**Title:** Deciphering the Anomalous: A Mechanistic Framework for Subdiffusive Transport in Cellular and Molecular Biology

**Abstract:**

The interior of a living cell is a densely crowded and dynamically structured milieu, far from the idealized environment assumed by classical Brownian motion. Consequently, the transport of particles—from small metabolites to large protein complexes and messenger RNA—frequently exhibits anomalous subdiffusion, characterized by a mean-squared displacement that grows sublinearly with time (〈r²(t)〉 ~ t^α with α < 1). This review synthesizes recent advances from 2023 in understanding the physical origins and biological implications of this heterogeneous anomalous transport. We first delineate the primary mechanistic drivers: macromolecular crowding, which introduces transient binding and caging effects; viscoelasticity of the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm, which confers a material memory on particle trajectories; and fractal-like organization of cellular scaffolds. We then critically evaluate state-of-the-art experimental techniques, including single-particle tracking with enhanced spatiotemporal resolution and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, which have been pivotal in quantifying the distribution of diffusion coefficients and the anomalous exponent α within single cells. Theoretically, we contrast continuous-time random walk and fractional Brownian motion models, highlighting their connection to specific underlying biological mechanisms. Finally, we explore the functional consequences of subdiffusion in key processes such as gene regulation, where it can extend the time for transcription factors to locate their targets, and in intracellular signaling, where it influences reaction kinetics and pattern formation. By integrating experimental data with biophysical models, this review provides a predictive framework for how anomalous transport fundamentally shapes cellular function.
