We present ForestClim, a novel open-access dataset delivering high-resolution (30 arc-seconds) bioclimatic variables quantifying microclimate temperatures across European forests. Derived from downscaled ERA5-Land data and forest structure, this resource captures critical thermal gradients influencing understory biodiversity and ecosystem processes. By providing standardized, continental-scale microclimate grids, ForestClim enables refined ecological modeling of species distributions and climate change impacts, addressing a key limitation in macroecological studies reliant on coarse-resolution free-air temperatures. This dataset advances mechanistic understanding of forest ecological responses to environmental change.
