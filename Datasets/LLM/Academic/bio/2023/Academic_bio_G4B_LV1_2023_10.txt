**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of data-dependent acquisition (DIA) proteomics demands efficient and robust analytical pipelines for comprehensive peptide identification.  Traditional workflows often struggle to maintain speed while retaining accuracy, particularly with large, complex datasets. This study presents MSFragger-DIA, a novel platform leveraging the established MSFragger algorithm to accelerate peptide identification within DIA data.  MSFragger-DIA integrates a refined fragment ion parsing strategy, implemented using the fragpipe software, to enhance the precision of peptide fragment assignment.  We demonstrate the platform’s efficacy through benchmarking against established DIA analysis methods, showcasing a significant reduction in processing time without compromising peptide identification sensitivity.  Preliminary results indicate improved reproducibility and reduced false discovery rates.  MSFragger-DIA offers a promising solution for researchers seeking to maximize throughput and analytical confidence in DIA proteomics studies, facilitating deeper biological insights from complex biological samples. Further validation and expansion of the algorithm are planned for 2024.
