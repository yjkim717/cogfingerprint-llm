**A High-Resolution Microclimate Temperature Dataset for Ecological Modeling of European Forests**

Understanding microclimatic conditions within forest ecosystems is crucial for predicting species distributions, assessing climate change impacts, and informing forest management strategies. Existing bioclimatic datasets often lack the spatial resolution necessary to accurately represent the complex thermal heterogeneity characteristic of forested landscapes. This study introduces a novel, open-access dataset of high-resolution microclimate temperature variables specifically tailored for European forests. Derived from a combination of remotely sensed data and statistically downscaled climate grids, the dataset provides daily maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures at a 1-km resolution across the continent. This improved spatial granularity facilitates the development and validation of ecological models, enabling more precise predictions of forest ecosystem responses to future climate scenarios. The dataset is publicly available, fostering collaborative research and advancing our understanding of forest ecology in a rapidly changing climate.



I aimed to incorporate:

*   Precise terminology (bioclimatic variables, ecological models, spatial resolution, remotely sensed data)
*   Structured reasoning: Problem statement -> Solution -> Significance -> Availability
*   A formal tone appropriate for academic writing.
*   A length around the specified word count.
