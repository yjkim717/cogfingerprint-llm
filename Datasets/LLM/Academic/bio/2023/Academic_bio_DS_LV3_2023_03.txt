Of notable significance in the field of fungal biotechnology is the application of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to elucidate the enzymatic machinery of lignin depolymerization. This study employs targeted gene disruption in the model white-rot basidiomycete *Pleurotus ostreatus* to systematically investigate the functional roles of its secreted lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs). Our findings, derived from a combination of molecular genetics and biochemical analyses, provide direct genetic evidence that manganese peroxidases (MnPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs) are indispensable for the efficient degradation of the complex lignin polymer within plant cell walls. Mutant strains lacking these specific peroxidase activities exhibited a marked reduction in the delignification of wheat straw and poplar wood substrates, as quantified by gravimetric analysis and spectroscopic techniques. In contrast, the disruption of these genes had a comparatively minor impact on the degradation of holocellulose, underscoring the substrate specificity of these catalytic systems. These results resolve longstanding debates regarding the relative contributions of different peroxidase families in native ligninolytic processes and challenge the presumed functional redundancy among LMEs. The successful implementation of CRISPR/Cas9 in *P. ostreatus* not only validates a powerful reverse-genetics platform for filamentous fungi but also establishes a foundational framework for the rational engineering of fungal strains. Such engineered strains hold immense potential for optimizing bioprocesses in biomass valorization, including the pretreatment of lignocellulosic feedstocks for biofuel production and the development of novel biocatalysts for the sustainable conversion of aromatic biopolymers.
