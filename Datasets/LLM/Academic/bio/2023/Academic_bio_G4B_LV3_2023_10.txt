**Abstract**

Recent advances in data-dependent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry have fueled a demand for efficient peptide identification workflows. This study presents MSFragger-DIA, a novel computational pipeline integrating the established MSFragger and FragPipe algorithms, optimized for rapid and accurate identification of peptides from DIA data.  The platform leverages MSFragger’s fragment ion grouping capabilities coupled with FragPipe’s robust peptide fragmentation prediction, resulting in enhanced sensitivity and reduced false discovery rates.  Evaluations across multiple proteomic datasets – including studies of cellular response to stress and tissue-specific biomarker analysis – demonstrate MSFragger-DIA’s superior performance compared to traditional approaches.  This integrated solution facilitates high-throughput quantitative proteomics, offering researchers a streamlined pathway for analyzing complex biological samples.  Further development focuses on expanding its applicability to novel sample types and incorporating advanced statistical analysis for enhanced data interpretation in 2023.
