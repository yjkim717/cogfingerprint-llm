**Abstract**

The biological processes underlying aging remain incompletely understood, necessitating the identification of robust biomarkers capable of reflecting age-related changes at a systemic level. This study employed advanced proteomic analysis to comprehensively investigate the human plasma proteome and its relationship to aging. Utilizing data from a cohort of individuals encompassing a wide age range, including a substantial representation of centenarians, we identified a set of 273 plasma proteins exhibiting statistically significant correlations with chronological age. These proteins, collectively termed “aging proteins,” demonstrate altered abundance and functional profiles with advancing age. Preliminary analyses suggest that these identified proteins represent a novel and potentially valuable subset of biomarkers for quantifying biological age and predicting age-related morbidity. Further investigation into the functional roles of these aging proteins – including their potential involvement in protein aggregation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory pathways – is warranted.  This research provides a foundational framework for future studies aimed at elucidating the complex mechanisms driving aging and developing targeted interventions to promote healthy longevity.
