**Title:** Enhancing Competency in Obstetrics and Gynecology through Direct Observation of Procedural Skills: A Formative Assessment Paradigm

**Abstract:**

The acquisition of procedural skills is a cornerstone of postgraduate training in obstetrics and gynecology. As the medical landscape continues to evolve, ensuring that trainees possess the requisite competencies to navigate complex clinical scenarios is paramount. This study (2023) investigates the efficacy of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) as a formative assessment tool in enhancing the procedural competencies of postgraduate students in obstetrics and gynecology. DOPS, a validated assessment framework, facilitates the direct observation and feedback of trainees' procedural skills, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and professional growth.

A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the effectiveness of DOPS in postgraduate training. Postgraduate students (n = 50) and faculty members (n = 20) participated in the study, with students undergoing DOPS assessments in various procedural skills relevant to obstetrics and gynecology. The assessments were followed by structured feedback sessions, enabling students to identify areas of strength and improvement.

The results indicate that DOPS was well-received by both students and faculty, with a significant majority (85%) of students reporting improved confidence in performing procedural skills. Faculty members also perceived DOPS as an effective tool for identifying and addressing skill gaps, with 90% indicating that it informed their teaching practices. Quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) in students' procedural competencies following DOPS assessments.

The findings of this study underscore the value of DOPS as a formative assessment paradigm in postgraduate obstetrics and gynecology training. By providing a structured framework for direct observation and feedback, DOPS facilitates the development of competent, skilled, and reflective practitioners. As the medical education landscape continues to evolve, the integration of DOPS into postgraduate training programs has the potential to enhance patient outcomes, improve trainee satisfaction, and promote a culture of excellence in obstetrics and gynecology. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of DOPS on clinical practice and patient outcomes.
