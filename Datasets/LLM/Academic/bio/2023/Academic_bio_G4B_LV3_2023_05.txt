**Abstract**

The rapid expansion of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) (HPAI) during the late 2022 to early 2023 period represents a significant zoonotic threat demanding heightened surveillance.  Observations of widespread HPAI A(H5N1) detection within gull populations across both European and North American migratory routes underscore the evolving role of scavenging birds as amplification vectors.  This geographic distribution, coupled with confirmed, albeit limited, human cases, necessitates a comprehensive re-evaluation of existing zoonotic potential assessments.  Preliminary data suggests increased environmental persistence of the virus within these avian hosts, potentially facilitating wider transmission.  Consequently, integrated epidemiological modeling, incorporating avian surveillance data and human case reporting, is crucial for refining risk stratification.  Further research should prioritize investigations into viral evolution, host susceptibility, and the effectiveness of targeted biosecurity measures to mitigate future spillover events and safeguard public health.
