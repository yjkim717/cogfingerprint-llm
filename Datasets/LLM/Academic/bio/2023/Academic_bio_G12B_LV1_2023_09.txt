**Abstract**

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disorder, challenging traditional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This study leverages advanced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to investigate molecular heterogeneity within the AD spectrum, moving beyond established diagnostic biomarkers. Utilizing a data-driven approach, we identified five distinct molecular subtypes of AD based on CSF protein signatures, each exhibiting unique proteomic landscapes and associated with differential genetic risk profiles derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Subsequent neuroimaging analysis revealed significant variations in regional brain atrophy patterns across these subtypes, highlighting divergent pathological trajectories. Critically, we observed correlations between molecular subtype membership, genetic predisposition, atrophy patterns, and longitudinal clinical outcomes, including cognitive decline rates and conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. These findings support a framework wherein AD manifests as a collection of biologically and genetically defined subtypes. The identification of these subtypes offers a refined understanding of AD pathophysiology and holds significant potential for personalized medicine. Future research will focus on validating these subtypes in independent cohorts, elucidating the underlying biological mechanisms driving subtype-specific differences, and exploring targeted therapeutic interventions tailored to each molecular profile.  Ultimately, this characterization of AD molecular subtypes could revolutionize clinical trial design and improve patient stratification for more effective therapeutic strategies.
