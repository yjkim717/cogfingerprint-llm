Title: Unveiling Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease: Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomics Reveals Distinct Molecular Subtypes

Abstract:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by heterogeneous clinical presentations and outcomes. Recent advancements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics have enabled the identification of molecular subtypes underlying this heterogeneity. Through a comprehensive analysis of CSF proteomes, we classified AD into five distinct molecular subtypes, each with unique genetic risk profiles and clinical trajectories. Our findings demonstrate that these subtypes are associated with differential expression of proteins involved in distinct pathophysiological pathways, including amyloid-Î² metabolism, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation. Furthermore, we show that these subtypes exhibit varying responses to therapeutic interventions, underscoring the potential for personalized medicine approaches tailored to individual molecular profiles. This study highlights the utility of CSF proteomics in stratifying AD patients into distinct subgroups, paving the way for targeted therapeutic strategies and improved patient outcomes in 2023 and beyond.
