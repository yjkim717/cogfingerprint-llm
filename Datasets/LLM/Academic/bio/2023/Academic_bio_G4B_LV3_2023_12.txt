**Abstract**

Single-cell genomics represents a pivotal advance in biological research, yet inherent stochasticity in RNA transcription presents substantial challenges for accurate data interpretation. This study introduces a novel mathematical framework leveraging stochastic systems biology to address these complexities. We propose an integrated methodology employing generating functions to model RNA quantification within the context of single-cell library construction. Crucially, this approach incorporates microfluidic technologies for enhanced sample preparation, minimizing technical bias.  Simulation-based analysis, driven by the generated functions, allows for the quantification of transcriptional noise and its impact on downstream genomic profiles.  The resulting model provides a robust tool for discerning cell-to-cell variability and generating functions that accurately reflect the underlying biological processes.  This framework, validated through simulations, offers a significant step towards a more nuanced understanding of single-cell heterogeneity in 2023 and beyond.
