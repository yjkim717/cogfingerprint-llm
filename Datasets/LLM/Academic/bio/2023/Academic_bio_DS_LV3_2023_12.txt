The integration of single-cell genomics with stochastic systems biology necessitates mathematical frameworks that explicitly account for both intrinsic biological noise and extrinsic technical variation. Here, we develop a unified analytical approach employing generating functions to model the complete distribution of RNA transcription counts. This methodology enables the deconvolution of biological stochasticity from measurement artifacts, providing a rigorous foundation for inferring kinetic parameters of gene expression. Our 2023 analysis demonstrates that this framework significantly improves the accuracy of parameter estimation from experimental data, thereby offering a more precise tool for probing the dynamic principles governing cellular state transitions and regulatory networks. This represents a critical advancement in quantitative, data-driven systems biology.
