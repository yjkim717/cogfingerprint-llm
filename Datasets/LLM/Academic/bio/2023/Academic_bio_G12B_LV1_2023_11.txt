**Plasma Proteomic Profiling Identifies Aging-Associated Biomarkers and Reveals Novel Biological Pathways**

**Abstract**

The biological mechanisms underpinning healthy aging remain incompletely understood, hindering the development of targeted interventions to promote longevity and mitigate age-related diseases. This study leverages high-throughput plasma proteomics, utilizing a Somascan® platform, to identify and characterize protein biomarkers associated with chronological age in a cohort of healthy individuals. We performed quantitative analysis of a broad plasma proteome, identifying 273 proteins exhibiting statistically significant correlations with age (p < 0.05). These aging proteins (Aps) represent a diverse range of functional categories, including those involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, immune response regulation, lipid metabolism, and protein homeostasis.  Furthermore, we investigated the potential clinical relevance of these Aps by examining their associations with established age-related conditions, revealing significant correlations with indicators of frailty and cardiovascular risk.  Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted dysregulation of key signaling cascades, notably the unfolded protein response and components of the complement system, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for modulating the aging process.  The identified Ap panel demonstrates robust discriminatory power for age stratification, offering a valuable resource for biomarker discovery and longitudinal studies of healthy aging.  These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the systemic proteomic landscape of aging and provide a foundation for the development of novel diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging and delaying the onset of age-related morbidity.
