This study presents a novel 30-meter resolution dataset of microclimatic temperature variables for European forests, derived from machine learning integration of satellite thermal data and topographic indices. We demonstrate that incorporating these high-resolution grids significantly enhances the predictive accuracy of species distribution models for understory vegetation compared to conventional macroclimate datasets. Our findings underscore the critical importance of microclimate heterogeneity in forecasting biodiversity responses to climate change, providing an essential tool for targeted conservation planning in European forest ecosystems.
