**Heterogeneous Anomalous Transport: A Growing Paradigm in Biological Systems**

**Abstract**

The conventional paradigm of Brownian diffusion, predicated on Fick’s laws, increasingly fails to accurately describe the dynamics of biomolecules and cellular components within complex biological environments. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) – deviations from standard diffusion characterized by non-Gaussian displacement probability distributions and scale-dependent mean squared displacement – within cellular and molecular contexts. We propose that HAT, arising from the interplay of crowding, confinement, active forces, and complex network architectures, is not a mere experimental artifact but a fundamental feature governing biological function.  The review begins by outlining experimental techniques prevalent in the field, including fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), single-particle tracking (SPT), and microrheological approaches, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations in discerning HAT signatures.  Subsequently, we examine theoretical frameworks developed to model HAT, categorizing them into passive models (e.g., continuous time random walk, fractional Brownian motion) and active models incorporating motor proteins and directed fluxes. A critical assessment of these models in capturing different HAT regimes – subdiffusion, superdiffusion, and intermittent transport – is provided.  Finally, we showcase diverse biological examples, including protein trafficking in the cytoplasm, mRNA localization within cells, and the dynamics of signaling molecules within membranous compartments. We argue that HAT plays a crucial role in enhancing reaction efficiency, facilitating long-range communication, and enabling robust cellular responses to environmental stimuli.  Future research directions should focus on integrating multi-scale modeling approaches, developing novel experimental probes sensitive to spatio-temporal fluctuations, and elucidating the evolutionary pressures that have selected for HAT mechanisms in biological systems.  Understanding HAT promises to fundamentally reshape our understanding of cellular organization and function, offering new avenues for therapeutic intervention and biotechnological innovation.
