**Abstract**

The biological hallmarks of aging are increasingly recognized as quantifiable through proteomic analysis. This study leveraged a comprehensive proteomic investigation of plasma samples to identify a cohort of 273 proteins exhibiting significant correlations with aging phenotypes. Utilizing a novel somascan approach, we established a robust association between these plasma-derived biomarkers and systemic age-related alterations, including declines in physiological function and increased vulnerability to age-associated diseases.  These findings suggest a potential for utilizing this panel of biomarkers to predict individual aging trajectories and assess risk stratification.  Further validation across diverse populations is warranted, yet this research provides a foundational framework for developing non-invasive diagnostic tools.  The identified proteins represent promising targets for future therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating the aging process and mitigating associated pathologies, marking a crucial step toward personalized geriatric medicine in 2023.
