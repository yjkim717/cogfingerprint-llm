**Abstract**

The prognostication and therapeutic stratification of colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of oncologic mortality worldwide, remain critically dependent on the identification of robust biomarkers that accurately reflect tumor biology. While traditional clinicopathological staging systems, such as the TNM classification, provide a foundational prognostic framework, they often fail to capture the profound heterogeneity in clinical outcomes observed among patients within the same stage. This limitation has catalyzed an intensive search for molecular and cellular markers that can elucidate the underlying drivers of disease progression. Central to the malignant phenotype is the dysregulation of cell proliferation, a hallmark of cancer that directly influences tumor aggressiveness, metastatic potential, and therapeutic resistance. This 2023 systematic review synthesizes the current evidentiary landscape concerning proliferative biomarkers in CRC, with a specific focus on their utility in refining prognostic models and informing personalized treatment paradigms.

Our analysis begins by re-evaluating the role of established immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based markers, with particular emphasis on the Ki-67 antigen. Ki-67, a nuclear protein expressed in all active phases of the cell cycle, has long served as a cornerstone for quantifying the proliferative index in CRC tissue specimens. We critically appraise the voluminous literature on Ki-67, examining its correlation with advanced tumor stage, lymph node involvement, and poorer overall survival. However, we also address the significant methodological challenges and inter-laboratory variability in scoring protocols that have hampered its universal adoption as a standalone clinical standard. Beyond Ki-67, we explore other IHC-detectable proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) and phospho-histone H3, discussing their comparative advantages and limitations in the context of modern pathology workflows.

The review subsequently transitions to a comprehensive examination of proliferative biomarkers revealed through advanced molecular biology techniques. We detail the prognostic significance of specific genetic alterations that constitutively activate proliferative signaling pathways. This includes mutations in the KRAS and BRAF oncogenes, which drive the MAPK pathway, and dysregulations in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, a pivotal initiator of CRC tumorigenesis. The analysis extends to the epigenetic landscape, where we investigate how DNA methylation patterns—particularly the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP)—and alterations in histone modification states can silence tumor suppressor genes and unleash unchecked cellular replication.

Furthermore, we synthesize emerging evidence on the critical role of non-coding RNAs in post-transcriptionally regulating proliferation networks. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) such as the oncogenic miR-21 and the tumor-suppressive miR-143/145 cluster are evaluated for their serum and tissue expression levels as non-invasive prognostic indicators. The review also incorporates the rapidly evolving field of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and their intricate interactions with cell cycle machinery. By integrating data from immunohistochemistry, genomic sequencing, epigenomic profiling, and transcriptomic analyses, this review constructs a multidimensional atlas of proliferation in CRC. We conclude that the future of CRC prognostication lies not in the isolation of a single biomarker, but in the development of integrated prognostic panels that combine histological proliferation indices with molecular signatures. Such a multi-omics approach promises to unlock more precise risk stratification, ultimately guiding adjuvant therapy decisions and improving long-term survival for patients with this heterogeneous disease.
