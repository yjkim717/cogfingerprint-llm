**Abstract**

European forests are increasingly vulnerable to climate change, necessitating detailed understanding of local microclimatic conditions. This study presents a novel, publicly accessible dataset of bioclimatic variables characterizing microclimate temperatures across European forest landscapes. Utilizing high-resolution temperature grids derived from [mention data source if known, e.g., remote sensing data and climate models], we have quantified key bioclimatic variables – including mean daily temperature, diurnal temperature range, and seasonal temperature trends – at a fine spatial scale. These variables are intended to enhance the predictive capabilities of ecological models simulating forest responses to environmental change.  The open-access nature of this resource facilitates broader research into forest resilience, species distribution modeling, and the development of targeted conservation strategies.  Future work will explore the integration of these bioclimatic datasets with other environmental factors to improve microclimate assessments within European forest ecosystems in 2023 and beyond.
