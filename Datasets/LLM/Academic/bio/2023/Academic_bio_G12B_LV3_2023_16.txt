**Abstract:** Lignin, a complex plant cell wall polymer, presents a significant recalcitrance to degradation. This study, conducted in 2023, investigates the enzymatic mechanisms employed by *Pleurotus ostreatus* in natural lignin breakdown. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to generate targeted mutants, we provide compelling experimental evidence for the indispensable roles of manganese peroxidases and versatile peroxidases. These lignin-modifying enzymes are crucial for effective fungal degradation of lignin within a plant cell wall context, highlighting key targets for bio-refining strategies.
