**Abstract**

The year 2023 has witnessed a paradigm shift in our understanding of intracellular dynamics, moving beyond classical diffusion models to embrace the ubiquity of anomalous and heterogeneous transport. This review synthesizes recent advances demonstrating that the motion of molecules, vesicles, and organelles within the crowded cellular milieu is frequently characterized by non-Gaussian statistics and power-law decays in mean-squared displacement. We argue that this anomalous behavior is not a mere curiosity but a fundamental feature arising from structural complexity, binding interactions, and viscoelastic cytoplasmic properties. Cutting-edge single-particle tracking and super-resolution microscopy techniques have been pivotal in quantifying this heterogeneity, revealing distinct transport modalities within single cells. Concurrently, sophisticated theoretical frameworks, including continuous-time random walks and fractional calculus, are being refined to describe these phenomena. Most significantly, we highlight the emergent role of machine learning in deciphering complex trajectories, classifying transport modes, and predicting molecular interactions directly from experimental data. The integration of advanced experimentation, physical theory, and computational analytics is thus forging a new, quantitative, and predictive understanding of transport physics across diverse biological systems, from gene regulation to organelle communication.
