**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating refined prognostic strategies to optimize patient management. This review synthesizes current understanding of prognostic biomarkers associated with CRC proliferation, integrating both established and novel approaches. Traditional immunohistochemical techniques, utilizing markers such as Ki-67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), continue to provide valuable insights into tumor aggressiveness. However, emerging molecular biology techniques, including gene expression profiling and circulating tumor DNA analysis, are increasingly employed to identify more sensitive and specific predictors of patient outcomes.  We evaluate the strengths and limitations of each methodology, highlighting the potential for multi-omic approaches to provide a comprehensive assessment of proliferative activity.  Furthermore, the integration of these biomarkers with clinical data holds promise for stratifying patients based on predicted response to therapy and ultimately, enhancing survival rates.  Future research should focus on validating these biomarkers across diverse patient populations and exploring their utility in personalized treatment decisions within the evolving landscape of CRC diagnostics and therapeutics (2023).
