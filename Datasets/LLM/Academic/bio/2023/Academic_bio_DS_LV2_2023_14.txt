**Abstract**

The intricate and often non-uniform nature of intracellular environments gives rise to anomalous transport phenomena, a critical yet incompletely understood aspect of cellular and molecular biology. Conventional diffusion models frequently fail to capture the complex, heterogeneous motion of biomolecules, which is constrained by macromolecular crowding, cytoskeletal networks, and compartmentalization. This review synthesizes recent advances (circa 2023) in characterizing and modeling these heterogeneous anomalous transport processes. We first survey cutting-edge experimental methodologies, including single-particle tracking with advanced statistical analysis, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and super-resolution imaging, which have been pivotal in quantifying subdiffusive and sometimes superdiffusive behaviors in vivo. Subsequently, we evaluate a suite of theoretical frameworks that move beyond classical Fickian diffusion, emphasizing continuous-time random walks, fractional Brownian motion, and obstructed diffusion models that incorporate spatial disorder and temporal memory effects. Finally, we discuss the profound biological implications of these transport regimes, illustrating their necessity in understanding fundamental processes such as gene regulation, intracellular signaling cascades, organelle dynamics, and the search processes of DNA-binding proteins. By bridging high-resolution experimental data with sophisticated physical models, this review aims to establish a more predictive, quantitative foundation for analyzing transport heterogeneity, thereby enhancing our comprehension of cellular function in both health and disease.
