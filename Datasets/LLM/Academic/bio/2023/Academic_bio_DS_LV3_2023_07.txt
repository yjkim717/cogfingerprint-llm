This study introduces ForestClim, a novel high-resolution dataset of bioclimatic variables tailored to European forest understories. By refining spatial resolution to capture microclimatic heterogeneity, it addresses critical gaps in existing macroclimatic layers. We demonstrate its utility by integrating these variables into species distribution models, revealing significantly improved predictive accuracy for understorey plant communities. This resource is pivotal for advancing ecological forecasting under climate change, providing an essential tool for researchers and conservation planners aiming to understand fine-scale forest dynamics.
