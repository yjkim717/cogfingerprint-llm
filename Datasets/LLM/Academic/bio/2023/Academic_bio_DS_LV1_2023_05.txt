**Abstract**

The 2022-2023 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b has been characterized by unprecedented global dissemination and a notable shift in host tropism, increasingly involving wild bird species previously considered less susceptible. This study investigates the epidemiological dynamics of this virus during its peak activity in Europe from December 2022 to March 2023, with a specific focus on its incursion into larid populations and the consequent zoonotic implications. Through a combination of passive surveillance data, active targeted sampling, and genomic sequencing, we documented a significant surge in HPAI H5N1 detections within black-headed gull (*Chroicocephalus ridibundus*) colonies. This was correlated with a series of mass mortality events along major European migratory flyways, suggesting a pivotal role of gulls as novel, highly efficient reservoirs and disseminators of the virus. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the circulation of a monophyletic viral lineage within these populations, exhibiting specific mammalian-adapting mutations in the PB2 and NP genes, which have been previously associated with enhanced replication in human cells. Concurrently, sporadic human infections with the avian-origin virus were reported in individuals with direct occupational or environmental exposure. Despite these spillover events, a comprehensive risk assessment, integrating virological, epidemiological, and ecological data, indicates that the virus has not acquired the capacity for sustained human-to-human transmission. Consequently, the population-level zoonotic risk remains classified as low. Our findings underscore a critical ecological shift towards increased gull involvement, which intensifies viral circulation and amplifies interface events, thereby necessitating enhanced, integrated One Health surveillance strategies at the wildlife-human-domestic animal nexus to monitor the evolving threat of this panzootic pathogen.
