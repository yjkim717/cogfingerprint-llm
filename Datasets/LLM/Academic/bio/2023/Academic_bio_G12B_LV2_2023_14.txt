**Heterogeneous Anomalous Transport in Cellular and Molecular Systems: A Review of Mechanisms, Measurement, and Biological Relevance**

**Abstract**

The canonical diffusion paradigm, predicated on Fick's laws, frequently fails to accurately describe the dynamics of molecular transport within complex biological environments. This review examines the burgeoning field of heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) within cellular and molecular biology, highlighting deviations from Brownian motion observed across diverse biological scales. We synthesize recent advances in experimental methodologies employed to probe HAT, including single-molecule tracking, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and microrheology, emphasizing their utility in discerning transport mechanisms.  The theoretical framework underpinning HAT is explored, encompassing concepts such as fractal dynamics, continuous-time random walks, and the influence of confining geometries and spatiotemporal heterogeneities.  Specifically, we discuss how active transport mechanisms, crowding effects, and the presence of dynamic cellular structures (e.g., cytoskeletal networks, membranous organelles) contribute to non-Gaussian and non-diffusive behaviors.  We present a comprehensive overview of biological examples exhibiting HAT, including protein trafficking within cells, mRNA localization, and the transport of signaling molecules. Furthermore, we consider the implications of HAT for cellular function, including metabolic regulation, signal transduction efficiency, and the pathogenesis of disease. Finally, we identify key challenges and future directions, including the development of more sophisticated theoretical models capable of incorporating multi-scale interactions and the refinement of experimental techniques to disentangle the contributions of various transport modes. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for a deeper understanding of the intricate transport processes governing cellular life.
