**Abstract**

The comprehensive characterization of cancer genomes through multi-omic profiling—encompassing genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data—has become a cornerstone of modern oncology research. However, a significant bottleneck persists in the integrative visualization and exploration of these complex, high-dimensional datasets, which are often dispersed across disparate repositories and lack unified clinical context. To address this critical challenge, we present an evaluation and application of the UCSC Xena platform, a robust, web-based visual exploration tool designed for multi-omic cancer genomics data. Xena facilitates the seamless integration of diverse data types, including but not limited to gene expression, somatic mutations, copy number variations, and DNA methylation, concurrently with rich clinical annotation from flagship projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Its architecture enables researchers to perform dynamic, cohort-based analyses, visualize data distributions across sample groups, and correlate molecular features with clinical outcomes without requiring advanced computational expertise or local data download. This accessibility democratizes complex bioinformatic interrogation, accelerating hypothesis generation and validation. In this work, we demonstrate Xena's utility through a case study investigating the co-occurrence of *TP53* mutations and *MDM2* amplifications in a pan-cancer cohort, illustrating how its interactive heatmaps, survival plots, and genomic viewers can rapidly uncover biologically and clinically relevant patterns. We conclude that UCSC Xena represents an indispensable resource for the cancer research community, effectively bridging the gap between large-scale, public multi-omic data and actionable biological insight by providing an intuitive, yet powerful, visual analytics environment. Its continued development is paramount for translating complex genomic data into a deeper understanding of tumor biology and therapeutic vulnerabilities.
