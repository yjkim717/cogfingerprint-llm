**Abstract**

Stochasticity increasingly recognized as a fundamental driver of cellular heterogeneity and phenotypic variation presents a significant challenge for traditional systems biology approaches. This study investigates the integration of single-cell genomic data with dynamic mathematical modeling to elucidate stochastic cell behavior. Utilizing microfluidic platforms for high-throughput single-cell RNA quantification, we generate comprehensive datasets capturing transcriptional variation across diverse cell populations. Employing generating functions – a novel approach to represent stochastic processes – we construct mechanistic models capable of accurately simulating observed cell-to-cell variability.  These models, informed by single-cell transcriptomes, allow for the disentanglement of biological stochasticity from technical noise.  Results demonstrate enhanced predictive power and a deeper mechanistic understanding compared to purely empirical analyses.  This framework facilitates targeted intervention strategies and provides a robust methodology for investigating complex biological systems governed by stochastic dynamics.
