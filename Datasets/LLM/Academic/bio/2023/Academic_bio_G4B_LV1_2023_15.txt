**Abstract: Integrating Multi-Layered Biomarkers for Enhanced Prognosis in Colorectal Cancer**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating the development of robust prognostic biomarkers to personalize treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes. This review synthesizes current research exploring the utility of diverse molecular markers – encompassing genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and non-coding RNA expression – in predicting CRC progression and overall survival. Traditional approaches, including histological examination and established genetic markers like *KRAS* and *TP53*, are increasingly complemented by advanced methodologies such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) and transcriptomic profiling. 

Recent advancements in molecular biology have facilitated the identification of novel biomarkers, including circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fragments and specific microRNA signatures, offering potential for early detection and risk stratification. Furthermore, IHC analysis targeting proteins involved in tumor microenvironment interactions, such as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), is proving valuable in refining prognostic assessments.  The integration of these multi-layered approaches—combining genomic, epigenetic, and proteomic data—represents a paradigm shift in CRC risk prediction.  

Future research should prioritize standardization of biomarker assays and validation across diverse patient cohorts to establish clinically actionable prognostic models. Ultimately, a comprehensive understanding of these molecular signatures will facilitate tailored therapeutic interventions and contribute to improved survival rates for individuals diagnosed with CRC.
