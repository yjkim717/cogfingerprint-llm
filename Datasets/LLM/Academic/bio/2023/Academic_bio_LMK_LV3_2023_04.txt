**Evaluating the Efficacy of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills in Postgraduate Obstetrics and Gynecology Training: A Formative Assessment Paradigm**

**Abstract**

In the realm of medical education, the assessment of procedural skills is a critical component of postgraduate training, particularly in high-stakes specialties such as obstetrics and gynecology. The Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) has emerged as a formative assessment tool, designed to provide constructive feedback and enhance the acquisition of clinical competencies. This study investigates the effectiveness of DOPS in evaluating the procedural skills of postgraduate trainees in obstetrics and gynecology, with a focus on its formative assessment potential.

Conducted in 2023, this mixed-methods study recruited 50 postgraduate trainees from obstetrics and gynecology programs across three tertiary care institutions. The DOPS assessment framework was implemented over a period of six months, during which trainees underwent a series of observed procedural skill assessments. Feedback was provided using a standardized template, encompassing technical skills, communication, and patient safety. Quantitative data on trainee performance were analyzed using descriptive statistics and regression analysis, while qualitative feedback from trainees and assessors was thematically analyzed.

The results demonstrate a significant improvement in the procedural skills of trainees over the study period, as measured by DOPS scores (p < 0.001). Thematic analysis revealed that trainees valued the DOPS feedback, citing its specificity and timeliness as key factors in their learning. Assessors reported that DOPS facilitated a more nuanced understanding of trainee competencies, enabling targeted feedback and remediation.

This study provides robust evidence supporting the efficacy of DOPS as a formative assessment tool in postgraduate obstetrics and gynecology training. By integrating DOPS into training programs, educators can create a culture of continuous feedback and improvement, ultimately enhancing patient safety and clinical outcomes. The findings of this study have implications for medical education policy and practice, highlighting the need for ongoing investment in faculty development and assessment infrastructure to support the effective implementation of DOPS.

In conclusion, this study underscores the value of DOPS in promoting competency-based education and improving the quality of care in obstetrics and gynecology. As the medical education landscape continues to evolve, the integration of innovative assessment tools like DOPS will be crucial in shaping the next generation of clinicians.
