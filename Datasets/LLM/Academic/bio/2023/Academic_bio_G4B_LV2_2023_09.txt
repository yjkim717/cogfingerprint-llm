**Abstract**

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibits considerable heterogeneity, challenging the efficacy of standardized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Recent advances in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics offer a promising avenue for elucidating this complexity. This study presents a large-scale proteomic analysis of CSF samples, revealing five distinct molecular subtypes of AD characterized by divergent biomarker profiles. Utilizing sophisticated mass spectrometry techniques, we identified significant differences in the abundance of numerous proteins within these subtypes, correlating with distinct genetic risk profiles assessed through genome-wide association studies. 

Notably, subtype-specific associations were observed between CSF protein signatures and clinical progression, including cognitive decline and amyloid deposition. These findings suggest that AD is not a monolithic disease but rather a collection of clinically and genetically separable entities.  Further research integrating these molecular subtypes with longitudinal clinical data is warranted to refine diagnostic stratification and personalize treatment strategies.  The identification of these subtypes underscores the potential of CSF proteomics as a crucial tool in advancing our understanding and management of AD.
