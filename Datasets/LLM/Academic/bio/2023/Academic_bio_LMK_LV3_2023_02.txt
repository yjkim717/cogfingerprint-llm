Title: Prognostic Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer: Integrating Immunohistochemistry and Molecular Biology for Enhanced Predictive Accuracy


#### Abstract

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, underscoring the imperative for precise prognostic biomarkers to guide clinical management. The heterogeneity of CRC necessitates a multifaceted approach to identifying and validating biomarkers that accurately predict disease progression and treatment response. This review synthesizes current evidence on prognostic biomarkers of cell proliferation in CRC, focusing on the integration of traditional immunohistochemistry (IHC) with cutting-edge molecular biology techniques. We examine the role of established IHC markers, such as Ki-67, and emerging molecular signatures, including those related to the cell cycle and DNA repair mechanisms, in predicting CRC outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of novel molecular biology approaches, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and gene expression profiling, to enhance the predictive accuracy of prognostic biomarkers. The convergence of IHC and molecular biology techniques offers a promising avenue for the development of robust, multi-dimensional prognostic models. These models have the potential to stratify CRC patients according to risk, inform personalized treatment strategies, and improve overall survival rates. Recent studies have highlighted the utility of combining IHC-derived proliferation indices with molecularly defined signatures to predict disease recurrence and metastasis. For instance, the integration of Ki-67 expression levels with mutational analysis of key oncogenes, such as KRAS and BRAF, has been shown to enhance prognostic accuracy in CRC. Moreover, the application of NGS to identify genetic alterations associated with cell proliferation and treatment resistance is poised to further refine prognostication in CRC. By synthesizing the current state of knowledge on prognostic biomarkers in CRC, this review aims to provide a comprehensive framework for future research directions. The integration of IHC and molecular biology techniques is anticipated to yield more precise and actionable prognostic information, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes in CRC. As the field continues to evolve, the development of standardized, high-throughput assays for prognostic biomarker assessment will be crucial for translating these advances into clinical practice.
