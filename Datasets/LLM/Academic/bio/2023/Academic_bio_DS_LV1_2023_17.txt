**Abstract**

The paradigm of postgraduate biomedical education is progressively shifting from summative, high-stakes examinations towards integrated, workplace-based formative assessments that facilitate continuous professional development. Within the specialized domain of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN), where clinical competence is inextricably linked to procedural proficiency, the implementation of robust and reliable assessment tools is paramount. This study investigates the efficacy and practical implementation of the Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) as a formative assessment instrument within a contemporary OB/GYN residency program. A mixed-methods longitudinal cohort study was conducted over an 18-month period (2022-2023), involving 67 postgraduate trainees across four academic years. Participants underwent structured DOPS assessments for a range of core procedures, from foundational skills (e.g., speculum examination, cervical cerclage) to advanced laparoscopic techniques. Each DOPS encounter comprised a pre-observation briefing, real-time observation using a validated checklist assessing domains of knowledge, preparation, technical skill, aseptic technique, and communication, followed by immediate, structured feedback.

Quantitative analysis of performance metrics demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in procedural competency scores among trainees who underwent multiple DOPS cycles compared to a control cohort assessed solely by traditional end-of-rotation evaluations (p < 0.01). Trainee self-assessments, collected via Likert-scale surveys, indicated a marked increase in confidence and perceived technical ability. Qualitatively, thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with both trainees and faculty assessors revealed that the formative, feedback-centric nature of DOPS was highly valued for its role in identifying specific skill deficits and fostering deliberate practice. The provision of contemporaneous feedback was identified as the most beneficial component, enabling real-time correction and reinforcing positive behaviors.

However, the study also identified significant systemic challenges. The primary impediment to consistent implementation was the substantial time commitment required for both observation and feedback delivery within high-volume clinical environments, frequently cited by faculty as a barrier to fidelity. This resource-intensity occasionally led to assessment fatigue and compromised the ideal assessment schedule. In conclusion, while DOPS functions as a potent and effective formative tool for enhancing procedural competency in OB/GYN postgraduate training, its optimal integration is contingent upon addressing inherent logistical constraints. Future implementation strategies must prioritize faculty development, streamlined assessment protocols, and protected educational time to fully realize the potential of this workplace-based assessment modality in cultivating a generation of proficient and reflective clinical practitioners.
