Title: Emergence and Dispersal of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) Virus in Wild Birds and Its Zoonotic Implications

Abstract:

The ongoing global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus has raised significant concerns regarding its potential to infect humans and other mammals. As of 2023, the virus has been detected in various wild bird species across Europe and the Americas, resulting in substantial mortality among avian populations and sporadic cases of infection in mammals, including humans. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the circulating A(H5N1) viruses are closely related to those isolated during previous outbreaks, indicating a possible persistence of the virus in wild bird reservoirs.

The transmission dynamics of HPAI A(H5N1) virus involve complex interactions between wild birds, domestic poultry, and other animals, facilitating the emergence of novel viral variants with potentially increased zoonotic potential. The virus's ability to infect a range of mammalian species, including humans, underscores the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of avian influenza viruses in both wild and domestic bird populations.

This study highlights the critical role of wild birds in the dispersal and maintenance of HPAI A(H5N1) virus, with significant implications for animal and human health. Enhanced virological and serological surveillance, coupled with improved biosecurity measures, are essential to mitigate the risks associated with the spread of this highly pathogenic virus. Furthermore, ongoing research into the molecular determinants of A(H5N1) virus transmission and pathogenesis will inform the development of effective countermeasures to prevent and control future outbreaks.
