Title: Advancements in Understanding Heterogeneous Anomalous Transport in Cellular and Molecular Biology

Abstract:

The study of heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) has emerged as a pivotal area of research in cellular and molecular biology, underscoring the complexities of biological systems. Recent advancements in experimental techniques, such as single-particle tracking and microrheology, have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamics of HAT. Concurrently, the integration of theoretical tools and machine learning methods has enabled researchers to decipher the underlying mechanisms governing this phenomenon. As of 2023, our understanding of HAT has been significantly enhanced, revealing its critical role in various biological processes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on
