**Abstract**

The 2022-2023 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b has been characterized by unprecedented persistence and geographic spread within wild bird populations, marking a significant departure from previous seasonal patterns. This study investigates a critical facet of this ongoing panzootic: the pronounced susceptibility of seabirds and the associated viral evolution with potential zoonotic implications. We report on a series of mass mortality events observed in colonies of Black-headed Gulls (*Chroicocephalus ridibundus*) across Northern and Western Europe between December 2022 and March 2023. Post-mortem examinations and molecular diagnostics confirmed HPAI A(H5N1) as the primary etiological agent. Genomic surveillance of viral isolates from these events revealed the acquisition of specific mammalian-adaptive mutations in the polymerase complex (notably PB2-E627K) and the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein, which are known to enhance viral replication efficiency in mammalian cells and alter receptor-binding affinity. The convergence of these mutations within a viral lineage demonstrating efficient transmission within a highly gregarious wild bird species raises substantial concern. Our findings indicate that Black-headed Gulls are not merely dead-end hosts but have served as a significant reservoir and vehicle for the dissemination of a H5N1 variant with augmented virulence and heightened zoonotic potential. This shift in host range, coupled with the observed viral evolution, underscores an urgent need for enhanced, systematic surveillance at the wild bird-human-livestock interface to mitigate the risk of a future influenza pandemic of avian origin.
