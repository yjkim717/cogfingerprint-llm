**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating improved prognostic stratification and personalized treatment strategies. This review synthesizes recent advances in the identification and validation of biomarkers for predicting patient outcomes within CRC. We explore the application of both traditional immunohistochemical techniques and burgeoning molecular biology approaches – encompassing genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and circulating non-coding RNAs – to delineate prognostic signatures. Specifically, the role of proliferation markers, such as Ki-67 and PCNA, alongside emerging targets identified through transcriptomic profiling, are critically assessed. Furthermore, the integration of liquid biopsies utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and microRNAs holds considerable promise for early detection and monitoring treatment response.  Ultimately, this work highlights the evolving landscape of biomarker discovery in CRC, emphasizing the potential for integrating these multifaceted analyses to refine risk assessment, guide therapeutic decisions, and inform future clinical trials.
