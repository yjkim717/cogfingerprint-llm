**Abstract**

Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful paradigm for comprehensive proteome profiling, yet the computational challenge of achieving deep, sensitive peptide identification from complex fragment ion spectra remains. Here, we present and evaluate MSFragger-DIA, a novel search engine integrated within the FragPipe computational platform, specifically engineered to address this bottleneck. By leveraging an open search strategy and an efficient fragment ion indexing algorithm, MSFragger-DIA enables the rapid and unbiased interrogation of DIA datasets without the prerequisite for an extensive project-specific spectral library. Our analysis demonstrates that this approach significantly accelerates the proteomic workflow while maintaining high sensitivity in peptide-spectrum matching. The direct integration with FragPipe further streamlines the entire analytical pipeline, from raw data processing to statistical validation, facilitating robust protein identification and quantification. Consequently, MSFragger-DIA represents a substantial advancement in the dia proteomics toolkit, offering a versatile and efficient solution that enhances the depth and throughput of large-scale proteomic investigations, thereby accelerating discoveries in systems biology and biomarker research.
