**Abstract**

Advancements in single-cell technologies have generated unprecedented datasets of molecular profiles, yet integrating diverse omics layers remains a significant challenge. This study presents scSpaMet, a novel computational framework designed to simultaneously interrogate metabolomic and proteomic signatures at the single-cell level. Leveraging trajectory inference algorithms, scSpaMet identifies cellular states exhibiting distinct metabolic phenotypes within complex human tissues. The system integrates high-resolution spatial metabolomics data with corresponding cell-type specific protein expression, allowing for the delineation of cell-type-specific metabolic pathways.  By correlating metabolic flux with protein abundance, we aim to provide a more comprehensive systems biology understanding of tissue heterogeneity.  Preliminary analyses demonstrate scSpaMet’s efficacy in resolving previously obscured cell populations and identifying key metabolic regulators. This integrated approach represents a crucial step towards elucidating the functional roles of individual cells within dynamic biological systems, published in 2023.
