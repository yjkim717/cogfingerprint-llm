**Title:** Assessing the Zoonotic Potential of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) in Wild Birds: Implications for Public Health Risk

**Abstract:**

The ongoing global dissemination of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus has raised concerns regarding its zoonotic potential and the consequent public health risk. Between December 2022 and March 2023, the virus continued to spread across various regions, affecting both domestic poultry and wild bird populations, with sporadic cases of mammalian and human infections reported. This study aims to evaluate the current epidemiological landscape of HPAI A(H5N1) in wild birds and its implications for public health.

Using a comprehensive review of existing literature and recent surveillance data, we analyzed the global distribution, transmission dynamics, and genetic evolution of HPAI A(H5N1) in wild bird populations. Our findings indicate that the virus has become increasingly prevalent in diverse avian species, with a notable expansion into new geographic regions. The detection of HPAI A(H5N1) in wild birds, particularly in areas with high human-wildlife interfaces, underscores the potential for zoonotic transmission.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed ongoing genetic diversification of the virus, with emerging clades exhibiting enhanced virulence and transmissibility. These findings suggest that HPAI A(H5N1) is adapting to its avian hosts, potentially increasing its zoonotic potential. Moreover, the virus's ability to infect mammals and humans, albeit sporadically, highlights the need for continued vigilance and enhanced surveillance.

Our study underscores the critical importance of monitoring HPAI A(H5N1) in wild bird populations to mitigate the risk of zoonotic transmission and protect public health. We recommend strengthening global surveillance networks, improving diagnostic capabilities, and developing targeted interventions to reduce the virus's transmission at the human-animal interface. By elucidating the complex dynamics of HPAI A(H5N1) in wild birds, this research informs evidence-based strategies for mitigating the public health risk associated with this emerging zoonosis.
