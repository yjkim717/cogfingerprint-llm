**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) persists as a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with its clinical heterogeneity necessitating robust prognostic and predictive tools to guide therapeutic stratification. While traditional clinicopathological staging systems, such as the TNM classification, provide a foundational prognostic framework, they frequently fail to capture the intrinsic biological diversity of the disease, leading to suboptimal patient management. Consequently, the identification and validation of molecular biomarkers that reflect the fundamental hallmarks of cancer have become a paramount objective in oncological research. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis and critical appraisal of proliferative biomarkers in CRC, tracing their evolution from established immunohistochemical (IHC) assays to contemporary molecular profiling techniques, and evaluating their integration into prognostic and predictive models.

The discourse begins with an analysis of conventional IHC-based markers of cell proliferation, principally focusing on Ki-67. The utility of Ki-67 labeling index as a measure of tumor growth fraction is examined, alongside a discussion of its methodological challenges, including inter-laboratory variability in staining protocols and scoring systems, which have historically hampered its universal adoption as a standalone prognosticator. We further explore the role of other IHC markers, such as PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen), and assess their comparative advantages and limitations within the context of routine pathological practice.

The review then transitions to the molecular characterization of proliferative pathways, underscoring how genomic and transcriptomic technologies have refined our understanding of CRC biology. We detail the prognostic significance of mutations in key genes governing the cell cycle, such as *TP53* and its role in G1/S checkpoint control, and *KRAS*, which, beyond its predictive value for anti-EGFR therapy, influences proliferative signaling through the MAPK pathway. The emergence of high-throughput methodologies, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) and RNA-sequencing, is highlighted for their capacity to define proliferative signatures. These multi-gene expression profiles, which quantify the aggregate activity of genes involved in cell cycle progression, mitosis, and DNA replication, are increasingly demonstrating superior prognostic power compared to single-marker assays. Their ability to stratify patients into distinct risk categories, particularly within stage II and III disease where adjuvant chemotherapy decisions remain contentious, is a key focus.

Finally, we synthesize the current evidence on the predictive utility of these biomarkers, exploring their potential to forecast responses to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapies (e.g., 5-fluorouracil) which target rapidly dividing cells, as well as novel targeted agents. The abstract concludes by positing that the future of prognostication in CRC lies not in the supremacy of a single modality but in the integrative analysis of IHC and molecular data. The construction of multi-parametric models, potentially augmented by artificial intelligence for image analysis and data interpretation, represents the next frontier for developing clinically actionable tools that can personalize treatment and improve survival outcomes for patients with colorectal cancer.
