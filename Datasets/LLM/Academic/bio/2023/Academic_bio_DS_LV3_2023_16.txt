**Title:** CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Gene Targeting Elucidates the Indispensable Role of Lignin-Modifying Enzymes in *Pleurotus ostreatus* for Native Lignin Depolymerization

**Abstract:**

The enzymatic machinery responsible for the efficient breakdown of lignin, a recalcitrant aromatic polymer in plant biomass, remains incompletely characterized, particularly regarding the specific contributions of individual enzymes *in vivo*. White-rot fungi, such as *Pleurotus ostreatus*, are potent degraders of lignocellulose, producing an array of lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs), including manganese peroxidases (MnPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs). However, direct genetic evidence confirming their necessity for degrading native lignin within the complex plant cell wall matrix has been lacking. In this 2023 study, we employed a targeted CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing approach to generate knockout mutants of *P. ostreatus* with disruptions in key genes encoding MnPs and VPs. We then conducted a comparative analysis of the wild-type and mutant strains' capacity to degrade natural lignin in wheat straw and poplar wood substrates. Our findings demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9-generated mutants exhibited a significant and quantifiable reduction in lignin degradation efficiency, as measured by Klason lignin analysis and spectroscopic techniques. This phenotypic deficit provides the first direct experimental evidence that these peroxidase-based LMEs are not merely accessory but are essential components for the fungal decay of natural lignin. This research resolves a long-standing question in fungal biology and establishes a robust genetic toolkit for probing lignocellulolytic systems. The implications extend to industrial biotechnology, where engineered fungal strains or their enzyme cocktails can be optimized for more efficient biomass conversion in biorefining and biofuel production.
