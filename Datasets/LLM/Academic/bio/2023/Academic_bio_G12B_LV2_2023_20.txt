**Abstract**

Understanding microclimatic conditions within European forests is crucial for predicting species distributions and ecosystem responses to ongoing climate change. Current ecological models often lack the high-resolution temperature data necessary to accurately represent these fine-scale variations. This paper presents a novel, openly accessible dataset of bioclimatic variables specifically focused on forest microclimate temperatures across Europe. Derived from high-resolution temperature grids, this dataset provides temporally and spatially detailed information relevant to a range of ecological applications. The freely available resource aims to facilitate improved parameterization of species distribution models, enhance our understanding of forest microclimate dynamics, and ultimately, contribute to more robust projections of forest ecosystem futures in a changing climate. This dataset represents a significant advance for bioecological research within European forest systems.
