## Heterogeneous Anomalous Transport in Biological Systems: A Convergence of Experimental Observation, Theoretical Modeling, and Machine Learning Prediction

**Abstract:** The conventional diffusion paradigm, predicated on Fick’s laws, frequently fails to accurately describe particle dynamics within complex biological environments. This review examines the burgeoning field of heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) as it applies to cellular and molecular biology, focusing on the interplay between experimental observation, theoretical frameworks, and the increasingly crucial role of machine learning. Biological systems, characterized by their inherent structural heterogeneity – encompassing intracellular crowding, macromolecular networks, and active transport mechanisms – actively promote anomalous diffusion behaviors, including sub-diffusion, super-diffusion, and complex scaling phenomena. We critically evaluate established microrheological techniques, such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), single-particle tracking (SPT), and particle image force microscopy (PIFM), which have provided compelling experimental evidence for HAT in diverse biological contexts, ranging from cytoplasm and the nuclear interior to extracellular matrices.

Theoretical advances have attempted to rationalize these observations, with significant progress made in modeling HAT through continuous-time random walk (CTRW) approaches, fractional diffusion equations, and network-based models incorporating trapping and correlated motion. However, the complexity of biological systems often renders analytical solutions intractable.  Consequently, we explore the emerging application of machine learning (ML) techniques, particularly deep learning architectures, to both analyze high-dimensional single-particle tracking data and predict anomalous transport exponents and scaling behaviors *in silico*.  ML offers a powerful tool for identifying hidden patterns and correlations within experimental data, circumventing the limitations of traditional phenomenological models.  We discuss the challenges in integrating ML with established theoretical frameworks, emphasizing the need for interpretable models that provide mechanistic insights into the underlying physical processes driving HAT.  Finally, we highlight promising future directions, including the development of multi-scale models that bridge the gap between molecular-level interactions and macroscopic cellular behavior, and the potential for ML-driven drug delivery strategies exploiting HAT phenomena.
