"This 2023 study investigates the catalytic mechanisms of Ni-Fe catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via in situ Raman spectroscopy. Observed surface reconstructions and dynamic site identification underscore the critical role of real-time spectroscopic analysis in elucidating catalytic behavior. These findings highlight in situ techniques as essential tools for advancing OER bio-inspired catalyst design."
