Title: Unraveling Complex Biological Dynamics: Advances in Heterogeneous Anomalous Transport Analysis

Abstract:
The intricate dynamics of biological systems at the cellular and molecular levels have long been characterized by heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) phenomena. Recent breakthroughs in experimental techniques, such as high-resolution microrheology, have enabled researchers to probe these complex processes with unprecedented precision. Concurrently, the development of sophisticated theoretical frameworks and machine learning algorithms has facilitated the analysis and interpretation of large datasets, revealing novel insights into the underlying mechanisms driving HAT. As of 2023, the integration of these advances has significantly enhanced our understanding of biological systems, shedding light on the role of anomalous transport in cellular processes and its implications for molecular biology. This review synthesizes current knowledge on HAT, highlighting the interplay between experimental, theoretical, and computational approaches that are redefining the field.
