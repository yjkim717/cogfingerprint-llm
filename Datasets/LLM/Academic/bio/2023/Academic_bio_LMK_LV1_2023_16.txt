Title: Elucidating the Role of Lignin-Modifying Enzymes in Lignin Degradation by Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Gene Editing

Abstract:

Lignin degradation is a critical step in the carbon cycle and a key process in various biotechnological applications, including biofuel production and biorefining. White-rot fungi, such as Pleurotus ostreatus, are renowned for their ability to efficiently degrade lignin in plant cell walls through the action of lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs), including laccases, manganese peroxidases, and lignin peroxidases. However, the precise role of these enzymes in lignin degradation remains poorly understood. In this study, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to generate targeted disruptions in the genes encoding LMEs in P. ostreatus. Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 system is a highly effective tool for genome editing in P. ostreatus, enabling the precise disruption of multiple LME genes. The generated mutants exhibited significantly impaired lignin degradation capabilities, as assessed by analysis of lignin content and structure in treated biomass. Furthermore, biochemical assays revealed a substantial reduction in LME activity in the mutant strains. Our findings unequivocally demonstrate that LMEs are essential for the degradation of natural lignin in plant cell walls by P. ostreatus. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying lignin degradation and highlights the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for the improvement of biotechnologically relevant traits in white-rot fungi. The results of this research have significant implications for the development of more efficient biomass conversion processes and the production of value-added products from lignocellulosic biomass.
