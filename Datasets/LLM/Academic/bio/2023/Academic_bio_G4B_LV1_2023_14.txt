**Abstract**

The emergent complexity of biological systems necessitates a refined understanding of transport processes beyond traditional Brownian dynamics. This study investigates heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) within cellular and molecular contexts, recognizing its pervasive influence on a range of biological phenomena, from protein trafficking to intracellular signaling. We synthesize current experimental methodologies, primarily leveraging microrheology – the probing of particle motion within complex fluids – to characterize transport heterogeneity. Specifically, we examine deviations from Fickian diffusion, indicative of non-Brownian behavior, observed in model lipid membranes and within isolated cellular microenvironments. 

Theoretical frameworks, including modifications to the Rat-Krieger equation and the incorporation of active matter principles, are discussed as potential explanations for these deviations.  Furthermore, we posit that HAT arises from a combination of spatially varying viscosity, topological constraints, and potentially, transient interactions between mobile entities.  The implications of this heterogeneity extend to the regulation of cellular processes, suggesting that HAT may represent a critical, yet often overlooked, mechanism in modulating molecular interactions and ultimately, cellular behavior. Future research should focus on establishing quantitative relationships between microscopic transport characteristics and macroscopic biological outcomes.
