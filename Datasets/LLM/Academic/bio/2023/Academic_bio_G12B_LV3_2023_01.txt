**Abstract:**

The burgeoning field of heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) is rapidly transforming our understanding of molecular dynamics within complex biological systems. Traditional diffusion models, predicated on homogenous environments and Brownian motion, increasingly fail to accurately describe the non-equilibrium behavior observed in cells and molecular networks. This review examines the recent advancements in characterizing and modeling HAT across diverse biological contexts, including intracellular protein trafficking, macromolecular crowding, and signaling pathway dynamics. We detail experimental methodologies increasingly employed to probe anomalous diffusion, such as single-particle tracking (SPT) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) coupled with advanced data analysis techniques. Furthermore, we critically evaluate existing theoretical frameworks – encompassing continuous time random walks (CTRWs), fractional diffusion equations, and scaling analyses – assessing their applicability to specific biological scenarios exhibiting sub-diffusive, super-diffusive, or mixed transport regimes. A key focus is the integration of high-throughput experimental data with machine learning (ML) approaches. We highlight how ML algorithms, including deep learning and Bayesian inference, are enabling the extraction of nuanced transport parameters and the identification of underlying heterogeneity from complex spatio-temporal datasets. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for HAT research, emphasizing the need for integrated experimental-computational pipelines and the development of predictive models capable of elucidating the functional significance of anomalous transport in cellular processes and disease states, particularly in the context of rapidly evolving omics technologies and personalized medicine initiatives of 2023.
