Title: Evaluating the Efficacy of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) in Postgraduate Obstetrics and Gynecology Training: A Formative Assessment Perspective


#### Abstract

The Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) is a workplace-based assessment (WBA) tool increasingly utilized in postgraduate medical education to evaluate trainees' procedural competencies. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of DOPS as a formative assessment instrument in enhancing the learning experience of postgraduate trainees in obstetrics and gynecology (OB-GYN). A mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative data collected from a cohort of 30 postgraduate trainees and 15 faculty members at a tertiary care teaching hospital in 2023.


#### Methods
The study involved a prospective observational design. Postgraduate trainees in OB-GYN underwent DOPS assessments for various procedural skills, such as obstetric ultrasound and assisted vaginal delivery. Following each assessment, trainees received structured feedback from faculty members. The trainees' and faculty members' perceptions regarding the utility and feasibility of DOPS as a formative assessment tool were captured through surveys and semi-structured interviews.


#### Results
Quantitative analysis of survey data revealed that both trainees and faculty members held positive perceptions of DOPS. The majority (>80%) of trainees reported that DOPS facilitated the identification of their strengths and weaknesses in procedural skills, while >90% of faculty members agreed that DOPS provided valuable insights into trainees' competencies. Qualitative analysis of interview data yielded themes that supported the quantitative findings. Trainees appreciated the constructive feedback received through DOPS, which they believed enhanced their learning and boosted their confidence in performing procedural skills. Faculty members valued DOPS for its ability to provide a nuanced assessment of trainees' procedural abilities, thereby informing targeted educational interventions.


#### Conclusion
This study provides evidence supporting the efficacy of DOPS as a formative assessment tool in postgraduate OB-GYN training. The findings suggest that DOPS not only enhances trainees' learning experiences but also fosters a culture of feedback and continuous improvement. As medical education continues to evolve, the integration of DOPS into postgraduate training programs may contribute to the development of more competent and proficient obstetricians and gynecologists. Future research should focus on exploring the long-term impact of DOPS on trainees' clinical practice and patient outcomes.
