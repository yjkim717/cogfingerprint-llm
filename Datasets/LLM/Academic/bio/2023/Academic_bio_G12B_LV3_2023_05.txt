**Abstract:** The unprecedented global dissemination of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) between December 2022 and March 2023 represents a significant emerging threat to both avian and human health. This report synthesizes observations from Europe and the Americas, documenting a marked expansion of HPAI A(H5N1) circulation, particularly within wild bird populations, including notable increases in detections among vulnerable seabird species. Phylogenetic analyses reveal the emergence of novel viral variants exhibiting concerning mutations associated with enhanced transmissibility and potential for increased zoonotic potential. While direct human infections remain limited, the observed genetic evolution warrants heightened surveillance and proactive risk mitigation strategies. The widespread presence of HPAI A(H5N1) in diverse avian reservoirs poses a sustained risk of spillover events, necessitating a comprehensive, One Health approach integrating ecological monitoring of wild bird populations, stringent biosecurity measures within poultry farming operations, and robust epidemiological surveillance for early detection of human cases. Further research is crucial to characterize the dynamics of viral adaptation, predict future evolutionary trajectories, and inform the development of targeted interventions to minimize the impact of this evolving zoonotic threat.
