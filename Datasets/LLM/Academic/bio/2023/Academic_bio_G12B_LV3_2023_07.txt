**Abstract**

The increasing demand for fine-scale ecological data necessitates advancements in bioclimatic modeling, particularly concerning microclimate conditions within forested ecosystems. Lembrechts (2023) addresses this need by presenting ForestClim, a novel, publicly available dataset of high-resolution bioclimatic variables specifically focused on forest microclimate temperatures across Europe. Utilizing a 25x25 mÂ² spatial resolution, ForestClim offers a substantial improvement over existing datasets, enabling more accurate parameterization and validation of ecological models. This dataset promises to enhance research investigating species distributions, forest phenology, and the impacts of climate change on European forest biodiversity, facilitating improved predictive capabilities and informing conservation strategies.
