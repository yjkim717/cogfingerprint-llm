**Abstract**

The recent emergence and rapid dissemination of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, specifically clade 2.3.4.4b, represents a significant and evolving threat to global animal and human health.  Between December 2022 and March 2023, a geographically widespread outbreak characterized by the expansion of HPAI across Europe and the Americas underscored the virus’s considerable transmissibility and pathogenic capacity. Initial investigations focused on poultry populations, revealing devastating mortality rates and substantial economic disruption within the agricultural sector.  However, the detection of HPAI in non-avian reservoirs, notably marine mammals such as sea birds, raises critical concerns regarding the zoonotic potential of these viruses. 

Analysis of circulating viral strains indicates a dominant clade 2.3.4.4b lineage, exhibiting a notable adaptability and sustained prevalence.  Further research is urgently needed to elucidate the mechanisms driving this rapid spread, including environmental factors and potential vector transmission pathways.  Specifically, the identification of novel host species and assessment of the human risk profile associated with exposure to HPAI viruses, particularly those exhibiting HPAIV (highly pathogenic avian influenza virus) characteristics, remain paramount.  Continued surveillance and genomic characterization are essential to proactively mitigate the potential for further outbreaks and inform targeted public health interventions.
