**Abstract**

The integration of formative assessment strategies within postgraduate medical training remains a critical area of focus in bio-medical education. This study examines the feasibility and perceived effectiveness of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) as a formative assessment tool for obstetrics and gynecology (O&G) residents in the Indian healthcare context during 2023. Employing a mixed-methods approach, we evaluated trainee and faculty perceptions following the implementation of DOPS across a range of common O&G procedures. Findings reveal overwhelmingly positive reception from both cohorts, with participants citing enhanced procedural skill refinement and improved feedback quality as key benefits. Trainees reported increased self-awareness regarding technical performance, while faculty observed demonstrable progress in resident competence. However, practical challenges pertaining to scheduling and time allocation emerged as significant barriers to widespread and consistent DOPS implementation. These temporal constraints necessitate exploration of innovative solutions, such as streamlined observation protocols and integrated scheduling strategies, to maximize the utility of DOPS within resource-limited settings. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on formative assessment in postgraduate medical education, offering actionable insights for optimizing procedural skills training in O&G and potentially adaptable across other surgical specialties.
