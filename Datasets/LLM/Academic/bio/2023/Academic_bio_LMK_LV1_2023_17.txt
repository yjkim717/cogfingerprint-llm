**Title:** Evaluating the Efficacy of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) in Formative Assessment of Postgraduate Trainees in Obstetrics and Gynecology: A Prospective Cohort Study

**Abstract:**

The acquisition of procedural skills is a crucial component of postgraduate training in obstetrics and gynecology. Ensuring that trainees possess the necessary competencies to perform these skills safely and effectively is essential for delivering high-quality patient care. Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) has emerged as a valuable tool for formative assessment, providing immediate feedback and guiding trainee development. This prospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of DOPS in assessing the procedural skills of postgraduate trainees in obstetrics and gynecology.

Between January 2022 and December 2022, 50 postgraduate trainees in obstetrics and gynecology from a tertiary care teaching hospital participated in this study. Trainees underwent DOPS assessments for various procedural skills, including obstetric ultrasound, amniocentesis, and cesarean section. Assessors, comprising experienced faculty members, used a standardized DOPS assessment form to evaluate trainee performance. The assessment form comprised six domains: (1) pre-procedure preparation, (2) patient consent and communication, (3) procedural technique, (4) patient safety and comfort, (5) post-procedure care, and (6) overall competence.

A total of 200 DOPS assessments were conducted, with each trainee undergoing a minimum of four assessments. The results showed a significant improvement in trainee performance over time, with a mean score increase from 3.2 ± 0.8 to 4.5 ± 0.6 (p < 0.001) on a 5-point Likert scale. The DOPS assessment tool demonstrated high reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and validity (r = 0.85, p < 0.001) when correlated with global rating scales.

The findings of this study support the use of DOPS as an effective teaching and assessment tool for postgraduate trainees in obstetrics and gynecology. By providing regular, structured feedback, DOPS facilitates the development of procedural skills and enhances trainee confidence. The results also highlight the importance of ongoing assessment and feedback in postgraduate training, enabling targeted interventions to address areas of weakness. In conclusion, DOPS is a valuable adjunct to traditional assessment methods, offering a robust and reliable means of evaluating trainee competence in procedural skills.
