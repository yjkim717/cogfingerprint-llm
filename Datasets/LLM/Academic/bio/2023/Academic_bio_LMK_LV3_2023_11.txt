Title: Unveiling the Plasma Proteome Landscape of Healthy Aging: A Multi-Cohort Analysis

Abstract:
Aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive physiological decline. The identification of reliable biomarkers is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms and promoting healthy aging. Leveraging the aptamer-based SomaScan technology, this study integrates data from four independent cohorts to investigate the plasma proteome in the context of aging. Our meta-analysis reveals 273 plasma proteins significantly associated with chronological age, implicating diverse biological pathways, including inflammation, cellular senescence, and lipid metabolism. These age-related proteins serve as potential biomarkers for monitoring healthy aging and may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms driving age-related decline. Our findings underscore the utility of the plasma proteome in aging research and highlight the SomaScan platform as a valuable tool for biomarker discovery, paving the way for future longitudinal studies and therapeutic interventions aimed at promoting healthy aging.
