**Abstract**

The recalcitrant nature of lignin, a primary component of plant cell walls, presents a significant barrier to efficient biomass utilization. *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom) represents a promising biological agent for lignin degradation, yet the precise enzymatic mechanisms driving this process remain incompletely elucidated. This study investigated the role of key lignin-modifying enzymes within *P. ostreatus* during lignolytic activity. Utilizing transcriptomic analysis and enzyme assays, we confirmed the critical involvement of manganese peroxidases (MnP) and versatile peroxidases (VP) in the initial stages of lignin breakdown.  Specifically, elevated expression of *mnp1* and *vp1* genes correlated with increased ligninase activity *in vitro*.  Furthermore, preliminary investigations leveraging CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing techniques demonstrated that targeted disruption of *mnp1* significantly attenuated lignin degradation capacity within fungal cultures. These findings underscore the importance of MnP and VP in *P. ostreatus*-mediated ligninolysis and highlight the potential for targeted genetic manipulation to enhance ligninolytic efficiency in biotechnological applications.
