**Abstract**

Recent advancements in proteomics have facilitated a deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease (AD) heterogeneity. This study, utilizing a large-scale cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic analysis conducted in 2023, identified five distinct molecular subtypes within the AD patient population. These subtypes are characterized by unique enrichment of biological pathways, demonstrating differential involvement of neuroinflammatory, synaptic, and metabolic processes. Critically, each subtype exhibited significant correlations with specific genetic risk profiles and distinct patterns of regional brain atrophy, as assessed through neuroimaging. Furthermore, longitudinal clinical data revealed divergent trajectories of cognitive decline across these molecular subtypes. These findings underscore the complex, multi-faceted nature of AD and highlight the potential for refined diagnostic and therapeutic strategies tailored to individual molecular subtype classifications, paving the way for personalized medicine approaches in AD management.
