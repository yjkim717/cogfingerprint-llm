**Abstract**

Heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) represents a burgeoning area of investigation at the intersection of cellular and molecular biology, challenging conventional models of diffusion and offering novel insights into complex biological processes. This review synthesizes recent advancements in characterizing and interpreting HAT phenomena observed within diverse biological systems, leveraging a combination of sophisticated experimental microrheology techniques and emerging theoretical frameworks.  Specifically, we examine how deviations from Fickian diffusion – manifested as velocity-dependent mean squared displacement – are increasingly recognized as fundamental determinants of cellular mechanics, signaling pathways, and molecular interactions. 

The observed heterogeneity of transport arises from intricate spatial variations in viscosity and confinement, often influenced by the cellular cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix.  Recent studies utilizing dynamic light scattering and fluorescence microrheology provide compelling evidence for HAT in organelles, protein networks, and even within the cytoplasm itself. Furthermore, we discuss the application of non-equilibrium statistical physics and active matter models to explain these observed deviations, highlighting the growing convergence between theoretical predictions and experimental data.  Finally, we conclude by outlining key unresolved questions and future directions for research, emphasizing the potential of HAT to refine our understanding of biological function and inform the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
