**Direct Observation of Procedural Skills with Structured Checklists: A Formative Assessment Strategy to Enhance Resident Competency in Obstetrics and Gynecology**

**Abstract**

Effective training in obstetrics and gynecology (OBGY) necessitates the acquisition of complex procedural skills, a domain where competency directly impacts patient safety and outcomes. Traditional assessment methods often struggle to comprehensively evaluate these skills, particularly within the context of formative feedback crucial for resident development. This study investigates the implementation and reception of direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) utilizing structured checklists as a formative assessment tool within an OBGY residency program.  The research, conducted in 2023, sought to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived impact of DOPS on resident learning and faculty teaching practices.

A mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating quantitative data derived from post-procedural checklist ratings and resident self-assessments, alongside qualitative data gathered through semi-structured interviews with both residents and attending physicians. The structured checklists were designed to assess key technical and non-technical skills associated with common OBGY procedures, incorporating elements of cognitive, manual, and communication proficiency. Data analysis focused on identifying patterns in assessment scores, resident perceptions of feedback utility, and faculty perspectives on the integration of DOPS into their teaching workflow.

Findings demonstrate a consistently positive perception of DOPS among both residents and faculty. Residents reported increased awareness of their skill strengths and weaknesses, a heightened focus on procedural technique, and a greater receptiveness to constructive criticism. Faculty perceived DOPS as a valuable tool for providing targeted feedback, facilitating individualized learning plans, and identifying areas requiring focused remediation. Quantitative data revealed a trend towards improved checklist scores over time, suggesting a positive correlation between structured observation and procedural skill refinement.

However, the study also highlighted challenges, including the time commitment required for observation and feedback, and the need for ongoing faculty training in effective DOPS implementation. Future research should explore the longitudinal impact of DOPS on resident performance in high-stakes clinical scenarios, as well as the potential for integrating DOPS data into automated competency assessment systems. Furthermore, investigating the optimal frequency and timing of observations, and exploring the use of video-based feedback tools, represents a promising avenue for future exploration. This study contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the value of DOPS as a formative assessment strategy in OBGY residency training, advocating for its wider adoption and refinement to optimize resident competency and ultimately improve patient care.
