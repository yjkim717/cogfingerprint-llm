**Abstract: Refinement of Proliferative Biomarker Assessment in Colorectal Cancer: Integrating Immunohistochemical and Emerging Molecular Approaches for Enhanced Prognostic Stratification**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health burden, characterized by substantial heterogeneity in clinical presentation, progression, and response to therapy. Accurate prognostic stratification is therefore crucial for guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes.  Proliferation, a fundamental hallmark of cancer, has long been recognized as a key determinant of CRC aggressiveness and survival. Historically, immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of proliferation-associated markers, particularly Ki-67, has served as a cornerstone in pathological evaluation. However, the inherent limitations of IHC, including inter-observer variability, antigen masking, and lack of quantitative precision, necessitate the exploration of complementary and advanced methodologies. This review synthesizes current knowledge regarding proliferative biomarkers in CRC, critically evaluating both established IHC techniques and emerging molecular approaches, with a focus on their potential to refine prognostic prediction and personalize treatment strategies.

The traditional IHC assessment of Ki-67, while widely utilized, often yields semi-quantitative results that are susceptible to interpretation bias.  Furthermore, Ki-67 reflects total cellular proliferation, failing to discriminate between different cell cycle phases or the contribution of specific cell populations within the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, alternative IHC markers, such as phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) for mitotic index and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) for DNA synthesis, are increasingly being investigated to provide more nuanced insights into proliferative activity.  However, the clinical utility of these markers remains incompletely defined, and their integration into standardized diagnostic protocols is ongoing.

Recent advancements in molecular biology have facilitated the development of more sophisticated methods for assessing proliferation. These include flow cytometric analysis of DNA content (ploidy), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels targeting genes involved in cell cycle regulation (e.g., *CCNE1*, *CDK4*, *RB1*).  Furthermore, spatial transcriptomics and multiplex immunohistochemistry are enabling the characterization of proliferative gradients and the identification of spatially distinct proliferative zones within the tumor, allowing for a more detailed understanding of tumor heterogeneity.  Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented resolution to investigate the proliferative state and behaviour of individual cells within the tumor and its stroma, revealing novel subpopulations and signaling pathways that drive uncontrolled growth.

This review highlights the potential of integrating IHC with these emerging molecular techniques to create a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of proliferation in CRC. Machine learning algorithms are increasingly being applied to combine IHC data with clinical parameters and genomic information, generating predictive models with improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy.  The identification of specific proliferation signatures associated with response to targeted therapies (e.g., CDK4/6 inhibitors) represents a promising avenue for personalized treatment strategies.  Future research should focus on standardizing methodologies, validating findings in large, multi-institutional cohorts, and developing clinically actionable biomarkers that can
