**Abstract**

Heterogeneous anomalous transport – deviating from classical Brownian motion – is increasingly recognized as a fundamental characteristic of cellular and molecular processes. This study synthesizes recent advancements in characterizing these complex transport phenomena, integrating experimental microrheology with sophisticated theoretical modeling and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we examine how novel microrheological probes, coupled with advanced algorithms, are enabling the quantification of non-diffusive transport within confined biological environments.  Our analysis reveals that machine learning models, trained on high-resolution microrheological data, can accurately predict transport behavior influenced by cellular architecture and molecular crowding.  These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of intracellular dynamics, impacting areas such as drug delivery, protein trafficking, and the regulation of cellular signaling.  Further research utilizing this integrated approach promises to unlock critical insights into the mechanistic basis of biological function, particularly concerning the role of anomalous transport in cellular homeostasis.
