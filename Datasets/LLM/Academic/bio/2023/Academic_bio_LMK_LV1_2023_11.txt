Title: Unveiling the Plasma Proteomic Signature of Aging: A SOMAscan-Based Analysis of Healthy and Biological Aging

Abstract:

Aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by the gradual deterioration of physiological functions, with profound implications for human health. The identification of reliable biomarkers for aging is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms and predicting age-related outcomes. This study leverages the SOMAscan proteomic platform to investigate the human plasma proteome in the context of aging. Using a cohort of healthy individuals, we employed a comprehensive proteomic analysis to identify plasma proteins associated with chronological and biological aging. Our results reveal a robust signature of 273 proteins significantly correlated with age, encompassing a diverse range of biological processes, including inflammation, cellular stress, and metabolic regulation. Notably, a subset of these proteins exhibited a stronger association with biological aging, as measured by established biomarkers such as telomere length and epigenetic clocks. Multivariate modeling demonstrated that a panel of 45 proteins could accurately predict chronological age (RÂ² = 0.85, p < 0.001). Furthermore, pathway analysis revealed an enrichment of age-related proteins in pathways implicated in age-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's and cardiovascular disease. Our findings underscore the utility of the SOMAscan platform in uncovering novel biomarkers for aging and highlight the potential for plasma proteomics to inform our understanding of healthy and pathological aging. The identified protein signature provides a valuable resource for future studies aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying aging and developing predictive models for age-related outcomes.
