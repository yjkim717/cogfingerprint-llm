**Abstract**

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized biological research, yet inherent stochasticity in gene expression and technical noise during data acquisition pose significant challenges to accurate biological inference. While stochastic systems biology offers a framework to model these intrinsic fluctuations, integrating these models with the complexities of scRNA-seq data analysis remains a critical hurdle. This work proposes a unified computational framework leveraging generating functions to explicitly account for both biological stochasticity in RNA transcription and prevalent technical artifacts within scRNA-seq datasets. Our approach establishes a probabilistic model where generating functions represent the joint distribution of cellular mRNA abundances, incorporating parameters reflecting transcriptional burst kinetics and error rates associated with library preparation and sequencing. By analytically characterizing the relationship between model parameters and observable data distributions, we enable robust parameter estimation and facilitate the discrimination between true biological heterogeneity and technical variation. This framework, validated through simulations and applied to publicly available datasets, provides a powerful tool for improved inference of gene regulatory networks and cellular phenotypes from noisy single-cell transcriptomic measurements, offering a pathway towards more reliable biological discovery in the era of high-throughput genomics.
