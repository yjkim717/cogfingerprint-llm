**Abstract: Emerging Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer Prognosis – A Convergence of Molecular and Immunological Approaches**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating refined prognostic strategies beyond conventional clinical staging. This review synthesizes recent advancements in biomarker discovery and application for improved prediction and assessment of patient outcomes within CRC. We explore the evolving landscape of molecular biology, focusing on the utility of genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and, increasingly, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) as prognostic indicators. Specifically, we examine the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs) in modulating CRC progression, metastasis, and response to therapy. 

Furthermore, the integration of immunohistochemistry (IHC) with molecular profiling is highlighted as a crucial methodological shift.  Novel IHC targets, reflecting alterations in signaling pathways and tumor microenvironment components, are correlated with ncRNA expression patterns to generate more comprehensive prognostic models.  The study acknowledges the inherent limitations of each biomarker modality, including variability in expression and potential for confounding factors.  

Despite these challenges, the convergence of these techniques – combining genomic, epigenetic, and immunological data – offers a promising avenue for personalized risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making.  Future research should prioritize the validation of these biomarkers in large, diverse cohorts and the development of robust, clinically translatable assays.  Ultimately, the goal is to shift from a reactive to a proactive approach in CRC management, enabling earlier detection, tailored interventions, and improved patient survival rates by 2024.
