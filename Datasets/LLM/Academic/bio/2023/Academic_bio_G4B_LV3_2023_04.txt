**Abstract**

The integration of formative assessment strategies remains a critical challenge within postgraduate medical education, particularly in specialized disciplines such as obstetrics and gynecology. This study investigated the efficacy of direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) as a novel formative assessment technique for evaluating the development of clinical competence among postgraduate students. Utilizing direct observation, faculty provided immediate, specific feedback on students’ performance during simulated and, where feasible, clinical obstetrical and gynecological procedures.  Data collection involved student and faculty surveys assessing perceptions of DOPS’s utility in enhancing procedural skills and fostering a growth mindset. Preliminary findings indicate a strong positive correlation between DOPS implementation and improved student confidence in performing key tasks.  Furthermore, faculty reported increased satisfaction with student progress and a heightened ability to tailor training interventions. These results suggest that DOPS represents a valuable adjunct to traditional assessment methods, offering a nuanced approach to cultivating procedural expertise and supporting the long-term development of skilled clinicians within obstetrics and gynecology.
