**Title:** Evaluating the Efficacy of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) as a Formative Assessment Tool in Postgraduate Obstetrics and Gynecology Training: A 2023 Analysis

**Abstract**

The paradigm of postgraduate medical education is progressively shifting from summative, high-stakes examinations towards integrated, workplace-based formative assessments that facilitate continuous professional development. Within the specialized domain of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN), where clinical competence is inextricably linked to procedural proficiency, the implementation of robust and effective assessment methodologies is paramount for ensuring patient safety and trainee readiness. This study critically evaluates the application of the Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) as a formative assessment instrument within contemporary OB/GYN postgraduate training programs. DOPS, a structured workplace-based assessment (WBA) tool, involves the direct, real-time observation of a trainee performing a defined clinical procedure, followed by immediate, structured feedback aimed at reinforcing strengths and identifying areas for improvement.

Our methodological approach involved a systematic analysis of implementation data and qualitative feedback from both trainees and faculty assessors across multiple tertiary care institutions throughout 2023. The primary objective was to ascertain the tool's formative utility—specifically, its capacity to engender meaningful learning and skill refinement—rather than its function as a mere metric of performance. The analysis revealed that DOPS was overwhelmingly perceived as an effective formative mechanism. Its efficacy is derived from several key factors: the immediacy of feedback, which allows for the rapid correction of technical and cognitive errors; the contextualization of assessment within the authentic clinical environment, enhancing ecological validity; and the structured nature of the feedback conversation, which promotes reflective practice and self-directed learning among postgraduate trainees. Specific procedural competencies in areas such as laparoscopic suturing, complex obstetric maneuvers, and hysteroscopic interventions were notably enhanced through iterative DOPS cycles.

However, this investigation also identified a significant and persistent implementation challenge: time constraints. The rigorous demands of clinical service in high-volume OB/GYN departments often conflict with the dedicated time required for a proper DOPS encounter, including pre-briefing, observation, and debriefing. This frequently leads to ad-hoc assessments or rushed feedback, potentially undermining the developmental intent of the tool. Faculty development in efficient feedback techniques and the strategic integration of DOPS into protected educational time are identified as critical success factors. In conclusion, while logistical challenges related to time allocation persist, the Direct Observation of Procedural Skills stands as a highly effective and indispensable component of a competency-based curriculum in postgraduate OB/GYN training. Its continued refinement and strategic implementation are crucial for cultivating a generation of obstetrician-gynecologists equipped with the refined procedural expertise demanded by modern clinical practice.
