**Abstract: Emergence and Dissemination of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5N1) – A Novel Transcontinental Spread and Implications for Zoonotic Risk**

The global emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) represents a significant and rapidly evolving threat to both avian and mammalian health. This study examines the unprecedented transcontinental spread of this clade, observed between December 2022 and March 2023, with a particular focus on the novel pathways of dissemination and implications for zoonotic potential. Historically concentrated in Asia and Africa, HPAI A(H5N1) exhibited a marked expansion into Europe and the Americas during the study period, facilitated by migratory bird pathways and, potentially, novel anthropogenic factors.

We analyze surveillance data documenting outbreaks across diverse avian species, with notable instances in black-headed gulls ( *Chroicocephalus ridibundus*) serving as important sentinel populations indicative of wider environmental contamination. Further, the presence of the virus in Peruvian pelicans (*Pelecanus thagus*) along the Pacific coast of South America highlights the expansion of the outbreak’s geographical range and introduces concerns regarding the potential for further spread within neotropical ecosystems.

The documented increase in HPAI A(H5N1) detections within poultry populations underscores the immediate economic and food security risks. Critically, we address the escalating concern regarding zoonotic transmission, noting the increasing, albeit still rare, reports of human infections linked to exposure to infected birds. Genomic analyses suggest potential antigenic drift within circulating viral strains, which may impact the efficacy of existing vaccines and influence host susceptibility. This study emphasizes the urgent need for enhanced global surveillance, improved biosecurity measures in poultry farming, and rigorous investigation into the mechanisms driving the virus’s unprecedented spread, particularly concerning its interaction with wild bird reservoirs and the evolving risk to human health. Future research must prioritize understanding the ecological drivers and evolutionary dynamics of this novel HPAI A(H5N1) lineage.
