**Abstract: Emergent HPAI Clade 2.3.4.4b and Avian Reservoir Dynamics – Preliminary Findings from European Gull Surveillance**

The rapid global dissemination of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) during late 2022 and early 2023 underscored escalating zoonotic potential and necessitated comprehensive surveillance efforts. This study investigates the emergence and distribution of HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b within a European gull ( *Chroicocephalus ridibundus*) population in coastal regions of [Specify Region – e.g., Northwest Europe], representing a significant avian reservoir. Utilizing targeted sampling and phylogenetic analysis of circulating viruses, we documented a substantial increase in clade 2.3.4.4b prevalence between December 2022 and March 2023, coinciding with the broader global HPAI outbreak. 

Initial data suggests a potential for sustained viral maintenance within this gull population, exhibiting characteristics consistent with HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b, often associated with increased transmissibility.  Further investigation into environmental factors – including migratory patterns and inter-species contact – is crucial to fully elucidate the mechanisms driving clade spread.  The findings highlight the continued relevance of sentinel species, such as black-headed gulls, in monitoring emerging avian influenza threats and informing risk mitigation strategies.  Longitudinal surveillance and enhanced pathogen characterization remain paramount to assess and mitigate the evolving zoonotic risk posed by these evolving HPAI variants.
