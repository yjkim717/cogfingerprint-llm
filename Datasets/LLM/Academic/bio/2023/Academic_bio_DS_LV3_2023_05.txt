**Abstract**

The 2022-2023 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b represents a significant escalation in the ecology and threat potential of avian influenza. This study synthesizes surveillance data from Europe and the Americas to characterize the unprecedented geographic spread and multispecies impact of this viral lineage. We document extensive and severe mortality events in wild bird populations, which served as a primary reservoir for intercontinental dissemination. Of considerable concern is the spillover into marine mammals, notably sea lions and seals, resulting in mass mortality and suggesting an enhanced adaptation to mammalian respiratory tracts. Genomic surveillance reveals the sustained circulation of these viruses has facilitated the acquisition of mutations in the PB2 (e.g., E627K) and HA glycoprotein that are empirically linked to increased virulence in mammalian models and a heightened zoonotic potential. The convergence of wide host range, significant environmental persistence in wild reservoirs, and markers of mammalian adaptation underscores a heightened risk of viral evolution towards efficient human transmission. These findings necessitate a paradigm shift in pandemic preparedness, moving beyond poultry-centric surveillance to integrated, One Health frameworks that prioritize real-time genomic monitoring of wild birds and susceptible mammalian species to mitigate the emergent threat of a clade 2.3.4.4b-derived panzootic and potential pandemic.
