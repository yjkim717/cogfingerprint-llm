Title: Unveiling Molecular Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease: Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomics Reveals Distinct Subtypes and Genetic Risk Profiles

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by heterogeneous clinical manifestations and progression rates. Recent advancements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics have enabled the identification of molecular subtypes underlying this heterogeneity. Through a comprehensive proteomic analysis of CSF samples, we classified AD into five distinct molecular subtypes, each exhibiting unique genetic risk profiles and clinical outcomes. Our findings demonstrate that these subtypes are associated with differential expression of proteins involved in distinct pathological processes, including amyloidogenesis, neuroinflammation, and synaptic degeneration. The identification of these molecular subtypes has significant implications for personalized medicine, enabling tailored therapeutic strategies and improved patient stratification in clinical trials. This study highlights the potential of CSF proteomics to redefine AD diagnosis and treatment, fostering a more nuanced understanding of the disease's molecular landscape.
