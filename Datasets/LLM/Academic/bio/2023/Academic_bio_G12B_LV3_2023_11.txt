**Abstract**

The identification of robust biomarkers for assessing biological aging remains a critical challenge in biomedical research. This study, conducted in 2023, investigated the plasma proteome to identify proteins significantly associated with aging trajectories across diverse human cohorts. Utilizing multi-cohort analyses, we identified 273 plasma proteins exhibiting significant associations with age (age-associated proteins, APs). These APs demonstrated varying degrees of correlation with chronological age and exhibited links to several age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, analysis of temporal changes in AP abundance revealed the potential to reflect individual systemic aging rates, suggesting these proteins may serve as indicators of accelerated or decelerated aging phenotypes. These findings underscore the utility of plasma-based proteomics as a powerful tool for aging research and highlight a novel panel of APs with potential applications in the early detection of age-related pathologies, risk stratification, and monitoring of interventions targeting healthy aging. Further validation and longitudinal studies are warranted to fully elucidate the clinical relevance of these biomarkers.
