## Abstract: Targeted Disruption of Lignin-Modifying Enzyme Genes Reveals Critical Roles in *Pleurotus ostreatus* Lignin Degradation

Lignin, a complex phenylpropanoid polymer, represents a significant recalcitrance factor limiting the efficient utilization of plant biomass for biofuel and biochemical production. The white-rot fungus *Pleurotus ostreatus* is a renowned lignin degrader, employing a suite of extracellular ligninolytic enzymes. While the involvement of enzymes like laccases and peroxidases in lignin breakdown is well-established, the precise contribution and functional redundancy of specific lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs) remain incompletely understood. This study, conducted in 2023, utilizes the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system to systematically investigate the roles of key LMEs in *P. ostreatus* lignin degradation. We generated targeted knockout mutants for several manganese peroxidases (MnPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs), crucial components of the fungal ligninolytic machinery. Phenotypic analysis of these mutants, coupled with quantitative assessment of lignin degradation rates using model lignin substrates, revealed a significant impairment in natural lignin breakdown capacity in the absence of specific MnP and VP isoforms. Notably, disruption of certain VP genes resulted in a more pronounced degradation deficit compared to MnP knockouts, suggesting a greater functional specialization for these enzymes in the initial stages of lignin depolymerization. These findings provide compelling evidence for the essentiality of specific LMEs, particularly VPs, for efficient lignin degradation by *P. ostreatus* and highlight the potential of CRISPR-based approaches to elucidate the complex enzymatic mechanisms governing fungal biomass conversion. Further research will focus on characterizing the altered metabolic profiles and identifying compensatory mechanisms adopted by the mutants.
