Title: Unveiling Cell-Type Specific Metabolic Landscapes through Integrated Single-Cell Spatial Metabolomics and Proteomics

Abstract:
The intricate interplay between metabolic reprogramming and cellular heterogeneity in human tissues remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce the scSpaMet framework, a novel approach that enables the simultaneous profiling of proteins and metabolites at the single-cell level within their native spatial context. By integrating cutting-edge spatial metabolomics and proteomics techniques, scSpaMet generates high-resolution, cell-type specific metabolic-protein maps. Our results demonstrate that this integrated approach reveals previously unappreciated metabolic patterns and protein-metabolite interactions that are obscured in bulk tissue analyses. Application of scSpaMet to human tissue samples uncovered distinct metabolic signatures associated with specific cell types, shedding light on the complex tissue systems biology. This advancement has significant implications for understanding metabolic reprogramming in health and disease, and paves the way for novel therapeutic strategies targeting cell-type specific metabolic vulnerabilities.
