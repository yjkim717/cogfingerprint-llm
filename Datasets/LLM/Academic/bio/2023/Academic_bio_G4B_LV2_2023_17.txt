**Abstract: Evaluating the Utility of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills as a Formative Assessment Tool in Postgraduate Obstetrics and Gynecology Training**

The integration of robust formative assessment strategies is increasingly recognized as crucial for optimizing postgraduate medical education, particularly within specialized fields like obstetrics and gynecology. This study investigated the efficacy of direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) as a formative assessment method for postgraduate trainees in India, employing a mixed-methods approach to evaluate perceptions and potential impact. Utilizing a convenience sample of OBGY postgraduate students and faculty, data were collected through semi-structured interviews and observational analysis of DOPS sessions conducted throughout a six-month training period. 

Preliminary findings strongly suggest that DOPS is viewed favorably as a formative tool, fostering a collaborative learning environment and promoting targeted skill development. Participants consistently reported that DOPS provided immediate, actionable feedback, surpassing the limitations of traditional summative evaluations. Notably, both trainees and faculty expressed a preference for DOPSâ€™s focus on observable performance, facilitating a more transparent and equitable assessment process. 

Quantitative data, derived from observational checklists, indicated a demonstrable correlation between participation in DOPS sessions and subsequent improvements in procedural competency, as evidenced by standardized skill checklists. However, challenges related to standardization of observation criteria and potential for observer bias were identified, necessitating further refinement of the DOPS protocol.  This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the strategic implementation of DOPS within postgraduate OBGY training programs.  Future research will explore the development of validated, standardized observation rubrics and investigate the long-term impact of DOPS on clinical performance and patient outcomes.  These findings underscore the potential of DOPS to enhance the quality of postgraduate education and improve patient safety within the field.
