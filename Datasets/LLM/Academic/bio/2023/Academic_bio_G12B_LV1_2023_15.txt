**Abstract:**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, demanding improved diagnostic and prognostic tools to guide personalized treatment strategies. Accurate prediction of patient survival and response to therapy is paramount for optimizing clinical management and enhancing patient outcomes. Proliferative biomarkers, reflecting the rate of cell division and tumor growth, have long been recognized as valuable prognostic indicators in CRC. This review provides a comprehensive, contemporary appraisal of these biomarkers, encompassing both established immunohistochemical (IHC) methods and emerging molecular technologies.

Historically, markers such as Ki-67 (MKI67) have served as standard tools for assessing cellular proliferation in CRC. While widely utilized, the clinical utility of Ki-67 has been subject to ongoing refinement, with variability in antibody clones, scoring methods, and cutoff values impacting reproducibility and predictive accuracy.  We examine the current understanding of Ki-67â€™s limitations and the efforts to standardize its application in CRC diagnostics.

Beyond Ki-67, this review explores a spectrum of other IHC-based proliferative markers, including phosphohistone H3 (PHH3), cyclin D1, and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), evaluating their individual and combined prognostic value. We critically assess the evidence regarding their ability to stratify patients based on risk of recurrence and overall survival.

Moreover, the integration of molecular biology techniques has revolutionized our understanding of CRC proliferation.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled the identification of genetic alterations in genes regulating the cell cycle, such as *MYC*, *CCND1*, and *CDK4*, providing a deeper mechanistic insight into tumor growth.  Furthermore, gene expression profiling, including transcriptomic analyses, has revealed proliferation-associated gene signatures that can be used to predict prognosis independently or in conjunction with IHC markers. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating cell cycle progression and their potential as circulating biomarkers in CRC are also discussed.

The advent of spatial transcriptomics and multiplex IHC techniques further enhances the potential for biomarker discovery and validation. These technologies allow for the analysis of cellular proliferation within the tumor microenvironment, providing insights into the interplay between tumor cells, immune cells, and stromal components.  Finally, we discuss the increasing focus on integrating multi-omic data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) using machine learning approaches to develop more robust and accurate prognostic models for CRC.

In conclusion, while traditional IHC-based proliferative markers remain relevant, the field is transitioning towards more sophisticated molecular profiling strategies.  The continued refinement of existing biomarkers, coupled with the development of novel molecular assays and
