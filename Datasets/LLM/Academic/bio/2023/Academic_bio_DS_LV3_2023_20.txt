This study introduces ForestClim, a novel open-access database providing high-resolution bioclimatic variables for European forest microclimates. Addressing the critical gap in fine-scale temperature data, we demonstrate its utility in refining species distribution and ecological process models. By enhancing spatial resolution, this resource significantly improves the accuracy of climate change impact projections, offering an indispensable tool for advancing forest ecology and conservation planning across Europe.
