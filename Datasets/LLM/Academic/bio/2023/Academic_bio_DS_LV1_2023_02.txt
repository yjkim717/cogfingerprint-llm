**Title:** Integrative Analysis of Proliferative Biomarkers in Colorectal Carcinoma: From Immunohistochemical Quantification to Next-Generation Molecular Profiling for Prognostic Stratification

**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, characterized by significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes driven by divergent tumor biology. A central hallmark of aggressive disease is dysregulated cellular proliferation, making its accurate quantification a cornerstone of prognostic assessment. This review synthesizes the current landscape of proliferative biomarkers in CRC, critically evaluating their evolution from conventional protein-level detection to sophisticated molecular assays, with a focus on their integration into personalized oncology frameworks. We commence by examining the enduring role of immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based markers, notably Ki-67, which provides a direct histopathological index of the growth fraction within tumor tissue. While its utility is well-established, we discuss its limitations, including inter-observer variability in scoring and the challenge of intratumoral heterogeneity, which can compromise its standalone prognostic power.

The discourse then progresses to the realm of molecular biology techniques that offer a more granular dissection of proliferative drive. We detail the application of fluorescent *in situ* hybridization (FISH) for assessing gene amplifications, such as *MYC*, which acts as a master regulator of cell cycle progression. Furthermore, the review delves into the prognostic significance of mitotic machinery components, including aurora kinases and polo-like kinases, whose expression levels, quantifiable via quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and RNA sequencing, correlate with advanced disease stages and metastatic potential. A pivotal section is dedicated to the role of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), contextualizing their detection not merely as proliferation markers but as predictive biomarkers for emerging CDK inhibitor therapies.

We subsequently explore the paradigm shift enabled by high-throughput methodologies. The implementation of next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels allows for the concurrent identification of driver mutations (e.g., in *KRAS*, *BRAF*, and *PIK3CA*) that constitutively activate proliferative signaling pathways, such as MAPK and PI3K/AKT. This multiplexed genomic profiling facilitates a composite risk model, moving beyond singular biomarker analysis. The emerging potential of liquid biopsy—specifically, the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) bearing proliferation-associated mutations—is highlighted as a transformative tool for minimal residual disease monitoring and real-time assessment of therapeutic response. In conclusion, the accurate prognostication in CRC is increasingly dependent on a multimodal approach. The future lies in synthesizing data from IHC, molecular techniques, and genomic sequencing to construct robust, clinically actionable biomarker signatures that effectively stratify patients, guide adjuvant therapy decisions, and ultimately improve survival in this molecularly complex malignancy.
