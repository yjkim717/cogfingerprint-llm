**Abstract**

European forests represent critical carbon sinks and biodiversity hotspots, yet their microclimatic conditions are often poorly characterized. This study presents a novel, open-access dataset of bioclimatic variables designed to represent microclimate temperatures within European forest ecosystems. Utilizing high-resolution temperature grids, we derived these variables – encompassing daily minimum, maximum, and mean temperatures – to facilitate improved ecological modelling.  The methodology leverages established bioclimatic analysis techniques, ensuring robust and transferable results. These data are intended to enhance the accuracy of predictive ecological models, particularly those simulating species distribution and forest dynamics under climate change scenarios.  Further research will explore the integration of these variables into existing European forest simulation frameworks, contributing to a more nuanced understanding of forest resilience in a changing environment (2023).
