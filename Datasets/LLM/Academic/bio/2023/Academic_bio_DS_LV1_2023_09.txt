**Title:** Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomic Profiling Delineates Molecular Subtypes of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease with Divergent Pathophysiological Trajectories

**Abstract:**

Advancements in high-resolution mass spectrometry have enabled the deep proteomic characterization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), providing an unprecedented window into the neuropathological processes of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this 2023 study, we analyzed the CSF proteome of a large, well-characterized cohort and identified five distinct molecular subtypes. These subtypes exhibited unique genetic risk architectures and were characterized by divergent protein signatures. Notably, subtypes were defined by predominant features including aberrant neuronal hyperplasticity, pronounced blood-brain barrier dysfunction, innate immune activation, and distinct amyloid-beta processing abnormalities. Longitudinal clinical data revealed significant inter-subtype heterogeneity in rates of cognitive decline and survival, underscoring their profound prognostic relevance. Our findings challenge the traditional model of AD as a unitary clinicopathological entity. Instead, they provide a robust biological framework for a precision medicine approach, suggesting that therapeutic strategies must be tailored to the specific underlying molecular drivers identified through CSF proteomics to improve patient outcomes.
