**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in electrochemical biosensing necessitate a deeper understanding of interfacial dynamics. This study employs in situ Raman spectroscopy to characterize the transient structural changes occurring on Niâ€“Fe catalyst surfaces during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a critical step in biofuel cell operation. Analysis reveals significant surface reconstruction events correlated with reaction kinetics, providing novel insights into the underlying catalytic mechanisms. Specifically, shifts in vibrational modes observed via Raman spectroscopy directly link catalyst structural modification to enhanced OER efficiency. These in situ measurements offer a powerful tool for rational catalyst design and optimization within bioelectrochemical systems, informing strategies for improved performance in 2023 and beyond.
