**Abstract: Refinement of Proliferative Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer: Integrating Immunohistochemical and Molecular Approaches for Enhanced Prognosis and Therapeutic Stratification (2023)**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, necessitating improved prognostic accuracy and personalized therapeutic strategies. Accurate prediction of patient survival and response to treatment is critically dependent on reliable biomarkers, and proliferative markers represent a cornerstone in this assessment. This review synthesizes current knowledge regarding the application of proliferative biomarkers in CRC, charting a trajectory from established immunohistochemical (IHC) methods to contemporary molecular biology techniques, with a focus on enhancing clinical utility and ultimately, improving patient outcomes.

Historically, IHC staining for Ki-67 has served as a widely adopted marker of cell proliferation in CRC, providing valuable, albeit sometimes inconsistent, prognostic information. While readily accessible and relatively inexpensive, the inherent subjectivity in IHC interpretation and the limitations in quantifying proliferation dynamics have spurred the development and adoption of more sophisticated molecular approaches.  These include fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for *MYC* amplification, assessment of telomerase activity (hTERT), and increasingly, the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to identify genomic alterations impacting cell cycle regulation, such as mutations in *TP53*, *RB1*, and *PIK3CA*.

Furthermore, recent research has emphasized the importance of considering the tumor microenvironment (TME) in modulating proliferative signaling.  Immune cell infiltration, stromal interactions, and metabolic factors significantly influence tumor growth and response to therapy, and novel biomarkers reflecting these interactions are emerging.  The integration of IHC with spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed immunofluorescence allows for a more granular assessment of proliferative marker expression within the context of the TME, potentially yielding more predictive insights.

Despite advancements, challenges remain. Inter-laboratory variability in IHC staining protocols, the limited spatial resolution of traditional IHC, and the complex interplay of multiple proliferative pathways necessitate a more holistic and integrated approach.  Future research should prioritize the development of standardized IHC protocols, the validation of novel molecular biomarkers in large, prospective clinical trials, and the incorporation of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze complex datasets and refine prognostic models.  Ultimately, a combined strategy leveraging the strengths of both IHC and advanced molecular techniques, coupled with a deeper understanding of the TME, promises to deliver more robust and clinically actionable prognostic information for patients with CRC, facilitating tailored treatment plans and improved survival.
