Title: Elucidating the Role of Lignin-Modifying Enzymes in Lignin Degradation by Pleurotus ostreatus using CRISPR/Cas9 Gene Editing

Abstract:

Lignin, a complex aromatic polymer, is a major constituent of plant cell walls, and its degradation is crucial for carbon recycling and biotechnological applications. White-rot fungi, such as Pleurotus ostreatus, are renowned for their ability to efficiently degrade lignin through the action of lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs). However, the precise mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. This study employed the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to investigate the role of LMEs in lignin degradation by P. ostreatus. By targeting specific LME-encoding genes, we generated knockout mutants and evaluated their lignin-degrading capabilities. Our results demonstrate that LMEs, including laccases and peroxidases, are essential for lignin degradation, as mutants deficient in these enzymes exhibited significantly impaired lignin breakdown. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed a coordinated regulation of LME expression in response to lignin, suggesting a complex interplay between these enzymes. The findings of this study provide conclusive evidence for the critical role of LMEs in lignin degradation by P. ostreatus and highlight the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. The insights gained from this research have significant implications for the development of biotechnological applications, such as lignin valorization and biomass conversion, and contribute to our understanding of the complex interactions between fungi and plant biomass.
