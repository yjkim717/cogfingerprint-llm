Title: Elucidating the Role of Lignin-Modifying Enzymes in Lignin Degradation by Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Gene Editing

Abstract:

Lignin degradation is a critical step in the carbon cycle and a key process in the development of sustainable biorefineries. White-rot fungi, such as Pleurotus ostreatus, are renowned for their ability to efficiently degrade lignin, a complex aromatic polymer. Lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs), including laccases, manganese peroxidases, and lignin peroxidases, are hypothesized to play a crucial role in this process. However, the precise mechanisms underlying LME-mediated lignin degradation remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to generate targeted disruptions in the genes encoding LMEs in P. ostreatus. Our results demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing is a highly efficient and precise method for modifying the P. ostreatus genome. The disruption of LME-encoding genes significantly impaired the lignin-degrading capacity of P. ostreatus, indicating that LMEs are essential for lignin degradation. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed that LME disruption led to changes in the expression of genes involved in lignin biosynthesis and degradation pathways. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the critical role of LMEs in lignin degradation by P. ostreatus and demonstrate the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex process. This study contributes to our understanding of the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying lignin degradation and has significant implications for the development of sustainable biotechnological applications.
