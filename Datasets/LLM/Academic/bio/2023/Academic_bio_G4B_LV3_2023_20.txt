**Abstract**

This research presents a novel approach to characterizing microclimates within European forests, crucial for advancing ecological modeling. Utilizing a suite of open-access bioclimatic variables, we generated high-resolution temperature grids at a fine spatial resolution. These grids represent a significant advancement over existing datasets, facilitating more accurate simulations of species distribution and ecosystem processes. The methodology incorporates key bioclimatic variables – temperature seasonality, annual temperature range, and solar radiation – to capture nuanced environmental gradients.  Results demonstrate the utility of this approach for improving the predictive capability of ecological models, ultimately supporting informed conservation strategies within European forest landscapes in 2023.
