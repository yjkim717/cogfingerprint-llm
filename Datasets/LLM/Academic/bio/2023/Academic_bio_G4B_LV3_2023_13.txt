**Abstract**

Advances in single-cell technologies necessitate integrated approaches for comprehensive biological analysis. This study presents scSpaMet, a pioneering framework designed to simultaneously interrogate single immune and cancer cell metabolomes and protein expression profiles within complex human tissues. Leveraging spatial metabolomics data alongside high-resolution protein imaging, scSpaMet facilitates the identification of cell-type specific metabolic signatures and dynamic transcriptional trajectories.  The methodology employs advanced multi-omic data integration, moving beyond traditional bulk analysis to capture nuanced cellular heterogeneity.  Preliminary results demonstrate the framework’s capacity to resolve previously obscured metabolic dependencies and predict treatment responses.  These findings underscore the potential of scSpaMet to advance systems biology research, offering unprecedented insights into tissue microenvironments and driving precision medicine strategies by 2023.
