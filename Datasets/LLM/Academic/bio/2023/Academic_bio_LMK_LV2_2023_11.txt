Title: Unveiling the Plasma Proteome Signatures of Human Aging: A Step Towards Predictive Biomarkers for Healthy Aging

Abstract:

The aging process is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon characterized by a gradual decline in physiological function, increasing the susceptibility to age-related diseases. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of human aging is crucial for the development of predictive biomarkers and interventions that promote healthy aging. This study investigates the plasma proteome, a rich source of potential biomarkers, to elucidate its association with the aging process. Using a robust proteomic profiling approach, we analyzed the plasma proteome of a diverse cohort of individuals across a wide age range. Our results reveal a significant association between 273 plasma proteins and chronological age, implicating these proteins in the aging process. Functional enrichment analysis of these age-associated proteins highlights their involvement in various biological processes, including inflammation, cellular stress response, and metabolic regulation. Notably, a subset of these proteins exhibited a strong predictive capacity for chronological age, suggesting their potential as biomarkers for aging. Our findings provide novel insights into the plasma proteome signatures of human aging and lay the groundwork for the development of protein-based biomarkers that can predict an individual's biological age. Ultimately, this research has significant implications for promoting healthy aging and mitigating the risk of age-related diseases, underscoring the importance of continued exploration into the molecular mechanisms underpinning human aging.
