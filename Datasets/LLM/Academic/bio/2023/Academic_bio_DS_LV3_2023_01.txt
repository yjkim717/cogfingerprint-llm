**Abstract**

The year 2023 has witnessed a paradigm shift in our understanding of intracellular dynamics, driven by the growing recognition of heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) as a fundamental physical principle governing molecular mobility. Traditional models of diffusion, predicated on homogeneous environments and Gaussian statistics, are increasingly inadequate for describing the complex, crowded, and viscoelastic milieu of the cell. HAT, characterized by non-Gaussian displacement distributions and scale-invariant dynamics, provides a superior theoretical framework. This framework is critical for elucidating key biological processes, including organelle positioning, signal transduction cascades, and the search dynamics of transcription factors on chromatin. The inherent heterogeneity—where transport parameters vary spatially and temporally within a single cell—adds a layer of complexity, demanding advanced analytical tools.

Consequently, the field is now defined by a powerful synergy between cutting-edge experimental techniques, such as single-particle tracking with nanoscale resolution, and sophisticated theoretical models derived from continuous-time random walks and fractional calculus. A pivotal development in 2023 is the integration of machine learning (ML) to decode the immense, high-dimensional datasets generated by these experiments. Supervised ML algorithms classify distinct mobility states from trajectory data, while unsupervised methods identify previously occult subpopulations and transitions between dynamical regimes. Furthermore, generative models are being employed to simulate biologically realistic HAT scenarios for hypothesis testing. This tripartite integration of experiment, theory, and ML is not merely refining our models but is fundamentally reshaping our mechanistic understanding of cellular and molecular biology, offering unprecedented insights into how anomalous transport underpins function and dysfunction from the molecular to the cellular scale.
