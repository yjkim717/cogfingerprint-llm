**Abstract**

Understanding the catalytic mechanisms of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for developing efficient water splitting technologies. This study employs *in situ* spectroscopic techniques to probe the behavior of Ni–Fe catalysts during OER. Results reveal dynamic surface reconstruction phenomena and elucidate key intermediates involved in the reaction pathway. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of Ni–Fe catalyst activity and offer insights for optimizing OER performance through rational material design.
