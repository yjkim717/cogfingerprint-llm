## Enhanced Peptide Identification in Data-Independent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry via MSFragger-DIA within the FragPipe Workflow

**Abstract:** Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful quantitative proteomics technique, offering advantages in reproducibility and throughput compared to data-dependent acquisition (DDA). However, accurate and efficient peptide identification within DIA datasets remains a critical challenge. This study introduces MSFragger-DIA, a novel peptide identification algorithm specifically optimized for DIA spectral libraries, and its seamless integration within the established FragPipe data analysis pipeline. MSFragger-DIA leverages advanced search algorithms to accurately match precursor and fragment ion spectra against spectral libraries generated from DDA runs, significantly improving identification rates and reducing false discovery rates in DIA experiments.  The algorithmâ€™s efficiency stems from its ability to rapidly filter and score potential peptide matches, a crucial step given the extensive data generated by DIA. We demonstrate the efficacy of MSFragger-DIA within FragPipe through benchmarking against traditional peptide identification methods applied to both synthetic and real-world DIA datasets. Results indicate a substantial increase in the number of identified peptides, particularly for low-abundance proteins, alongside a maintained or improved level of confidence in peptide-level identifications. This integrated approach, MSFragger-DIA within FragPipe, represents a significant advance in DIA proteomics, streamlining the analysis process and facilitating more comprehensive and reliable quantitative protein profiling in 2023.  The open-source nature of both MSFragger and FragPipe further promotes accessibility and facilitates wider adoption within the proteomics community.
