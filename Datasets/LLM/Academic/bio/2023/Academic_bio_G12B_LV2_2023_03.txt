**Abstract**

Lignin, a complex aromatic polymer constituting a significant barrier to biomass utilization, presents a persistent challenge for sustainable biofuel production and bioprocessing. White-rot fungi (WRF), notably *Pleurotus ostreatus*, are recognized for their capacity to depolymerize lignin through the action of lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs). While the involvement of LMEs in lignin degradation by *P. ostreatus* is established, the precise enzymatic mechanisms and the relative contributions of individual enzyme classes remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the fundamental role of key LMEs – manganese peroxidases (MnPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs) – in the natural lignin degradation process mediated by *P. ostreatus*. Through a combination of enzymatic assays and targeted molecular analyses, we provide experimental evidence supporting the essentiality of both MnPs and VPs in the breakdown of lignin substrates. Specifically, our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between MnP and VP activity and the extent of lignin depolymerization *in vitro*. Further, our data suggests a synergistic interaction between these enzymes, contributing to a broader range of oxidative modifications on the lignin polymer. These results underscore the importance of MnPs and VPs in *P. ostreatus*-mediated lignin degradation and offer valuable insights for the potential metabolic engineering of fungal strains to enhance lignin conversion efficiency, a crucial step towards realizing sustainable bio-based economies. Future research will focus on elucidating the detailed catalytic mechanisms and substrate specificities of these enzymes.
