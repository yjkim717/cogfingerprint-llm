**Abstract: Emergent Patterns in Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) Circulation: A Rapid Assessment of Geographic Expansion and Implications for Zoonotic Risk (December 2022 â€“ March 2023)**

The unprecedented global expansion of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) during late 2022 and early 2023 represents a significant threat to poultry industries and public health. This study presents a rapid assessment of HPAI A(H5N1) circulation patterns across Europe and the Americas between December 2023 and March 2023, synthesizing available epidemiological data from national veterinary agencies and publicly accessible databases.  Our analysis reveals a geographically expansive wave of infection, characterized by rapid introduction and sustained transmission in previously unaffected regions. Notably, the observed spillover events impacting wild avian populations, particularly within migratory pathways utilized by *Laridae* species (including *Chroicocephalus ridibundus*, the black-headed gull), appear to be facilitating the rapid dissemination of the virus across continental boundaries.

The emergence of HPAI A(H5N1) in novel geographic locations, coupled with documented detections in mammalian hosts, raises concerns regarding the zoonotic potential of this viral strain. While human infections remain relatively infrequent, the increased prevalence of HPAI in poultry and the documented instances of direct and indirect contact between humans and infected birds necessitate heightened surveillance and risk mitigation strategies. We observed a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05) between the presence of migratory *Laridae* populations and the incidence of HPAI outbreaks in coastal regions, suggesting a critical role for these birds in long-distance virus dispersal.  Furthermore, preliminary genomic analyses indicate the presence of novel viral variants exhibiting altered antigenic properties, potentially impacting the efficacy of existing avian influenza control measures and diagnostic tools.  This rapid assessment underscores the urgency for enhanced global collaboration in epidemiological monitoring, pathogen characterization, and the development of effective preventative interventions to minimize the impact of HPAI A(H5N1) on both animal and human health. Further research is crucial to elucidate the mechanisms driving the virus's adaptability and to assess the long-term implications of this evolving pandemic.
