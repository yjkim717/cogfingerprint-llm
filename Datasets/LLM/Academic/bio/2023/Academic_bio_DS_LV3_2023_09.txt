**Abstract**

Recent advances in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics have enabled a more granular molecular stratification of Alzheimer's disease (AD), challenging its historical characterization as a single-pathogenesis disorder. In this 2023 study, we conducted a large-scale, high-resolution proteomic profiling of CSF samples from a multi-center AD cohort. Our integrative analysis, incorporating unsupervised clustering, identified five distinct molecular subtypes, each defined by unique protein abundance signatures. These subtypes were further characterized by divergent genetic risk profiles, as evidenced by polygenic risk score variations and specific allele associations. Crucially, each subtype demonstrated significant differences in core pathological features, including amyloid-beta and tau deposition patterns quantified by PET imaging, and exhibited heterogeneous clinical progression trajectories. This delineation of AD heterogeneity underscores the profound biological diversity underlying the clinical syndrome. Our findings compellingly argue that the conventional one-size-fits-all therapeutic paradigm is untenable. The identification of these proteomically-defined subgroups provides a critical framework for developing personalized medicine strategies, enabling future clinical trials to target specific pathophysiological mechanisms and paving the way for more effective, subtype-specific interventions.
