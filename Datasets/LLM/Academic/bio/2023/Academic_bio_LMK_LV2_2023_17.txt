**Title:** Evaluating the Efficacy of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills as a Formative Assessment Tool in Postgraduate Obstetrics and Gynecology Training: A Mixed-Methods Study

**Abstract:**

In the realm of postgraduate medical education, the assessment of clinical competencies is paramount to ensuring that trainees possess the requisite skills to deliver high-quality patient care. Formative assessments, in particular, play a crucial role in facilitating learning and improvement among trainees. This study investigates the effectiveness of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) as a formative assessment tool for postgraduate students in Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB-GYN). Conducted in 2023, this mixed-methods study combines quantitative and qualitative data to provide a comprehensive understanding of DOPS' utility in enhancing the learning experience of OB-GYN trainees.

The study was conducted across multiple institutions, involving a cohort of 50 postgraduate OB-GYN trainees and 20 assessors. Trainees underwent a series of DOPS assessments, which were followed by feedback sessions. Quantitative data were collected through pre- and post-DOPS surveys, assessing trainees' perceptions of their procedural competence and confidence. Qualitative data were gathered via semi-structured interviews with trainees and focus group discussions with assessors, exploring their experiences and perceptions of DOPS.

Quantitative findings indicate a significant improvement in trainees' self-reported procedural competence (p < 0.001) and confidence (p < 0.01) following DOPS assessments. Moreover, assessors' feedback was positively correlated with trainees' improvement in procedural skills, underscoring the importance of constructive feedback in the learning process. Qualitative analysis revealed that trainees valued DOPS for providing them with specific, timely, and relevant feedback on their performance. Assessors, too, appreciated DOPS for its structured framework, which facilitated the assessment of complex procedural skills.

The study's results demonstrate that DOPS is an effective formative assessment tool in postgraduate OB-GYN training, enhancing trainees' procedural competence and confidence. The integration of DOPS into workplace-based assessment frameworks can foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement, ultimately contributing to the delivery of high-quality patient care. The findings have implications for the design of postgraduate OB-GYN training programs, highlighting the need for regular, structured, and feedback-rich assessments.

This study contributes to the existing literature on workplace-based assessment in medical education, providing evidence on the utility of DOPS in a specific clinical context. The mixed-methods approach employed in this study offers a nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between assessment, feedback, and learning. As the medical education community continues to evolve, the insights gained from this study can inform the development of assessment frameworks that prioritize trainee learning and patient outcomes.

In conclusion, this study supports the use of DOPS as a valuable formative assessment tool in postgraduate OB-GYN training. By providing trainees with regular, structured feedback on their procedural skills, DOPS can enhance their learning experience, improve their competence, and ultimately contribute to better patient care. As such, DOPS should be considered an integral component of comprehensive assessment frameworks in OB-GYN training programs.
