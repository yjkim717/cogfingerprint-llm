**Abstract**

Heterogeneous anomalous transport represents a critical challenge in understanding biological processes at the cellular and molecular levels. This study synthesizes recent advancements across experimental microrheology, theoretical reaction-diffusion modeling, and machine learning methodologies to characterize this complex phenomenon. We posit that traditional diffusion models inadequately capture the observed variability in transport dynamics within biological systems, necessitating the integration of novel approaches. Specifically, the application of advanced microrheological techniques alongside reaction-diffusion simulations, informed by machine learning algorithms, offers a powerful framework for dissecting spatial heterogeneity.  Our analysis reveals how subtle variations in microenvironment influence molecular movement, impacting processes such as signaling and gene expression.  These findings, presented in 2023, underscore the importance of considering anomalous transport as a fundamental descriptor of cellular behavior and provide a foundation for future investigations into biological regulation.
