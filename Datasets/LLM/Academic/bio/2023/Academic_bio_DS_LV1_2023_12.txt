**Abstract**

Single-cell RNA sequencing has revealed pervasive transcriptional stochasticity, yet delineating biological noise from technical variation remains a central challenge. Here, we introduce a generative modeling framework employing probability generating functions to explicitly decompose observed expression distributions into intrinsic and extrinsic noise components. Our method enables the inference of kinetic parameters governing promoter switching and transcriptional bursting from scRNA-seq count data. Validation across synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrates robust quantification of noise signatures, providing mechanistic insights into gene regulation. This approach establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for interpreting cellular heterogeneity, advancing systems biology through principled integration of stochastic theory with high-resolution genomic measurements.
