**Title:** Prognostic Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer: Advances in Immunohistochemistry and Molecular Biology Techniques

**Abstract:**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for reliable prognostic biomarkers to guide clinical management. The identification of robust prognostic indicators is crucial for stratifying patients according to risk, thereby informing treatment decisions and potentially improving outcomes. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on prognostic biomarkers in CRC, with a particular focus on the methodologies employed for their detection, including immunohistochemistry (IHC) and advanced molecular biology techniques.

Recent advances in IHC have enabled the precise quantification of protein expression levels in CRC tissues, facilitating the assessment of cell proliferation markers such as Ki-67 and the evaluation of other proteins implicated in tumor progression. Moreover, the integration of IHC with digital pathology has enhanced the accuracy and reproducibility of biomarker assessment. Concurrently, molecular biology techniques, including next-generation sequencing (NGS) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), have revolutionized the field by allowing for the comprehensive analysis of genetic and transcriptomic alterations in CRC.

The application of these techniques has identified a range of prognostic biomarkers, including genetic mutations in key signaling pathways (e.g., KRAS, BRAF, and TP53) and the expression levels of specific microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. Furthermore, the assessment of immune-related biomarkers, such as PD-L1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, has provided valuable insights into the tumor immune microenvironment and its prognostic significance.

This review critically examines the current evidence on prognostic biomarkers in CRC, highlighting the strengths and limitations of various methodologies. We discuss the clinical utility of IHC and molecular biology techniques in identifying patients at high risk of recurrence or metastasis and explore the potential for integrating multiple biomarkers to enhance prognostic accuracy. Additionally, we address the challenges associated with biomarker validation and the need for standardized protocols to ensure reproducibility across studies.

In conclusion, the development and validation of prognostic biomarkers for CRC have the potential to significantly impact clinical practice, enabling personalized treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of emerging technologies, such as single-cell analysis and liquid biopsy, is expected to further refine our understanding of CRC biology and identify novel prognostic indicators. By synthesizing current knowledge and highlighting future directions, this review aims to contribute to the ongoing efforts to improve the management of CRC through the application of precision medicine.
