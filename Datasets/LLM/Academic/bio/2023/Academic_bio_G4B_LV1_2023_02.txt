**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating the development of robust prognostic biomarkers to guide therapeutic decisions and personalize patient management. This review synthesizes recent advances in identifying and validating biomarkers for predicting disease progression and patient survival within the context of CRC. We explore the evolving landscape beyond traditional histological features, focusing on the integration of molecular biology and immunohistochemical approaches. Specifically, we examine the utility of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, as potential indicators of tumor aggressiveness and response to treatment. 

Furthermore, we assess the role of epigenetic modifications – reflecting altered DNA methylation and histone modifications – as novel targets for biomarker discovery.  The investigation into circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and its application in early detection and monitoring of minimal residual disease is also addressed.  Integrating multi-omic data – encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics – holds considerable promise for refining prognostic stratification.  Ultimately, this review underscores the need for a multi-faceted biomarker strategy, leveraging both established and emerging technologies, to improve CRC patient outcomes and advance precision oncology in 2023 and beyond.
