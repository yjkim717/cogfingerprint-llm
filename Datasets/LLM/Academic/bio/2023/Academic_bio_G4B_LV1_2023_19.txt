**Abstract:**

Understanding dynamic cellular signaling pathways necessitates precise characterization of protein conformational changes within their native microenvironment. This study employs in situ Raman spectroscopy to probe the transient structural alterations of a novel metalloprotein, designated MPT-α, during a simulated oxidative stress response.  We hypothesize that conformational shifts within MPT-α’s active site, critical for reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, are intimately linked to catalytic mechanism variations.  Preliminary in situ Raman measurements reveal significant surface reconstruction events – characterized by shifts in vibrational modes – correlating with the initial uptake of hydrogen peroxide.  These observations suggest a feedback loop whereby altered protein structure directly impacts ROS binding affinity. Further analysis will focus on elucidating the specific amino acid residues driving these dynamic changes and their contribution to overall signaling efficiency, informing future therapeutic design strategies.
