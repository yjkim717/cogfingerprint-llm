Title: Elucidating Heterogeneous Anomalous Transport in Cellular Systems: A Microrheological Perspective

Abstract:
The intricate dynamics of cellular and molecular biology are characterized by heterogeneous anomalous transport, wherein particles exhibit non-Brownian motion due to the complex intracellular environment. Recent advances in microrheology have enabled researchers to probe the mechanical properties of cells and elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving anomalous transport. This review synthesizes recent experimental and theoretical findings, highlighting the role of microrheological techniques in understanding the heterogeneous transport of particles within cells. We discuss the application of single-particle tracking and ensemble-averaged measurements to quantify anomalous diffusion, as well as the development of theoretical models incorporating viscoelasticity and non-equilibrium fluctuations. By integrating these approaches, we provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between cellular structure and transport dynamics, shedding light on the mechanisms governing cellular behavior in 2023. Our analysis underscores the significance of microrheology in unraveling the intricacies of cellular biology.
