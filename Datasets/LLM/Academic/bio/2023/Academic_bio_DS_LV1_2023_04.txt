**Title:** Evaluating the Efficacy of Direct Observation of Practical Skills (DOPS) as a Formative Assessment Tool in Postgraduate Molecular Biology Training

**Abstract**

The transition from theoretical knowledge to proficient practical execution is a critical juncture in postgraduate scientific education, particularly in technique-intensive disciplines such as molecular biology. While traditional summative assessments (e.g., written examinations, thesis defenses) evaluate cumulative knowledge, they often fail to provide timely, actionable feedback on core laboratory competencies. This gap underscores the need for robust workplace-based assessment (WBA) tools that foster skill acquisition through formative feedback. This study investigates the implementation and efficacy of Direct Observation of Practical Skills (DOPS), a structured WBA modality, within a postgraduate molecular biology training program.

Over a 12-month period in 2023, we conducted a mixed-methods prospective cohort study involving 45 postgraduate trainees and 15 faculty assessors at a major research university. Participants engaged in a series of DOPS assessments targeting fundamental yet complex procedures, including CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) optimization, and next-generation sequencing (NGS) library preparation. Each DOPS session involved direct, real-time observation of a trainee performing a defined protocol, followed by immediate, structured feedback against a standardized rubric assessing domains such as aseptic technique, instrumentation proficiency, troubleshooting acumen, data interpretation, and safety compliance.

Quantitative analysis of pre- and post-intervention self-efficacy scores, measured via a 5-point Likert scale, revealed a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) in trainee confidence across all assessed procedural domains. Qualitative data, derived from semi-structured interviews and open-response surveys, were analyzed using thematic analysis. The findings strongly indicated that DOPS was perceived as a highly effective formative tool. Trainees reported that the immediate, specific feedback was instrumental in rectifying technical errors and reinforcing best practices, thereby accelerating their technical maturation. Faculty concurred, noting enhanced observational skills and a more structured framework for mentoring.

However, a principal emergent challenge, consistently identified by both cohorts, was the significant time investment required for the observation and feedback cycle, often conflicting with research productivity pressures. Despite this constraint, the consensus was that the formative benefits—improved technical accuracy, reduced experimental repetition, and enhanced scientific rigor—outweighed the logistical drawbacks. We conclude that the integration of DOPS into postgraduate molecular biology curricula provides a powerful mechanism for standardizing practical skill assessment and promoting a culture of continuous improvement. Future work should focus on developing streamlined DOPS formats and exploring hybrid digital platforms to mitigate time constraints while preserving the core benefits of direct observational assessment.
