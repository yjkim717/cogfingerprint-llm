**Abstract**

The rapid expansion of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) (HPAI) during the latter half of 2023 represents a significant concern for global zoonotic surveillance.  Observations across Europe and the Americas revealed extensive HPAI A(H5N1) outbreaks within gull populations, suggesting a critical role for these scavenging birds as amplification hosts.  This geographic dispersion, coupled with elevated viral loads in gull tissues, raises escalating concerns regarding the zoonotic potential of the virus.  While human case numbers remain limited to date, the demonstrated capacity for avian-to-human transmission necessitates continuous and proactive risk assessments.  Further investigation into the specific viral subtypes circulating within gull populations, alongside detailed epidemiological monitoring, is paramount.  Understanding the mechanisms driving viral adaptation and spread within migratory gull flocks will be crucial in informing targeted public health interventions and mitigating future zoonotic events associated with HPAI A(H5N1).
