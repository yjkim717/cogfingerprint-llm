Title: Evaluating the Efficacy of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) as a Formative Assessment Tool in Postgraduate Obstetrics and Gynecology Training: A Prospective Study

Abstract:

The acquisition of procedural skills is a critical component of postgraduate training in obstetrics and gynecology. Ensuring that trainees possess the requisite competencies necessitates effective assessment tools. The Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) has emerged as a formative assessment method, providing immediate feedback to trainees on their technical skills. This prospective study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of DOPS in assessing the procedural skills of postgraduate students in obstetrics and gynecology.

Conducted over a period of 12 months (January 2023 to December 2023), this study involved 50 postgraduate trainees in obstetrics and gynecology at various stages of their training. A total of 200 DOPS assessments were conducted across a range of procedural skills, including obstetric ultrasound, assisted vaginal delivery, and gynecological laparoscopy. The assessments were performed by trained faculty members using a standardized DOPS proforma, which evaluated the trainees' performance across several domains, including preparation, technical skill, and post-procedure care.

The results of the study demonstrated a significant improvement in the procedural skills of the trainees over the study period, as evidenced by an increase in the mean DOPS scores from 64.2 (±10.5) at the initial assessment to 82.5 (±8.2) at the final assessment (p < 0.001). Moreover, the study found a strong positive correlation between the DOPS scores and the trainees' self-assessment of their procedural competence (r = 0.85, p < 0.01). Feedback from both trainees and faculty members indicated a high level of satisfaction with the DOPS assessment process, citing its ability to provide constructive feedback and identify areas for improvement.

The findings of this study support the use of DOPS as a formative assessment tool in postgraduate obstetrics and gynecology training. By providing regular, structured feedback, DOPS enables trainees to refine their procedural skills and develop the competencies required for independent practice. The study's results have implications for the design of postgraduate training programs, highlighting the importance of incorporating DOPS and other formative assessment tools to ensure that trainees are adequately prepared for clinical practice. As the medical education landscape continues to evolve, the integration of DOPS into training programs is likely to play an increasingly important role in shaping the next generation of obstetricians and gynecologists.
