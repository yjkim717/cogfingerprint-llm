Title: Elucidating the Role of Lignin-Modifying Enzymes in Lignin Degradation by Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Gene Disruption

Abstract:
White-rot fungi, such as Pleurotus ostreatus, are renowned for their ability to degrade lignin, a complex polymer integral to plant cell walls. Lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs) are hypothesized to play a crucial role in this process. This study (2023) employs the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to disrupt LME-encoding genes in P. ostreatus, thereby investigating their involvement in lignin degradation. Our results demonstrate that targeted disruption of key LME genes significantly impairs the fungus's ability to break down lignin, underscoring the essential role of these enzymes in this process. This research not only enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning lignin degradation but also highlights the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in elucidating the genetic basis of complex fungal phenotypes. The findings have significant implications for the development of novel biotechnological applications in biomass conversion and bioremediation.
