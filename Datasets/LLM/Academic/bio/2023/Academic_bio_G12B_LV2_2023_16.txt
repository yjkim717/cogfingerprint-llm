**Abstract**

Lignin, a complex phenylpropanoid polymer constituting a significant proportion of plant biomass, presents a substantial recalcitrance to degradation, hindering efficient utilization of lignocellulosic feedstocks. White-rot fungi (WRF), notably *Pleurotus ostreatus*, are recognized for their capacity to depolymerize lignin through the action of lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs). While the involvement of LMEs in lignin degradation is established, a deeper mechanistic understanding of the specific enzymatic contributions remains crucial for optimizing bioprocesses. This study investigates the role of manganese peroxidases (MnPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs) in the natural lignin degradation capabilities of *P. ostreatus*. Through a combination of enzymatic assays and targeted analyses of degradation products, we demonstrate a direct and essential correlation between the activity of MnPs and VPs and the effective breakdown of natural lignin derived from softwood. Our findings provide robust experimental evidence confirming the pivotal role of these LMEs in the overall lignin degradation pathway employed by *P. ostreatus*. Furthermore, the study highlights the potential for leveraging this understanding to enhance ligninolytic activity in fungal bioreactors.  Future research directions include exploring the synergistic effects of multiple LMEs and investigating the potential for employing CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing techniques to selectively manipulate LME expression within *P. ostreatus* strains, ultimately aiming to improve the efficiency and specificity of lignin bioconversion processes for sustainable biofuel and biomaterial production. This research contributes to the growing body of knowledge surrounding fungal lignin degradation and offers valuable insights for the development of bio-based solutions for renewable resource utilization.
