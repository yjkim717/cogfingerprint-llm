Title: Unveiling Alzheimer's Disease Heterogeneity through Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomics: A Pathway to Personalized Medicine

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by significant heterogeneity in clinical presentation and progression. A 2023 large-scale proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed five distinct molecular subtypes of AD, each associated with unique genetic risk profiles and clinical outcomes. This stratification underscores the potential of CSF proteomics to elucidate AD's molecular underpinnings. By identifying subtype-specific biomarkers, this study paves the way for tailored therapeutic strategies, advancing the paradigm of personalized medicine in AD management and treatment.
