Title: Elucidating Anomalous Transport in Cellular and Molecular Biology: A Review of Recent Advances

Abstract:
The intricate dynamics of cellular and molecular biology are characterized by heterogeneous environments that give rise to anomalous transport phenomena. Recent years have witnessed significant progress in understanding the complex mechanisms underlying these non-diffusive processes. This review synthesizes current knowledge on anomalous transport in biological systems, with a focus on microrheological approaches that probe the mechanical properties of cells and their constituents. We examine the role of heterogeneous diffusion in various biological contexts, including intracellular transport, protein dynamics, and cellular response to external stimuli. By integrating theoretical models and experimental findings, we provide a comprehensive overview of the field, highlighting key challenges and opportunities for future research. Our analysis underscores the importance of anomalous transport in shaping biological function and dysfunction, and discusses the implications for our understanding of complex biological systems in the context of 2023 research.
