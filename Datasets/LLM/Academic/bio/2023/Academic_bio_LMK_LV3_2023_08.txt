Title: Leveraging UCSC Xena for Comprehensive Cancer Genomics Analysis: A Multi-Omic Approach

Abstract:

The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized the field of cancer genomics, yielding vast amounts of multi-omic data that underscore the complex molecular landscapes of various cancers. Effective analysis and interpretation of these data are crucial for deciphering the underlying mechanisms of tumorigenesis and identifying potential therapeutic targets. In this context, the UCSC Xena platform emerges as a powerful web-based visualization tool, facilitating the integration and analysis of diverse cancer genomics datasets. As of 2023, UCSC Xena has become an indispensable resource for researchers, offering an extensive repository of multi-omic data, including genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiles, across numerous cancer types.

By harnessing the capabilities of UCSC Xena, researchers can perform comprehensive analyses, ranging from differential gene expression and mutation analysis to Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, thereby uncovering novel insights into cancer biology. The platform's intuitive interface and robust analytical tools enable the seamless exploration of complex data, fostering a deeper understanding of the molecular alterations driving cancer progression. Furthermore, the integration of multi-omic data within UCSC Xena facilitates the identification of putative biomarkers and therapeutic targets, accelerating the translation of basic research findings into clinical applications. This abstract highlights the utility of UCSC Xena in advancing cancer genomics research, underscoring its potential to inform precision oncology initiatives and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
