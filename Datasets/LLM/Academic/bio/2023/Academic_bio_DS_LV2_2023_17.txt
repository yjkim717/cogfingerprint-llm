**Title:** Evaluating the Efficacy of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) as a Formative Assessment Modality in Postgraduate Obstetrics and Gynecology Training: A 2023 Analysis

**Abstract**

The paradigm of postgraduate medical education is progressively shifting from summative, high-stakes examinations towards integrated, workplace-based formative assessments that facilitate continuous professional development. Within the specialized domain of Obstetrics and Gynecology (OB/GYN), a discipline demanding a high degree of technical proficiency and clinical judgment, the implementation of robust, real-time evaluation tools is paramount for ensuring competency. This study critically evaluates the application and perceived efficacy of the Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) as a formative assessment instrument within a contemporary OB/GYN residency program. DOPS entails an expert evaluator, typically a senior consultant, directly observing a trainee perform a defined clinical procedure—such as a normal vaginal delivery, cervical cerclage, or diagnostic hysteroscopy—and providing immediate, structured feedback.

Our methodological approach involved a longitudinal, mixed-methods analysis conducted throughout the 2023 academic year. Quantitative data were gathered from DOPS assessment forms completed following 347 discrete procedural observations across a cohort of 42 postgraduate trainees. Concurrently, qualitative data were procured via semi-structured interviews with both trainees (n=42) and faculty evaluators (n=18) to capture nuanced perceptions of the tool's utility and implementation challenges. The quantitative results demonstrated a statistically significant correlation (p < 0.01) between repeated DOPS engagements and improved performance scores across key competency domains, including procedural knowledge, technical skill, aseptic technique, and communication with patients and staff. Qualitatively, thematic analysis revealed a strong consensus among trainees that the immediate, specific feedback inherent to the DOPS process was instrumental in identifying and rectifying technical deficiencies, thereby enhancing their operative confidence and clinical autonomy.

However, the analysis also identified a critical and pervasive barrier to optimal implementation: significant time constraints. Faculty members frequently cited the challenge of integrating sustained, uninterrupted observation sessions into demanding clinical schedules, which occasionally led to rushed assessments or scheduling delays. This logistical limitation underscores a tension between the pedagogical ideal of formative assessment and the practical realities of a high-volume clinical environment. In conclusion, while the DOPS framework is validated as a highly effective formative tool for cultivating procedural competency in OB/GYN postgraduate training, its full potential is contingent upon systemic support. We posit that maximizing the utility of DOPS requires deliberate institutional strategies, such as protected non-clinical time for faculty evaluators and the integration of structured DOPS sessions into formal training rotations, to mitigate time-related impediments and fully realize its benefits in shaping the next generation of proficient obstetrician-gynecologists.
