**Abstract**

The enzymatic degradation of lignin, a recalcitrant component of plant cell walls, represents a critical challenge in sustainable biomass utilization. Recent investigations utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing have identified key enzymatic pathways employed by *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a prominent white-rot fungus, for effective lignin depolymerization. Specifically, this study demonstrates the indispensable roles of manganese peroxidases (MnPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs) in mediating this process.  Gene editing experiments confirmed that inactivation of *MnP* and *VP* genes significantly impaired the fungus’s ability to effectively modify lignin.  These findings suggest that MnPs and VPs function synergistically, potentially through the generation of reactive oxygen species, to initiate lignin breakdown.  Further research exploring the regulatory mechanisms governing these laccase-like enzymes and their interaction with lignin is warranted, offering promising avenues for bioengineering enhanced ligninolytic capabilities in fungal systems.
