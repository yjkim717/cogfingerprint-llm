**Abstract**

The 2022-2023 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b has represented an unprecedented phase in the virus's ecology within Europe. This study provides a consolidated epidemiological analysis of the outbreak's progression from December 2022 to March 2023, documenting a significant geographical expansion and a notable shift in host tropism. While the epizootic initially maintained its established pattern of severe mortality in wild waterfowl and colonial sea birds, surveillance data revealed an alarming and sustained increase in infections within gull populations (Laridae), a family previously considered less susceptible. This shift in avian reservoir dynamics has critical implications for viral persistence and dissemination, particularly in peri-urban and coastal environments where gulls interface closely with anthropogenic activity. Concurrently, the period was marked by an escalation in mass mortality events in mammalian scavengers, including foxes and seals, linked to spillover infections from predating or scavenging infected bird carcasses. These mammalian cases, while currently constituting dead-end transmission events, necessitate intensive genomic surveillance to monitor for potential adaptive mutations that could enhance mammalian airway receptor binding. Crucially, despite this increased viral burden across a widened host range, the overall zoonotic risk assessment for the general human population remains low. The absence of sustained human-to-human transmission and the lack of genetic markers associated with increased transmissibility in mammalian models support this conclusion. However, the heightened circulation in gulls elevates the risk of incursions into the poultry sector, underscoring the imperative for enhanced biosecurity protocols. Our findings highlight the rapidly evolving landscape of HPAI H5N1, emphasizing the need for integrated, One Health-oriented surveillance strategies that encompass wild birds, mammals, and domestic animals to monitor the virus's zoonotic potential effectively.
