**Abstract**

The effective training of procedural skills remains a critical challenge within obstetrics and gynecology residency programs globally. This study investigates the utility of direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) as a formative assessment modality, specifically within the context of postgraduate training in India. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we assessed perceptions of DOPS implementation among both trainees and supervising faculty at a major tertiary care hospital in [Specify Region, India – e.g., North India] during the period January – December 2023. Quantitative data, gathered via pre- and post-intervention surveys, revealed a statistically significant increase in confidence levels among trainees following the introduction of DOPS. Qualitative feedback indicated a widespread appreciation for the tool’s capacity to provide immediate, actionable feedback, fostering a culture of deliberate practice. 

Faculty reported valuing DOPS’s ability to objectively evaluate skill acquisition and tailor instructional strategies. The study highlights the potential of DOPS to augment traditional assessment methods, promoting enhanced skill development and improved patient safety outcomes. Further research is warranted to explore the scalability and long-term impact of DOPS implementation across diverse obstetrics and gynecology training settings within India and potentially, other resource-limited environments.
