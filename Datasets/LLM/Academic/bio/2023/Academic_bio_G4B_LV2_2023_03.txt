**Abstract**

Lignin, a complex polymer prevalent in plant cell walls, presents a significant barrier to the effective decomposition of lignocellulosic biomass, hindering biofuel production and soil carbon cycling. This study investigates the enzymatic mechanisms underpinning lignin degradation by *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a white-rot fungus extensively utilized in biotechnological applications. Utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we identified and characterized the roles of manganese peroxidases (MnPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs) in mediating lignin modification.  Our findings reveal that these extracellular enzymes are not merely involved in initial lignin solubilization, but critically contribute to a cascade of structural alterations, effectively dismantling the recalcitrant lignin matrix.  Specifically, targeted enzyme disruption demonstrated a marked reduction in ligninolytic activity and subsequent decreased biomass digestibility.  These results underscore the pivotal role of MnPs and VPs within *P. ostreatus* in orchestrating comprehensive lignin degradation.  Further research utilizing comparative genomics and proteomics will refine our understanding of the synergistic interactions between these enzymes and facilitate the rational engineering of fungal strains for enhanced ligninolytic capacity, ultimately advancing sustainable biomass utilization strategies.
