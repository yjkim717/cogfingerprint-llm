**Abstract**

The integration of robust formative assessment strategies is increasingly recognized as critical for optimizing postgraduate training within specialized clinical disciplines. This study investigated the effectiveness of direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) as a formative assessment tool specifically within obstetrics and gynecology (OBGY) postgraduate education.  A mixed-methods approach was employed to evaluate perceptions and preliminary impacts following the implementation of a DOPS program designed to supplement traditional evaluation methods. 

Data collection included post-training surveys administered to both OBGY residents and supervising faculty, alongside a qualitative analysis of observational feedback forms completed during DOPS sessions.  Preliminary findings suggest a significantly positive reception to DOPS, with respondents reporting increased confidence in skill acquisition and a heightened awareness of procedural nuances. Specifically, participants indicated that DOPS fostered a more reflective learning environment, facilitating targeted feedback and promoting iterative skill refinement. 

The observed implementation of DOPS appeared to align strongly with established principles of formative assessment – providing timely, specific, and actionable guidance.  Furthermore, the structured nature of DOPS data collection facilitated workplace-based assessment, offering a standardized approach to evaluating procedural competency.  While this study represents an initial exploration, the results support the potential of DOPS to enhance postgraduate training in OBGY by directly observing and documenting the development of critical procedural skills. Future research should focus on longitudinal assessment of skill retention and integration of DOPS into broader curriculum design, alongside a quantitative evaluation of skill performance outcomes.
