**Abstract**

The 2022-2023 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b has presented an unprecedented scale of viral circulation within the European avifauna, prompting a critical reassessment of its ecological and zoonotic dynamics. This study synthesizes surveillance data from December 2022 to March 2023 to characterize the shifting epidemiological landscape. We document a significant geographical and host-range expansion, with widespread spillover into terrestrial and marine mammals, indicating an enhanced potential for cross-class transmission. A pivotal development during this period was the pronounced escalation of A(H5N1) detections within gull populations (Laridae), a demographic previously considered less susceptible. This shift towards synanthropic species, which interface extensively with both wild bird reservoirs and human habitats, represents a substantial alteration in the virus's ecological niche. The increased viral load in coastal and urban environments heightens the risk of exposure for scavenging mammals and, potentially, human populations. However, genomic surveillance and risk assessment analyses concurrently indicate that the virus has not acquired molecular markers associated with efficient human-to-human transmission. Consequently, despite the expanded mammalian host range and the concerning mortality events observed in both wild birds and mammals, the overall risk to human health remains classified as low for the general public. These findings underscore the necessity for intensified, targeted surveillance of bridge species like gulls and of mammalian cases to monitor for adaptive mutations that could alter the virus's pandemic potential. This evolving scenario highlights the imperative for a One Health approach to mitigate the ongoing threat of this panzootic HPAI virus.
