**Abstract**

The integration of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) within postgraduate training programs represents a critical area of investigation in contemporary medical education. This study examines the feasibility and perceived impact of implementing DOPS as a formative assessment strategy in obstetrics and gynecology (O&G) residency programs in India, a context characterized by unique resource limitations and training demands. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we assessed the perceptions of both resident physicians and faculty members regarding the utility of DOPS in facilitating skill acquisition and professional development. Findings indicate predominantly positive attitudes towards DOPS, with participants reporting enhanced self-awareness of procedural competence, targeted feedback opportunities, and potential for improved patient safety outcomes. However, logistical challenges, primarily related to the allocation of protected time for observations and standardized assessment, were consistently identified as barriers to widespread and consistent implementation. These results underscore the promise of DOPS as a valuable formative assessment tool within O&G postgraduate training, while highlighting the necessity for institutional strategies to mitigate time constraints and ensure sustainable integration. Further research should focus on quantifying the impact of DOPS on objective measures of procedural skill and patient outcomes within the Indian healthcare system.
