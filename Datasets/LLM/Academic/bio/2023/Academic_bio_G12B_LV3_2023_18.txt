**Abstract:**

The period between December 2022 and March 2023 witnessed a significant geographic expansion and altered epidemiological pattern of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) across Europe and the Americas. This report synthesizes surveillance data to characterize this recent surge, focusing on the unprecedented prevalence of HPAI A(H5N1) in wild bird populations, particularly within seabird colonies. Historically, HPAI primarily impacted domestic poultry; however, the observed widespread circulation in wild birds, including migratory species, suggests a broadened reservoir and potential for long-distance viral dissemination.  Genetic analysis indicates the continued dominance of specific Eurasian H5N1 lineages, contributing to the virus's heightened pathogenicity and transmissibility.  Crucially, this expansion raises concerns regarding the zoonotic potential of HPAI A(H5N1). While human infections remain limited, the increased exposure risk to both poultry workers and individuals in close proximity to wild bird habitats necessitates enhanced surveillance and risk mitigation strategies.  The documented co-infections of wild birds with other avian viruses warrant further investigation to assess the possibility of reassortment events and the emergence of novel viral variants. This report underscores the urgent need for international collaboration in avian influenza monitoring, predictive modeling of viral spread, and the development of effective interventions to protect both animal and human health in the face of this evolving threat.
