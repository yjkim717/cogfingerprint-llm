**Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) as a Formative Assessment Strategy in Obstetrics and Gynecology Postgraduate Training: A Mixed-Methods Exploration of Perceived Impact and Implementation Challenges**

**Abstract**

The acquisition of competent procedural skills is paramount in Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGY) postgraduate training, yet traditional assessment methods often fail to adequately capture the nuances of technical proficiency and clinical judgment in real-time. This study investigates the feasibility and perceived effectiveness of Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS) – a structured formative assessment approach – within an OBGY residency program. Utilizing a mixed-methods design, we sought to evaluate both the impact of DOPS on resident learning and the challenges associated with its implementation in a demanding clinical environment. Quantitative data were collected via pre- and post-intervention surveys (n=32 residents, 18 faculty) assessing perceptions of procedural skill confidence, preparedness for independent practice, and the utility of feedback received. Qualitative data were gathered through semi-structured interviews with a subset of residents (n=10) and faculty (n=8) to explore experiences with the DOPS process, identify perceived benefits, and uncover barriers to consistent application.

Results indicate a statistically significant increase in resident-reported confidence in performing key OBGY procedures following the introduction of DOPS (p<0.01), with a demonstrable improvement in self-assessed procedural skill competency. Faculty participants consistently endorsed the value of DOPS for providing targeted feedback and identifying areas requiring focused remediation. However, qualitative analysis revealed several implementation challenges, including time constraints within busy clinical schedules, concerns regarding observer subjectivity and potential bias, and a need for standardized DOPS checklists and training for both residents and faculty. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of cultivating a culture of constructive feedback and psychological safety to maximize the learning potential of DOPS.

These findings suggest that while DOPS represents a promising formative assessment tool for OBGY postgraduate training, successful integration requires careful consideration of logistical constraints and a concerted effort to address potential biases. Future research should focus on developing validated DOPS checklists aligned with competency-based training frameworks, exploring the impact of DOPS on patient outcomes, and investigating strategies to optimize faculty training in effective observational feedback. The results contribute to the growing body of literature advocating for enhanced formative assessment practices within medical education, emphasizing the need for adaptable and context-specific approaches to skill development.
