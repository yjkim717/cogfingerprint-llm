**Abstract**

The recalcitrant nature of lignin presents a significant obstacle to efficient biomass utilization and the development of sustainable biofuel production.  *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom) represents a promising fungal model for investigating ligninolytic pathways. This research investigates the role of specific enzymatic mechanisms in lignin degradation by *P. ostreatus*, focusing on manganese peroxidases (MnP) and versatile peroxidases (VP).  Transcriptomic analysis, coupled with enzymatic assays, revealed a strong correlation between the expression of MnP and VP genes and the extent of lignin depolymerization within fungal cultures.  Furthermore, targeted disruption of MnP and VP genes via CRISPR/Cas9 technology demonstrated a marked reduction in ligninolytic activity, confirming their pivotal roles in this process.  These findings highlight the coordinated action of these extracellular enzymes in initiating lignin breakdown, suggesting a refined understanding of fungal lignin degradation strategies.  Future research will explore the synergistic interactions between these enzymes and investigate the potential for engineered fungal strains with enhanced ligninolytic capacity.
