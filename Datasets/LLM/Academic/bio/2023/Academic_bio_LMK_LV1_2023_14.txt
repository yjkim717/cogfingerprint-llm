Title: Elucidating Heterogeneous Anomalous Transport in Cellular Systems: A Microrheological Perspective

Abstract:
The intricate dynamics of cellular and molecular biology are characterized by heterogeneous anomalous transport phenomena, which deviate from traditional Brownian motion. Recent advances in microrheological techniques have enabled the quantification of these complex transport behaviors, shedding light on the underlying biophysical mechanisms. This review synthesizes current understanding of anomalous transport in cellular systems, with a focus on the experimental and theoretical frameworks that underpin this field. We examine the role of microrheology in probing the viscoelastic properties of cellular environments and discuss the implications of heterogeneous transport for cellular function and regulation. By integrating insights from biophysics, cell biology, and statistical mechanics, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting key challenges and opportunities for future research in 2023 and beyond.
