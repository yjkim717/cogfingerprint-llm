**Abstract**

The phenomenon of anomalous transport, characterized by a nonlinear relationship between the mean-square displacement of particles and time (MSD ~ t^α, α ≠ 1), is a fundamental signature of the complex, heterogeneous environment within living cells. While Fickian diffusion adequately describes transport in simple, homogeneous media, its assumptions break down in the crowded, viscoelastic, and structured intracellular milieu. This review synthesizes recent advances from 2020-2023 in characterizing and modeling heterogeneous anomalous transport across cellular and molecular biology. We first critically evaluate state-of-the-art experimental methodologies, including single-particle tracking (SPT) with advanced statistical analysis, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and super-resolution techniques, which collectively reveal the prevalence of non-Gaussian displacement distributions and spatially varying diffusion coefficients. Theoretically, we dissect the transition from continuous-time random walks (CTRW) and fractional Brownian motion (fBm) to more sophisticated multi-component models that decouple spatial disorder from temporal memory effects. We then explore key biological applications, demonstrating how anomalous transport governs the search dynamics of transcription factors on chromatin, the delivery of vesicles in the cytoplasm, and the aggregation of proteins in neurodegenerative pathologies. By integrating experimental data with bespoke theoretical frameworks, this review underscores that moving beyond ensemble-averaged descriptions to embrace dynamical heterogeneity is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of cellular function, with profound implications for drug delivery and the study of disease states.
