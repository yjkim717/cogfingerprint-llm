**Abstract**

Recent advancements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics have illuminated heterogeneous disease presentations within Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study leveraged a large-scale, multi-center CSF proteomic analysis to delineate five distinct molecular subtypes of AD, characterized by divergent biomarker profiles. Notably, each subtype exhibited a unique correlation with established genetic risk scores, indicating a nuanced interplay between genetic predisposition and pathological processes. Furthermore, clinical outcomes – including cognitive decline and biomarker progression – demonstrated significant stratification across these subtypes. These findings strongly suggest that a “one-size-fits-all” therapeutic strategy for AD is insufficient. Instead, identifying and targeting these molecular subtypes based on their specific biomarker signatures holds considerable promise for facilitating personalized treatment interventions and ultimately improving patient prognosis. Future research should focus on validating these subtypes and exploring their predictive utility for clinical trial enrollment.
