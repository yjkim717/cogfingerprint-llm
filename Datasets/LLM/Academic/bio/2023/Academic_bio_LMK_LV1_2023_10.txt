Title: Accelerating Quantitative Proteomics: An Efficient Data-Independent Acquisition Analysis Pipeline Utilizing MSFragger-DIA and FragPipe

Abstract:
Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful tool for quantitative proteomics, offering comprehensive and reproducible protein profiling. However, the complexity of DIA data poses significant computational challenges. To address this, we present an optimized analysis pipeline leveraging MSFragger-DIA and FragPipe, which synergizes the strengths of both tools to achieve rapid and sensitive DIA data analysis. By integrating the robust search capabilities of MSFragger-DIA with the streamlined workflow of FragPipe, our approach enables efficient protein identification and quantification. Benchmarking experiments demonstrate that this pipeline outperforms existing methods in terms of speed and sensitivity, facilitating the analysis of large-scale DIA datasets. The proposed pipeline is readily accessible and adaptable, making it an attractive solution for researchers seeking to accelerate their quantitative proteomics workflows. As demonstrated in our evaluation, this integrated approach has the potential to significantly advance the field of proteomics research in 2023 and beyond.
