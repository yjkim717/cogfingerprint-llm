**Abstract: Enhancing Obstetrical Skill Acquisition Through Direct Observation: A Formative Assessment Approach in Postgraduate Training**

The consistent and accurate performance of fundamental obstetrical procedures is paramount to ensuring patient safety and optimal maternal-fetal outcomes. This study investigated the utility of direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) as a formative assessment strategy within postgraduate training programs in obstetrics and gynecology (OBGY) in India. Recognizing the limitations of traditional evaluation methods, we hypothesized that DOPS, implemented as a structured feedback mechanism, would positively influence the acquisition of procedural competence. 

A mixed-methods approach was employed, utilizing standardized observation checklists alongside qualitative data gathered through postgraduate student reflective accounts. Data collection occurred across a six-month period, focusing on core OBGY procedures including vaginal examinations, fetal heart rate monitoring, and induction of labor. Findings demonstrate a significant correlation between the frequency of DOPS sessions and demonstrable improvements in procedural accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, student feedback indicated a heightened awareness of performance strengths and areas requiring targeted development.  

These results support the integration of DOPS as a valuable component of formative assessment, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and ultimately contributing to the elevation of clinical standards within OBGY postgraduate curricula. Future research should explore the optimal design of DOPS protocols and their impact on long-term clinical performance.
