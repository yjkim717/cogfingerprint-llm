Title: Unveiling Cellular Metabolic Heterogeneity through Integrated Single-Cell Spatial Metabolomics and Protein Profiling

Abstract:
The intricate interplay between cellular metabolism and protein expression underlies tissue homeostasis and disease progression. Here, we introduce the scSpaMet framework, a cutting-edge approach that enables simultaneous protein and metabolite profiling at the single-cell level in human tissues. By integrating spatial metabolomics and protein profiling, scSpaMet reveals cell-type-specific metabolic signatures and local metabolite competition, providing unprecedented insights into tissue systems biology. Our analysis demonstrates that scSpaMet can identify distinct metabolic patterns associated with cancer metabolism, shedding light on the complex interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment. By elucidating the metabolic heterogeneity of human tissues at the single-cell level, this innovative framework has far-reaching implications for our understanding of cancer biology and the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.
