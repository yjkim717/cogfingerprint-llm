Here we introduce scSpaMet, an integrated analytical framework that advances spatial systems biology by coupling single-cell metabolomics with multiplexed protein imaging in human tissue specimens. Our methodology enables simultaneous mapping of over 100 metabolites alongside 40 protein markers at subcellular resolution, revealing previously inaccessible metabolic heterogeneity across tissue microenvironments. Through systematic analysis of colorectal cancer and healthy colon tissues, we demonstrate that scSpaMet identifies distinct metabolic reprogramming patterns across epithelial, immune, and stromal cell populations. Crucially, we uncover local metabolite competition between adjacent cell types that drives spatial organization of metabolic niches. Validation experiments confirm that these metabolic patterns correlate with functional protein expression gradients and cellular activation states. This integrated approach provides unprecedented insight into how metabolic networks are spatially organized at cellular resolution, establishing a new paradigm for investigating metabolic dysregulation in human diseases. Our findings position spatial metabolomics as an essential component of next-generation tissue systems biology, with broad applications across developmental biology, immunology, and oncology research.
