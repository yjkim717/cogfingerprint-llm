**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cancer genomics necessitates robust methods for interrogating complex biological data. This study highlights the utility of the UCSC Xena platform in streamlining the analysis and interpretation of multi-omic datasets within oncology research. Xena’s web-based interface enables the visualization of integrated genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data, incorporating valuable clinical annotations to facilitate targeted investigation. Specifically, we demonstrate Xena’s capacity to support differential gene expression analyses, identifying key regulatory pathways altered in diverse cancer subtypes. Furthermore, the platform’s capacity to incorporate survival analysis data allows for the assessment of prognostic biomarkers and the prediction of patient outcomes.  By providing a unified visualization environment, UCSC Xena reduces the analytical bottleneck associated with managing heterogeneous data, fostering collaborative research and accelerating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets.  Continued development of Xena’s analytical capabilities promises to further enhance its role in precision oncology by enabling more sophisticated data-driven insights in 2023 and beyond.
