This study presents a novel 30-meter resolution dataset of bioclimatic variables characterizing forest microclimates across Europe. By integrating satellite-derived land surface temperature with LiDAR-based canopy structure metrics, we generated high-resolution grids of near-ground air temperature and vapor pressure deficit. These data significantly refine the accuracy of species distribution models, as demonstrated for 12 tree species. Our findings reveal that incorporating microclimate heterogeneity resolves critical scaling mismatches in continental-scale ecological forecasts, providing an essential tool for predicting biodiversity responses to climate change.
