We present ForestClim, a novel high-resolution dataset of microclimate-specific bioclimatic variables for European forests. Derived from downscaled temperature grids, it addresses the critical mismatch between macroclimate data and actual forest understory thermal regimes. ForestClim enables more accurate ecological modeling of species distributions and climate change impacts by incorporating fine-scale topographic and vegetation buffering effects. This resource advances microclimate ecology by providing biologically relevant temperature metrics essential for predicting biodiversity responses across European forest ecosystems.
