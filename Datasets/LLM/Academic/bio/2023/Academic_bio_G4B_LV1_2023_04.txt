**Abstract**

The integration of robust formative assessment strategies remains a critical challenge within postgraduate training in obstetrics and gynecology. This study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of direct observation of procedural skills (DOPS) as a novel method for enhancing the development of clinical competence among trainees. A mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating quantitative data from postgraduate students’ perceptions of DOPS and qualitative feedback gathered through semi-structured interviews. The research specifically examined the utility of DOPS in providing timely and actionable feedback relative to traditional evaluation methods. 

Results indicated a generally positive reception to DOPS, with students reporting a heightened awareness of procedural nuances and a perceived improvement in skill acquisition. Notably, the observational component facilitated the identification of specific areas for targeted intervention, aligning with the principles of formative assessment. Furthermore, the study highlighted the importance of standardized observation protocols and clear communication of feedback to maximize the effectiveness of DOPS.  

These findings suggest that DOPS represents a valuable addition to the postgraduate OBGY curriculum, offering a practical means of supporting continuous professional development. Future research should explore the longitudinal impact of DOPS on procedural performance and investigate optimal implementation strategies to ensure consistent fidelity and maintain trainee engagement.  The demonstrated utility of this approach warrants consideration for broader adoption within obstetrics and gynecology training programs.
