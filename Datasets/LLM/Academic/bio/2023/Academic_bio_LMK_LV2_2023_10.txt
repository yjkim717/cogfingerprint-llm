Title: Enhanced Quantitative Proteomics via MSFragger-DIA: A Computational Platform for Efficient Data-Independent Acquisition Analysis

Abstract:
Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry has emerged as a pivotal technique in quantitative proteomics, offering comprehensive and reproducible protein quantification. However, the complexity of DIA data analysis remains a significant bottleneck. Here, we present MSFragger-DIA, a novel approach that enables fast and sensitive direct peptide identification from DIA data by leveraging fragment ion indexing. Integrated into the FragPipe computational platform, MSFragger-DIA streamlines the analysis workflow, facilitating high-throughput proteomics research. By harnessing the power of fragment ion indexing, MSFragger-DIA achieves enhanced sensitivity and specificity in peptide identification, thereby improving protein quantification accuracy. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of MSFragger-DIA in analyzing large-scale DIA datasets, underscoring its potential to advance quantitative proteomics research. The integration of MSFragger-DIA into FragPipe provides a user-friendly and efficient solution for researchers, furthering the application of DIA mass spectrometry in complex biological systems.
