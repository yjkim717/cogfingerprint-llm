**Abstract:**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, underscoring the critical need for refined prognostic tools to guide therapeutic decision-making and improve patient outcomes. This review synthesizes current literature evaluating the prognostic value of proliferative biomarkers in CRC, spanning established immunohistochemical (IHC) approaches and emerging molecular biology techniques.  Historically, markers such as Ki-67 have served as standard indicators of cell proliferation, yet their predictive accuracy remains variable, necessitating exploration of more sophisticated methodologies.  We examine the utility of proliferation-related signaling pathway components, including those involved in the MAPK and PI3K/AKT cascades, assessed through IHC and quantitative PCR, and their correlation with disease recurrence and overall survival. Furthermore, this review considers the potential of novel biomarkers reflecting distinct aspects of cell cycle regulation and DNA replication stress, such as markers of mitotic checkpoints and replication fork stability.  The integration of these biomarkers into multi-parameter assays, leveraging advances in computational pathology and molecular profiling, represents a promising avenue for enhanced prognostic stratification.  Ultimately, a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between proliferative mechanisms and CRC progression will facilitate the development of personalized treatment strategies, ultimately aiming to optimize patient survival and quality of life in the context of this prevalent malignancy. Future research should prioritize validation studies within large, prospective cohorts to establish clinical utility and refine biomarker panels.
