Title: Assessing the Zoonotic Potential of HPAI A(H5N1) Virus in Wild Birds and Poultry Production Systems

Abstract:

The ongoing global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus has raised significant concerns regarding its zoonotic potential and impact on poultry production and public health. As of 2023, the virus has been detected in wild birds across Europe and the Americas, resulting in substantial mortality and subsequent transmission to domestic poultry and mammals. This has led to considerable economic losses in the poultry industry and raised concerns about the potential for human infection. While human cases have been reported, the transmission dynamics of the virus remain poorly understood. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on the epidemiology of HPAI A(H5N1) virus in wild birds and poultry production systems, with a focus on its zoonotic potential. We examine the role of wild birds as reservoirs and potential vectors of the virus, as well as the factors contributing to its transmission to poultry and mammals. The review also discusses the implications of the virus's spread for poultry production and public health, highlighting the need for enhanced surveillance and control measures to mitigate the risks associated with HPAI A(H5N1) virus. By elucidating the complex interactions between the virus, wild birds, and poultry production systems, this review provides insights into the development of effective strategies for preventing and controlling the spread of HPAI A(H5N1) virus.
