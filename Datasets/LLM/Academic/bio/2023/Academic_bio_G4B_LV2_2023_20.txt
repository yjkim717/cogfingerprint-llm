**Abstract**

European forests represent a critical component of the continent’s biodiversity and carbon sequestration capacity. However, understanding their response to spatially variable microclimatic conditions remains a significant challenge for ecological modeling. This study presents a novel, publicly available dataset of high-resolution microclimate temperature grids for European forests, derived from bioclimatic variable analysis. Utilizing established bioclimatic indices – including solar radiation, topographic effects, and vegetation indices – we generated spatially explicit temperature maps. These microclimate variables are intended to enhance the accuracy and predictive power of ecological models simulating forest dynamics, species distribution, and carbon cycling.  The open-access nature of this resource facilitates broader research and promotes standardized approaches to assessing forest vulnerability within a changing climate.  Further validation and expansion of this dataset are planned for 2024.
