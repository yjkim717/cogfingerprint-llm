**Abstract**

Understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of enzyme catalysis often necessitates detailed, real-time characterization of the active site environment. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing spectroscopic monitoring – analogous to in situ Raman measurements – to investigate conformational changes and dynamic interactions within metalloenzyme complexes during substrate binding and catalytic turnover. We hypothesize that subtle surface rearrangements, observable through shifts in vibrational modes, correlate directly with altered catalytic efficiency.  Applying this methodology to a model copper-zinc metalloenzyme, we observed significant alterations in the coordination sphere of the metal center following substrate engagement.  These dynamic shifts, characterized via high-resolution spectroscopic analysis, provide critical insights into the catalytic mechanisms.  Further investigation into the relationship between these surface modifications and reaction kinetics is warranted, potentially revealing previously unappreciated regulatory pathways and contributing to a more holistic understanding of enzyme function within 2023.
