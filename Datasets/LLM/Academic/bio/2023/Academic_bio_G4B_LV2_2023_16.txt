**Abstract**

Lignin, a complex polymer abundant in plant cell walls, presents a significant barrier to the effective utilization of biomass for biofuel and biomaterial production.  *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom) is a well-established white-rot fungus renowned for its capacity to degrade lignin, yet the precise enzymatic mechanisms underpinning this process remain incompletely elucidated. This study investigates the critical role of lignin-modifying enzymes within *P. ostreatus* in facilitating lignin breakdown.  Specifically, we demonstrate that manganese peroxidases (MnPs) and versatile peroxidases (Vps) exhibit a synergistic and indispensable function in initiating and sustaining lignin degradation.  Employing transcriptomic analysis alongside enzymatic assays, we identified significant upregulation of MnP and Vp gene expression during fungal colonization of lignocellulosic substrates.  Further, targeted disruption of these enzymes via CRISPR/Cas9 technology revealed a marked reduction in ligninolytic activity, confirming their central importance. These findings underscore the pivotal contribution of MnPs and Vps to the white-rot fungal pathway for lignin degradation and highlight the potential for biotechnological manipulation to enhance lignin processing efficiency.
