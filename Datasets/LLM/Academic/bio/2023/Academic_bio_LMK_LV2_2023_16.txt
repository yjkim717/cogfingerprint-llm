Title: Elucidating the Role of Lignin-Modifying Enzymes in Lignin Degradation by Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Gene Editing

Abstract:

Lignin degradation is a crucial step in the carbon cycle and a key process in the utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. White-rot fungi, such as Pleurotus ostreatus, are renowned for their ability to efficiently degrade lignin, primarily through the action of lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs). Despite their ecological and industrial significance, the precise roles of LMEs in lignin degradation remain poorly understood. This study employed the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to investigate the functional importance of LMEs in P. ostreatus. By targeting specific LME-encoding genes, we generated knockout mutants and assessed their lignin degradation capabilities. Our results demonstrate that the disruption of key LME genes significantly impairs the ability of P. ostreatus to degrade lignin, underscoring the essential role of these enzymes in this process. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed that the loss of LME function leads to compensatory changes in the expression of other genes involved in lignin degradation, highlighting the complexity of the lignin degradation machinery. This research not only advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lignin degradation but also provides a foundation for the development of novel biotechnological applications utilizing white-rot fungi. The findings presented here contribute to the ongoing efforts to elucidate the intricacies of lignin degradation and its potential applications in sustainable biomass utilization.
