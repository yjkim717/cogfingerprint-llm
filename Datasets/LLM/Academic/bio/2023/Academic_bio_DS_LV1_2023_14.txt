**Abstract**

The intricate and crowded milieu of the cell cytoplasm fundamentally dictates the nature of molecular transport, which frequently deviates from classical Brownian motion. This review synthesizes recent advances in characterizing and modeling **heterogeneous anomalous transport** within living systems, a phenomenon central to processes ranging from gene expression to signal transduction. We posit that the **diffusion coefficients** of biomolecules are not intrinsic constants but are emergent properties of a complex, viscoelastic environment, leading to transient subdiffusion. A critical examination of contemporary single-particle tracking (SPT) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) methodologies reveals the pervasive nature of these **anomalous transport** behaviors, challenging the adequacy of normal diffusion models in **cellular biology**. We explore a hierarchy of theoretical frameworks, from continuous-time random walks (CTRW) and fractional Brownian motion (fBm) to more recent polymer physics-based models that explicitly account for macromolecular crowding and transient binding. The discussion is contextualized within key **molecular biology** applications, including the search dynamics of transcription factors on chromatin, the hindered diffusion of mRNA particles, and the assembly of protein complexes. By integrating experimental data with multi-scale modeling, this review underscores that a quantitative understanding of **heterogeneous transport** is not merely a biophysical curiosity but is essential for a predictive mechanistic understanding of cellular function. Future directions will hinge on coupling high-resolution experimental data with spatially explicit, dynamic simulations of the intracellular environment.
