**Title:** Integrative Prognostic Stratification in Colorectal Cancer: A 2023 Perspective on Immunohistochemical and Molecular Biomarker Synergy

**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, characterized by profound inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity that complicates accurate prognostication and treatment personalization. While traditional clinicopathological staging systems, such as the TNM classification, provide a foundational prognostic framework, they often fail to capture the full biological spectrum of the disease, leading to significant outcome variations within identical stages. Consequently, the identification and validation of robust biomarkers have become a paramount objective in translational oncology. This review synthesizes the contemporary landscape of prognostic biomarkers in CRC, with a specific focus on the synergistic integration of established immunohistochemical (IHC) markers with emerging molecular profiling data to construct refined, multi-parametric risk models.

The utility of IHC in evaluating protein expression within the morphological context of tumor tissue remains indispensable. Key proliferative markers, such as Ki-67, provide a direct histopathological assessment of tumor aggressiveness, while the loss of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) reliably identifies microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, a subgroup with distinct clinical behavior and favorable prognosis. Furthermore, the analysis of specific signaling pathways through IHC, including the aberrant nuclear accumulation of Î²-catenin in Wnt-driven tumors or the phosphorylation status of STAT3, offers functional insights into oncogenic drive. However, the prognostic power of single IHC markers is often limited by pre-analytical variables and subjective interpretation.

The advent of high-throughput molecular technologies has exponentially expanded the biomarker repertoire. Genomic classifiers, such as the consensus molecular subtypes (CMS), stratify CRC into biologically distinct entities with divergent prognosis and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Mutational status of genes including *KRAS*, *NRAS*, and *BRAF* carries significant prognostic weight, with *BRAF V600E* mutations conferring a particularly dismal outcome. Beyond genomics, transcriptomic signatures quantifying immune cell infiltration (e.g., Immunoscore) have emerged as powerful independent prognosticators, often surpassing the predictive capacity of TNM staging. The integration of these molecular data with digital pathology and artificial intelligence is paving the way for a new era of quantitative, objective biomarker analysis.

We argue that the most significant prognostic advances in 2023 stem from a combinatorial approach. For instance, coupling IHC-based MMR status with next-generation sequencing for *BRAF* mutation analysis can distinguish sporadic MSI-H tumors from those of Lynch syndrome origin, with direct implications for patient management and family screening. Similarly, integrating a proliferative index (Ki-67) with a stromal gene signature can identify tumors with a highly aggressive, therapy-resistant phenotype. This review will critically appraise the evidence for such integrative models, discuss the challenges in standardizing their clinical application, and explore future directions, including the role of liquid biopsies for dynamic risk assessment. Ultimately, the convergence of IHC and molecular profiling is essential for deconvoluting CRC heterogeneity and delivering on the promise of precision oncology.
