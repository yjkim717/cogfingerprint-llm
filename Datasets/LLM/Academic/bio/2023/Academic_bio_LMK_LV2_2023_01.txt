Title: Elucidating Anomalous Transport in Cellular and Molecular Biology: Recent Advances and Perspectives

Abstract:
The intricate dynamics of cellular and molecular biology are characterized by heterogeneous anomalous transport, where particles exhibit non-Brownian motion due to the complex intracellular environment. Recent advances in microrheology have enabled researchers to probe the viscoelastic properties of cells and elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing anomalous transport. This review synthesizes current understanding of heterogeneous transport in biological systems, highlighting the role of crowding, confinement, and molecular interactions in modulating transport dynamics. We discuss the application of novel experimental techniques, such as single-particle tracking and optical tweezers, in quantifying anomalous transport and shedding light on the molecular mechanisms driving these phenomena. By integrating theoretical frameworks and experimental insights, we provide a comprehensive understanding of anomalous transport in cellular and molecular biology, and outline future directions for research in this rapidly evolving field, as of 2023.
