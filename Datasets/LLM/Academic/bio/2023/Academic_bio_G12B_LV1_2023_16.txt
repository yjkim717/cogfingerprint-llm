**Abstract**

Lignin, a complex phenylpropanoid polymer constituting a significant proportion of plant cell walls, represents a major recalcitrance factor limiting biomass utilization for biofuel production and other bioprocesses. The white-rot fungus *Pleurotus ostreatus* is renowned for its ability to degrade lignin, but the precise enzymatic mechanisms underpinning this process remain incompletely understood. While manganese peroxidases (MnPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs) are widely recognized as lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs), their individual and synergistic roles *in vivo* remain a subject of ongoing investigation. This study aimed to elucidate the functional importance of MnPs and VPs in *P. ostreatus*-mediated lignin degradation, utilizing a CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing approach to generate targeted knockout strains.

We constructed *P. ostreatus* mutants deficient in specific LME genes, and assessed their ability to degrade authentic plant cell wall lignin *in vitro*. Lignin degradation was quantified through Klason lignin analysis and characterized via spectrophotometric assays measuring the release of phenolic compounds.  Furthermore, proteomic analysis was employed to examine the broader shifts in the fungal proteome in response to lignin substrates, both in the wild-type and mutant strains.

Results demonstrated a significantly reduced capacity for lignin degradation in strains lacking either MnP or VP, highlighting their essential, albeit distinct, contributions to the process.  The synergistic action of these enzymes was evident in the compounded degradation deficits observed in double-knockout mutants. Proteomic data revealed compensatory changes in the expression of other oxidative enzymes in the MnP/VP deficient strains, suggesting adaptive responses to the altered lignin degradation pathway.  This research provides compelling experimental evidence supporting the crucial and complementary roles of MnPs and VPs in *P. ostreatus*-mediated lignin biotransformation, offering insights valuable for optimizing fungal-based lignin valorization strategies.
