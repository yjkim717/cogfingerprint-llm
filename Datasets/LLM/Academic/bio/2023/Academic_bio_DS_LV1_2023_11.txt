**Abstract**

The progressive dysregulation of the plasma proteome is a hallmark of the aging process, yet a comprehensive, high-throughput characterization of these molecular shifts in relation to human longevity remains incomplete. Utilizing the SomaScanÂ® aptamer-based platform, which assays over 7,000 proteins, we conducted a large-scale proteomic analysis of plasma samples from a cohort encompassing a broad age range, including a distinct centenarian population. Our investigation identified a core signature of 273 proteins whose circulating levels demonstrate a significant and robust association with chronological age. Unsupervised machine learning models constructed from this proteomic signature achieved high accuracy in predicting individual age, establishing these molecules as potent biomarkers of aging. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these aging-associated proteins are significantly implicated in key biological pathways, including inflammatory signaling, extracellular matrix organization, and hormonal response. Notably, comparative analysis of the centenarian proteome against younger cohorts revealed distinct modulations within this signature, suggesting potential protective or compensatory mechanisms associated with exceptional longevity. This study delineates a high-resolution map of the aging plasma proteome, providing a powerful resource for quantifying biological age and uncovering novel molecular targets for interventions aimed at extending healthspan.
