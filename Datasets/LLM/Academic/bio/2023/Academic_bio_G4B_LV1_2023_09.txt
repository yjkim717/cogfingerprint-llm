**Distinct Molecular Subtypes of Alzheimer’s Disease Revealed Through Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomics and Integrated Risk Assessment**

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibits substantial heterogeneity, complicating diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. This study investigated the potential for identifying distinct molecular subtypes of AD using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics, integrating genetic risk profiles and clinical data. Applying advanced mass spectrometry techniques, we analyzed CSF samples from a cohort of [Insert sample size – e.g., 300] individuals, generating a comprehensive proteomic signature.  Principal component analysis and cluster analysis revealed five novel, clinically relevant molecular subtypes of AD.  Notably, each subtype demonstrated a unique proteomic profile, correlating with specific genetic risk scores (e.g., APOE4 allele status) and differing rates of cognitive decline.  These findings suggest that AD pathogenesis may be driven by distinct biological pathways within these subtypes.  Further investigation into the specific protein alterations within each subtype is warranted to inform targeted diagnostic strategies and personalized therapeutic approaches.  This work highlights the value of CSF proteomics in elucidating AD heterogeneity and advancing precision medicine.
