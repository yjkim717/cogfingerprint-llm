**Abstract**

The white-rot fungus *Pleurotus ostreatus* is a model organism for studying the enzymatic machinery of lignin depolymerization, a critical process in global carbon cycling and biotechnological applications. While lignin-modifying enzymes (LMEs), such as manganese peroxidases (MnPs) and versatile peroxidases (VPs), have long been implicated in this process, direct genetic evidence confirming their indispensable role *in vivo* has been limited. In this study, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate targeted knock-out mutants of key LME-encoding genes in *P. ostreatus*. Phenotypic and biochemical analyses of these isogenic mutants revealed a significant impairment in their ability to degrade native lignin in a natural substrate. Our results provide definitive genetic evidence that MnPs and VPs are not merely contributors but are essential components for the natural lignin degradation pathway in this fungus. These findings resolve long-standing questions regarding the primary enzymatic drivers of white-rot decay and establish a robust genetic platform for elucidating the precise roles of individual isozymes, with implications for optimizing fungal strains in lignocellulosic biomass conversion.
