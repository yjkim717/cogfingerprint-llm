**Abstract**

Accurate microclimate characterization is increasingly vital for ecological modeling and conservation efforts, particularly within European forests. This research presents a novel methodology for generating high-resolution temperature grids, leveraging newly derived bioclimatic variables to represent local environmental conditions. Utilizing a spatially explicit temperature grid system, we quantify key bioclimatic variables – including solar radiation exposure and topographic influence – relevant to forest ecosystems. These grids, designed for application within ecological models, provide a more nuanced representation of microclimate variability than traditional methods. Preliminary results demonstrate improved model performance in simulating species distributions and forest growth dynamics, highlighting the potential of this approach for informed forest management strategies in 2023 and beyond.
