 Here's an abstract inspired by the provided summary and keywords, written in a formal, academic style:

Lembrechts’ (2023) ForestClim dataset addresses a critical need for high-resolution microclimate data in European forest ecology. This open-access resource provides bioclimatic variables, particularly focusing on temperature, at a 25x25 m² spatial resolution. The enhanced granularity of ForestClim significantly improves the capacity for ecological modeling, allowing for more nuanced investigations of forest dynamics and species distributions. This advancement promises to refine predictions of forest responses to climate change and inform adaptive management strategies across diverse European forest ecosystems.
