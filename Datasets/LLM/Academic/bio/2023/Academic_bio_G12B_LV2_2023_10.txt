**Abstract**

Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful approach for quantitative proteomics, offering advantages in reproducibility and throughput compared to data-dependent acquisition (DDA). However, accurate and efficient peptide identification from complex DIA datasets remains a computational bottleneck. This study presents MSFragger-DIA, a novel peptide identification algorithm specifically optimized for DIA data processing, and its seamless integration within the established FragPipe proteomics pipeline. MSFragger-DIA leverages a spectral library search strategy, employing a refined scoring function that accounts for the characteristic fragmentation patterns observed in DIA experiments. Preliminary benchmarking demonstrates that MSFragger-DIA exhibits enhanced speed and sensitivity compared to conventional search engines when applied to DIA data, allowing for more comprehensive protein quantification. The integration with FragPipe streamlines the entire proteomics workflow, facilitating automated data processing, statistical analysis, and report generation. This advancement addresses a critical need in the field, contributing to improved accuracy and efficiency in DIA-based proteomics research. We anticipate that MSFragger-DIA will significantly accelerate the adoption of DIA methodologies and broaden its applicability across diverse biological investigations, particularly in areas requiring high-throughput and robust quantitative protein profiling. This work was conducted in 2023.
