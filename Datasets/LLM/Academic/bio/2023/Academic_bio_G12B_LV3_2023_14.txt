**Heterogeneous Anomalous Transport in Biological Systems: A Review of Emerging Paradigms**

Recent experimental observations across cellular and molecular biology have revealed deviations from classical diffusion, suggesting the prevalence of heterogeneous anomalous transport (HAT) phenomena. This review, presented in late 2023, synthesizes current understanding of HAT within biological contexts, moving beyond traditional Brownian motion models to account for complex spatiotemporal dynamics. We explore the increasing application of microrheological techniques – including fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and single-particle tracking – in characterizing anomalous diffusion exponents and transport timescales within cellular environments. Furthermore, we critically evaluate theoretical frameworks, such as continuous time random walks and fractional diffusion equations, adapted to model HAT, and discuss the limitations of these approaches in accurately representing the inherent heterogeneity.  A significant focus is placed on the burgeoning role of machine learning methodologies in analyzing high-dimensional single-molecule tracking data to identify patterns indicative of HAT and predict transport behavior. Finally, we present case studies encompassing protein trafficking, mRNA localization, and macromolecular crowding, demonstrating the broad relevance of HAT in diverse biological processes. This review aims to stimulate further interdisciplinary research bridging molecular biology, statistical physics, and computational science to fully elucidate the mechanisms governing HAT and its implications for cellular function and disease.
