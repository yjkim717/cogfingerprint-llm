**Abstract**

The 2022-2023 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b in Europe represented a significant epidemiological shift, characterized by unprecedented mortality events in wild bird populations. This study investigates the outbreak's dynamics, with a particular focus on its pronounced impact on Laridae, especially black-headed gulls (*Chroicocephalus ridibundus*), which suffered mass mortality, suggesting a potential role as a key reservoir and dissemination vector. The persistence of the virus within resident wild bird populations throughout the winter of 2023 indicates a transition towards endemicity in European avifauna, challenging previous models of viral ecology that emphasized seasonal reintroduction via migratory pathways. Genomic surveillance revealed the continued acquisition of mutations in the viral haemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase complex, which are associated with enhanced mammalian adaptation. Despite these genetic changes, comprehensive risk assessment concludes that the zoonotic potential remains low to moderate, as critical mutations for sustained human-to-human transmission, particularly in the receptor-binding domain, were not consolidated. Our findings underscore the necessity for integrated One Health surveillance strategies that bridge wild bird monitoring, viral genomics, and public health preparedness. The establishment of HPAI H5N1 2.3.4.4b in wild bird communities necessitates a paradigm shift in mitigation policies, moving from purely reactive culling to proactive, ecosystem-based management to anticipate future evolutionary trajectories and spillover risks.
