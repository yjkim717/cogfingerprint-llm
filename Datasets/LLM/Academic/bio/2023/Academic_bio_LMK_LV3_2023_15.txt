Title: Prognostic Biomarkers of Cell Proliferation in Colorectal Cancer: A Review of Emerging Molecular Markers and Diagnostic Techniques

Abstract:

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for reliable prognostic biomarkers to inform clinical decision-making. Cell proliferation is a hallmark of CRC progression, and its assessment has become a crucial aspect of diagnosis and treatment stratification. This review aims to provide an updated overview of the prognostic biomarkers of cell proliferation in CRC, with a focus on emerging molecular markers and diagnostic techniques.

Recent advances in molecular biology have led to the identification of novel biomarkers associated with cell proliferation in CRC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) remains a widely used technique for assessing protein expression, including markers such as Ki-67, a well-established indicator of cell proliferation. However, the emergence of molecular profiling technologies has enabled the detection of additional biomarkers, including genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations. For instance, aberrant expression of cell cycle regulators, such as cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), has been linked to CRC progression and poor prognosis.

The integration of these molecular markers into clinical practice has the potential to refine CRC diagnosis and treatment. For example, the assessment of microsatellite instability (MSI) and mismatch repair (MMR) status has become a crucial aspect of CRC diagnosis, with implications for targeted therapy. Furthermore, the development of novel diagnostic techniques, such as digital pathology and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered image analysis, is enhancing the accuracy and reliability of IHC-based biomarker assessment.

This review will examine the current evidence supporting the use of prognostic biomarkers of cell proliferation in CRC, with a focus on the clinical utility of emerging molecular markers and diagnostic techniques. We will discuss the strengths and limitations of various approaches, including IHC, molecular profiling, and digital pathology. By synthesizing the available evidence, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of cell proliferation biomarkers in CRC diagnosis and treatment, informing the development of more effective and personalized therapeutic strategies.

Ultimately, the integration of prognostic biomarkers into clinical practice has the potential to improve patient outcomes in CRC, enabling more accurate diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment selection. As the field continues to evolve, further research is needed to validate the clinical utility of emerging biomarkers and diagnostic techniques, paving the way for more effective and targeted therapies in CRC.
