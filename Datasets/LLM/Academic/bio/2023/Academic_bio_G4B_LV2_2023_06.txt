**Abstract**

Recent advancements in electrochemical biosensing necessitate a deeper understanding of interfacial dynamics within enzymatic reaction environments. This study employs in situ Raman spectroscopy to investigate the transient structural changes occurring at the active site of glucose oxidase (GOx) during catalytic turnover. Utilizing a microfluidic platform, we monitored vibrational modes in real-time, revealing critical surface reconstruction events correlated with substrate binding and product release. These in situ measurements provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the catalytic cycle, differentiating between conformational shifts and alterations in protein packing.  Data analysis, focusing on peak intensity and frequency shifts, contributes to refined models of GOx activity, informing the design of improved biosensors and enzymatic diagnostics â€“ a key area of research in 2023.
