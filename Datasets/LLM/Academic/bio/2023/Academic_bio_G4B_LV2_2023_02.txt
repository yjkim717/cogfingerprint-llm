**Abstract: Advancing Prognostic Biomarker Discovery in Colorectal Cancer – A Synthesis of Molecular and Immunohistochemical Approaches**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating the continued development of robust prognostic biomarkers to refine patient stratification and personalize therapeutic strategies. This review synthesizes current advancements in biomarker discovery for CRC, integrating insights from genetic, epigenetic, and molecular biological investigations, with a particular emphasis on immunohistochemical techniques and the emerging role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). 

Traditional histological analysis remains the cornerstone of CRC diagnosis and staging; however, increasing evidence highlights the limitations of relying solely on phenotypic assessment. Consequently, research has focused on identifying molecular signatures predictive of disease progression and response to treatment. Genetic alterations, including mutations in *KRAS*, *TP53*, and *MSH2*, are well-established prognostic factors. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation patterns, offer complementary information regarding tumor heterogeneity. 

Furthermore, ncRNAs, including microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, are increasingly recognized for their potential as biomarkers. These molecules are often dysregulated in CRC and can modulate key cellular pathways involved in proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis.  Immunohistochemistry, utilizing antibodies targeting specific protein expression profiles, provides a spatially defined assessment of these molecular alterations. Integrating these diverse approaches – genetic profiling, epigenetic analysis, ncRNA expression, and immunohistochemical validation – promises a more comprehensive understanding of CRC’s complex biology and improved patient outcomes.  Future research should prioritize standardized biomarker assays and clinical validation to facilitate widespread implementation.
