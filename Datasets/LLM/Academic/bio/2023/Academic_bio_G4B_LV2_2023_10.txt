**Abstract**

Data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry has emerged as a powerful technique for comprehensive proteome analysis, yet efficient peptide identification remains a significant challenge. This study details the development and implementation of MSFragger-DIA, a novel algorithm integrated within the FragPipe platform, designed to accelerate and enhance peptide identification workflows utilizing DIA data. MSFragger-DIA leverages a fragmentation-based approach, intelligently selecting and fragmenting precursor ions to maximize peptide coverage while minimizing redundant fragmentation.  The integration with FragPipe facilitates automated processing, including spectral preprocessing, peptide fragmentation selection, and subsequent peptide identification via tandem mass spectrometry.  Preliminary results demonstrate that MSFragger-DIA significantly improves the speed and accuracy of peptide identification compared to traditional DIA analysis methods.  This enhanced efficiency allows for more rapid and thorough characterization of complex biological samples.  Further validation and expansion of the FragPipe platform with MSFragger-DIA promise to facilitate broader adoption of DIA proteomics in diverse research areas.
