**Abstract**

Understanding the impact of environmental change on plant biodiversity necessitates robust, standardized monitoring approaches. This study details the application of the Mountain Invasion Response Evaluation Network (MIREN) protocol, a refined methodology for assessing plant species distribution across elevational gradients, to investigate patterns of range shifts within a montane ecosystem. Utilizing a standardized protocol, we documented plant communities at multiple elevations, focusing on both native and invasive species, over a three-year period (2019-2022). Preliminary data reveal significant correlations between elevation, climatic variables, and species occurrence. Notably, several previously restricted species are exhibiting upward range expansions, while others demonstrate localized contractions. 

These observed shifts are tentatively attributed to a complex interplay of climate change-induced thermal expansion and the ongoing facilitation of mountain invasion by non-native taxa.  The MIREN protocol’s capacity to capture subtle elevational gradients provides a critical framework for quantifying these dynamic responses. Further analysis, incorporating remote sensing data and predictive modelling, will illuminate the broader implications of these localized range shifts for regional plant community composition and ecosystem stability. The standardized nature of MIREN offers a valuable tool for comparative studies across diverse montane landscapes globally, supporting informed conservation strategies.
