**Abstract**

The year 2022 witnessed an unprecedented escalation in avian influenza activity across Europe, characterized by a significant expansion in both poultry and wild bird populations affected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically clade 2.3.4.4b. This outbreak represents the most extensive recorded event to date, necessitating a detailed investigation into the dynamics of viral spread and ecological factors contributing to its propagation. Preliminary data indicates a notable role for wild birds, particularly scavenging species, as vectors in introducing and disseminating the virus into poultry farms. 

Genome sequencing revealed a high prevalence of the 2.3.4.4b lineage, suggesting a sustained and potentially evolving epidemiological profile.  The increased detection of novel virus variants within wild bird populations raises concerns regarding potential zoonotic transmission and the emergence of further pathogenic strains.  Furthermore, the impact extended beyond managed poultry, with documented cases in seabirds, indicating a broader ecological disruption. Continued surveillance efforts, coupled with enhanced biosecurity protocols and investigations into environmental reservoirs, are crucial for mitigating future outbreaks and understanding the complex interplay between avian influenza, wild bird ecology, and poultry health.
