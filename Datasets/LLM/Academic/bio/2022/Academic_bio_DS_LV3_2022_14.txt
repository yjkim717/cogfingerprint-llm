In 2022, Korabel et al. established a pivotal theoretical framework for intracellular nanoparticle dynamics by deriving an exact steady-state solution to the Smoluchowski coagulation equation. This analytical model precisely quantifies the equilibrium cluster density of nanoparticles following endosomal entrapment, a critical process in nanomedicine and drug delivery systems. Departing from conventional asymptotic approximations, the exact solution demonstrates remarkable fidelity with empirical data across clusters comprising 1â€“20 nanoparticles, capturing finite-size effects often neglected in continuum approaches. The work elucidates how intracellular confinement and biochemical kinetics govern nanoparticle aggregation, providing a predictive tool for optimizing nanocarrier design. By reconciling theoretical rigor with experimental validation in complex biological environments, this research advances fundamental understanding of nanoparticle clustering mechanisms and offers transformative implications for targeted therapeutic strategies and diagnostic applications.
