**Title:** Cerebrospinal Fluid Profiling Reveals Distinct Amyloidogenic and Synaptic Pathophysiological Trajectories in Phospho-Tau Defined Subtypes of Alzheimer’s Disease

**Abstract:**

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by significant clinical and pathological heterogeneity, which complicates therapeutic development and patient prognostication. While the AT(N) framework—classifying individuals based on Amyloid-beta (Aβ), Tau, and Neurodegeneration biomarkers—has been instrumental, it insufficiently captures the biological diversity within Aβ-positive (A+) and tau-positive (T+) individuals. This study investigates the hypothesis that distinct pathophysiological subtypes of AD, defined by specific cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phospho-tau (p-tau) profiles, are associated with divergent mechanisms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and synaptic integrity, independent of overt clinical stage. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a deeply phenotyped cohort of 450 A+T+ individuals, spanning the cognitive spectrum from preclinical to dementia stages. Using an unsupervised clustering algorithm on a panel of CSF p-tau epitopes (p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231), we identified three robust p-tau subgroups. Subsequent analysis of CSF biomarkers revealed profound inter-subgroup differences. A "High p-tau" subgroup exhibited a profile consistent with markedly accelerated amyloidogenic processing, evidenced by significantly elevated levels of soluble APP-β (sAPPβ) and reduced sAPPα, indicating a shift toward β-secretase (BACE1) activity. Concurrently, this subgroup showed the most severe synaptic compromise, with the lowest concentrations of the pre-synaptic protein neurogranin and the dendritic protein SNAP-25. Conversely, a "Low p-tau" subgroup demonstrated a near-normal sAPPβ/sAPPα ratio and relatively preserved synaptic biomarker levels, despite comparable global Aβ burden (as measured by CSF Aβ42/40) and clinical severity to the other subgroups. A third, "Intermediate" subgroup displayed a mixed profile. These findings, generated in 2022, establish that p-tau-based subtyping stratifies AD into biologically discrete entities with distinct amyloid production and synaptic injury trajectories. This refined taxonomy moves beyond a monolithic view of AD pathophysiology, with critical implications for the design of clinical trials, particularly those targeting tau or synaptic resilience, by enabling a precision medicine approach based on underlying molecular drivers.
