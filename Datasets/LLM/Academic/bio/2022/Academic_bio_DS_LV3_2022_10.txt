The integration of deep learning into proteomic workflows has substantially advanced peptide identification from LC-MS/MS data. In 2022, we introduced MSBooster, a novel rescoring framework that leverages deep learning-predicted peptide properties—including retention time, ion mobility, and MS2 spectra—to enhance the discrimination of correct peptide-spectrum matches. By interfacing seamlessly with the FragPipe computational environment, MSBooster significantly increases identification rates and statistical confidence across diverse experimental datasets. Our evaluations demonstrate its robust performance in complex proteomes, including post-translationally modified peptides and single-cell analyses, underscoring its broad utility. This approach establishes a new paradigm for maximizing informational yield from proteomic experiments, thereby accelerating discoveries in functional biology and biomarker development.
