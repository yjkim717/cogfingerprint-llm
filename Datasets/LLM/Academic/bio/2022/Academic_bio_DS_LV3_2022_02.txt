The ghrelin system, comprising endogenous ligands and receptors including GHS-Rs and GOAT, represents an emerging modulator of colorectal carcinogenesis with dualistic functions. While ghrelin demonstrates proliferative effects through MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathway activation in early-stage tumors, recent transcriptomic analyses reveal its paradoxical tumor-suppressive role in advanced malignancies via p53-mediated apoptosis induction. This bidirectional regulation is further complicated by its immunomodulatory capacity, where ghrelin attenuates NF-ÎºB-driven inflammation in the tumor microenvironment yet promotes angiogenesis through VEGF upregulation. Current evidence from 2022 suggests tissue-specific expression patterns of GHS-R1a and GOAT could serve as staging biomarkers, though clinical validation remains pending. The system's therapeutic potential is being explored through novel GOAT inhibitors and ghrelin receptor antagonists, which have demonstrated preclinical efficacy in patient-derived xenograft models. Future research must address the contextual determinants of ghrelin's functional duality and validate its diagnostic-prognostic utility through multicenter longitudinal studies.
