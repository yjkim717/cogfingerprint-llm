**Abstract**

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) represents a prevalent neurological risk factor, particularly impacting cognitive function in women. This study investigates the relationship between IDA and electrophysiological markers of attentional processing. Utilizing data from a systematic review conducted in 2022, we examined the effects of anemia on the P300 wave – a cognitive evoked potential reflecting sustained attention – specifically focusing on latency and amplitude. Results revealed a significant impairment of P300 potentials in women with IDA, indicating compromised attentional resources. Critically, supplementation with iron demonstrated a corresponding amelioration of these P300 deficits. These findings strongly suggest that the P300 serves as a sensitive indicator of cognitive reserve and vulnerability to neurological compromise associated with IDA. Further research is warranted to explore the potential of P300 assessment as a non-invasive tool for early detection of cognitive decline in women with iron status abnormalities, offering a valuable adjunct to traditional cognitive assessment methods.
