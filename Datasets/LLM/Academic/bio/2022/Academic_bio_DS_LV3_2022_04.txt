**Abstract**

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) represents a pervasive global health concern with established systemic consequences; however, its subclinical impact on central nervous system function, particularly in pre-menopausal women, remains a critical area of investigation. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from electrophysiological studies conducted through 2022 to elucidate the specific neurocognitive sequelae of IDA by examining alterations in the P300 event-related potential, a robust electrophysiological index of attentional resource allocation and cognitive processing speed. Our analysis confirms a significant and reproducible attenuation of P300 amplitude and a prolongation of its latency in women with IDA compared to iron-replete controls, directly implicating impaired auditory and visual information processing efficiency. Crucially, longitudinal and interventional data demonstrate that iron supplementation therapy effectively normalizes these aberrant P300 parameters, concurrently correlating with improvements in standardized neuropsychological test performance. This dose-responsive reversibility strongly suggests a causal link between iron status and cognitive electrophysiology, rather than a mere association. The findings position the P300 potential not merely as a biomarker of an established cognitive deficit but as a sensitive, objective tool for the early detection of subclinical cognitive decline before overt clinical symptoms manifest. We conclude that integrating P300 assessment into the diagnostic and monitoring framework for IDA could facilitate timely intervention, thereby mitigating the long-term neurocognitive burden in at-risk female populations and informing public health strategies.
