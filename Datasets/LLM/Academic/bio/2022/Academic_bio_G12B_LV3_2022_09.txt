**Abstract**

Recent advances in phosphotau (p-tau) assays have revealed heterogeneity within Alzheimer's disease (AD), prompting investigation into distinct p-tau subtypes and their relationship to disease pathology. This study, conducted in 2022, explored the association between specific p-tau profiles, amyloid metabolism, and synaptic integrity across a spectrum of AD stages. Our findings demonstrate significant correlations between distinct p-tau subgroups and levels of amyloid-Î² deposition, independent of clinical stage. Furthermore, these p-tau profiles exhibited robust associations with synaptic biomarkers, suggesting a direct link to neuronal dysfunction and loss. These results underscore the potential of p-tau subtypes as valuable biomarkers for improved AD diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of therapeutic interventions targeting amyloid and synaptic pathways. Understanding these nuanced relationships is crucial for advancing precision medicine approaches in AD.
