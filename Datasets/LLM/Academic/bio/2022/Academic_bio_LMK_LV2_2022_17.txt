Title: The Impact of Iron Deficiency Anemia on P300 Cognitive Evoked Potentials in Women: A Review of the Effects of Iron Supplementation


#### Abstract

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a prevalent nutritional disorder associated with cognitive impairment and decline in cognitive function. The P300 cognitive evoked potential is a reliable neurophysiological marker for assessing cognitive processing. This review examines the relationship between IDA, P300 wave latency, and cognitive impairment in women, as well as the efficacy of iron supplementation in mitigating these effects. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that IDA is linked to prolonged P300 latencies, indicative of impaired cognitive processing. Furthermore, studies have consistently demonstrated a correlation between IDA and mild cognitive decline. The underlying mechanisms are thought to involve alterations in dopamine and serotonin metabolism, as well as impaired myelination and neurotransmitter synthesis. Iron supplementation has been shown to partially reverse the detrimental effects of IDA on P300 latencies, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for mitigating cognitive decline. However, the efficacy of iron supplementation varies depending on factors such as duration and dosage. This review highlights the need for further research into the complex interplay between IDA, cognitive function, and iron supplementation. The findings have significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of cognitive impairment in women with IDA, underscoring the importance of early detection and intervention. By elucidating the relationship between IDA and cognitive decline, this review contributes to the development of targeted therapeutic approaches to address this prevalent public health concern.
