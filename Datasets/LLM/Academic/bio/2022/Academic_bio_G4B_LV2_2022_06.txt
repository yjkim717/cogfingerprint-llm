**Abstract**

The optimization of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) efficiency remains a critical challenge in electrochemical energy conversion. Recent research highlights the pivotal influence of surface iron (Fe) sites and strontium (Sr) vacancies within perovskite materials on facilitating lattice oxygen oxidation during OER. This study, conducted in 2022, explored the mechanistic contributions of these structural defects to enhanced catalytic activity. Specifically, we observed that the presence of surface Fe sites promotes oxygen transfer via a concerted, multi-electron pathway, while Sr vacancies appear to stabilize lattice oxygen, mitigating charge recombination.  These findings suggest a synergistic effect wherein Fe sites initiate oxygen liberation, subsequently stabilized by vacancies, resulting in a significant augmentation of OER performance. Further investigation into defect engineering strategies is warranted to realize robust and efficient perovskite-based OER catalysts.
