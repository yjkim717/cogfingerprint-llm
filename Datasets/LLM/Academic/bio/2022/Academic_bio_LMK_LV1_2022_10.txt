Title: Enhancing Peptide Identification in LC-MS/MS Analyses with Deep Learning-Augmented MSBooster

Abstract:
Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a cornerstone technique in proteomics, enabling the identification of peptides and proteins in complex biological samples. However, the accuracy of peptide identification remains a significant challenge. In 2022, we integrated deep learning-based features into the MSBooster tool, leveraging FragPipe workflows to augment peptide identification rates. By harnessing the predictive power of deep learning models, MSBooster enhances the confidence of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) and improves the overall efficiency of LC-MS/MS data analysis. Our results demonstrate that MSBooster significantly boosts peptide identification rates across diverse LC-MS/MS datasets, outperforming traditional methods. The integration of MSBooster with FragPipe workflows streamlines the analysis process, facilitating the application of deep learning-augmented peptide identification in various proteomics studies. This advancement has far-reaching implications for the field, enabling researchers to probe deeper into the proteome with increased accuracy and confidence.
