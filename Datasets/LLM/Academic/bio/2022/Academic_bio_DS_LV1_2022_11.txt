**Abstract**

Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis remains clinically challenging, underscoring the critical need for objective biomarkers. This study investigates the potential of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), a pivotal enzyme in dopamine synthesis, as a novel cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker for PD. Utilizing high-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we quantified AADC levels in a cohort of 120 PD patients, 50 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and 70 healthy controls. Our analysis revealed a significant reduction in CSF AADC concentrations in PD patients compared to both control groups (p < 0.001). Furthermore, AADC levels demonstrated a strong inverse correlation with the severity of motor symptoms, as assessed by the MDS-UPDRS Part III score (r = -0.72, p < 0.001). The integration of AADC into a multi-protein biomarker panel significantly improved the differential diagnosis of PD from AD and healthy aging, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94. These 2022 findings posit CSF AADC not only as a robust diagnostic biomarker but also as a quantifiable indicator of nigrostriatal dysfunction and disease progression, offering a promising tool for refining patient stratification and monitoring therapeutic efficacy.
