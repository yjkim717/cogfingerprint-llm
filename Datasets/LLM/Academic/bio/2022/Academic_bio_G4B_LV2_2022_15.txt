**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health challenge, necessitating continued investigation into novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues. Emerging evidence suggests a complex interplay between the ghrelin system and CRC development, characterized by both autocrine and paracrine signaling mechanisms. This review synthesizes recent research examining the ghrelin system’s influence on CRC progression, focusing on its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Specifically, ghrelin, primarily known for its role in appetite regulation, has been demonstrated to stimulate CRC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis through receptor activation within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, alterations in ghrelin receptor expression and signaling pathways have been observed in CRC tissues compared to adjacent normal mucosa. 

Despite growing interest, substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the precise mechanisms governing ghrelin’s effects and the optimal strategies for utilizing ghrelin analogues in CRC management. Future research should prioritize elucidating the specific downstream effectors of ghrelin signaling within CRC cells and exploring the potential of targeted ghrelin modulation to inhibit tumor growth and enhance treatment response. This review underscores the importance of continued investigation into the ghrelin system as a promising area for CRC research and clinical translation.
