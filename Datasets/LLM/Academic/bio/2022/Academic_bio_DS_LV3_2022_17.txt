**Title:** The P300 Event-Related Potential as a Neurophysiological Biomarker for Iron-Deficiency Anemia-Associated Cognitive Impairment and Its Reversal with Iron Repletion in Women: A Systematic Review

**Abstract**

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) represents a significant global health burden, with a pronounced prevalence among women of reproductive age. Beyond its well-characterized hematological and somatic manifestations, IDA is increasingly implicated in subclinical cognitive dysfunction, though the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from electrophysiological studies conducted up to 2022 to evaluate the impact of IDA on the P300 component of event-related potentials (ERPs), a robust neurophysiological index of attentional resource allocation and cognitive processing speed. Our analysis of the extant literature reveals a consistent and significant finding: women diagnosed with IDA exhibit a characteristic attenuation in P300 amplitude and a concomitant prolongation of P300 latency compared to iron-replete controls. This electrophysiological profile is indicative of impaired stimulus evaluation and slower cognitive processing, providing an objective correlate to subjective reports of "brain fog" and attentional deficits. Crucially, this review provides compelling evidence for the reversibility of these neurocognitive deficits. Intervention studies employing oral iron supplementation demonstrate a significant normalization of P300 parameters following the restoration of iron stores and the correction of anemia. The P300 waveform's sensitivity to both the deficit state and subsequent repletion underscores its utility as a dynamic and objective biomarker. We conclude that the P300 ERP serves as a potent tool for the early detection of IDA-induced cognitive decline, often preceding overt performance deficits on standard neuropsychological batteries. These findings advocate for the integration of electrophysiological monitoring into the clinical management of IDA, facilitating timely intervention and providing a quantifiable measure of cognitive recovery, thereby refining therapeutic strategies for this vulnerable population.
