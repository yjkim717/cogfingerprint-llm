In 2022, the integration of deep learning techniques with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data analysis revolutionized peptide identification. MSBooster, a novel computational tool, leverages deep learning-based features to augment existing database search algorithms, such as those employed in FragPipe. By enhancing the discriminative power of MS/MS spectra, MSBooster significantly improves peptide identification rates. This synergy between deep learning and traditional database search methods has the potential to transform proteomics research, enabling more accurate and comprehensive analysis of complex biological samples.
