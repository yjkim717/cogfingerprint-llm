**Abstract**

Accurately capturing dynamic transcriptional processes is increasingly critical for understanding cellular regulation and disease mechanisms. Recent RNA velocity methods offer a promising avenue for inferring gene expression rates, yet their sensitivity and robustness remain areas of active investigation. This study presents a novel Markovian analysis framework for RNA velocity estimation, rigorously addressing limitations inherent in existing approaches. Utilizing biological datasets, we demonstrate the enhanced sensitivity of our method compared to established techniques, specifically in capturing subtle transcriptional changes. 

Central to our approach is a careful consideration of parameter choices – including rate constants and observation windows – within the Markov model. We outline a systematic methodology for optimizing these parameters, acknowledging their significant impact on velocity estimates. Furthermore, we validate our simulations, confirming improved accuracy and reduced spurious velocity signals. This work contributes a refined computational tool for analyzing transcriptomic dynamics, facilitating deeper insights into cellular heterogeneity and response to perturbations, published in 2022.
