**Abstract**

The identification of peptides within complex LC-MS/MS datasets remains a significant challenge in proteomics research. Traditional methods often struggle with spectral overlap and inherent biases, leading to incomplete or inaccurate peptide coverage.  This study introduces MSBooster, a novel approach leveraging deep learning to enhance peptide identification rates. MSBooster integrates predicted peptide properties – calculated from fragmentation spectra utilizing algorithms such as Fragpipe – into a deep neural network. These predicted properties, encompassing features like charge state and collision cross-section, are then used to guide peptide identification, effectively mitigating spectral ambiguity. 

Preliminary results, presented in 2022, demonstrate a statistically significant increase in peptide identification accuracy compared to conventional search algorithms. Specifically, we observed a [Insert Specific Percentage or Number]% improvement in peptide coverage across a series of in-house LC-MS/MS experiments.  Further validation and expansion of the model’s capabilities are ongoing, suggesting a promising avenue for improving proteome analysis.
