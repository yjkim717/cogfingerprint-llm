**Abstract**

The ghrelin system, historically recognized for its role in appetite regulation, has emerged as a significant modulator of colorectal cancer (CRC) development and related clinical manifestations. This review, conducted in 2022, synthesizes current literature exploring the multifaceted influence of ghrelin and its receptor (GHSR) on CRC carcinogenesis. Evidence suggests ghrelin promotes tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis through various signaling pathways, contributing to disease progression. Furthermore, dysregulation of the ghrelin axis is implicated in the development of CRC-associated cachexia and sarcopenia, debilitating conditions characterized by muscle wasting and weight loss.  This review further evaluates the potential of ghrelin as a diagnostic biomarker, noting its altered serum levels in CRC patients. Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting the ghrelin system to mitigate CRC progression, alleviate cachexia, and improve patient outcomes, highlighting both opportunities and challenges for future translational research in this rapidly evolving field.
