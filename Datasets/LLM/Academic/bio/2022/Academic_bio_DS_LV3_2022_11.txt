In the evolving landscape of Parkinson's disease (PD) biomarker discovery, this 2022 study leverages high-resolution proteomic profiling of cerebrospinal fluid to identify Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) as a significantly upregulated protein in PD cohorts. AADC, a pivotal enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis, demonstrates a robust positive correlation with established clinical measures of motor symptom severity, including the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). This correlation suggests its potential utility not merely as a diagnostic marker but as a quantitative indicator of disease progression. Furthermore, multivariate statistical models incorporating AADC concentration demonstrated high discriminatory power, accurately differentiating PD from both healthy controls and relevant neurological disease mimics, thereby addressing a critical diagnostic challenge. The elevation of AADC may reflect a compensatory biochemical mechanism in the nigrostriatal pathway, offering a novel window into the dynamic pathophysiology of dopaminergic dysfunction. These findings position AADC as a promising, clinically translatable biomarker, with implications for refining diagnostic accuracy, stratifying patient populations for targeted therapies, and serving as a pharmacodynamic endpoint in future clinical trials aimed at disease modification.
