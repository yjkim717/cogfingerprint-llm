**Abstract**

Global climate change is driving a pervasive reorganization of biodiversity, with species' geographic ranges shifting in response to altering thermal regimes. Mountainous regions, characterized by steep **elevation gradients**, provide a critical natural laboratory for observing these shifts, as they compress extensive climatic variation over short geographical distances. The Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN) has established a **standardized protocol** for the longitudinal monitoring of **plant species distributions** along these gradients across a global network of transects. This research employs this robust, comparative framework to quantify the magnitude and direction of range shifts for both native and **non-native species** over a 15-year period (2007-2022). Our multi-continental analysis reveals a pronounced mean upward shift in plant species' optimum elevations at a rate of approximately 4.1 meters per year. However, this trend is not uniform across floristic groups. While native species demonstrate variable responses, often lagging behind climate velocity, **non-native species** are found to be expanding their ranges upwards at a significantly faster rate, frequently establishing in high-elevation habitats previously considered resistant to invasion. This differential response is critically mediated by concurrent human disturbance, which facilitates colonization. Our findings provide empirical, global-scale evidence that current biotic responses to **climate change** are fundamentally altering mountain plant communities, leading to a phenomenon of "biotic homogenization" at high elevations. The MIREN **standardized protocol** proves indispensable for disentangling the synergistic drivers of change and underscores the urgent need for integrated conservation strategies that address both climatic and anthropogenic pressures to safeguard the unique biodiversity of mountain ecosystems.
