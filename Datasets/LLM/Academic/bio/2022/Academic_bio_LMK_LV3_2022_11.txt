Title: Identification of L-Aromatic Amino Acid Decarboxylase as a Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker for Parkinson's Disease Progression

Abstract:
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor dysfunction, necessitating reliable biomarkers for diagnosis and disease monitoring. Using a proteomics-based approach, our 2022 study investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein profiles to identify novel biomarkers for PD. We discovered that L-Aromatic Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC), a crucial enzyme in dopamine synthesis, is significantly altered in PD patients. Quantitative analysis revealed elevated AADC levels in the CSF of PD patients compared to controls, correlating with disease severity. Our findings suggest that AADC is a potential fluid biomarker for PD, enabling early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression. The identification of AADC as a biomarker underscores the utility of proteomics in elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying PD, paving the way for targeted therapeutic interventions and improved patient outcomes.
