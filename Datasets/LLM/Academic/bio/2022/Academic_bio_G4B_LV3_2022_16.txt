**Abstract**

The efficient genetic manipulation of *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a prominent white-rot fungus, remains a significant challenge in elucidating its complex lignocellulose degradation pathways. This study details a novel methodology leveraging a polycistronic tRNA construct in conjunction with CRISPR-Cas9 technology to facilitate targeted multiple-gene mutagenesis. Traditional transformation techniques often yield low frequencies of successful mutations and limited multiplexing capabilities. Our approach circumvents these limitations by employing a specifically designed polycistronic tRNA, enabling the simultaneous editing of multiple genes involved in polysaccharide hydrolysis.  Preliminary results demonstrate a substantial increase in the efficiency of inducing multiple-gene mutations within *P. ostreatus* compared to conventional methods. This advancement represents a critical step towards a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis underpinning fungal ligninolytic activity and offers a powerful tool for biotechnological applications involving enhanced biomass degradation.
