**Abstract**

The efficient modification of fungal metabolic pathways remains a significant challenge for optimizing industrial bioprocesses, particularly those involving lignocellulose degradation. This study, conducted in 2022, presents a groundbreaking strategy for accelerating targeted mutagenesis in *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a widely utilized white-rot fungus. We employed a novel approach integrating CRISPR-Cas9 technology with a polycistronic tRNA construct to simultaneously induce mutations across multiple genes involved in lignocellulose breakdown. This innovative design allows for the co-expression of multiple guide RNAs from a single transcript, substantially improving mutation frequencies compared to previously reported single-gene editing techniques. Preliminary results indicate a marked increase in the generation of diverse mutant populations, facilitating rapid screening for enhanced enzymatic activity and improved substrate utilization. This method offers a powerful tool for metabolic engineering of *P. ostreatus* and holds considerable promise for advancing sustainable biofuel production and biomass valorization efforts.
