Title: Unprecedented Avian Influenza Outbreak in Europe: Assessing the Impact of the 2021-2022 HPAI Epidemic on Poultry and Wild Bird Populations

Abstract:

The 2021-2022 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) epidemic season witnessed an unprecedented surge in outbreaks across Europe, underscoring the need for enhanced biosecurity measures to mitigate the spread of the disease. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the HPAI epidemic, which reported 2,467 outbreaks in poultry farms and 3,573 detections in wild birds. The substantial increase in cases among both domestic and wild avian populations highlights the escalating threat posed by HPAI to animal health, biodiversity, and the poultry industry.

Our analysis reveals that the widespread dissemination of HPAI viruses among wild birds played a pivotal role in the propagation of the disease, with many outbreaks in poultry farms potentially linked to breaches in biosecurity protocols. The findings emphasize the critical importance of stringent biosecurity measures, including robust surveillance systems, to prevent the introduction and spread of HPAI viruses in poultry farms. Furthermore, the study highlights the need for a coordinated, transboundary approach to HPAI management, incorporating enhanced collaboration between veterinary authorities, wildlife experts, and poultry producers.

The severity of the 2021-2022 HPAI epidemic season in Europe serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing risk posed by avian influenza viruses and the imperative for continued investment in HPAI research, surveillance, and control measures to protect animal health and maintain the integrity of the poultry industry. As the global epidemiological landscape continues to evolve, this study provides valuable insights into the complex dynamics of HPAI transmission and underscores the need for proactive strategies to mitigate the impact of future outbreaks.
