**Abstract**

The efficiency of cellular respiration, a cornerstone of energy metabolism, is critically dependent upon the coordinated activity of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Recent investigations suggest parallels between the mechanistic complexities of these complexes and the electrochemical processes observed in perovskite materials. This study hypothesizes that localized surface defects – analogous to ‘surface Fe sites’ – within mitochondrial membranes may facilitate accelerated electron transfer during oxidative phosphorylation. Specifically, we propose that membrane oxidation, driven by ‘lattice oxygen oxidation’ similar to that seen in perovskites, could be modulated by the presence of ‘Sr vacancies’ (representing structural instability) which alter the local redox potential.  Further research utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques is warranted to explore this potential biophysical link and its implications for mitochondrial function and disease states.
