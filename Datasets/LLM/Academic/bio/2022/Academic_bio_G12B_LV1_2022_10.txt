**Deep Learning-Enhanced Peptide Identification via MSBooster: A Novel Rescoring Framework for LC-MS/MS Data Analysis**

Accurate and comprehensive peptide identification is a critical bottleneck in proteomics workflows, directly impacting downstream quantitative analyses and biological interpretation. While established search engines like FragPipe provide robust initial peptide identifications from liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data, false positive identifications and missed peptide assignments remain persistent challenges. Here, we introduce MSBooster, a novel computational framework designed to significantly enhance peptide identification rates by leveraging deep learning to rescore initial search engine outputs. MSBooster utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a large dataset of experimentally validated peptide spectra to predict peptide properties, specifically focusing on fragmentation patterns and precursor ion characteristics.  This learned representation is then used to re-evaluate peptide matches generated by FragPipe, assigning a confidence score based on the agreement between the predicted and observed spectral features. Benchmarking against publicly available datasets demonstrates that MSBooster consistently improves peptide identification rates, reducing false discovery rates while simultaneously increasing the number of uniquely identified peptides. This approach offers a computationally efficient means to refine peptide identification, potentially unlocking greater proteomic depth and improving the reliability of downstream analyses such as protein quantification and biomarker discovery. Future work will focus on expanding the training dataset to encompass a broader range of peptides and instrumentation configurations, and integrating MSBooster directly into existing proteomics pipelines.

**Key Features & Reasoning behind Choices:**

*   **Formal Language:** Uses precise terminology ("convolutional neural network," "false discovery rate," "proteomic depth").
*   **Structured Reasoning:** Starts with the problem, introduces the solution (MSBooster), explains *how* it works (CNN, prediction of properties), presents results (improved rates, reduced FDR), and outlines future directions.
*   **Contextualized for 2022:**  A deep learning approach to proteomics is a current and relevant trend.
*   **Expands on the Summary:** Goes beyond just stating that it "improves identification rates" â€“ it explains *how* it does so and suggests the broader implications.
*   **Mention of FragPipe:**  Acknowledges the existing standard and positions MSBooster as a complementary tool.
