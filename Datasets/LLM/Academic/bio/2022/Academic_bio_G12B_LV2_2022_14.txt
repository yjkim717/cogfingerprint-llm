**Abstract**

Understanding the intracellular distribution and aggregation behavior of nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial for optimizing their therapeutic efficacy. While experimental observations demonstrate NP clustering within endosomal compartments, quantitative models predicting this behavior remain limited. This study presents a theoretical framework utilizing Smoluchowski’s equation to model NP aggregation dynamics within the intracellular milieu, specifically focusing on endosomal environments. The model incorporates parameters relevant to cellular conditions, including diffusion coefficients and collision frequencies, to predict resultant cluster density profiles. We demonstrate a strong correlation between the model’s predictions and experimental data obtained from gold nanoparticle tracking within cellular systems. This agreement validates the applicability of Smoluchowski’s equation for describing NP clustering in complex biological settings. The findings offer valuable insights for rational design of NP formulations, allowing for targeted manipulation of cluster density to enhance therapeutic outcomes and improve overall delivery efficiency. Further research will explore the influence of cellular factors and NP surface properties on the observed aggregation kinetics.
