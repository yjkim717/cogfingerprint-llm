Title: Assessing Climate Change Impacts on Mountain Ecosystems: A Standardized Protocol for Monitoring Plant Species Distributions along Elevation Gradients

Abstract:

Mountain ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change, with elevation gradients serving as natural laboratories for studying the impacts of global change on plant species distributions. As temperatures rise, many plant species are shifting their ranges poleward or to higher elevations, leading to changes in community composition and potentially facilitating the invasion of non-native species. To better understand these dynamics, a standardized monitoring protocol is essential. Here, we present a comprehensive framework for tracking changes in plant species distributions along elevation gradients. Our protocol involves systematic surveys of plant communities at multiple elevations, using a stratified sampling design to capture the complexity of mountain ecosystems. By monitoring changes in species presence, abundance, and community composition over time, researchers can identify early warning signs of climate-driven changes and assess the potential for invasion by non-native species. The proposed protocol is designed to be adaptable to diverse mountain ecosystems worldwide, facilitating the development of a global monitoring network. By standardizing data collection and analysis methods, our protocol enables comparative studies across different regions and ecosystems, providing insights into the processes driving changes in plant species distributions. The implementation of this protocol will contribute significantly to our understanding of climate change impacts on mountain ecosystems and inform conservation efforts aimed at preserving biodiversity in these fragile environments.
