**Abstract**

Recent advancements in biomarker analysis have highlighted the complex heterogeneity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), necessitating a refined understanding of pathological processes beyond traditional amyloid plaque deposition. This study investigated the relationship between phosphorylated tau (p-tau) isoforms and their downstream effects on amyloidogenic processes and synaptic integrity within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from individuals diagnosed with AD. Utilizing data collected in 2022, we analyzed p-tau subgroups – specifically, those defined by their post-translational modification – and correlated them with measures of amyloid production, quantified through CSF soluble amyloid-beta isoforms, and synaptic health, assessed via established CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels. 

Our findings demonstrate a significant association between distinct p-tau subgroups and divergent patterns of amyloid production. Furthermore, we observed that these p-tau profiles were independently predictive of synaptic integrity, indicating a nuanced interplay between tau pathology and neuronal function. Crucially, these relationships were maintained irrespective of clinical disease stage, suggesting that p-tau stratification may represent a more sensitive indicator of underlying disease mechanisms than previously considered. These results underscore the potential of p-tau as a valuable biomarker for early AD detection and stratification, facilitating targeted therapeutic interventions focused on preserving synaptic function and modulating amyloidogenic pathways. Further research is warranted to elucidate the specific biological pathways mediating these observed correlations and to validate these findings across larger, more diverse cohorts.
