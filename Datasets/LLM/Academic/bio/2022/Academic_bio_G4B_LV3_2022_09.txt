**Abstract**

Recent advancements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analysis have illuminated the complex pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study investigated the heterogeneity of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) isoforms and their relationship to key pathological processes. Utilizing advanced mass spectrometry techniques, we identified distinct p-tau subgroups within a cohort of AD patients, demonstrating a significant correlation between elevated p-tau levels and disruptions in amyloid metabolism. Notably, these associations persisted irrespective of disease stage, suggesting an early involvement of p-tau pathology. Furthermore, our findings revealed a strong inverse relationship between p-tau levels and measures of synaptic integrity, as assessed via established CSF biomarkers. These results highlight the potential of p-tau as a refined diagnostic and prognostic tool, warranting further investigation into its role in modulating amyloid dynamics and ultimately, preserving neuronal function within the progression of AD.
