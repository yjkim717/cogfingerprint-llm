**Abstract**

The intracellular behavior of nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial for understanding their therapeutic and toxicological potential. A key factor governing this behavior is the propensity for NPs to aggregate, forming clusters that can significantly alter cellular uptake, trafficking, and downstream biological effects. This study investigates the dynamics of NP clustering within endosomal compartments, employing a theoretical framework based on Smoluchowski's coagulation equation to model the process. We derive a steady-state solution to this equation, considering the influence of diffusion-limited aggregation and accounting for the finite size and concentration of NPs within the cellular environment.  The derived model predicts a characteristic relationship between cluster density and NP concentration, which is demonstrably consistent with experimental observations of gold nanoparticle clusters reported in the literature.  Furthermore, the modelâ€™s parameters, such as diffusion coefficients and aggregation rates, provide insights into the biophysical conditions within endosomes that promote or inhibit NP clustering. Our findings offer a robust, quantitative approach to predict and interpret NP aggregation behavior, facilitating improved design and delivery strategies for nanomedicines and a refined understanding of NP-induced cellular responses. This approach provides a valuable tool for future in silico studies of nanoparticle behavior.
