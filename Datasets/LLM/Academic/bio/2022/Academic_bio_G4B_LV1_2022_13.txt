**Spatial Quantification of Immune Infiltration in Lung Cancer via Multiplex Protein Imaging**

Lung cancer remains a leading cause of mortality, with increasing recognition of the critical role of the tumor microenvironment in disease progression and response to therapy.  Accurate assessment of immune cell infiltration within the tumor landscape is therefore paramount. This study introduces SpatialVizScore, a novel computational method designed to objectively quantify immune cell populations in lung tumors utilizing multiplex protein imaging techniques, specifically immunohistochemistry. Employing a high-resolution spatial imaging platform, we analyzed tissue sections stained for a panel of key immune cell markers.  Our methodology facilitates the identification and quantification of diverse immune cell types – including T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells – within a defined spatial context. Preliminary results demonstrate a strong correlation between SpatialVizScore values and established clinical parameters of tumor aggressiveness.  This approach offers a powerful tool for characterizing tumor immune states, potentially predicting therapeutic efficacy, and informing the development of targeted immunotherapies. Future research will focus on validating SpatialVizScore across diverse lung cancer subtypes and correlating it with patient outcomes.
