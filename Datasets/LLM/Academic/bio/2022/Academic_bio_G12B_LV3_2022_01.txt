**Abstract**

Intracellular nanoparticle delivery represents a promising avenue for targeted therapeutics; however, post-endocytic nanoparticle aggregation and subsequent cluster formation significantly influence therapeutic efficiency. This study, conducted in 2022, utilizes the Smoluchowski equation to model the dynamic behavior of nanoparticle clusters within endosomal compartments. We demonstrate that a precise description of cluster density, derived from the Smoluchowski framework, provides a substantially improved fit to experimental data compared to conventional power-law distributions when analyzing clusters comprising 1-20 nanoparticles. This refinement in modeling nanoparticle clustering offers enhanced predictive capabilities for intracellular drug delivery systems. Understanding the nuanced dynamics of these early-stage clusters is crucial for optimizing nanoparticle design and delivery strategies to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize potential adverse effects, ultimately advancing the field of nanomedicine.
