"In 2022, advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing enabled the analysis of cellular dynamics through RNA velocity. This study evaluates the Markovian assumptions underlying RNA velocity methods and their impact on downstream analyses. We assess the sensitivity of these methods to parameter choices and biological variability in diverse datasets, revealing critical dependencies that inform a robust workflow for accurate cell fate prediction and gene regulatory network inference."
