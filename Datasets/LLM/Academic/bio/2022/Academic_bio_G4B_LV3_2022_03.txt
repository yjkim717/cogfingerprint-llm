**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in genome editing techniques are increasingly applied to fungal biotechnology. This study details a refined methodology for targeted mutagenesis within *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a commercially significant white-rot fungus, leveraging a polycistronic tRNA-mediated CRISPR/Cas9 system.  Employing this approach, we successfully induced multiple-gene mutations simultaneously, offering a substantial improvement over traditional single-gene editing strategies.  Specifically, this system allows for the manipulation of genes involved in lignocellulose degradation pathways.  Characterization of resulting mutants revealed altered substrate utilization and extracellular enzyme production profiles, providing valuable insights into the complex enzymatic networks driving fungal decomposition.  The robustness and efficiency of this polycistronic tRNA-CRISPR/Cas9 system represent a critical tool for dissecting fungal metabolic pathways and optimizing *P. ostreatus* for enhanced bioremediation applications, as demonstrated in 2022 preliminary results.
