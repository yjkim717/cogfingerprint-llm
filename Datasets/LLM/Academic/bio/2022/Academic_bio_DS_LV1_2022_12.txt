This study presents a rigorous mathematical framework for RNA velocity analysis, addressing critical limitations in existing Markovian formulations. Through systematic parameter sensitivity analysis, we demonstrate that conventional assumptions yield unstable velocity estimates across diverse biological datasets. We introduce a regularized optimization approach that incorporates transcriptional stochasticity, substantially improving trajectory inference accuracy. Validation on single-cell RNA sequencing data from murine hematopoiesis confirms enhanced robustness in reconstructing developmental dynamics. Our work establishes foundational principles for reliable velocity estimation in complex biological systems.
