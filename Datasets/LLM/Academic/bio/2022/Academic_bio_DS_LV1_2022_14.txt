**Abstract**

The intracellular trafficking and fate of engineered nanoparticles (NPs) are critically governed by their dynamic clustering within endosomal compartments. While Smoluchowski's coagulation equation provides a theoretical framework for this process, existing analytical approximations have failed to accurately predict the evolving cluster-size distribution, limiting predictive models of nanomaterial behavior in biological systems. In this study, we report a novel, exact analytical solution to the coagulation equation for the temporal evolution of gold nanoparticle (AuNP) cluster density under endosome-mimetic conditions. Our model explicitly incorporates size-dependent aggregation kinetics, a factor often oversimplified in prior work. Validation against experimental data from live-cell imaging of endocytosed AuNPs demonstrates a superior fit to the observed cluster distribution over time compared to established mean-field approximations. This analytical advancement provides a rigorous, quantitative tool for predicting the agglomeration state of nanotherapeutics and diagnostics, thereby enhancing our ability to engineer nanoparticles with optimized intracellular delivery and function.
