**Abstract**

The summer of 2022 witnessed a geographically extensive and persistent High Pathogenicity Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak across Europe, primarily attributed to clade 2.3.4.4b, a Eurasian lineage of *Influenza A* virus. This study examines the rapid dissemination and ecological impact of this HPAI event, characterized by widespread morbidity and mortality within poultry populations.  Initial detections in June rapidly escalated, resulting in significant losses across numerous commercial poultry operations, highlighting the vulnerability of intensive farming practices to viral spread. 

Crucially, the outbreak was not confined to domestic fowl; extensive wild bird surveillance revealed a substantial number of positive detections, indicating zoonotic transmission and a broadening geographic range for the virus.  The prevalence of clade 2.3.4.4b underscores the evolutionary dynamics of avian influenza viruses and their capacity to adapt and circulate effectively.  Continued monitoring of wild bird populations remains paramount for early detection and risk assessment.  The sustained presence of this clade, coupled with documented spillover events, reinforces the ongoing threat to both animal and human health. Further research is required to fully delineate transmission pathways, evaluate vaccine efficacy, and implement robust biosecurity strategies to mitigate future outbreaks and minimize economic consequences.
