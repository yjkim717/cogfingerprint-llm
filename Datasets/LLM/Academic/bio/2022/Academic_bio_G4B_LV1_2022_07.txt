**Abstract**

Understanding the impacts of environmental change on plant communities is increasingly crucial for conservation efforts. This study introduces the Mountain Invasion and Range Extension (MIREN) protocol, a standardized methodology designed to systematically assess plant species distributions across elevational gradients within mountainous regions.  Prior research has often lacked consistent approaches, hindering robust comparisons and predictive modeling. The MIREN protocol employs a stratified random sampling design, coupled with detailed habitat characterization, to generate high-resolution data on native and non-native species assemblages. 

Analysis of data collected under this protocol in the Appalachian Mountains demonstrates significant regional variation in plant species distribution patterns correlated with elevation. Notably, we observed a pronounced association between increased elevation and the prevalence of native, endemic species. Conversely, the protocol revealed a concerning trend of mountain invasion, evidenced by the expansion of non-native species into higher elevation zones.  Furthermore, our findings indicate a demonstrable range shift for several established non-native species, suggesting adaptive responses to altered climatic conditions.  These results underscore the importance of standardized monitoring techniques like MIREN in documenting and predicting the ecological consequences of ongoing environmental change, particularly within vulnerable mountain ecosystems.  Future research will focus on integrating MIREN data with climate models to refine predictions of species distributions.
