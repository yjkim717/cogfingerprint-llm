**Directed Mutagenesis of *Pleurotus ostreatus* via CRISPR-Cas9 for Enhanced Lignocellulose Degradation Studies**

The efficient degradation of lignocellulosic biomass represents a critical pathway for sustainable biofuel production and biorefining. *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a prominent white-rot fungus, possesses inherent lignocellulolytic capabilities, yet optimizing these processes through targeted genetic manipulation remains challenging. This study details the development and implementation of a novel CRISPR-Cas9 mediated mutagenesis strategy for the precise induction of multiple-gene mutations within *P. ostreatus*. Utilizing a polycistronic tRNA template, we facilitated the simultaneous disruption of key genes involved in lignin biosynthesis and polysaccharide hydrolysis.  The resultant mutant strains were screened for altered degradation phenotypes, demonstrating a significant improvement in the breakdown of mixed lignocellulosic substrates.  These multiple-gene mutations, achieved with enhanced efficiency compared to traditional single-gene approaches, provide a valuable platform for dissecting the complex regulatory networks governing lignocellulose degradation in *P. ostreatus*.  Further research leveraging this platform promises advances in fungal biotechnology.
