The 2022 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 epidemic in Europe represents a paradigm shift in the ecology and impact of avian influenza viruses, constituting the largest and most geographically extensive outbreak since records began. This epizootic is distinguished by an unprecedented scale of viral circulation within wild bird populations, functioning as a primary reservoir and facilitating rapid, intercontinental dispersal. The epidemiological pattern observed in 2022 deviates significantly from previous seasonal outbreaks, characterized by persistent viral presence across multiple avian migration cycles and widespread mortality events affecting a diverse range of wild bird species, particularly colonial nesting seabirds and raptors. This sustained, high-intensity transmission in wildlife reservoirs has precipitated an extraordinary spillover into domestic poultry, necessitating massive culling operations and imposing severe economic burdens on the agricultural sector.

Critically, the 2022 outbreak has been marked by an alarming frequency of mammalian infections, including in mustelids, canids, and marine mammals. These repeated cross-species transmission events provide compelling evidence of ongoing viral adaptation in mammalian hosts, heightening concerns over the zoonotic potential of emergent H5N1 genotypes. The accumulation of specific mammalian-adapting mutations in the viral polymerase complex (PB2-E627K) and hemagglutinin glycoprotein raises the prospect of enhanced replication efficiency in warm-blooded hosts. This evolutionary trajectory underscores a pressing need to re-evaluate pandemic preparedness frameworks. Consequently, this review synthesizes the 2022 epidemiological data to argue for a fundamental enhancement of integrated One Health surveillance systems, bridging wild bird monitoring, poultry biosecurity, and real-time genomic sequencing of mammalian isolates. The findings emphasize that mitigating the escalating zoonotic risk posed by HPAI H5N1 requires a proactive, coordinated international strategy focused on early detection and containment of adaptive viral variants.
