Title: Unprecedented Avian Influenza Outbreaks in Europe: Insights from the 2021-2022 HPAI Epidemic Season

Abstract:

The 2021-2022 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic season in Europe was characterized by an unprecedented magnitude and geographical spread of outbreaks, affecting both domestic and wild bird populations. This epizootic event was marked by widespread reports of HPAI virus infections in poultry, captive birds, and wild birds across the continent. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the predominance of clade 2.3.4.4b H5Nx viruses, which were responsible for the majority of the outbreaks. The extensive spread of the virus was facilitated by the migration patterns of wild birds, which played a crucial role in the introduction and dissemination of the virus across Europe. The epidemic had a significant impact on the poultry industry, with numerous farms and holdings affected, resulting in substantial economic losses. Furthermore, the virus also affected various wild bird species, with some populations experiencing significant mortality rates. This study provides an overview of the 2021-2022 HPAI epidemic season in Europe, highlighting the key epidemiological features and the role of wild birds in the spread of the virus. The findings of this study have important implications for the development of effective control measures and surveillance strategies to mitigate the impact of future HPAI outbreaks in Europe.
