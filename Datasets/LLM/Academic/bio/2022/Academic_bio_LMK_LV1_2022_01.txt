Title: Investigating Nanoparticle Clustering Dynamics within Cellular Endosomes via Smoluchowski's Coagulation Equation

Abstract:

The intracellular fate of nanoparticles is crucial for understanding their interactions with cellular machinery. This study employs Smoluchowski's coagulation equation to model the clustering distribution of nanoparticles within endosomes. By numerically solving the equation, we obtained cluster density distributions that account for the temporal evolution of nanoparticle aggregates. Our model predictions were validated against experimental data on gold nanoparticles, demonstrating a satisfactory agreement. The results indicate that the clustering dynamics are influenced by the initial nanoparticle concentration and the endosomal environment. Notably, our analysis reveals that the cluster size distribution follows a power-law decay, consistent with experimental observations. This work provides a theoretical framework for understanding nanoparticle clustering within cells, shedding light on the complex interactions between nanoparticles and cellular compartments. The findings have implications for the design of nanoparticle-based delivery systems and the interpretation of nanoparticle-cell interactions. (2022)
