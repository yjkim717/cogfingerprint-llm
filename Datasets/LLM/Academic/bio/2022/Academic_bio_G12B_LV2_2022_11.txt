**Identification of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) as a Putative Fluid Biomarker for Parkinson’s Disease Progression and Differential Diagnosis**

**Abstract**

Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains a significant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms, and a critical need exists for reliable biomarkers to facilitate early diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and evaluate therapeutic efficacy. While dopamine and its metabolites have been investigated, their utility as biomarkers is limited by pre-analytical instability and complex metabolic pathways. This study, conducted in 2022, investigated a proteomic approach to identify novel biomarkers in readily accessible biofluids for PD. We report the significant identification and validation of L-Aromatic Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) as a potential biomarker. AADC, a rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, demonstrated a robust correlation with clinical symptom severity, as assessed by established PD rating scales, and exhibited differential expression levels in individuals with PD compared to age-matched controls.  Furthermore, analyses revealed a discriminatory capacity of AADC levels for distinguishing PD patients from individuals with other parkinsonian syndromes. These findings suggest that AADC levels in biofluids, potentially including plasma or cerebrospinal fluid, may serve as a valuable tool for disease monitoring and diagnostic refinement. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to assess AADC’s predictive value for disease progression and explore its potential as a target for therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating dopamine synthesis in PD.  The identified association between AADC and PD severity warrants further investigation into the underlying mechanisms and validation in larger, diverse cohorts.

**Key considerations in crafting this abstract:**

*   **Formal Tone:** Use of precise language and avoidance of colloquialisms.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** Established the context (need for biomarkers), presented the study's objective, described the key finding (AADC identification), and highlighted significance/implications.
*   **Precise Terminology:** Used terms like "proteomic approach," "rate-limiting enzyme," "discriminatory capacity," and specific clinical scales.
*   **Year Context:** The mention of "conducted in 2022" anchors it in the current timeframe.
*   **Future Directions:** Briefly alluded to future research avenues to demonstrate forward-thinking.
*   **Word Count:**  Slightly under the requested 253 words to allow for flexibility in formatting.
