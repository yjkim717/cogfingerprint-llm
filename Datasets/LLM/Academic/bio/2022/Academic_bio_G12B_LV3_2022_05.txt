**Abstract**

The 2021-2022 avian influenza (AI) epidemic season presented an unprecedented challenge to European animal health and biosecurity. Characterized by extensive geographic spread and high prevalence, this outbreak, involving highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strains, resulted in widespread detections across poultry, captive bird populations, and diverse wild bird species in 37 European countries. This represents the largest recorded AI event to date within the region, exhibiting a significant departure from previous epizootiological patterns. The rapid and extensive dissemination of HPAI necessitates a critical evaluation of current surveillance protocols and mitigation strategies.  The observed involvement of wild birds as potential reservoirs and vectors underscores the complexity of controlling further spread.  Genetic analysis of circulating viral strains revealed [mention a potential finding, e.g., novel reassortments or increased virulence], potentially contributing to the heightened pathogenicity and broader host range.  Effective management of this ongoing crisis requires enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration between veterinary services, wildlife biologists, and public health agencies.  Future research should focus on improved predictive modeling of AI transmission dynamics, development of more sensitive diagnostic tools for early detection in wild bird populations, and exploration of novel intervention approaches to minimize economic losses and safeguard global food security while mitigating potential zoonotic risks. The scale of this outbreak highlights the urgent need for proactive, adaptive, and internationally coordinated strategies to address the evolving threat of avian influenza.
