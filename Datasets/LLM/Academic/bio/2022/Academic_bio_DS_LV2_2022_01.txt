**Abstract**

The precise quantification of intracellular nanoparticle clustering is critical for predicting nanomaterial fate and therapeutic efficacy. While endosomal fusion drives nanoparticle aggregation, a predictive, quantitative framework for the resulting cluster density within a biological milieu has been lacking. In this study, we derive an analytical solution for nanoparticle cluster density by adapting Smoluchowski's coagulation equation to model the dynamic, diffusion-limited environment of the cellular endosomal network. This theoretical model provides a closed-form expression for the temporal evolution of cluster distributions. We rigorously validate our derivation against experimental data from intracellular trafficking studies of citrate-capped gold nanoparticles in HeLa cells. The strong concordance between our theoretical predictions and empirical results confirms the model's robustness, establishing a foundational tool for optimizing nanocarrier design by enabling the *a priori* prediction of aggregation behavior in complex biological systems.
