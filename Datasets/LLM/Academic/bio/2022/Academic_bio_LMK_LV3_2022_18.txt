Title: Enhanced Biosecurity Measures in Response to the 2021-2022 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Outbreak in Europe

Abstract:
The 2021-2022 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) epidemic season in Europe was characterized by an unprecedented scale of outbreaks in poultry, captive birds, and wild avifauna. The severity of the epidemic necessitated immediate action to mitigate the risk of further transmission and protect the poultry industry. In response, enhanced biosecurity measures were urgently implemented across affected regions. This study examines the efficacy of these measures in controlling HPAI outbreaks and assesses their impact on the poultry sector. By analyzing epidemiological data and biosecurity protocols, we evaluate the effectiveness of enhanced biosecurity in reducing HPAI transmission. Our findings inform evidence-based policy recommendations for future HPAI mitigation strategies, emphasizing the critical role of robust biosecurity measures in preventing large-scale outbreaks. The results of this research contribute to the ongoing development of HPAI management policies in Europe.
