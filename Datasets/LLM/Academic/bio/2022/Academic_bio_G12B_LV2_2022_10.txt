## Enhanced Peptide Identification in Proteomics via Deep Learning-Augmented Rescoring within FragPipe

**Abstract:** Accurate peptide identification remains a critical bottleneck in quantitative proteomics workflows. While established search engines like FragPipe provide robust initial peptide identification, false positive identifications and suboptimal scoring can hinder downstream analyses. This study introduces an integrated deep learning approach to improve peptide identification accuracy within the FragPipe processing pipeline. Leveraging the MSBooster software, we implemented a deep learning model trained on extensive tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data to predict peptide physicochemical properties, specifically fragmentation patterns. These predictions are then utilized to rescore initial peptide matches generated by FragPipe, effectively weighting identifications based on their consistency with predicted spectral characteristics. Preliminary results demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in false peptide identifications and a concomitant improvement in overall peptide identification confidence scores. This integration of deep learning-based rescoring represents a promising advancement in proteomics data analysis, offering the potential to enhance the reliability of quantitative protein measurements and downstream biological inferences. The methodology provides a computationally efficient and readily implementable solution for improving the performance of existing proteomics pipelines, contributing to more robust and reproducible research outcomes.
