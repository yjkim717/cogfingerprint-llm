Title: Unprecedented Outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus during the 2021-2022 Epidemic Season in Europe

Abstract:

The 2021-2022 epidemic season witnessed an unparalleled surge in the incidence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (HPAIV) across Europe, underscoring the escalating threat posed by this zoonotic pathogen to both poultry and wild bird populations. Between June and September 2022, a total of 788 detections were reported, marking this period as the largest HPAIV epidemic season on record in the region. The rapid dissemination of HPAIV among wild birds and poultry underscores the complex interplay between ecological, anthropogenic, and virological factors that facilitate the emergence and spread of this disease. The substantial economic and animal welfare impacts of this outbreak highlight the imperative for stringent biosecurity measures to be implemented across poultry farms and holdings. Enhanced surveillance and robust disease control strategies are crucial to mitigating the risk of HPAIV transmission and containing outbreaks in a timely and effective manner. This study emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach, integrating insights from epidemiology, virology, and wildlife ecology, to inform evidence-based policy and guide the development of targeted interventions aimed at reducing the risk of HPAIV spread. By elucidating the dynamics of HPAIV transmission and identifying key risk factors, this research contributes to the ongoing efforts to protect animal health and mitigate the socio-economic impacts of avian influenza outbreaks.
