**Abstract**

The intracellular trafficking of nanoparticles presents a complex challenge for understanding their biodistribution and potential therapeutic effects. This study examines the dynamics of gold nanoparticle clusters within mammalian cells, employing a quantitative approach to investigate cluster formation and evolution. Utilizing Smoluchowskiâ€™s equation, we modeled the growth of nanoparticle clusters based on theoretical considerations of Brownian motion and stochastic aggregation. Specifically, we determined cluster density as a function of nanoparticle concentration and incubation time, establishing a predictive framework for cluster formation. 

Experimental validation involved observing nanoparticle accumulation within endosomes via fluorescence microscopy.  Comparative analysis of predicted cluster densities from the Smoluchowski model with observed cluster density within endosomes revealed a moderate degree of correlation, suggesting the equation provides a useful, albeit simplified, representation of this process.  Further refinement incorporating factors such as endosomal membrane interactions is warranted to improve predictive accuracy and fully elucidate the mechanisms governing nanoparticle cluster behavior within the cellular environment.
