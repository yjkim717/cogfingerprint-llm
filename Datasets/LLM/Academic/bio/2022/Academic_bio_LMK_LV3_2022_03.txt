Title: Enhanced Lignocellulose Degradation in Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Multiple-Gene Mutagenesis

Abstract:
The efficient degradation of lignocellulose is crucial for the industrial application of Pleurotus ostreatus, a fungus renowned for its ligninolytic capabilities. Leveraging the precision of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, this study introduces a novel multiple-gene mutation strategy in P. ostreatus, utilizing a polycistronic tRNA-gRNA (PTG) approach to facilitate simultaneous editing of multiple genomic loci. By targeting genes involved in lignocellulose degradation, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the mutagenesis efficiency, yielding mutants with improved ligninolytic activity. The PTG-CRISPR/Cas9 system enables the generation of complex genotypes, thereby expanding the genetic diversity of P. ostreatus for biotechnological applications. Our findings underscore the potential of this precision genome editing tool in optimizing fungal strains for enhanced lignocellulose degradation, with implications for sustainable biorefining and bioenergy production. This research advances the genetic engineering of P. ostreatus, paving the way for future industrial applications.
