**Abstract**

The ghrelin system, comprising the peptide hormone ghrelin, its endogenous receptor GHS-R, and the activating enzyme ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), represents a multifaceted signaling network with emerging significance in gastrointestinal pathophysiology. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), its role is notably dichotomous. While ghrelin has demonstrated pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects in various *in vitro* and *in vivo* models, potentially fueling carcinogenesis and tumor progression, other studies suggest context-dependent tumor-suppressive properties. This review, contextualized within 2022, synthesizes current evidence to delineate the complex involvement of the ghrelin system in key oncogenic processes, including cell cycle regulation, survival signaling, and angiogenesis. We critically evaluate the expression profiles of GHS-R and GOAT in CRC tissues, assessing their potential as diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Despite promising preclinical data, the precise molecular mechanisms remain elusive, and the system's prognostic value is not yet defined. We conclude that a deeper understanding of the ghrelin system's intricate signaling crosstalk is imperative to resolve existing controversies and unlock its potential for novel CRC management strategies.
