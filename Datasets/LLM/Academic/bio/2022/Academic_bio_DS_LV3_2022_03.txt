**Abstract**

The white-rot fungus *Pleurotus ostreatus* is a model organism for studying lignocellulose degradation, a process critical for biotechnological applications in biofuel production and bioremediation. However, functional genomic studies in this basidiomycete have been hindered by the inherent inefficiency of inducing multiplex mutagenesis through conventional methods. In this study, we report the development and validation of a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based system for high-efficiency, multiple-gene editing in *P. ostreatus*. Our approach leverages a synthetic polycistronic tRNA-gRNA (PTG) architecture, wherein multiple guide RNA (gRNA) units are processed from a single transcript through the endogenous tRNA-processing machinery. We systematically optimized this system by screening a panel of RNA polymerase III promoters and tRNA sequences to identify configurations that maximize the expression and subsequent liberation of individual gRNAs. The optimized PTG system demonstrated a marked improvement in editing efficiency, achieving a triple-gene mutation frequency of up to 20% in protoplast transformations, a significant advancement over previous methodologies. Targeted disruption of a suite of genes encoding key lignin-modifying enzymes confirmed the system's efficacy and enabled a preliminary functional analysis of their synergistic roles in lignocellulose deconstruction. This robust and scalable platform for multiplex genome engineering in *P. ostreatus* not only facilitates a deeper mechanistic understanding of fungal wood decay but also paves the way for the rational engineering of superior fungal strains for industrial biocatalysis.
