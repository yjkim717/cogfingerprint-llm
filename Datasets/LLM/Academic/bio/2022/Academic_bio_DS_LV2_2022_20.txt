**Abstract**

Anthropogenic climate change is driving a global reorganization of biodiversity, with species shifting their distributions to track suitable climatic conditions. Mountainous regions, characterized by steep elevation gradients, serve as critical natural laboratories for observing these shifts, as they compress a wide range of climatic conditions over short geographical distances. However, a lack of standardized, long-term monitoring data has hindered robust cross-regional comparisons and a unified understanding of the pace and drivers of these biotic responses. To address this critical methodological gap, the Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN) has developed and implemented a standardized protocol for monitoring temporal changes in plant species distributions along elevation transects. This protocol systematically quantifies the occupancy, abundance, and upper and lower distribution limits of both native and non-native plant species at regular elevational intervals. By applying this harmonized methodology across a globally distributed network of mountain regions, we can generate comparable data to disentangle the complex interplay of climate warming, land-use change, and biotic interactions in shaping novel plant communities. Initial findings from this coordinated effort are already revealing accelerated colonization rates of non-native species into high-elevation ecosystems, often outpacing the upward migration of native flora. This standardized approach provides an empirical foundation for testing macroecological hypotheses about community assembly under global change and is an indispensable tool for informing proactive conservation strategies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change on mountain biodiversity worldwide.
