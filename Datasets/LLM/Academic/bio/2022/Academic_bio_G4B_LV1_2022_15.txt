**Abstract**

The ghrelin system, traditionally implicated in appetite regulation, is increasingly recognized for its complex interactions within the tumor microenvironment. This study investigates the involvement of the ghrelin signaling pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression, hypothesizing a role for both autocrine and paracrine signaling mechanisms. We propose that aberrant ghrelin signaling, specifically mediated by ghrelin receptor subtypes (ghs-rs), contributes to enhanced cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis in CRC. Preliminary data suggests that elevated ghrelin levels within CRC cells stimulate downstream MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, promoting cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. Furthermore, ghrelin secreted by CRC cells appears to foster a pro-tumorigenic environment by modulating stromal cell behavior.  Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise ghs-rs involved and to determine the potential of targeting the ghrelin system as a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for CRC.
