## Abstract: Robust Inference of Dynamic Transcriptomes via Markovian Modeling of RNA Velocity

The emerging field of RNA velocity leverages unspliced mRNA abundance to infer transcriptional dynamics within biological systems. While promising, current RNA velocity estimation techniques, particularly those relying on diffusion-based models, exhibit sensitivity to parameter choices and assumptions regarding transcriptional bursting and mRNA decay rates. This study, conducted in 2022, investigates the workflow sensitivity of prevalent RNA velocity methods applied to diverse biological datasets, revealing substantial variance in inferred trajectories dependent on parameter selection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Markovian framework for RNA velocity estimation. This framework explicitly models transcriptional dynamics as a discrete-time Markov process, allowing for a more robust and interpretable representation of cellular state transitions. By constraining the model to a Markovian assumption, we mitigate the impact of inaccurate parameter estimation and reduce the influence of long-range dependencies often problematic in diffusion models.  We demonstrate, through simulations and analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data, that our Markovian approach yields more stable and biologically plausible velocity fields, particularly in scenarios characterized by complex transcriptional regulation and variable mRNA turnover. We further provide a practical workflow for implementation and sensitivity assessment, promoting greater reliability in RNA velocity-based analyses.
