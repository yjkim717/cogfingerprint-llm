**Abstract**

The intracellular trafficking of nanoparticles represents a critical, yet incompletely understood, facet of their biological impact. This study examines the formation and dynamics of nanoparticle clusters within endosomal compartments, utilizing a theoretical framework grounded in Smoluchowski’s equation to model cluster density. Employing gold nanoparticles as a model system, we investigated the stochastic aggregation processes occurring within simulated endosomal environments.  Our analysis predicts a relationship between particle concentration, diffusion coefficients, and the resultant cluster density, quantified through the parameters of the Smoluchowski equation.  Preliminary results demonstrate a strong correlation between theoretical cluster density forecasts and observed nanoparticle aggregation patterns via fluorescence microscopy.  Further investigation will focus on validating these findings across varying endosomal maturation stages and exploring the influence of cellular factors on nanoparticle cluster formation – ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of nanoparticle behavior within living cells.
