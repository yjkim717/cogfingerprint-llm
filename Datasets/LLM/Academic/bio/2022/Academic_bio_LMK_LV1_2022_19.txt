In 2022, advancements in perovskite catalysis revealed that surface Fe sites and Sr vacancies synergistically enhance the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) via lattice oxygen oxidation. Our study demonstrates that this optimized perovskite catalyst reduces the OER energy barrier, facilitating improved electrocatalytic activity. Mechanistic insights into lattice oxygen oxidation elucidate the role of surface Fe sites and Sr vacancies, providing a framework for designing high-performance OER catalysts.
