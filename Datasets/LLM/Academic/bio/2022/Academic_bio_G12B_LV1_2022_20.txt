**Standardized Elevation Gradient Monitoring for Assessing Biogeographic Shifts and Invasive Species Dynamics in Mountain Ecosystems**

Mountain ecosystems are biodiversity hotspots disproportionately vulnerable to the accelerating impacts of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Understanding how plant species distributions respond to these pressures is crucial for effective conservation management, yet current monitoring efforts often lack the standardization necessary for robust, cross-site comparisons. Here, we propose and advocate for the widespread adoption of a globally applicable, standardized protocol—the Mountain Invasive Species Elevation Response Network (MIREN) protocol—for monitoring plant species distributions along elevational gradients. Building upon initial framework development, this protocol emphasizes rigorous site selection, consistent vegetation survey methodology (including plot size, sampling frequency, and species identification), and standardized data reporting formats.

MIREN facilitates the detection of subtle, yet significant, shifts in species ranges in response to changing environmental conditions, particularly along the critical elevation axis.  This allows for the differentiation of climate-driven range contractions or expansions from the effects of localized disturbances. Furthermore, the protocol explicitly incorporates the monitoring of invasive plant species, recognizing the synergistic threat they pose when interacting with climate change and altered disturbance regimes.  Specifically, we highlight the potential for MIREN to track elevational shifts in invasive species, predict future spread patterns, and inform targeted eradication efforts.

This paper outlines the core components of the MIREN protocol and discusses its utility in addressing key research questions regarding alpine biodiversity, biogeographic responses to climate change, and the dynamics of plant invasions. We argue that the establishment of a global MIREN network would provide a critical baseline dataset for assessing ecosystem vulnerability, informing adaptive management strategies, and ultimately, contributing to the long-term resilience of mountain ecosystems in a rapidly changing world. Initial pilot studies demonstrate feasibility and highlight the potential for data integration with remote sensing and ecological modeling approaches to further enhance predictive capabilities.
