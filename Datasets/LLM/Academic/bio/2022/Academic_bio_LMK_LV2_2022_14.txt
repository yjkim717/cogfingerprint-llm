Title: Exact Cluster Density Derivation for Nanoparticle Distribution using Smoluchowski's Coagulation Equation: Implications for Nanodiagnostics

Abstract:
The clustering distribution of nanoparticles is a crucial aspect in the field of nanodiagnostics, as it directly influences the efficacy of diagnostic tools. In this study, we derive an exact cluster density of nanoparticles by analytically solving Smoluchowski's coagulation equation, a well-established mathematical framework for modeling particle aggregation. Our derivation provides a precise description of the cluster distribution, enabling accurate prediction of nanoparticle clustering behavior. Validation against experimental data on gold nanoparticle distribution demonstrates excellent agreement, underscoring the validity of our approach. The derived cluster density has significant implications for the optimization of nanodiagnostic applications, where precise control over nanoparticle distribution is paramount. This work contributes to the advancement of nanodiagnostics by providing a robust theoretical framework for understanding nanoparticle clustering dynamics. (2022)
