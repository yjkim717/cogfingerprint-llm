This study critically evaluates RNA velocity methodologies through mathematical modeling and parameter sensitivity analysis. We demonstrate that current approaches exhibit significant sensitivity to kinetic parameter assumptions, limiting their biological interpretability. By developing a Markovian analytical framework, we establish robust probabilistic transitions between transcriptional states. Validation across diverse biological datasets confirms improved trajectory inference accuracy. Our work provides both theoretical foundations and practical refinements for RNA velocity applications in single-cell genomics, addressing key limitations in dynamical cellular process characterization.
