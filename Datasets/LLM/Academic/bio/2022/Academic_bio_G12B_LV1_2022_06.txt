**Abstract**

The pursuit of sustainable energy solutions necessitates the development of efficient catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a crucial bottleneck in water splitting. Drawing inspiration from metalloenzymes exhibiting remarkable OER activity, this study explores the potential of a bio-mimetic perovskite oxide material incorporating iron and strontium as catalytic centers. We hypothesize that the synergistic interplay between surface Fe redox sites and inherent Sr vacancies within the perovskite lattice promotes efficient lattice oxygen oxidation, driving OER kinetics.  Characterization techniques, including X-ray absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveal a strong correlation between the concentration of surface Fe species and OER performance. These findings suggest that strategically engineering defect structures – specifically, Sr vacancies – and modulating surface Fe coordination can significantly enhance catalytic efficiency, representing a promising avenue for bio-inspired OER catalyst design.
