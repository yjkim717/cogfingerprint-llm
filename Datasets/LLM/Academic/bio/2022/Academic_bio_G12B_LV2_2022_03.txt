Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, aiming for precision, structured reasoning, and appropriate terminology, reflecting a 2022 publication context, based on the provided summary.  I've aimed for around 218 words, and included a few expansions relevant to the topic to create a more complete abstract.

**Abstract**

The efficient manipulation of fungal genomes remains a critical bottleneck in the study of complex metabolic processes, particularly those related to lignocellulose degradation. Here, we report a novel and highly effective strategy for generating multiple-gene mutations in *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a commercially significant basidiomycete with substantial potential for biomass conversion. Our approach leverages a tRNA-guided single guide RNA (tRNA-sgRNA) system utilizing the CRISPR-Cas9 machinery, circumventing limitations associated with traditional multi-gene editing techniques. This method exploits the inherent processing activity of tRNA precursors to generate functional sgRNAs, dramatically simplifying multiplexed genome editing workflows. We demonstrate the successful implementation of this tRNA-sgRNA strategy to induce targeted mutations in genes implicated in lignocellulose degradation pathways within *P. ostreatus*. Initial results indicate a significantly improved mutation efficiency compared to previously reported methods.  This innovative tool facilitates a more rapid and precise investigation into the genetic determinants of fungal cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic activity, enabling the rational engineering of strains with enhanced biomass deconstruction capabilities. Further, the adaptability of this tRNA-sgRNA system suggests broad applicability for genome engineering across diverse fungal species, potentially accelerating advancements in biofuel production and sustainable bioprocessing. This work represents a significant step forward in fungal metabolic engineering and contributes to the development of more efficient and sustainable approaches to biomass utilization.
