Title: Investigating the Relationship Between Iron Deficiency Anemia and Cognitive Impairment in Women: A Systematic Review of P300 Evoked Potentials

Abstract:

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a prevalent nutritional disorder affecting cognitive function, particularly in women of reproductive age. The P300 evoked potential is a reliable neurophysiological marker for assessing cognitive processing. This systematic review aims to elucidate the impact of IDA on cognitive function in women using P300 as a cognitive assessment tool. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, for studies published between 2010 and 2022. Studies examining the relationship between IDA and cognitive function in women, utilizing P300 evoked potentials as an outcome measure, were included. The search yielded 12 eligible studies, involving 846 participants, which met the inclusion criteria. The results indicate that women with IDA exhibited significantly prolonged P300 latencies and reduced amplitudes compared to non-anemic controls, suggesting impaired cognitive processing. Furthermore, the meta-analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between hemoglobin levels and P300 amplitude, as well as a negative correlation between hemoglobin levels and P300 latency. The findings of this systematic review suggest that IDA is associated with mild cognitive decline, as evidenced by altered P300 evoked potentials. The study's results have implications for the early detection and treatment of cognitive impairment in women with IDA, highlighting the potential utility of P300 as a diagnostic biomarker. Future research should focus on elucidating the underlying mechanisms and investigating the efficacy of iron supplementation on cognitive function in IDA-affected women.
