"This study presents a rigorous assessment of RNA velocity methodologies via Markovian analysis, leveraging simulated and empirical bio datasets to scrutinize underlying assumptions and parameter choices. Through systematic evaluation of workflow sensitivity, we elucidate the impact of mathematical modelling decisions on inferred velocity estimates, providing insights into optimal parameter configurations and informing best practices for robust RNA velocity analysis in 2022."
