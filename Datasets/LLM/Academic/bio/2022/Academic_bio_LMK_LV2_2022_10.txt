Title: Enhancing Peptide Identification via Deep Learning-based Rescoring in LC-MS/MS Analysis

Abstract:
Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) coupled with liquid chromatography (LC) is a cornerstone technique for proteomic analysis, enabling the identification of peptides and proteins in complex biological samples. However, the accuracy of peptide identification via database search algorithms remains a challenge. To address this limitation, we present MSBooster, a novel deep learning-based approach that enhances peptide identification rates by rescoring peptide-to-spectrum matches (PSMs). By leveraging features extracted from MS/MS spectra and incorporating them into a deep learning framework, MSBooster improves the discriminative power between correct and incorrect PSMs. Our results demonstrate that MSBooster significantly enhances peptide identification rates compared to traditional database search methods. By integrating MSBooster into existing proteomics pipelines, researchers can improve the accuracy and reliability of their findings, ultimately advancing our understanding of complex biological systems. This methodological advancement has significant implications for the field of proteomics and beyond.
