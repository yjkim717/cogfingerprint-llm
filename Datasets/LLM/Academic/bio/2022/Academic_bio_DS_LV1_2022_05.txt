**Abstract**

The 2022-2023 epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), primarily driven by the A(H5N1) subtype of the influenza A virus, constituted an unprecedented panzootic event across Europe. This epizootic was characterized by an exceptional geographical scope and virulence, surpassing all previously recorded outbreaks in both scale and ecological impact. A primary manifestation was a surge in severe outbreaks within commercial and backyard poultry holdings, leading to substantial economic losses and necessitating extensive culling operations. Concurrently, and of significant ecological concern, was the virus's spillover into wild avifauna, resulting in mass mortality events among resident and migratory bird populations, particularly in colonial seabirds and raptors, with demonstrable impacts on vulnerable species' conservation status. Phylogenetic analyses indicated the circulation of novel reassortant clades of H5N1, which exhibited enhanced fitness and environmental persistence, facilitating year-round viral circulationâ€”a departure from the previously observed seasonal patterns of low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI). The epidemiological trajectory underscored a critical shift in transmission dynamics; rather than sporadic introductions from wild birds, the virus established endemicity within wild populations, creating a persistent reservoir that perpetuated spillover events into the poultry sector. This necessitated a paradigm shift in mitigation strategies, moving beyond reactive culling to the proactive, large-scale implementation of stringent, multi-layered biosecurity protocols. Enhanced passive and active surveillance systems, integrating molecular diagnostics and syndromic monitoring, became imperative for early detection and rapid response. The 2022 HPAI epizootic thus represents a pivotal case study in the escalating interface between wildlife disease ecology and agricultural biosecurity, highlighting the urgent need for a coordinated, One Health approach to manage the endemic threat of HPAI viruses.
