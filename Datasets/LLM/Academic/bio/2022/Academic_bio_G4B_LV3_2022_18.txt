**Abstract**

The year 2022 witnessed a dramatic escalation of avian influenza (HPAI) activity across Europe, representing the most extensive epizootic event documented to date. This unprecedented outbreak, primarily driven by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, triggered widespread mortality within poultry populations, necessitating large-scale depopulation measures. Crucially, surveillance efforts revealed an expansion of HPAI infection into wild bird populations – notably waterfowl – exceeding previous records. These detections underscore a shift in transmission dynamics, suggesting a broadening reservoir and potential for increased zoonotic risk. Consequently, rapid and coordinated biosecurity protocols, coupled with enhanced surveillance of wild bird populations, were implemented to mitigate further spread. Further research is vital to fully characterize viral evolution, assess long-term ecological impacts, and refine preventative strategies to manage future HPAI outbreaks.
