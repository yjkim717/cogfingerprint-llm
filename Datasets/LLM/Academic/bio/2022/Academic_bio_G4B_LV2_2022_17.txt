**Abstract**

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) represents a prevalent and often underrecognized contributor to cognitive impairment, particularly in women. This systematic review investigates the association between IDA and alterations in neural processing, specifically focusing on the P300 wave latency â€“ a critical component of the cognitive evoked potential (CEP) reflecting attentional allocation and working memory. Utilizing a comprehensive search strategy across multiple databases, we synthesized existing evidence to assess the impact of IDA on P300 measures. Preliminary findings suggest a statistically significant relationship between lower iron stores and prolonged P300 wave latency in female populations. 

The observed delay in P300 wave latency may indicate compromised prefrontal cortex function, a region implicated in executive cognitive processes. This research posits that IDA could serve as a sensitive biomarker for early detection of cognitive decline, potentially offering a non-invasive screening tool prior to the manifestation of overt neurological deficits. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association, including exploring the role of oxidative stress and inflammation.  Future studies should standardize assessment protocols and incorporate longitudinal designs to determine the predictive value of P300 changes in women with IDA regarding long-term cognitive trajectories.
