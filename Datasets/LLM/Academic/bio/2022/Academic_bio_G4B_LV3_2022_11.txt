**Abstract**

Recent investigations into Parkinson’s disease (PD) have increasingly focused on identifying sensitive and specific biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease monitoring. This study utilized cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to explore novel indicators of PD pathogenesis. Analysis revealed a significant upregulation of L-Aromatic Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) expression in patients diagnosed with PD, correlating positively with the severity of motor symptom presentation. Furthermore, AADC levels demonstrated a clear discriminatory capacity, effectively differentiating PD from Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in a cohort of longitudinally monitored patients. These findings suggest that AADC represents a promising biomarker candidate for PD.  Further research is warranted to validate these results across larger, more diverse populations and to elucidate the precise mechanism underlying AADC’s role in dopamine synthesis and PD progression.  The identification of AADC as a CSF biomarker could facilitate earlier intervention strategies and improved patient outcomes.
