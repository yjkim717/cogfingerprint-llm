Title: Phosphorylated Tau Subgroups in Alzheimer's Disease: Distinct Amyloid Production and Synaptic Integrity Profiles in Cerebrospinal Fluid

Abstract:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by heterogeneous pathological features, including amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and tau protein phosphorylation. Recent studies have identified distinct phosphorylated tau (p-tau) subgroups within AD, suggesting potential variability in disease mechanisms and progression. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between p-tau subgroups and amyloid production and synaptic integrity profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

Using a cohort of 250 AD patients and 150 healthy controls, we analyzed CSF samples for p-tau subgroup classification, Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, and synaptic protein levels (e.g., neurogranin and synaptotagmin). We employed a combination of mass spectrometry and immunoassay techniques to quantify p-tau species and synaptic proteins. Multivariate statistical analysis and machine learning algorithms were applied to identify correlations between p-tau subgroups and amyloid production and synaptic integrity profiles.

Our results demonstrate that AD patients can be stratified into three distinct p-tau subgroups based on CSF p-tau profiles: p-tau subgroup 1 (characterized by high p-tau181 and p-tau217 levels), p-tau subgroup 2 (marked by elevated p-tau231 and p-tau235 levels), and p-tau subgroup 3 (defined by increased p-tau199 and p-tau202 levels). Notably, these subgroups exhibited distinct amyloid production profiles, with p-tau subgroup 1 showing the lowest Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, indicative of enhanced amyloidogenic processing. Conversely, p-tau subgroup 3 displayed relatively preserved Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios, suggesting reduced amyloid production.

Furthermore, our analysis revealed subgroup-specific synaptic integrity profiles. P-tau subgroup 2 was associated with elevated neurogranin and synaptotagmin levels, indicating significant synaptic damage. In contrast, p-tau subgroup 1 showed relatively lower synaptic protein levels, suggesting a more preserved synaptic integrity.

Our findings provide evidence that p-tau subgroups in AD are related to distinct amyloid production and synaptic integrity profiles, as reflected in CSF biomarkers. These results have significant implications for understanding AD heterogeneity, disease progression, and potential therapeutic targeting. The identification of p-tau subgroup-specific biomarkers may enable more precise diagnosis and monitoring of AD, ultimately informing personalized treatment strategies.

This study highlights the importance of integrating p-tau subgroup analysis with amyloid and synaptic integrity assessments to elucidate the complex pathophysiology of AD. Future research should focus on validating these findings and exploring the clinical utility of p-tau subgroup stratification in AD management.
