**Abstract**

Recent advancements in electrocatalysis have increasingly focused on perovskite materials for their potential in facilitating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). This research, conducted in 2022, explores the mechanistic contributions of surface iron (Fe) sites and strontium (Sr) vacancies within a specific perovskite structure to enhanced OER performance.  We hypothesize that these structural defects promote lattice oxygen oxidation, a critical step in the OER pathway.  Analysis revealed a strong correlation between the density of surface Fe sites and the observed kinetic enhancement, suggesting a role in facilitating electron transfer. Furthermore, the presence of Sr vacancies appears to stabilize the perovskite lattice, mitigating degradation and contributing to sustained catalytic activity.  These findings provide valuable insights into optimizing perovskite catalysts for efficient and durable OER applications.
