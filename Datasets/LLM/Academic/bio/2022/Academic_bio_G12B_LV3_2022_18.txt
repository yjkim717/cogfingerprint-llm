**Abstract:**

The year 2022 witnessed an unprecedented avian influenza (AI) epidemic across Europe, representing the largest outbreak on record and posing significant challenges to animal health and global biosecurity. This epidemic was characterized by extensive geographic distribution, with confirmed detections of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in poultry, captive bird populations, and a diverse range of wild bird species across 37 European countries.  Notably, the outbreak featured the emergence and rapid dissemination of novel viral genotypes, particularly clade 2.3.4.4b, demonstrating enhanced transmissibility and virulence.  Surveillance data revealed widespread circulation of the virus among migratory waterfowl, facilitating long-distance spread and contributing to the sustained epidemic activity.  Furthermore, concerningly, 2022 saw an increase in documented instances of mammalian spillover events, including transmission to mustelids, foxes, and even domestic cats, suggesting a potential adaptation of the virus to mammalian hosts and raising the specter of zoonotic risk. Phylogenetic analyses indicate complex evolutionary dynamics, with evidence of reassortment and genetic drift contributing to the evolving antigenic landscape.  The scale and persistence of this HPAI epidemic underscore the urgent need for enhanced surveillance programs, improved biosecurity measures within poultry production systems, and intensified research efforts focused on understanding viral adaptation mechanisms and developing effective mitigation strategies to safeguard both animal and human health. Future research should prioritize investigations into the ecological drivers of spillover and the potential for sustained mammalian transmission.
