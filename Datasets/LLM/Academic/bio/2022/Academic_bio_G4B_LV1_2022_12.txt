**Abstract**

Accurate estimation of transcriptional dynamics is increasingly vital for understanding cellular regulation and developmental processes.  Traditional RNA velocity methods, while promising, often exhibit limitations in sensitivity and robustness, particularly when applied to complex biological datasets. This study introduces a refined Markovian framework for RNA velocity estimation, leveraging a rigorous probabilistic approach to mitigate common sources of error. We detail the key parameter choices within the model – including selection of transition rates and state durations – and explicitly outline the underlying assumptions inherent in the analysis.  Employing this framework, we demonstrate enhanced performance in characterizing nascent transcript production and decay across a diverse set of experimental conditions.  The proposed methodology offers a significant advancement in workflow sensitivity and provides a more reliable tool for interpreting dynamic RNA signals within biological systems, warranting its application to a broader range of transcriptomic investigations.
