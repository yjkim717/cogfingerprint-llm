**Abstract:**

The ghrelin system, traditionally recognized for its role in appetite regulation and energy homeostasis, has emerged as a significant modulator of tumorigenesis and cancer progression across various malignancies. This review synthesizes current understanding of the ghrelin system's multifaceted influence on colorectal cancer (CRC), a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. We examine the intricate interplay between ghrelin, its receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor – GHS-R1a), and the tumor microenvironment, highlighting how ghrelin signaling impacts CRC initiation, proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Evidence suggests that elevated circulating ghrelin levels and increased GHS-R1a expression in CRC tissues are frequently associated with advanced disease stages and poorer patient prognosis. Notably, ghrelin’s pro-tumorigenic effects are mediated through diverse mechanisms, including activation of the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways, promotion of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and suppression of apoptosis. Furthermore, we explore the potential of ghrelin and GHS-R1a as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for CRC, discussing the challenges and opportunities in utilizing these markers for early detection and risk stratification. Finally, this review evaluates the therapeutic landscape targeting the ghrelin system in CRC, encompassing both ghrelin receptor antagonists and strategies aimed at modulating ghrelin secretion, and considers future directions for clinical development to improve patient outcomes. The complex and often paradoxical roles of the ghrelin system necessitates further investigation to fully elucidate its contribution to colon carcinogenesis and to harness its potential for targeted therapeutic interventions.
