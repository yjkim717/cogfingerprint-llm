**Abstract**

The intracellular trafficking of nanoparticles represents a critical area of investigation for understanding their biological effects and potential therapeutic applications. This study examined the spatial distribution of gold nanoparticle clusters within mammalian cells, hypothesizing a relationship between cluster density and cellular uptake mechanisms. Utilizing a modified Smoluchowski equation, we quantitatively assessed cluster density at various time points following nanoparticle introduction, correlating these values with observed endosomal accumulation.  Our findings suggest a dynamic process wherein nanoparticle aggregation, governed by Brownian motion and attractive forces, leads to a measurable increase in cluster density.  Specifically, the calculated cluster density exhibited a statistically significant correlation (p<0.05) with the observed concentration of nanoparticles within endosomes. These results provide a framework for predicting nanoparticle behavior within complex biological environments and highlight the importance of considering cluster dynamics when evaluating nanoparticle-mediated cellular interactions. Further research will focus on elucidating the specific biophysical mechanisms driving this aggregation.
