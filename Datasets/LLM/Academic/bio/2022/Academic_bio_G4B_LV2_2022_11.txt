**Abstract**

Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains a significant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor and non-motor deficits. Current diagnostic methods often rely on clinical presentation and response to dopaminergic therapies, highlighting the need for improved biomarkers to facilitate early detection and predict disease trajectory. This study investigated the potential of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to identify novel biomarkers for PD. Utilizing a targeted proteomic approach, we analyzed CSF samples from individuals diagnosed with PD and a control cohort, assessing correlations between protein expression and clinical measures of disease progression. 

Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant association between L-Aromatic Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) activity and the severity of PD symptoms, as evidenced by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores.  Specifically, elevated AADC levels were observed in patients with more advanced disease stages.  These results suggest that AADC represents a promising biomarker for PD progression. Further research, including longitudinal studies and validation across diverse patient populations, is warranted to fully elucidate the role of AADC in PD pathogenesis and its potential utility in clinical management.
