**Novel Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker Identification for Parkinson’s Disease via Proteomic Analysis**

Parkinson’s disease (PD) presents a significant diagnostic challenge, often relying on clinical presentation and limited neuroimaging. This study investigated the potential of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to identify novel biomarkers for PD. Utilizing a high-resolution mass spectrometry platform, we analyzed CSF samples from a cohort of PD patients and age-matched controls, alongside individuals with Autistic-Dissociative Disorder with Cataplexy (ADDC) to assess diagnostic differentiation.  Notably, L-Aromatic Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) exhibited a statistically significant and robust correlation with disease severity as quantified by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Furthermore, AADC levels demonstrated a clear discriminatory capacity, effectively differentiating PD from the ADDC cohort. These findings suggest that AADC represents a promising biomarker for early PD detection and severity stratification. Further research is warranted to validate these results across larger patient populations and explore the underlying pathogenic mechanisms associated with altered AADC expression in PD.
