**Abstract**

Accurate peptide identification remains a critical challenge in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based proteomics, where conventional database search engines can yield significant false discovery rates. In 2022, we introduce MSBooster, a novel post-processing tool integrated within the FragPipe computational environment that leverages deep learning to enhance the discrimination of correct peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). MSBooster employs deep neural networks to predict key peptide properties, such as retention time, ion mobility, and fragment ion intensities, generating additional, highly discriminative features. These predicted properties are then used to rescore PSMs, effectively augmenting traditional score functions. Our evaluation across diverse datasets and search engines demonstrates that MSBooster significantly increases the number of confidently identified peptides at a fixed false discovery rate, thereby improving proteome coverage and the reliability of downstream biological conclusions without requiring additional instrumentation. This approach represents a substantial advancement in computational proteomics by harnessing predictive models to extract more information from existing LC-MS/MS data.
