**Abstract**

Understanding the influence of environmental gradients on plant species distribution is paramount to conservation efforts, particularly within sensitive mountain ecosystems increasingly impacted by invasive species. This study highlights the critical role of standardized monitoring protocols in elucidating complex biogeographic patterns. Specifically, we examine the application of the MIREN (Monitoring of Inland Regions with Elevation) protocol – a rigorously defined methodology – for assessing plant community composition along established elevation gradients. 

Our analysis, conducted in 2022, demonstrates that the MIREN protocol facilitates the quantification of regional plant richness and the identification of statistically significant correlations between species assemblages and topographic variables.  The protocol’s standardized approach minimizes observer bias and allows for robust comparative analyses across diverse mountain landscapes.  Furthermore, the data generated through MIREN implementation provides a valuable baseline for tracking the impacts of invasive species, as shifts in native plant distributions can often precede or accompany the establishment of non-native flora. 

The consistent application of MIREN protocols contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of plant community dynamics within mountain ecosystems, informing targeted conservation strategies and predictive models.  Future research should focus on integrating MIREN data with remote sensing techniques to scale up monitoring efforts and enhance spatial analyses of plant species distribution and vulnerability.
