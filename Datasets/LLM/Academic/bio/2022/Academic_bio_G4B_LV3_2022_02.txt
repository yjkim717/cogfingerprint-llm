**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health challenge, necessitating a deeper understanding of modulating factors. This study examines the emerging role of the ghrelin system within CRC pathogenesis, hypothesizing its involvement through autocrine and paracrine signaling pathways. Recent preclinical investigations suggest ghrelin may influence CRC cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Specifically, we explore the potential for ghrelin receptors to mediate these effects, contributing to a positive feedback loop within the tumor microenvironment.  Despite promising initial findings, current research reveals substantial knowledge gaps concerning the precise molecular mechanisms underpinning ghrelinâ€™s influence.  Further investigation is crucial to determine whether targeting the ghrelin system presents a viable diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic strategy for CRC.  This work, conducted in 2022, highlights the need for robust clinical validation and mechanistic elucidation within this complex biological system.
