**Abstract: Targeted Polygenic Modification of *Pleurotus ostreatus* for Enhanced Lignocellulose Degradation via a CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Polycistronic tRNA System**

The accelerating demand for sustainable biomass conversion has spurred intensive research into fungal systems capable of efficient lignocellulose degradation. *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a widely utilized saprotrophic fungus, exhibits considerable potential, but further improvement of its enzymatic capabilities remains crucial. Traditional mutagenesis approaches often lack the precision and efficiency required for targeted polygenic modification. Here, we present a novel and streamlined method for generating multiple-gene mutations within *P. ostreatus* utilizing a CRISPR/Cas9 system coupled with a polycistronic tRNA strategy. This approach enables the simultaneous targeting and disruption of several genes implicated in lignocellulose degradation pathways, bypassing the limitations of sequential gene editing. We designed and delivered a single construct comprising multiple CRISPR guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting candidate genes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis, transcribed under the control of a polycistronic tRNA leader sequence.  Successful implementation resulted in the generation of fungal strains exhibiting significantly enhanced cellulolytic activity, as demonstrated through enzymatic assays and phenotypic characterization. This methodology offers a rapid and versatile platform for combinatorial gene editing in *P. ostreatus*, accelerating the development of fungal biocatalysts for improved biofuel production and sustainable bioprocessing applications. Further investigation will focus on optimizing gRNA design and exploring the synergistic effects of multiple gene disruptions on overall lignocellulose degradation efficiency.

**Notes and Potential Expansions:**

*   **Rationale:** I emphasized the broader context (sustainable biomass conversion) to provide a clear motivation for the research.
*   **Terminology:** I used terms like "saprotrophic," "cellulolytic," "hemicellulose hydrolysis," "biocatalysts," and "phenotypic characterization" to maintain academic rigor.
*   **Structure:** The abstract follows a logical flow: 1) Background & Problem, 2) Solution/Method, 3) Results, 4) Significance & Future Directions.
*   **Specificity:** While the summary was brief, I added detail about the types of genes targeted (cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis) to provide more clarity.
*   **Future Work:** Including a sentence about future work (optimizing gRNA design, synergistic effects) is standard practice in abstracts.
*   **Potential Expansion:** If more information were available, the abstract could be expanded to include:
    *   Specific genes targeted and their known roles.
    *   Quantitative data on the enhancement of cellulolytic activity (e.g., % increase in enzyme production).
    *   Details of the fungal strain used and the CRISPR/Cas9 system components.
    *   A brief mention of the vector used for delivery.
