Title: Investigating the Impact of Iron Deficiency Anemia on Cognitive Function in Women: A Review Utilizing P300 Evoked Potentials as a Cognitive Assessment Tool

Abstract:

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a prevalent nutritional disorder that has been associated with cognitive impairment in various populations. Despite its significant health implications, the specific effects of IDA on cognitive function in women remain understudied. This review aims to synthesize existing evidence on the relationship between IDA and cognitive function in women, employing P300 evoked potentials as a neurophysiological index of cognitive processing. The P300 component, elicited through oddball paradigms, is a well-established marker of attentional allocation and working memory. By examining the alterations in P300 latency and amplitude, this review seeks to elucidate the impact of IDA on cognitive function.

A comprehensive search of electronic databases was conducted to identify studies that have utilized P300 as a cognitive assessment tool in women with IDA. The results indicate that IDA is associated with prolonged P300 latency and reduced amplitude, suggesting impaired cognitive processing and attentional abilities. The findings of this review underscore the significance of IDA as a potentially modifiable risk factor for cognitive impairment in women. The use of P300 evoked potentials provides a sensitive and objective measure of cognitive function, allowing for the early detection of IDA-related cognitive decline. The implications of these findings for clinical practice and future research are discussed, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to mitigate the cognitive consequences of IDA in women. This review contributes to the growing body of evidence on the complex interplay between nutritional deficiencies and cognitive function, with important implications for women's health.
