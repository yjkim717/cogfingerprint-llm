Title: Quantifying Tumor Immunity with SpatialVizScore: A Novel Metric for Assessing Immune Infiltration in Lung Cancer

Abstract:

The complex interplay between tumor cells and the immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in determining cancer outcomes. To better understand the spatial dynamics of immune infiltration, we developed SpatialVizScore, a novel metric that leverages multiplex protein imaging data from imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to quantify the spatial distribution of immune cells within lung tumor samples. By integrating cell phenotyping with spatial information, SpatialVizScore provides a comprehensive assessment of immune infiltration, complementing existing immunoscore methodologies. We applied SpatialVizScore to a cohort of lung cancer patients and observed significant correlations between SpatialVizScore and clinical outcomes. Our results demonstrate that SpatialVizScore can effectively capture the spatial heterogeneity of immune infiltration, providing valuable insights into the tumor-immune interface. As a robust and informative metric, SpatialVizScore has the potential to enhance our understanding of tumor immunity and inform the development of targeted immunotherapies. (2022)
