Abstract:
The ghrelin system has been increasingly implicated in the complex process of colorectal carcinogenesis, with emerging evidence suggesting a multifaceted role in cancer progression within the gastrointestinal tract. As of 2022, research has elucidated various mechanisms by which the ghrelin system modulates tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, although the underlying pathways remain incompletely understood. Ghrelin, a peptide hormone primarily produced in the stomach, exerts its effects through interaction with its receptor, GHSR1a, which is expressed in various colorectal cancer cells. The ghrelin system's involvement in inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis suggests a potential link to colorectal cancer development and progression. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying the ghrelin system's role in colorectal cancer is warranted to elucidate its therapeutic potential and identify novel targets for intervention. Elucidating these mechanisms may provide valuable insights into the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.
