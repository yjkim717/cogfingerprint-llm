Title: The Ghrelin System: A Complex Regulator in Colorectal Carcinogenesis and Progression

Abstract:
The ghrelin system has emerged as a multifaceted regulator in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), influencing various cellular processes that underpin carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Recent studies have elucidated the ghrelin system's role in modulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, thereby impacting tumor growth and metastasis. As a result, the ghrelin system is being investigated for its diagnostic and prognostic potential in CRC. This review synthesizes current evidence on the ghrelin system's involvement in CRC development and progression, highlighting its complex interactions with other signaling pathways. Furthermore, we discuss the therapeutic implications of targeting the ghrelin system in CRC, providing a comprehensive understanding of its potential as a novel therapeutic target. As of 2022, ongoing research continues to unravel the ghrelin system's role in CRC, underscoring its significance in cancer biology and therapy.
