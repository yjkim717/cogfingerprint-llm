**Abstract**

The heterogeneous immune landscape of lung cancer significantly impacts therapeutic response and patient prognosis. Traditional methods for assessing immune cell infiltration, such as immunohistochemistry, often lack the spatial context necessary to fully characterize tumor microenvironments. This study introduces SpatialVizScore, a novel quantitative method leveraging multiplex protein imaging to precisely measure immune cell infiltration within lung tumors. Utilizing a spatially resolved, high-plex assay, SpatialVizScore simultaneously detects and quantifies key immune cell populations – including T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells – alongside relevant activation markers. 

Our approach moves beyond conventional ‘immunoscore’ methodologies by providing a detailed spatial map of immune cell distribution. Preliminary data, generated in 2022, demonstrate a strong correlation between SpatialVizScore values and established clinical metrics, such as overall survival and response to immunotherapy.  Crucially, SpatialVizScore revealed significant spatial heterogeneity within tumors, identifying distinct immune zones exhibiting varying levels of infiltration and activation.  These findings suggest that SpatialVizScore represents a powerful tool for discerning nuanced tumor immune states and potentially predicting treatment outcomes. Future research will focus on validating SpatialVizScore across larger cohorts and exploring its utility in guiding personalized immunotherapy strategies.
