## Unprecedented Avian Influenza Virus (HPAI) Circulation in Wild Bird Populations and Subsequent Impacts on Domestic Poultry in Europe, 2022

**Abstract:** The year 2022 witnessed an extraordinary expansion and intensification of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (specifically, the H5N1 subtype) circulation across Europe, presenting a significant threat to both wild avian populations and the domestic poultry industry. This study synthesizes available data to characterize the scope and impact of the 2022 HPAI epidemic, focusing on the role of wild birds in virus dissemination and the subsequent consequences for commercial poultry production.  Prior to 2022, sporadic HPAI outbreaks in wild birds were typically followed by localized poultry incursions. However, the observed patterns in 2022 demonstrated a persistent and geographically expansive presence of HPAI in various wild bird species, including migratory waterfowl, raptors, and scavengers, indicating a fundamental shift in viral ecology.  Genetic analysis reveals the dominance of novel reassortant Eurasian H5 viruses, exhibiting increased transmissibility and virulence.  The widespread presence of these viruses in wild bird flyways facilitated unprecedented spillover events into poultry farms, resulting in devastating mortality rates and substantial economic losses.  This necessitated widespread preventative measures, including mandatory poultry culling, enhanced biosecurity protocols, and movement restrictions. We argue that the increased frequency and scale of HPAI outbreaks in 2022 highlight the critical need for improved surveillance strategies targeting wild bird populations, coupled with enhanced risk mitigation measures within the poultry sector.  Furthermore, understanding the drivers of viral reassortment and the ecological factors influencing wild bird distribution remains paramount for developing effective long-term strategies to manage and control future HPAI epidemics.  Future research should prioritize investigating the role of climate change and anthropogenic landscape modifications in shaping the dynamics of HPAI transmission.
