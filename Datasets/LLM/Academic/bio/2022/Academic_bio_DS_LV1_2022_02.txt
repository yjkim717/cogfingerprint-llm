**Title:** The Ghrelin System in Colorectal Cancer: A Dual-Role Modulator of Tumorigenesis and a Novel Diagnostic Frontier

**Abstract:**

The ghrelin system, comprising the peptide hormone ghrelin, its cognate growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), and the activating enzyme ghrelin-O-acyl-transferase (GOAT), is a critical regulator of energy homeostasis. Recent evidence implicates this system in the pathophysiology of colorectal cancer (CRC), yet its precise role remains contentious. This review synthesizes findings from 2022 and prior, proposing a model of contextual duality. We posit that the system's impact is bifurcated: GHSR1a-mediated signaling may exert tumor-suppressive effects by inducing apoptosis in specific cellular contexts, while GOAT-driven production of acylated ghrelin within the tumor microenvironment potentially fuels proliferative and anti-apoptotic pathways via alternative GHSR isoforms or non-canonical receptors. This intricate interplay suggests that the ghrelin system components are not merely bystanders but active participants in colon carcinogenesis. Consequently, we evaluate the translational potential of these molecules, highlighting their emergence as promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in liquid biopsies. Furthermore, we explore the therapeutic rationale for targeting the GOAT-GHSR axis, either through agonism or antagonism, as a novel strategy for CRC management, contingent upon a deeper understanding of its context-dependent signaling.
