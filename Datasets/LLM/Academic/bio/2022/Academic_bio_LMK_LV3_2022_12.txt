In 2022, a critical examination of RNA velocity methodologies revealed inherent limitations stemming from oversimplified assumptions. Through a combination of simulated and empirical data, this study assessed the Markovian properties underlying gene expression dynamics. By reframing RNA velocity within a more rigorous Markovian framework, we propose a refined analytical approach that enhances the accuracy of gene expression analysis in computational biology, thereby advancing the field of bioinformatics.
