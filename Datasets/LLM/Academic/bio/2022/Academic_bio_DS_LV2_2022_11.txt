**Abstract**

Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis remains primarily clinical, underscoring a critical need for objective biomarkers to enhance diagnostic specificity and track disease progression. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents a rich source of potential protein biomarkers, a definitive signature for PD has been elusive. This study investigates Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC), a pivotal enzyme in dopamine synthesis, as a novel CSF biomarker for PD. We hypothesized that AADC levels would be altered in PD and correlate with core motor symptom severity. Using a cross-sectional design, we quantified AADC protein concentrations in the CSF of well-characterized cohorts: patients with idiopathic PD, age-matched healthy controls, and a disease control group with Alzheimer's disease (AD) to assess specificity. Our analysis revealed a significant reduction in CSF AADC levels in the PD cohort compared to both control groups. Crucially, this reduction demonstrated a robust inverse correlation with the severity of motor symptoms, as quantified by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III. The biomarker exhibited high diagnostic accuracy in differentiating PD from healthy controls and, importantly, from AD, indicating specificity for synucleinopathy-related pathology. These findings posit CSF AADC as a promising dual-purpose biomarker, capable of aiding in the differential diagnosis of PD and providing an objective correlate of disease burden. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to validate its utility in monitoring disease progression and response to therapeutic interventions.
