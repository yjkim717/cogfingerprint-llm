**The Impact of Iron-Deficiency Anemia on P300 Event-Related Potentials and Cognitive Function: A Potential Biomarker for Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment**

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is a globally prevalent condition with established neurological consequences. While traditionally associated with fatigue and reduced motor function, emerging evidence suggests a more subtle impact on cognitive processing. This study investigates the relationship between IDA, P300 event-related potentials (ERPs), and cognitive performance, specifically focusing on the potential for early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A systematic review and meta-analysis of recent electrophysiological and neuropsychological studies (2015-2022) was conducted, incorporating data from female populations experiencing IDA. Analysis revealed consistent findings of diminished P300 amplitude and prolonged latency in anemic participants compared to healthy controls, indicating impaired cognitive resource allocation and attentional processing. Critically, subsequent iron supplementation demonstrated significant improvements in both P300 ERP parameters and cognitive assessment scores. These improvements suggest a reversible neurological impact of IDA and highlight the potential of P300 ERPs as a sensitive biomarker for cognitive vulnerability in anemic individuals. Further research is warranted to explore the utility of this approach in longitudinal studies examining the progression from IDA to MCI, and to determine whether similar findings extend to male populations and other forms of anemia.  The observed link between IDA, altered neural processing as indexed by P300, and cognitive function underscores the importance of addressing iron status as a potential modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline.
