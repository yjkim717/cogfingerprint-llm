**Abstract**

The 2021–2022 epidemiological year marked a paradigm shift in the impact of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), specifically the A(H5N1) subtype, on the European continent. This epizootic constitutes the most extensive and geographically pervasive outbreak on record, characterized by an unprecedented scale of viral circulation within wild avifauna. A critical and alarming feature of this epidemic was the sustained and efficient viral transmission from wild bird reservoirs to commercial and backyard poultry operations, leading to severe economic losses and necessitating large-scale culling. The pathogenesis of the circulating HPAI A(H5N1) clade demonstrated heightened virulence in a broad range of wild bird species, including gulls, raptors, and seabirds, causing mass mortality events that signal a fundamental change in the virus's host-pathogen dynamics and ecological impact. This shift from sporadic spillover to persistent circulation in wild populations presents a continuous and heightened risk of incursion into the poultry sector. Consequently, the efficacy of conventional biosecurity protocols has been critically tested. This review synthesizes outbreak data from across Europe to argue that the 2021–2022 epidemic underscores an urgent need for a holistic "One Health" approach. We contend that enhanced, coordinated surveillance at the wildlife-domestic interface, coupled with the implementation of robust, risk-based biosecurity measures, is no longer merely advisable but imperative. Strengthening these defenses is crucial for mitigating future epizootics, protecting poultry industries, and reducing the zoonotic potential of this continuously evolving pathogen.
