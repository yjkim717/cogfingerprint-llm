Title: Quantifying Climate-Driven Shifts in Plant Diversity Along Elevation Gradients: A Global Perspective

Abstract:

Climate change is profoundly impacting plant species distributions and community composition worldwide. As temperatures rise, many species are shifting their ranges poleward or to higher elevations, leading to changes in community turnover and potentially destabilizing ecosystem functioning. The Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN) has developed a standardized monitoring protocol to track plant species distributions along elevation gradients, facilitating global assessments of range shifts and community responses to climate change. By leveraging this coordinated monitoring effort, we synthesized data from 2022 across multiple mountain regions to quantify the magnitude and direction of climate-driven changes in plant diversity. Our analysis reveals significant upward shifts in species distributions, with an average increase in elevation of 23.4 meters per decade. Community turnover was most pronounced in alpine ecosystems, where warming temperatures are facilitating the invasion of lower-elevation species. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating elevation gradients into conservation policy and management frameworks, particularly in regions with high levels of endemism. By integrating data from diverse mountain ecosystems, we highlight the need for a coordinated global response to mitigate the impacts of climate change on plant diversity and ecosystem resilience. Ultimately, this research informs evidence-based conservation strategies that prioritize climate-smart management and protection of vulnerable mountain ecosystems.
