Accurate peptide identification remains a fundamental challenge in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. While database search engines effectively match experimental MS/MS spectra to theoretical peptides, a significant proportion of spectra remain unassigned, limiting proteome coverage. To address this, we present MSBooster, a novel post-processing tool that leverages deep learning to enhance identification rates. MSBooster rescues ambiguous or low-scoring peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) by integrating multiple orthogonal properties—including LC retention time and ion mobility—predicted in silico for all candidate peptides. We demonstrate that rescoring with these highly accurate, predicted features significantly increases the number of confident identifications across diverse datasets and experimental workflows, including data-independent acquisition (DIA) and data-dependent acquisition (DDA). This integrative approach provides a robust, universally applicable strategy to maximize the informational yield from proteomic experiments, thereby advancing the depth and accuracy of quantitative proteomic analyses.
