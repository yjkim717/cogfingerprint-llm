The 2022 study presents a rigorous Markovian analysis of RNA velocity frameworks, critically evaluating their mathematical foundations and parameter sensitivity. Our findings reveal significant dependencies on kinetic assumptions, impacting the accuracy of dynamical predictions in single-cell RNA sequencing data. By systematically quantifying these sensitivities across diverse biological datasets, we propose a refined, robust model that enhances the inference of cellular trajectories. This work establishes a foundational improvement for RNA velocity methodologies, enabling more reliable characterization of transcriptional dynamics in developmental and disease contexts.
