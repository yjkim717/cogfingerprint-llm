**Abstract**

The year 2022 witnessed an unprecedented European outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically the H5N8 subtype, representing the continentâ€™s largest recorded avian influenza event. This crisis underscored the complex interplay between domestic poultry populations and wild bird reservoirs, with widespread mortality observed across numerous wild bird species, including gulls and waterfowl. Genomic analysis revealed the emergence of novel avian influenza virus genotypes, exhibiting altered transmissibility and potentially broadened host range.  The extensive poultry culling implemented to contain the spread demonstrated significant economic disruption and raised concerns regarding food security.  Consequently, this event necessitates a re-evaluation of current biosecurity protocols and a strengthened surveillance framework targeting wild bird populations. Further research is crucial to predict future outbreaks and develop targeted mitigation strategies to safeguard both avian and human health.
