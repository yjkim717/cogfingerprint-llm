Title: Assessing Climate-Driven Shifts in Plant Diversity Along Elevation Gradients: A Standardized Monitoring Framework

Abstract:

Climate change is precipitating a global redistribution of plant species, with elevation gradients serving as critical indicators of this phenomenon. As temperatures rise, native and non-native species are exhibiting varying responses, underscoring the need for systematic monitoring to inform conservation policy. In response, this study presents a standardized protocol for tracking changes in plant species distributions along elevation gradients. By integrating field observations with geospatial analysis, our framework enables the quantification of climate-driven shifts in plant diversity. The proposed methodology involves stratified sampling along elevational transects, coupled with species abundance data and environmental covariates. Our approach facilitates the identification of early warning signs of climate-driven range shifts, allowing for targeted conservation interventions. By standardizing data collection and analysis, this protocol enables cross-site comparisons and meta-analyses, thereby enhancing the robustness of findings. As of 2022, the implementation of this framework is poised to provide critical insights into the impacts of climate change on plant diversity, informing evidence-based conservation policy and management strategies. By elucidating the complex dynamics of species distributions along elevation gradients, this research contributes to the development of effective adaptation and mitigation measures, ultimately enhancing the resilience of ecosystems to climate change.
