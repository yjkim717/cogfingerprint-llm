**Abstract**

Metabolic pathways within eukaryotic cells frequently rely on precisely controlled redox reactions, analogous to catalytic processes. This study explores the impact of surface heterogeneity and structural defects on the efficiency of key enzymatic transformations. We hypothesize that localized surface sites, mirroring the role of strontium vacancies in perovskite catalysts, significantly influence substrate binding and reaction kinetics. Specifically, the presence of these “defect sites” – representing altered electronic environments – can promote favorable charge transfer dynamics. Furthermore, we propose that lattice oxygen oxidation, a mechanism observed in perovskites, may be relevant in modulating enzyme activity through transient redox state changes. Understanding these surface-dependent mechanisms is crucial for optimizing cellular metabolic regulation and developing targeted therapeutic interventions.
