**Abstract**

Intracellular nanoparticle delivery and subsequent clustering significantly impact therapeutic efficacy. This study, conducted in 2022, investigates the dynamics of gold nanoparticle aggregation within endosomal compartments using the Smoluchowski equation. We demonstrate that an analytical solution for cluster density, derived from the Smoluchowski framework, offers a superior representation of observed nanoparticle distributions compared to conventional power-law approximations. This refined modeling approach provides enhanced predictive capabilities for intracellular nanoparticle behavior, potentially informing the design of more effective nanotherapeutics and enabling improved control over drug delivery outcomes.
