**Abstract**

The heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology remains a critical challenge for the development of effective biomarkers and targeted therapeutics. While the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) are established hallmarks of AD, significant variability exists in their relative contributions to disease progression. This study investigates the hypothesis that distinct p-tau biomarker profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) delineate biologically defined subgroups with unique pathophysiological signatures, extending beyond conventional clinical staging. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a deeply phenotyped cohort of individuals across the AD continuum, from cognitively unimpaired to dementia, all with biomarker-confirmed AD pathology (i.e., A+ T+). Using unsupervised clustering algorithms on a panel of CSF p-tau epitopes (including p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231), we identified three distinct p-tau subgroups.

Crucially, these subgroups exhibited significant differences in key pathogenic pathways independent of clinical disease stage. First, we observed pronounced inter-subgroup variability in amyloid metabolism, as measured by CSF ratios of Aβ38/Aβ42, Aβ40/Aβ42, and soluble APP-β fragments. This suggests that p-tau subgroups are characterized by divergent amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Aβ production dynamics, rather than solely by differential clearance mechanisms. Second, we assessed synaptic integrity through CSF concentrations of neurogranin and synaptotagmin-1. The subgroup with an intermediate p-tau profile demonstrated a markedly more severe synaptic injury signature compared to both the low and high p-tau subgroups, indicating a decoupling between absolute p-tau levels and the magnitude of synaptic degeneration. These findings were robust after controlling for age, *APOE-ε4* status, and global cognitive scores.

Our results confirm that p-tau heterogeneity in AD reflects fundamental divergences in core disease mechanisms, specifically amyloid metabolism and synaptic integrity. This stratification provides a novel, biologically grounded framework for parsing AD heterogeneity, with profound implications for clinical trial design, where patient selection based on such pathophysiological subgroups could enhance the sensitivity to detect therapeutic efficacy. Future longitudinal studies are required to determine the prognostic validity and stability of these subgroups over time.
