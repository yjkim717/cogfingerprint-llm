Title: Assessing Community Turnover and Distribution Shifts along Elevation Gradients: A Standardized Monitoring Protocol for Mountain Ecosystems

Abstract:

Mountain ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change, exhibiting pronounced shifts in plant species distributions along elevation gradients. To elucidate the impacts of climate change on native and non-native species, a comprehensive monitoring protocol is essential. This study presents a standardized methodology for tracking changes in plant species distributions and community turnover along elevation gradients. By employing a stratified sampling design, we established a network of permanent plots across three mountain regions, encompassing a range of elevations and microclimates. Vegetation surveys were conducted using a consistent protocol, recording species presence, abundance, and functional traits. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this protocol in capturing fine-scale changes in plant community composition, highlighting the importance of elevation gradients as sentinels of climate change. By comparing native and non-native species distributions, we identified distinct elevational patterns, with non-native species exhibiting a greater propensity for upward migration. The standardized protocol presented here enables the detection of early warning signs of community turnover and facilitates the comparison of distribution shifts across regions. As global temperatures continue to rise, this monitoring framework will provide critical insights into the dynamics of mountain ecosystems, informing conservation efforts and enabling the development of targeted management strategies. By adopting a standardized approach, we can ensure the comparability and reproducibility of data, ultimately enhancing our understanding of the complex interactions between climate change, elevation gradients, and plant species distributions.
