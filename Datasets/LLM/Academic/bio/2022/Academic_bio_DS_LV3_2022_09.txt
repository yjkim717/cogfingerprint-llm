**Title:** Heterogeneity in Phosphorylated Tau Proteoforms Reveals Distinct Pathophysiological Subgroups in Alzheimer’s Disease with Divergent Amyloid-β Metabolism and Synaptic Integrity

**Abstract**

The pathophysiological continuum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is classically characterized by the sequential accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau). However, significant clinical and biological heterogeneity within the AD spectrum suggests the existence of distinct subtypes, which are not fully explained by this canonical model. This study aimed to delineate such heterogeneity by investigating the existence of biologically defined p-tau subgroups and their relationship with core AD pathogenic processes. We hypothesized that specific p-tau cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker profiles could identify subgroups with divergent underlying mechanisms of Aβ dysregulation and synaptic degeneration, independent of clinical disease stage.

To test this, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a deeply phenotyped cohort of individuals across the AD clinical spectrum, from preclinical to dementia stages, all with biomarker-confirmed AD pathology (i.e., Aβ-positive). Using an unsupervised clustering algorithm applied to a panel of CSF p-tau biomarkers (including p-tau181, p-tau217, and p-tau231), we identified three distinct p-tau subgroups. These subgroups were not primarily driven by the overall burden of tau pathology, as measured by total tau, but by the relative predominance of specific phosphorylation patterns.

Crucially, these p-tau subgroups exhibited significant differences in key pathophysiological pathways. First, we observed divergent profiles in amyloid metabolism. One subgroup showed a signature consistent with markedly increased Aβ production, as indicated by elevated levels of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio shifts and specific APP metabolites. In contrast, other subgroups presented profiles suggestive of impaired Aβ clearance mechanisms. Second, and of paramount importance, these subgroups demonstrated pronounced differences in synaptic integrity. CSF concentrations of neurogranin and synaptotagmin-1, established biomarkers of synaptic dysfunction, were significantly elevated in the subgroup with the Aβ production-dominant profile, indicating a more aggressive synaptopathy. This association between p-tau subgroup and synaptic injury remained robust after controlling for clinical severity, age, and global cognitive scores.

Our findings demonstrate that AD encompasses distinct molecular subtypes defined by specific p-tau proteoforms, which are linked to differential engagement of amyloidogenic and synaptic degeneration pathways. This stratification provides a novel framework for understanding clinical heterogeneity in AD and has profound implications for the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. Specifically, it suggests that targeted interventions—such as BACE inhibitors for the Aβ production-dominant subgroup or therapies enhancing synaptic resilience—may yield greater efficacy when aligned with an individual's underlying p-tau subgroup, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all approach to AD treatment.
