**Abstract**

Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) remains a cornerstone of proteomic analysis, yet peptide identification challenges frequently limit data interpretation. Recent advances leverage deep learning to address these limitations, exemplified by the development of MSBooster. This study details the application of MSBooster, a novel algorithm, to improve peptide identification rates within complex LC-MS/MS datasets. Specifically, MSBooster’s deep learning architecture predicts peptide properties, facilitating enhanced fragment ion analysis through tools like MSfragger and Fragpipe.  Our investigation assessed MSBooster’s performance across diverse workflows, including immunopeptidomics targeting post-translational modifications and single-cell proteomics demanding high sensitivity. Preliminary results demonstrate a statistically significant increase in identified peptide sequences compared to conventional methods.  Further research will focus on optimizing MSBooster’s parameters and expanding its utility for analyzing challenging biological samples, ultimately contributing to more robust and reliable proteomic data.
