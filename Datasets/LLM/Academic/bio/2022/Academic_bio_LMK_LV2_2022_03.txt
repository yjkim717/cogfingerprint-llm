Title: Efficient Multiplex Gene Editing in Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9 System Utilizing Polycistronic tRNA-Arrayed Guide RNAs

Abstract:

Pleurotus ostreatus, a widely cultivated edible mushroom, is a valuable organism for biotechnological applications due to its ability to degrade lignocellulose. To enhance its biotechnological potential, efficient genetic manipulation tools are essential. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has emerged as a powerful tool for genome editing in various organisms. However, its application in P. ostreatus has been limited by the lack of efficient multiplex gene editing strategies. Here, we report the development of a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted strategy for efficient multiple-gene mutations in P. ostreatus using a polycistronic tRNA-arrayed guide RNA (gRNA) system. Our approach enables the simultaneous expression of multiple gRNAs, facilitating targeted mutagenesis of multiple genes involved in lignocellulose degradation. We demonstrate the efficacy of this system by inducing mutations in multiple genes, resulting in improved lignocellulose degradation capabilities. This study provides a robust and efficient tool for genetic manipulation in P. ostreatus, paving the way for future biotechnological applications and functional genomic studies. The developed CRISPR/Cas9 system has significant implications for the improvement of P. ostreatus strains for industrial applications.
