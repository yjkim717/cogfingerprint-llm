In 2022, the integration of multiplex protein imaging with computational analytics has catalyzed a paradigm shift in quantitative tumor immunology. We present SpatialVizScore, a novel computational framework designed to systematically quantify and classify immune infiltration states in non-small cell lung carcinoma through spatially resolved, high-dimensional cellular mapping. By leveraging multiplexed immunofluorescence data, our method transcends conventional density-based assessments by incorporating critical spatial proximity metrics between tumor cells and various immune cell populations. This enables the derivation of a continuous SpatialVizScore, which stratifies tumors into distinct immunophenotypes—immune-enriched, immune-excluded, and immune-desert—based on the architecture of the tumor microenvironment. Validation on a multi-institutional cohort demonstrated that a high SpatialVizScore, indicative of structured immune infiltration and close lymphoid-stromal interactions, was a significant and independent predictor of prolonged overall survival. This spatially-aware scoring system provides a more nuanced understanding of anti-tumor immunity and resistance mechanisms, offering a robust tool for prognostic biomarker discovery and for stratifying patients who may benefit from immunotherapeutic interventions. Our work establishes a critical foundation for incorporating spatial biology into standard clinical oncology practice.
