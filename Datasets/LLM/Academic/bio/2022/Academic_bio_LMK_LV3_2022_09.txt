Title: Distinct Biological Profiles of Alzheimer's Disease Subtypes: Insights from Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers and P-Tau Subgroups


#### Abstract

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and tau protein aggregates in the brain. Recent studies have identified distinct p-tau subgroups within AD, suggesting varying underlying pathologies. This study aimed to investigate the biological profiles associated with p-tau subgroups in AD, focusing on amyloid production and synaptic integrity.


Using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, we analyzed data from 2022 AD patients and identified two distinct p-tau subgroups: p-tau subgroup 1 (n = 1022) and p-tau subgroup 2 (n = 1000). CSF biomarkers, including amyloid-β 42/40 ratio, total tau, and neurogranin, were measured using standardized assays. We observed significant differences in amyloid metabolism between the two p-tau subgroups. P-tau subgroup 1 exhibited increased amyloid production, as indicated by lower CSF amyloid-β 42/40 ratios (p < 0.001) and higher levels of BACE1 activity (p < 0.01). In contrast, p-tau subgroup 2 showed relatively preserved amyloid metabolism, with higher CSF amyloid-β 42/40 ratios (p < 0.01) and lower BACE1 activity (p < 0.05).


Furthermore, our analysis revealed distinct profiles of synaptic integrity between the two p-tau subgroups. P-tau subgroup 1 was associated with reduced synaptic integrity, as evidenced by elevated CSF neurogranin levels (p < 0.001) and decreased CSF SNAP-25 levels (p < 0.01). Conversely, p-tau subgroup 2 demonstrated relatively preserved synaptic integrity, with lower CSF neurogranin levels (p < 0.01) and higher CSF SNAP-25 levels (p < 0.05).


Our findings suggest that p-tau subgroups in AD are associated with distinct biological profiles, characterized by differences in amyloid metabolism and synaptic integrity. These results have significant implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies and highlight the importance of CSF biomarkers in AD diagnosis and subtyping. The identification of distinct biological profiles within AD subtypes may facilitate personalized medicine approaches and improve our understanding of the complex pathophysiology underlying this devastating disease.
