**Abstract:**

This research examines nanoparticle aggregation dynamics within cellular environments, specifically focusing on the behavior of gold nanoparticles. Employing a modified Smoluchowski coagulation equation, we modeled cluster density formation, aiming to predict nanoparticle distribution patterns.  Our analysis considered the influence of endosomal trafficking, a key pathway for nanoparticle internalization.  Computational simulations, validated against established experimental techniques, demonstrated a strong correlation between predicted cluster formation and observed gold nanoparticle localization within endosomes. These findings contribute to a refined understanding of nanoparticle behavior in biological systems, highlighting the potential of Smoluchowski’s equation as a predictive tool for nanoparticle-mediated cellular processes observed in 2022.
