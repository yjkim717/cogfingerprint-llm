**Abstract**

Anthropogenic climate change is driving a pervasive reorganization of biodiversity, with species shifting their ranges to track suitable climatic conditions. Mountainous regions, characterized by steep elevation gradients that compress myriad bioclimatic zones into small geographical areas, serve as ideal natural laboratories for observing these shifts. However, a critical limitation has been the lack of standardized, long-term monitoring protocols, hindering robust cross-regional comparisons and a unified understanding of global patterns. To address this methodological gap, the Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN) established a comprehensive protocol for the systematic monitoring of plant species distributions along elevation transects. This protocol standardizes the recording of native and non-native species richness, abundance, and upper- and lower-range limits at regular intervals. Implemented across a global network of mountain regions, this methodology provides critical, directly comparable data to quantify the velocity of range shifts, identify potential ecological mismatches between plant functional groups, and assess the vulnerability of high-elevation ecosystems to biotic invasions. By generating a coherent global dataset, the MIREN initiative moves beyond single-case studies to elucidate general principles governing floristic reassembly under climate change. Findings from this coordinated effort are pivotal for informing predictive models of biodiversity redistribution and for developing targeted conservation strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on the unique and often endemic biota of the world's montane regions.
