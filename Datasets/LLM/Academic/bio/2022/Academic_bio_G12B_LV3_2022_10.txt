**Abstract**

The increasing complexity of proteomic datasets demands innovative approaches to peptide identification. This study introduces MSBooster, a novel computational tool developed in 2022 that integrates deep learning methodologies to predict peptide physicochemical properties, thereby augmenting traditional *de novo* sequencing workflows. By incorporating these predictions within established proteomics pipelines such as FragPipe and MSFragger, MSBooster significantly improves peptide identification rates in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) experiments. This advancement promises to enhance the depth and accuracy of proteomic analyses, facilitating more comprehensive characterization of biological systems and accelerating downstream biological discovery.
