## Abstract: Advancing Cancer Research Through Integrated Multi-Omics Visualization with UCSC Xena

The burgeoning field of cancer genomics has generated an unprecedented volume of multi-omics data, presenting a significant challenge for researchers seeking to derive meaningful biological insights. Effective data integration and visualization are crucial for navigating this complexity and facilitating hypothesis generation. This study highlights the utility of the UCSC Xena platform, a publicly accessible web resource, in addressing this need. Xena provides a centralized hub for the analysis and visualization of diverse cancer genomics datasets, including DNA sequencing, RNA-Seq, and copy number variation data, alongside associated clinical annotations. Recent enhancements within Xena have expanded its capabilities to incorporate differential gene expression analysis and, importantly, support the visualization of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, a rapidly growing area within cancer research. This integration allows for a more holistic understanding of tumor heterogeneity and its relationship to clinical outcomes. We demonstrate how Xenaâ€™s interactive visualization tools enable researchers to identify novel biomarkers, explore gene regulatory networks, and investigate the impact of genomic alterations on cellular phenotypes. By providing a user-friendly interface and continually expanding its data types and analytical functionalities, UCSC Xena represents a valuable resource for accelerating cancer research and promoting collaborative discovery within the scientific community. The platform's increasing adoption underscores its role in democratizing access to complex genomic data and fostering innovation in precision oncology, particularly in the context of emerging single-cell technologies.
