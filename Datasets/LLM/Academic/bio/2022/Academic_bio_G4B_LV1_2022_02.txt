**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic targets and diagnostic biomarkers. Recent research increasingly implicates the ghrelin system – encompassing ghrelin production, receptor signaling (ghs-rs), and downstream effects – in the pathogenesis of various cancers. This study investigates the functional interplay between the ghrelin system and CRC progression, hypothesizing that ghrelin-mediated signaling contributes to key hallmarks of tumorigenesis. We propose that ghrelin stimulates CRC cell proliferation via activation of specific ghs-rs subtypes, concurrently promoting angiogenesis through increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Furthermore, ghrelin signaling may exacerbate inflammatory responses within the tumor microenvironment, potentially driving carcinogenesis.  Preliminary data suggests a correlation between elevated ghrelin levels and advanced CRC stages.  Future research will focus on elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms driving these effects and evaluating the potential of targeting the ghrelin system as a novel intervention strategy in CRC.
