"Recent investigations (2022) into perovskite catalysts reveal critical roles for surface iron sites and strontium vacancies in facilitating oxygen evolution reactions. These catalysts exhibit low energy barriers via lattice oxygen oxidation, suggesting potential bio-inspired designs for efficient Oâ‚‚ production. Understanding the interplay of these structural defects may inform the development of novel biomimetic systems for artificial photosynthesis."
