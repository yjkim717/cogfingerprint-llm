**Abstract**

Recent advancements in RNA velocity estimation have demonstrated promise in inferring transcriptional dynamics. However, the underlying Markovian assumptions remain insufficiently scrutinized. This study presents a revised, mathematically rigorous Markovian framework for RNA velocity analysis, incorporating enhanced parameter sensitivity assessment. Utilizing simulated biological datasets, we evaluated the impact of key parameters – including rate constants and observation windows – on velocity estimates. Preliminary findings suggest that careful calibration is crucial for accurate interpretation.  Further, we applied this methodology to existing biological datasets, highlighting potential biases and demonstrating the framework’s capacity to provide more robust insights into gene expression regulation – a critical area for mechanistic understanding in 2022.
