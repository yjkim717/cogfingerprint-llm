Title: Quantifying Nanoparticle Clustering in Endosomes using Smoluchowski's Coagulation Equation

Abstract:

The intracellular clustering distribution of nanoparticles is a crucial factor determining their interactions with cellular machinery. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing this phenomenon, we employed Smoluchowski's coagulation equation to model the clustering dynamics of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) within endosomes. By numerically solving the equation, we obtained the cluster density distribution as a function of time and AuNP concentration. Our theoretical predictions were validated against experimental data on AuNP clustering in mammalian cells, demonstrating excellent agreement. The results indicate that the cluster density is sensitive to the initial nanoparticle concentration and the coagulation rate constant. Our study provides a robust framework for understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of nanoparticle clustering in cellular environments, shedding light on the complex interplay between nanoparticle properties and cellular processes. This knowledge can inform the design of nanoparticles for biomedical applications, such as targeted therapy and imaging. (2022)
