This 2022 study presents a comprehensive mathematical analysis of RNA velocity inference methods, critical for reconstructing transcriptional dynamics within biological systems. We evaluate the underlying Markovian assumption frequently employed, assessing its impact across diverse datasets through extensive simulations and experimental validation. Our investigation reveals significant sensitivities to parameter choices and potential biases arising from non-Markovian transcriptional processes. To address these challenges, we propose a refined Markovian framework incorporating robust diagnostic tools for workflow sensitivity assessment. This work aims to enhance the reliability and interpretability of RNA velocity analyses, ultimately advancing our understanding of cellular differentiation and dynamic biological states.
