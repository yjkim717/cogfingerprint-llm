Title: Enhanced Lignocellulose Degradation in Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Multiple Gene Mutagenesis

Abstract:

Pleurotus ostreatus, a white-rot fungus, is a promising organism for biotechnological applications due to its ability to degrade lignocellulose. To improve its lignocellulolytic efficiency, we employed a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted genome editing strategy utilizing a polycistronic tRNA-gRNA (PTG) system to introduce multiple gene mutations. The PTG-CRISPR/Cas9 system enabled simultaneous disruption of genes involved in lignocellulose degradation, including those encoding cellulases, hemicellulases, and lignin-modifying enzymes. Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated multiple gene mutagenesis significantly enhanced the degradation of lignocellulosic biomass by P. ostreatus. The mutant strains exhibited improved saccharification efficiency and increased delignification rates compared to the wild-type strain. This study highlights the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for optimizing fungal strains for biotechnological applications, particularly in the context of lignocellulose conversion. Our findings provide a foundation for further research into the genetic engineering of P. ostreatus for enhanced bioconversion efficiency.
