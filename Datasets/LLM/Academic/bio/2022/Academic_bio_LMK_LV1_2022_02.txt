Title: The Ghrelin System: A Novel Modulator of Colorectal Cancer Progression and a Potential Biomarker for CRC Diagnosis and Prognosis

Abstract:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by a complex interplay of molecular alterations driving carcinogenesis. Recent evidence suggests that the ghrelin system, comprising ghrelin, its receptor GHSR1a, and the ghrelin-processing enzymes, plays a crucial role in modulating CRC progression. As a peptide hormone primarily produced in the gastrointestinal tract, ghrelin regulates various physiological processes, including energy homeostasis and inflammation. Emerging studies have implicated the ghrelin system in colon carcinogenesis, with ghrelin exhibiting both pro- and anti-tumorigenic effects depending on the context. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the ghrelin system's involvement in CRC development and progression, highlighting its potential as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying ghrelin's role in CRC may provide novel therapeutic targets and improve patient outcomes.
