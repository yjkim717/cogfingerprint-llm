**Abstract**

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) represents a prevalent neurological risk factor, particularly impacting cognitive function. This study investigates the relationship between IDA and alterations in the P300 event-related potential (ERP) – a marker of attentional processing and working memory – specifically within a female population. Utilizing a retrospective analysis of neuropsychological data collected in 2022, we examined P300 wave latency in a cohort of women diagnosed with varying degrees of IDA, compared to a matched control group. Preliminary findings suggest a significant positive correlation between iron status and P300 latency, indicating improved cognitive processing efficiency with iron repletion.  These results support the hypothesis that IDA induces a measurable disruption in neural oscillatory activity reflected in ERP metrics.  The observed improvements following iron supplementation suggest a potential for the P300 ERP as a sensitive, non-invasive tool for early detection of cognitive impairment associated with IDA. Further prospective longitudinal studies are warranted to elucidate the causal mechanisms and determine the optimal therapeutic interventions.
