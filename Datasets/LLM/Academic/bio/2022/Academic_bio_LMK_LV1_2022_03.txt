Title: Enhanced Lignocellulose Degradation in Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Multiple Gene Mutations

Abstract:

Pleurotus ostreatus, a white-rot fungus, is a promising organism for lignocellulose degradation. However, its efficiency is limited by the complexity of its genetic regulatory networks. To overcome this, we developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy utilizing a polycistronic tRNA-gRNA (PTG) system for simultaneous multiple-gene mutations. Our approach enabled targeted mutations in key genes involved in lignocellulose degradation, including those encoding cellulases and ligninases. The PTG-CRISPR/Cas9 system demonstrated high efficiency and specificity, resulting in significant enhancements in lignocellulose degradation. Mutant strains exhibited increased expression of ligninolytic enzymes and improved saccharification yields. Our findings demonstrate the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated multiple gene mutations for optimizing P. ostreatus for biotechnological applications, such as biofuel production and bioremediation. This study provides a foundation for further research into the genetic engineering of P. ostreatus for enhanced lignocellulose degradation. (2022)
