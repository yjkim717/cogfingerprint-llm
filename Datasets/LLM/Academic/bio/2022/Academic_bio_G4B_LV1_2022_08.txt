**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cancer genomics increasingly demands sophisticated tools for interpreting the complex interplay of genetic and molecular alterations. This study introduces UCSC Xena, a novel web-based platform designed to facilitate the visualization and integrated analysis of multi-omic data within the context of cancer research. Xena’s architecture provides seamless access to a curated repository of genomic datasets, encompassing gene expression profiles, DNA methylation maps, and copy number variation data derived from a diverse cohort of cancer types. 

Crucially, Xena employs a visual spreadsheet interface, enabling researchers to intuitively explore correlations and patterns across multiple data layers simultaneously.  This approach moves beyond traditional tabular data representation, facilitating hypothesis generation and identification of potential therapeutic targets.  The platform’s utility is further enhanced by its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser, allowing for contextualization of genomic findings within the broader genomic landscape.  

Published in 2022, our preliminary analyses demonstrate Xena’s efficacy in uncovering previously obscured relationships between gene expression and genomic alterations, specifically highlighting its value in characterizing tumor heterogeneity.  Further development will focus on incorporating advanced analytical workflows and expanding the dataset library to support more comprehensive cancer genomic investigations.
