**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health burden, necessitating a deeper understanding of modulating factors influencing its development and progression. This study investigates the emerging role of the ghrelin system within the tumor microenvironment of CRC, hypothesizing its involvement in an autocrine/paracrine signaling loop. Recent research indicates ghrelin, primarily known for its appetite-stimulating effects, can stimulate proliferation and angiogenesis in certain cancers. We explore the potential mechanisms by which ghrelin signaling, mediated through its receptors (GHSR1a and GHSR1b), contributes to CRC pathogenesis. Specifically, we examine the possibility of ghrelin acting as a locally produced growth factor within the tumor, promoting cell survival and potentially resisting conventional therapies. Furthermore, the investigation considers the therapeutic potential of ghrelin analogues as targeted agents, aiming to disrupt these aberrant signaling pathways.  Preliminary data suggests a correlation between ghrelin expression levels and CRC stage, warranting further investigation into its utility as a diagnostic biomarker and prognostic indicator.  Future research should focus on elucidating the precise signaling cascades involved and evaluating the efficacy of ghrelin modulation in preclinical CRC models (2022).
