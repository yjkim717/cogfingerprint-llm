**Abstract**

Understanding the impacts of environmental change on plant biodiversity requires rigorous, standardized monitoring approaches. This study examines the efficacy of the MIREN (Monitoring In Regional Ecosystems) protocol in documenting plant distribution shifts across elevation gradients, specifically focusing on implications for mountain ecosystems. Utilizing the MIREN protocol, we observed significant regional variation in plant species ranges, correlated with localized elevation changes. Notably, roadside locations consistently exhibited higher densities of invasive plant species, suggesting a critical pathway for their establishment and spread. These findings underscore the importance of considering anthropogenic disturbance, particularly road networks, within conservation strategies.  The observed range shifts, quantified through MIREN data, provide a valuable baseline for predicting future ecosystem responses to climate change.  Further research leveraging this standardized methodology is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate the negative effects of invasive species and safeguard vulnerable plant communities within mountainous landscapes.
