Title: The Impact of Iron Deficiency Anemia on Cognitive Function: A Systematic Review of P300 Evoked Potentials and Iron Supplementation in Women


#### Abstract

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a prevalent nutritional disorder affecting cognitive function, particularly in women of reproductive age. The P300 cognitive evoked potential is a reliable neurophysiological marker for assessing cognitive processing. This systematic review investigates the relationship between IDA, P300 latency and amplitude, and the efficacy of iron supplementation in mitigating cognitive impairment. A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases (2022) yielded 15 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, involving 846 women with IDA and 734 healthy controls. Meta-analysis revealed significant prolongation of P300 latency (SMD = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.83-1.63, p < 0.001) and reduction in P300 amplitude (SMD = -0.87, 95% CI: -1.24 to -0.50, p < 0.001) in IDA women compared to controls. Iron supplementation resulted in significant improvement in P300 latency (SMD = -0.93, 95% CI: -1.44 to -0.42, p < 0.001) and amplitude (SMD = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.25-1.05, p = 0.001). Subgroup analysis indicated that the duration of iron supplementation (> 3 months) and severity of IDA at baseline influenced the magnitude of cognitive improvement. This review provides robust evidence that IDA impairs cognitive function, as reflected by altered P300 evoked potentials, and that iron supplementation can partially reverse these changes. The findings have implications for the diagnosis and management of cognitive impairment in women with IDA, highlighting the need for early detection and treatment. Future research should focus on elucidating the underlying neurobiological mechanisms and optimizing iron supplementation regimens.
