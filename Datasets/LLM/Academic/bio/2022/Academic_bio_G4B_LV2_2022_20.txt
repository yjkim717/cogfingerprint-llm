**Abstract**

Understanding the impacts of climate change on biodiversity necessitates robust, standardized methodologies for documenting ecological shifts. This study examines the utility of the MIREN (Monitoring of Inland Regions by Elevation) protocol – a standardized approach to assessing plant species distributions along established elevation gradients – within mountain ecosystems.  Our analysis, drawing upon data collected in 2022, demonstrates the protocol’s capacity to reveal nuanced regional variations in species richness and to contribute to broader assessments of global biodiversity trends. 

Specifically, the MIREN protocol facilitates a systematic quantification of plant community composition across varying elevations, allowing for the identification of species’ elevational ranges and documenting potential range shifts attributable to environmental change. The implementation of a standardized protocol is crucial to mitigating observer bias and ensuring data comparability across diverse mountain landscapes.  Results indicate that MIREN provides a valuable framework for tracking responses of plant species to ongoing climatic pressures, particularly within sensitive mountain ecosystems.  Further research utilizing MIREN across multiple geographic locations is recommended to refine predictive models of species distributions and inform conservation strategies.  The protocol’s ability to capture both localized and global patterns underscores its significance for continued monitoring of plant species distributions.
