Title: Quantifying Spatially Variant Immune Infiltration in Lung Tumors using SpatialVizScore

Abstract:
The heterogeneous immune landscape within tumors significantly influences cancer progression and therapeutic response. To elucidate the complexities of tumor immunology, we introduce SpatialVizScore, a novel method for quantifying spatially variant immune cell infiltration in lung tumor samples. Leveraging multiplex protein imaging data obtained through imaging mass cytometry, SpatialVizScore integrates cellular composition and spatial distribution to derive a comprehensive immunoscore. By analyzing the spatial arrangement of immune cells within the tumor microenvironment, SpatialVizScore provides a nuanced understanding of immune infiltration patterns. Our approach was validated using lung tumor samples, demonstrating a significant correlation between SpatialVizScore and clinical outcomes. The proposed method offers a robust framework for characterizing the spatially variant immune landscape, enabling the identification of novel prognostic biomarkers and informing personalized immunotherapeutic strategies. By advancing the quantification of immune infiltration, SpatialVizScore contributes to the evolving field of tumor immunology, with implications for cancer diagnosis and treatment.
