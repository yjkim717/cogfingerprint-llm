**Abstract**

Emerging evidence suggests that variations in the phosphorylated tau (p-tau) isoform contribute significantly to the heterogeneous pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study investigated the relationship between distinct p-tau subgroups and measures of amyloidogenic processes alongside synaptic integrity, utilizing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. We analyzed data from a cohort of individuals diagnosed with AD, stratified based on their p-tau levels, to determine if these subgroups exhibited divergent profiles. Our findings revealed significant correlations between specific p-tau variants and markedly different rates of amyloid production, as indicated by CSF amyloid-beta levels. Critically, these alterations in amyloidogenic activity were consistently associated with compromised synaptic integrity, as assessed by CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL) concentrations. Notably, these associations were observed irrespective of the clinical stage of disease progression.  These results underscore the importance of considering p-tau as a critical determinant of disease trajectory, highlighting the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions based on p-tau subtype. Future research should focus on validating these findings in larger cohorts and exploring the mechanistic links between p-tau isoforms, amyloidogenic pathways, and synaptic dysfunction.
