**Abstract**

Understanding shifts in plant species distributions is crucial for predicting ecosystem responses to ongoing climate change and anthropogenic pressures. The Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN), established in 2022, implemented a standardized monitoring protocol across varied mountain ecosystems to investigate these dynamics along elevational gradients. Initial findings reveal notable region-specific patterns in plant community composition, highlighting the complex interplay of local environmental factors and broader climatic trends. Notably, a consistent global decline in non-native species richness was observed in proximity to roadside habitats, suggesting altered dispersal pathways and increased competition. These data provide a valuable baseline for assessing future changes and informing conservation strategies within vulnerable mountain biodiversity hotspots.
