"Recent advancements in heterogeneous catalysis have highlighted the critical role of structural defects in enhancing catalytic performance. This 2022 study elucidates the mechanisms governing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in perovskite catalysts, demonstrating a significant contribution from both surface iron sites and strontium vacancies. Our findings reveal that these defects facilitate OER through a preferential pathway involving lattice oxygen oxidation, exhibiting a remarkably low activation energy barrier. Understanding the interplay between these structural features offers a promising avenue for the rational design of bio-inspired, highly efficient OER catalysts for sustainable energy applications."
