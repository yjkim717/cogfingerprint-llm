**Abstract**

Understanding the multifaceted impacts of global change on mountain ecosystems, which are recognized as critical sentinels, remains a paramount challenge in biogeography and conservation biology. Mountain regions are experiencing disproportionate effects from climate change, including rapid thermal elevation shifts and altered disturbance regimes, which in turn facilitate the ingress and establishment of non-native species. To address the critical data gap concerning these dynamic processes, the Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN) has developed and implemented a globally standardized protocol for long-term ecological monitoring. This protocol is specifically designed to systematically quantify the distributional shifts of both native and non-native plant species along elevation gradients. By establishing permanent plots at regular elevational intervals along road and trail transects across multiple continents, the protocol generates robust, comparable data on species richness, composition, and abundance. The primary objective is to disentangle the synergistic drivers of vegetation change, particularly the relative contributions of climate warming versus anthropogenic introduction vectors in propelling non-native species upward. Preliminary analyses from this global observatory network, consolidated in 2022, already reveal a consistent pattern of non-native species migrating to higher elevations at a rate exceeding that of many native species, leading to novel species assemblages and potential biotic homogenization. These findings underscore the utility of a standardized approach in generating predictive insights into the future trajectories of mountain biodiversity. Consequently, the MIREN protocol serves as an indispensable tool for informing proactive conservation strategies and mitigating the compounded threats of climate change and biological invasions in these fragile and topographically complex ecosystems.
