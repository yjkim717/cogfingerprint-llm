## Abstract

RNA velocity, a computational technique inferring future cell states from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating cellular dynamics. However, existing RNA velocity methods often exhibit sensitivity to various factors including data characteristics and parameter selection, potentially leading to inaccurate trajectory inference. This study, conducted in 2022, critically analyzes current RNA velocity methodologies, focusing on their workflow sensitivities and the impact of parameter choices on resulting velocity fields. We propose a novel Markovian framework as a foundation for improved RNA velocity estimation and mitigation of common challenges. This framework explicitly models transcriptional dynamics within a Markovian context, allowing for a more robust and interpretable assessment of cellular trajectories. Through rigorous evaluation across diverse biological datasets, we demonstrate the frameworkâ€™s enhanced stability and reduced sensitivity compared to established approaches, highlighting its potential for advancing single-cell trajectory analysis and furthering our understanding of complex biological processes. The findings underscore the importance of careful parameter optimization and rigorous validation in RNA velocity studies.
