**SpatialVizScore: A Multiplex Imaging Approach to Quantify Immune Cell Infiltration and Reveal Tumor Microenvironment Heterogeneity**

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a critical role in cancer progression and response to therapy, with immune cell infiltration representing a key determinant of outcome. Traditional methods for assessing immune infiltration often lack spatial resolution, obscuring crucial cell-cell interactions. Here, we introduce SpatialVizScore, a novel computational method leveraging the power of multiplex protein imaging and spatial analysis to overcome this limitation. Utilizing high-plex immunohistochemistry datasets of lung tumor tissue, SpatialVizScore provides a quantitative assessment of immune cell infiltration density and distribution. Our analysis reveals distinct immune states within the TME, characterized by unique spatial relationships between infiltrating lymphocytes, myeloid cells, and tumor cells. This approach allows for the identification of previously unrecognized immune niches and offers a refined understanding of the complex interplay within the TME. SpatialVizScore represents a significant advancement in immunological cancer research, providing a robust framework for dissecting spatial immune heterogeneity and potentially informing the development of more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.
