**Abstract**

The 2022 European epidemic of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), primarily driven by the H5N1 virus clade 2.3.4.4b, represents an unprecedented epizootic event with profound implications for animal health, wildlife conservation, and biosecurity. This study provides a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of the outbreak, which spanned 37 countries and has been recorded as the most extensive on the continent to date. The epidemic was characterized by two concurrent and severe phenomena: an exceptionally high number of outbreaks in domestic poultry populations and mass mortality events in wild birds, the scale of which was historically unparalleled. We posit that the unprecedented nature of the 2022 epidemic can be attributed to a fundamental shift in HPAI H5N1 virus ecology, transitioning from a primarily poultry-driven disease to one sustained by autonomous and persistent transmission cycles within wild bird populations. This paradigm shift facilitated the widespread geographic dissemination of the virus across migratory flyways, effectively turning wild avifauna into a perennial reservoir. The consequences were a prolonged temporal extension of the outbreak beyond the typical autumn/winter peak and the virus's penetration into previously unaffected geographic regions. The severe impact on wild birds, including threatened seabird colonies and raptors, indicates a significant conservation crisis. These findings underscore the critical need for a revised One Health approach to HPAI management. Future strategies must integrate enhanced, year-round surveillance in wild birds, the development of next-generation vaccines for poultry, and robust, coordinated cross-border controls to mitigate the economic losses in agriculture and the escalating threat to global biodiversity posed by this rapidly evolving pathogen.
