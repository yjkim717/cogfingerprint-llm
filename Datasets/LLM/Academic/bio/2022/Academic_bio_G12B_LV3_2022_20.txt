**Abstract**

Understanding contemporary shifts in plant species distributions is crucial for predicting ecosystem responses to ongoing climate change and biological invasions. The Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN), established in 2022, has implemented a globally standardized protocol to monitor plant communities along elevational gradients within diverse mountain ecosystems. Initial findings reveal distinct regional patterns in native plant species richness, highlighting the complex interplay of local environmental factors and evolutionary history. Notably, a consistent trend of reduced non-native species richness was observed in proximity to roadside habitats across multiple sites. This standardized, longitudinal dataset provides a robust framework for future analyses investigating range shifts in response to climate change and evaluating the impact of anthropogenic disturbance. Ultimately, these data will inform targeted conservation strategies aimed at mitigating the effects of non-native species and preserving mountain biodiversity.
