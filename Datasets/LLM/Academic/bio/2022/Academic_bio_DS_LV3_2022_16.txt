Here we report a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated multiplex genome editing platform for the white-rot fungus *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a model organism for lignocellulose degradation studies. Traditional methods for generating multiple-gene knockouts in this basidiomycete are laborious and time-consuming, impeding functional genomics. Our 2022 study addresses this bottleneck by engineering a polycistronic tRNA-gRNA (PTG) expression system that enables simultaneous targeting of multiple genomic loci with high efficiency. This system leverages endogenous tRNA processing machinery to liberate individual guide RNAs from a single transcriptional unit, co-expressed with Cas9. We achieved targeted mutations in three key lignocellulolytic enzyme genes—laccases (*lac1*, *lac2*) and a cellobiohydrolase (*cbh1*)—in a single transformation cycle, with a multiplex editing efficiency of 78% in primary transformants. Mutant strains exhibited significantly altered secretome profiles and reduced enzymatic activities, directly linking genotype to phenotype in lignocellulose deconstruction. This CRISPR/PTG framework establishes a robust, scalable tool for dissecting complex gene networks in *P. ostreatus*, accelerating the development of engineered fungal strains for biorefinery applications and advancing systems biology of wood-decaying fungi.
