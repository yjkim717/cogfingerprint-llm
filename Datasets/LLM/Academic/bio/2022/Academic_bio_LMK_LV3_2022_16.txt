Title: Efficient Multiplex Genome Editing in Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9-Assisted Polycistronic tRNA-gRNA Strategy

Abstract:
The CRISPR/Cas9 system has revolutionized genetic engineering in various organisms. In 2022, we reported a novel application of this technology in Pleurotus ostreatus, an edible fungus with significant economic and nutritional value. By integrating polycistronic tRNA-gRNA (PTG) cassettes into the CRISPR/Cas9 framework, we achieved efficient multiplex genome editing in P. ostreatus. This PTG-CRISPR/Cas9 strategy enables simultaneous targeting of multiple genes, thereby facilitating the introduction of multiple-gene mutations. Our results demonstrate that the PTG-CRISPR/Cas9 system is highly effective in P. ostreatus, with mutation frequencies significantly higher than those achieved with conventional single-gRNA approaches. This advancement in genetic engineering has profound implications for strain improvement and functional genomics in P. ostreatus, and potentially in other fungal species. The PTG-CRISPR/Cas9 strategy is poised to accelerate research and development in fungal biotechnology.
