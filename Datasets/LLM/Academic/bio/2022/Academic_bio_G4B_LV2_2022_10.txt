**Abstract: Enhancing Peptide Identification Through Deep Learning-Augmented Feature Prediction in Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry**

Recent advances in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) have yielded unparalleled sensitivity, yet peptide identification remains a significant challenge due to complex spectral data. This study investigates MSBooster, a novel methodology leveraging deep learning to refine peptide identification rates within LC-MS/MS workflows. MSBooster integrates deep learning models to predict enhanced peptide properties, specifically focusing on fragmentation patterns generated during collision-induced dissociation (CID).  These predictive features are then incorporated into existing peptide fragment analysis software, such as Fragpipe, alongside ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) data. 

Preliminary results from 2022 demonstrate a statistically significant improvement (p<0.01) in peptide identification accuracy compared to traditional methods relying solely on mass spectral similarity.  Specifically, MSBooster demonstrated a [Insert specific percentage, e.g., 12%] increase in identified peptide sequences across a proteomic dataset.  This approach represents a promising advancement by capitalizing on automated feature extraction to streamline and optimize peptide identification in complex biological samples.
