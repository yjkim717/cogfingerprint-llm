**Abstract**

Advances in multiplex protein imaging have enabled unprecedented insights into the complex interplay between tumor cells and the immune system. This study introduces SpatialVizScore, a novel quantitative method designed to assess spatially heterogeneous immune cell infiltration within lung tumor microenvironments. Utilizing high-resolution imaging data, SpatialVizScore integrates information from multiple immune markers to generate a comprehensive metric reflecting the dynamic nature of immune response.  We demonstrate the utility of SpatialVizScore in characterizing the immunological landscape of lung cancer, revealing significant variations in immune cell composition across tumor regions. Furthermore, correlating SpatialVizScore with established immunoscore metrics and clinical outcomes suggests its potential as a prognostic biomarker.  The development of SpatialVizScore provides a refined approach to evaluating immune cell interactions, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of lung cancer progression and informing personalized therapeutic strategies.
