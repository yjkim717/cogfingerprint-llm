**UCSC Xena: A Browser-Based Platform for Integrated Multi-Omic Data Exploration in Cancer Genomics Research**

**Abstract**

The accelerating pace of cancer genomics research has resulted in an unprecedented accumulation of high-throughput data, including genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic profiles.  Effective analysis and interpretation of these complex, multi-omic datasets remain a significant challenge, hindering translational advances and requiring robust, user-friendly tools. The University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Xena platform addresses this need by providing a centralized, web-based resource for visualizing and exploring a vast collection of cancer genomic datasets, primarily derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) projects, alongside other publicly available repositories. This work details the capabilities of Xena as of late 2022, highlighting its evolution and impact on cancer research.

Xena’s core functionality revolves around interactive data visualization. Users can readily access and compare gene expression, DNA copy number alterations, somatic mutations, and other molecular features across diverse cancer types and individual samples. The platform supports a range of visualization techniques including heatmaps, Kaplan-Meier curves, volcano plots, and customizable genomic tracks, facilitating the identification of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Critically, Xena’s architecture allows for seamless integration of multiple data layers, enabling researchers to investigate complex relationships between genomic drivers and clinical outcomes. Recent updates have focused on improved handling of large datasets, incorporating support for spatial transcriptomics data and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses, reflecting the growing prominence of these technologies in cancer research. Furthermore, Xena now facilitates the direct download of processed data and provides programmatic access via a REST API, enhancing its utility for automated workflows and integration with external analytical pipelines.

The platform’s impact is evidenced by its widespread adoption within the cancer research community, demonstrated through citation metrics and user engagement. Xena serves as an invaluable resource for hypothesis generation, validation, and exploratory data analysis, accelerating the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical applications. By providing a standardized and accessible environment for multi-omic data exploration, Xena contributes significantly to advancing our understanding of cancer biology and facilitating the development of personalized cancer therapies. Future development will prioritize enhanced data harmonization across diverse sources and improved support for emerging data types, solidifying Xena's position as a central hub for cancer genomics research.
