Title: Quantitative Analysis of Nanoparticle Clustering Distribution within Cellular Environments using Smoluchowski's Coagulation Equation

Abstract:
The intracellular distribution of nanoparticles is a critical factor in determining their efficacy in nanodiagnostics and therapeutic applications. This study presents a mathematical framework to analyze the clustering distribution of nanoparticles within cells, leveraging Smoluchowski's coagulation equation to model the aggregation dynamics. By deriving an expression for cluster density, we demonstrate a robust correlation between theoretical predictions and experimental data on gold nanoparticle distribution within cellular matrices. Our results show that the proposed model accurately captures the clustering behavior of nanoparticles, providing a reliable tool for predicting nanoparticle aggregation patterns. The findings of this research contribute to the advancement of nanodiagnostics by enabling the quantitative assessment of nanoparticle distribution within cells, thereby informing the design of nanoparticle-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
