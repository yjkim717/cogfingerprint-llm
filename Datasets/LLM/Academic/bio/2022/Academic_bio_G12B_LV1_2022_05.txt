**Abstract: Unprecedented Avian Influenza Virus (HPAI) Circulation and Impacts on Wild Bird Populations and Commercial Poultry in Europe, 2022**

The year 2022 witnessed an extraordinary surge in highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus circulation across Europe, impacting both wild bird populations and commercial poultry sectors to an unprecedented degree. This study synthesizes surveillance data and outbreak reports to characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of the H5N1 HPAI epidemic, focusing on its implications for wildlife conservation and food security.  We observed a marked expansion of the virusâ€™s geographic range, exceeding previously documented patterns, and a significant increase in mortality rates among various wild bird species, including migratory waterfowl, raptors, and scavengers.  Genetic analysis of circulating viral strains revealed a predominance of reassortant H5 variants, suggesting ongoing evolutionary adaptation and increased transmissibility.

The epidemic's impact on commercial poultry was also substantial, with widespread outbreaks leading to significant economic losses and necessitating stringent biosecurity measures and culling programs.  We analyze the correlation between wild bird presence and poultry farm proximity as a potential driver of transmission, identifying key risk factors contributing to outbreaks. Furthermore, we examine the effectiveness of existing surveillance strategies in detecting and responding to the rapid spread of the virus, highlighting challenges in early detection within wild bird populations.  The observed scale of the 2022 HPAI epidemic underscores the need for enhanced international collaboration in disease monitoring, improved risk assessment models incorporating wild bird ecology, and the development of novel mitigation strategies to protect both avian biodiversity and the poultry industry. Future research should focus on understanding the drivers of viral reassortment and the long-term ecological consequences of widespread HPAI mortality in wild bird communities.
