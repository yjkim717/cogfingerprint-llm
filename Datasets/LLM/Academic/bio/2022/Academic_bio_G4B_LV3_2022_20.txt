**Abstract**

Mountain ecosystems are increasingly vulnerable to shifts in plant distributions, driven by factors including elevational gradients and the proliferation of invasive species. This study investigates the efficacy of the MIREN (Monitoring Invasions with Remote Sensing) protocol – a standardized methodology – in documenting these changes. Utilizing MIREN data collected across diverse mountain ranges, we observed pronounced regional variations in plant community composition correlated with local elevation. Notably, a consistent trend of declining non-native species richness was identified globally, suggesting a widespread ecological response to anthropogenic disturbance. Furthermore, analysis revealed a strong association between roadside infrastructure and the introduction and spread of invasive plant taxa. These “roadside vectors” represent critical points of entry for novel species, exacerbating existing pressures on native flora.  The MIREN protocol’s capacity to provide spatially explicit data offers a valuable tool for conservation management and predictive modeling of future plant distribution shifts within sensitive mountain environments.
