**Abstract**

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is a prevalent global health concern, increasingly recognized for its multifaceted impact beyond hematological parameters. This systematic review, conducted in 2022, synthesizes current evidence exploring the relationship between IDA and cognitive function, specifically focusing on alterations in P300 event-related potentials (ERPs) within female populations. A comprehensive literature search identified studies utilizing cognitive assessments alongside electrophysiological measures of P300 amplitude and latency. Findings consistently demonstrate that IDA is associated with diminished P300 amplitude, prolonged latency, and inter-trial variability, indicative of impaired attentional processing and cognitive efficiency. Notably, iron supplementation interventions consistently resulted in significant improvements in these P300 ERP characteristics, correlating with enhanced cognitive performance as measured by standardized neuropsychological tests. These results strongly suggest that P300 ERP analysis holds potential as a sensitive and objective biomarker for detecting early cognitive deficits associated with IDA, potentially preceding overt clinical symptoms. Further research utilizing longitudinal designs and larger sample sizes is warranted to validate P300 as a screening tool and to elucidate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms linking IDA, ERP dysfunction, and cognitive decline in women.
