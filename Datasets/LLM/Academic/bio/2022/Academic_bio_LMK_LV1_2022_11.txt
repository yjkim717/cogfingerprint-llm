Title: Identification of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase as a Novel Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker for Parkinson's Disease through Proteomics Analysis

Abstract:

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to motor dysfunction. The diagnosis of PD remains challenging due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. Recent advances in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics have enabled the discovery of novel protein biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we employed a tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to investigate the CSF proteome of PD patients and controls across multiple cohorts. Our analysis revealed a significant decrease in the levels of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC), a crucial enzyme involved in dopamine synthesis, in the CSF of PD patients compared to controls. Validation of AADC as a potential biomarker was performed using independent cohorts, demonstrating a consistent reduction in AADC levels in PD patients. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that AADC levels could distinguish PD patients from controls with moderate accuracy. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed a significant association between AADC levels and motor symptom severity in PD patients. Our findings suggest that AADC is a novel CSF biomarker for PD, providing insights into the underlying pathophysiology of dopamine synthesis dysregulation. The identification of AADC as a biomarker may facilitate the development of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PD. This study highlights the utility of CSF proteomics in discovering novel biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases and underscores the importance of validating biomarkers across multiple cohorts.
