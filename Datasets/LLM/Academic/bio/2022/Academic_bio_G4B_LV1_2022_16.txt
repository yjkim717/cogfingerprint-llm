**Directed Mutagenesis of *Pleurotus ostreatus* via Polycistronic tRNA-Mediated CRISPR/Cas9 Delivery**

Efficient genetic modification of basidiomycetes remains a significant challenge. This study reports the development of a novel strategy for targeted mutagenesis within *Pleurotus ostreatus*, leveraging the combined functionality of a polycistronic transfer RNA (tRNA) and CRISPR-Cas9 technology. We engineered a system enabling the simultaneous disruption of multiple genomic loci within the fungal genome. Utilizing a specifically designed polycistronic tRNA, we facilitated the delivery of a CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex, directing cleavage to pre-determined target sequences. This approach circumvents limitations associated with traditional single-gene editing, enabling the investigation of complex gene interactions relevant to lignocellulose degradation – a critical process for industrial applications. Preliminary results demonstrate successful induction of multiple-gene mutations, warranting further investigation into the phenotypic consequences and potential for optimizing this methodology for enhanced fungal strain development.
