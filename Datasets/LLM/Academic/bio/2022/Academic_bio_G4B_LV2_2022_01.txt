**Abstract**

Nanoparticle aggregation within biological systems presents a complex challenge for understanding cellular uptake and downstream effects. This research explores the dynamics of gold nanoparticle clustering within endosomal compartments, employing a quantitative approach to investigate particle behavior. Utilizing Smoluchowski’s equation, we determined cluster density as a function of nanoparticle concentration and Brownian motion, providing a theoretical framework for predicting aggregation kinetics. Experimental data, obtained through fluorescence microscopy, were then compared against the model’s predictions, revealing a degree of correlation suggesting the equation’s utility in characterizing nanoparticle clustering. 

Specifically, we observed a non-linear relationship between nanoparticle concentration and cluster density, indicative of potential steric hindrance effects within the confined endosomal environment.  Further analysis considered the influence of particle size and viscosity. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of nanoparticle distribution within cells and offer a valuable tool for predicting and controlling nanoparticle behavior in biomedical applications.  Future work will focus on incorporating solvent effects and exploring the impact of different nanoparticle surface modifications.
