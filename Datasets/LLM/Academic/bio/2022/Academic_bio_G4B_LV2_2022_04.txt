**Abstract**

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) represents a prevalent physiological challenge, particularly impacting cognitive function in women. This systematic review investigates the relationship between IDA and alterations in electroencephalography (EEG) markers, specifically examining the influence of iron supplementation on the P300 wave latency – a critical component of the cognitive evoked potential (CEP) reflecting attentional processing and working memory. Utilizing a comprehensive search strategy across relevant databases, we synthesized existing evidence to assess the effect of IDA on P300 wave characteristics and the restorative potential of targeted iron intervention. 

Preliminary findings suggest a statistically significant association between IDA and prolonged P300 wave latency in female populations. Critically, our analysis revealed a trend towards reduced latency values following iron supplementation, indicating a potential neurocognitive ameliorative effect. These results align with established understanding of iron’s role in neurotransmitter synthesis and cerebral blood flow, both of which are vital for optimal CEP generation. 

Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise neurobiological mechanisms underpinning this observed relationship and to determine optimal dosage and duration of iron supplementation for maximizing cognitive benefits.  This systematic review contributes to the growing body of evidence highlighting the importance of addressing IDA as a modifiable factor in mitigating cognitive deficits, particularly within the context of female physiology.
