Title: The Ghrelin System: A Potential Biomarker in Colorectal Cancer Progression

Abstract:
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignancy affecting the gastrointestinal tract, with a complex carcinogenic process involving various molecular pathways. Recent studies have implicated the ghrelin system in colon carcinogenesis and CRC progression. The ghrelin system, comprising ghrelin, its receptor (GHSR1a), and obestatin, modulates various physiological processes, including energy homeostasis, cell proliferation, and inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that alterations in ghrelin system expression are associated with CRC development and progression. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the ghrelin system's role in CRC, focusing on its potential diagnostic and prognostic value. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying ghrelin's involvement in colon carcinogenesis and CRC progression, highlighting its potential as a novel biomarker for CRC. The findings underscore the significance of the ghrelin system in CRC biology, warranting further investigation into its clinical utility.
