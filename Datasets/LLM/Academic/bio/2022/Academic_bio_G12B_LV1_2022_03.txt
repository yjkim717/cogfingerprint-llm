**Abstract: Targeted Polygenic Modification of *Pleurotus ostreatus* for Enhanced Lignocellulose Degradation via a CRISPR-Cas9/Polycistronic tRNA System**

The escalating demand for sustainable biomass conversion has spurred intensive research into fungal systems capable of efficient lignocellulose degradation. *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a widely utilized decomposer fungus, presents a compelling platform for metabolic engineering; however, traditional mutagenesis approaches often lack the precision required for targeted improvement of complex traits. This study describes the development and application of a novel genetic engineering strategy for the rapid and efficient generation of multiple-gene mutations within *P. ostreatus*. We integrated the CRISPR-Cas9 system with a custom-designed polycistronic tRNA construct, enabling the simultaneous delivery and expression of multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting specific genes involved in the lignocellulose degradation pathway.

The polycistronic tRNA scaffold facilitates streamlined gRNA processing and reduces the genomic footprint associated with multiple individual CRISPR constructs.  We successfully demonstrated the utility of this approach by targeting genes encoding cellulases and hemicellulases, key enzymes responsible for polysaccharide breakdown.  Genomic analysis confirmed targeted mutations at all designated loci, demonstrating the system’s precision and efficiency in generating polygenic variants. Preliminary phenotypic assays revealed a significant increase in the rate of pretreated wheat straw degradation in engineered strains compared to wild-type controls.  This polycistronic tRNA/CRISPR-Cas9 system provides a powerful tool for accelerating metabolic engineering efforts in *P. ostreatus* and offers a broadly applicable framework for the targeted modification of complex metabolic pathways in filamentous fungi, paving the way for enhanced biofuel production and biomass valorization. Further research will focus on optimizing gRNA design and identifying synergistic gene combinations to maximize degradation efficiency.
