**Abstract**

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) represents a prevalent neurodevelopmental and neuropsychological challenge, particularly affecting women. This study investigates the relationship between IDA, electrophysiological markers, and cognitive function, specifically examining alterations in the P300 cognitive evoked potential (CEP). Utilizing a retrospective analysis of neuropsychological data collected in 2022, we assessed P300 wave latency in a cohort of women diagnosed with varying degrees of IDA. Preliminary findings demonstrate a significant correlation between iron status and P300 latency, with individuals exhibiting IDA demonstrating prolonged CEP durations compared to iron-replete controls. Notably, a controlled iron supplementation trial revealed a demonstrable reduction in P300 latency, suggesting a causal link between iron homeostasis and neural processing efficiency. These results support the hypothesis that IDA contributes to subtle cognitive impairments and may serve as an early biomarker for detecting cognitive decline. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association and to explore the potential of targeted iron therapy for mitigating cognitive deficits.
