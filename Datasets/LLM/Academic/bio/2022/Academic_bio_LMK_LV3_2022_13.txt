Title: Quantifying Spatial Heterogeneity of Immune Infiltration in Lung Cancer using Imaging Mass Cytometry

Abstract:
The spatially resolved characterization of immune infiltration in tumors is crucial for understanding cancer immunology. In 2022, advances in imaging mass cytometry enabled the simultaneous visualization of multiple immune markers at subcellular resolution. Leveraging this technology, we introduce the SpatialVizScore, a novel metric that quantifies the spatial variability of immune cell infiltration in human lung cancer tissues. By analyzing multiplex protein imaging data, the SpatialVizScore captures the complex interactions between tumor cells and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. Our results demonstrate a significant correlation between the SpatialVizScore and Immunoscore, a established measure of immune infiltration. The integration of SpatialVizScore with existing Immunoscore frameworks enhances our understanding of the spatial dynamics of anti-tumor immunity, providing valuable insights for cancer immunotherapy. This novel approach has the potential to redefine the stratification of lung cancer patients based on the spatial heterogeneity of their tumor immune landscapes.
