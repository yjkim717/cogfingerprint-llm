**Title:** An Unprecedented Epizootic: Analyzing the 2022 Surge of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 in European Avian Populations and Implications for Biosecurity

**Abstract:**

The 2022 calendar year marked a paradigm shift in the epidemiology of avian influenza in Europe, culminating in the most extensive and severe epizootic on record. The primary agent, identified as the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus of the Gs/Gd lineage, exhibited unprecedented persistence and spatial dissemination across the continent. This study synthesizes surveillance data to delineate the dual-front nature of this crisis, characterized by synchronous, large-scale outbreaks in both commercial poultry operations and rampant mortality events within wild bird populations. The epizootic's trajectory deviated from established seasonal patterns, with viral circulation continuing throughout the summer months, thereby establishing endemicity in wild avifauna. This endemic reservoir served as a perpetual source of spillover, challenging conventional containment protocols predicated on seasonal migration. The consequences were profound, involving the culling of millions of domestic birds and significant ecological impacts on susceptible wild species, including seabirds and raptors. Critical analysis of outbreak reports and phylogenetic data indicates that the heightened viral fitness and environmental tenacity of the circulating clades overwhelmed existing biosecurity frameworks. Consequently, this review posits that the 2022 HPAI H5N1 epizootic necessitates a fundamental re-evaluation of mitigation strategies. We argue for the urgent development and implementation of enhanced, risk-based biosecurity measures, augmented passive surveillance in wild birds, and the exploration of next-generation interventions, such as vaccination strategies for high-value poultry stocks. The events of 2022 underscore that HPAI management must evolve to address the new reality of enzootic circulation within a complex ecological matrix.
