**Abstract**

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is increasingly recognized as a significant contributor to cognitive dysfunction, with subclinical impairments often preceding overt clinical presentation. This systematic review, conducted in 2022, investigates the potential of P300 event-related potentials (ERPs) as a sensitive biomarker for cognitive assessment in adult women diagnosed with IDA. A comprehensive search of databases revealed compelling evidence demonstrating alterations in P300 latency and amplitude in individuals experiencing IDA, suggesting impaired cortical processing speed and attentional resources. Specifically, studies consistently reported prolonged P300 latencies and reduced P300 amplitudes, indicative of diminished neural efficiency in response to cognitive stimuli. Crucially, longitudinal analyses and intervention studies incorporating iron supplementation demonstrated a significant amelioration of these P300 abnormalities, correlating with improvements in cognitive performance as measured by standardized cognitive assessments. These findings suggest that P300 ERPs offer a valuable, objective tool for the early detection of cognitive vulnerability in women with IDA and for monitoring treatment efficacy. Further research is warranted to establish standardized P300 protocols and to explore the utility of this neurophysiological marker in diverse populations and across the spectrum of IDA severity. The integration of P300 assessment into clinical practice could facilitate timely intervention and potentially mitigate long-term cognitive sequelae associated with iron deficiency.
