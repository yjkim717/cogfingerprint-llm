**Abstract**

Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) represents a significant global health burden, with its neurocognitive sequelae being of particular clinical concern. While conventional psychometric testing can detect deficits, a sensitive, objective biomarker for early and subtle cognitive impairment is lacking. This systematic review and meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines, synthesizes evidence from electrophysiological studies to evaluate the P300 event-related potential (ERP) as a putative neurophysiological marker in IDA. We systematically queried PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published up to December 2021 that compared P300 latency and amplitude in adult women with IDA against iron-replete controls. Our analysis of eight eligible studies (n=412 participants) revealed a consistent and significant prolongation of P300 latency (Hedges' g = 0.89, 95% CI 0.62–1.16, p<0.001) and reduction in amplitude (Hedges' g = -0.71, 95% CI -0.98 – -0.44, p<0.001) in the IDA cohort, indicating delayed information processing speed and diminished attentional resource allocation. Crucially, longitudinal data from interventional studies demonstrated a significant normalization of these P300 parameters following iron supplementation, correlating with hematological recovery. These findings robustly indicate that IDA induces measurable alterations in cortical information processing, which are reversible with treatment. We conclude that the P300 ERP serves as a sensitive, objective tool for the early detection and monitoring of cognitive dysfunction in IDA, potentially enabling timely intervention before deficits manifest on standard cognitive batteries.
