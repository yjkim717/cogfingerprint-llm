**Abstract**

The ghrelin system, traditionally recognized for its role in appetite regulation, has emerged as a significant modulator of colorectal cancer (CRC) biology. This review, conducted in 2022, synthesizes current understanding of the ghrelin axisâ€™s complex involvement in CRC progression. We explore the mechanistic contributions of ghrelin and its receptor, GHS-R1a, to key cellular processes including proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Furthermore, we evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of ghrelin and related biomarkers in CRC, considering their potential for early detection and risk stratification. Emerging evidence suggests that ghrelin levels may correlate with disease stage and patient survival outcomes. Finally, we discuss therapeutic strategies targeting the ghrelin system as a potential avenue for mitigating CRC-related syndromes, including modulation of ghrelin signaling pathways and the development of GHS-R1a antagonists. This review highlights the evolving landscape of ghrelin research within oncology and underscores the need for further investigation into its translational applications for improved CRC management.
