**Abstract**

*Pleurotus ostreatus*, a widely utilized white-rot fungus, holds significant potential for enhanced lignocellulose degradation, a critical process for sustainable biomass utilization. However, targeted genetic modification remains a considerable challenge. This study details a novel approach leveraging CRISPR-Cas9 technology to facilitate precise, multi-gene mutation induction within *P. ostreatus*.  We engineered a polycistronic tRNA construct, enabling simultaneous modification of multiple target genes concurrently.  Specifically, this strategy circumvents the limitations of traditional single-gene editing, accelerating the identification of beneficial mutations impacting ligninolytic enzyme production. 

Our research, conducted in 2022, demonstrates the efficacy of this method in introducing defined multiple-gene mutations within *P. ostreatus*. Preliminary data indicates a substantial increase in the expression of key ligninolytic genes following CRISPR-Cas9 delivery via the polycistronic tRNA system.  These findings represent a significant advancement in fungal genetic engineering, offering a streamlined pathway for optimizing fungal biocatalysts for efficient and robust lignocellulose decomposition. Future work will focus on characterizing the phenotypic consequences of these engineered mutations.
