**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health challenge, necessitating a deeper understanding of its complex etiologies. This study examines the emerging role of the ghrelin system within CRC pathogenesis, hypothesizing an autocrine/paracrine mechanism driving tumor progression. Utilizing in vitro and in vivo models, we investigated the impact of ghrelin signaling on CRC cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Preliminary findings suggest that ghrelin stimulates CRC cell growth via activation of specific downstream signaling pathways, including MAPK and PI3K/Akt cascades. Furthermore, ghrelin expression was elevated in colorectal tumor tissue, indicating a potentially critical role in sustaining tumor development. These results highlight the ghrelin system as a novel therapeutic target and biomarker for CRC; however, future research is crucial to fully elucidate the intricate interplay of ghrelin receptors and signaling networks within the tumor microenvironment and its clinical implications.
