This study presents an analytical derivation of nanoparticle cluster density dynamics during intracellular trafficking, with specific application to endosomal fusion processes. We reformulate Smoluchowski's coagulation equation to account for the confined environment of living cells, obtaining exact solutions for temporal evolution of cluster distributions. Our theoretical framework demonstrates that fusion kinetics between endosomal compartments directly govern nanoparticle aggregation patterns. Validation through quantitative analysis of gold nanoparticle distributions in HeLa cells reveals remarkable concordance between predicted and experimental cluster densities (RÂ² = 0.94). The model successfully captures the transition from monodisperse to polydisperse clustering regimes observed during endosome maturation. These findings provide a fundamental mathematical basis for predicting nanoparticle fate in biological systems, with significant implications for optimizing nanocarrier design in therapeutic applications where controlled clustering directly influences cargo delivery efficiency and intracellular targeting precision.
