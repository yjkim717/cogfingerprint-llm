**Abstract**

*Pleurotus ostreatus*, a white-rot fungus renowned for its ligninolytic enzyme production, presents a compelling model for investigating the genetic basis of enhanced lignocellulose degradation. This study reports the development and implementation of a novel genetic modification strategy targeting *P. ostreatus* to facilitate precise, multi-gene mutation analysis. Leveraging a polycistronic transfer RNA (tRNA) construct alongside CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we achieved efficient generation of multiple-gene mutations simultaneously within the fungal genome. This approach circumvents the limitations of traditional single-gene mutagenesis, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of gene network interactions involved in polysaccharide hydrolysis.  Specifically, we utilized a tailored CRISPR guide RNA targeting a region containing multiple candidate genes associated with ligninolytic activity.  The resultant multiple-gene mutant lines are now amenable to detailed phenotypic characterization, including enzyme activity assays and substrate degradation studies.  This methodology represents a significant advancement, offering a powerful tool for dissecting the complex genetic architecture underpinning efficient fungal degradation of recalcitrant biomass and contributing to the biotechnological optimization of *P. ostreatus* for sustainable biorefining applications.
