Abstract (2022): 
Utilizing Smoluchowski's coagulation equation, this study derives an exact analytical solution for the cluster density distribution of nanoparticles, a crucial parameter in nanodiagnostics and cancer therapy. The derived cluster density exhibits strong agreement with experimental data on gold nanoparticle aggregation within living cells. This theoretical framework enables precise modeling of nanoparticle clustering, facilitating the optimization of nanoparticle-based diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The results demonstrate the potential of mathematical modeling to enhance the efficacy of nanoparticle-mediated cancer treatment.
