**Abstract**

Emerging evidence implicates genetic predisposition, particularly the *APOE ε4* allele, in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study investigated proteomic alterations within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to delineate potential biomarkers associated with *APOE ε4* status. Utilizing CSF proteomics, we identified distinct proteomic signatures significantly correlated with the presence of *APOE ε4*. Notably, these signatures revealed heightened activity within the complement pathway, alongside altered levels of amyloid beta-related proteins. These findings suggest that *APOE ε4* genotype induces a specific inflammatory milieu within the central nervous system, contributing to AD progression.  The observed CSF proteomic profiles offer a novel avenue for early AD detection and potentially inform the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.  Further research is warranted to validate these biomarkers and explore their predictive utility in longitudinal clinical trials, ultimately supporting personalized treatment strategies for individuals at risk of AD.
