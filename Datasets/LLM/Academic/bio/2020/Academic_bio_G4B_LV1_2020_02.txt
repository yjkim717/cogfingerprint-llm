**Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Drives Angiogenesis and Metastatic Progression in Colorectal Cancer**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, largely attributed to its propensity for metastasis. Emerging evidence strongly implicates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as a critical regulator of both angiogenesis and metastatic dissemination within the tumor microenvironment. This review synthesizes recent advances in elucidating the complex interplay between Wnt signaling, β-catenin stabilization, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in CRC. Elevated β-catenin activity, frequently observed due to mutations or aberrant activation, directly stimulates VEGF expression, fostering neoangiogenesis essential for tumor growth and nutrient supply. 

Furthermore, Wnt signaling promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key driver of metastasis, by modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other adhesion molecules. We posit that targeting the Wnt/β-catenin axis represents a promising therapeutic strategy to simultaneously inhibit angiogenesis and suppress metastatic potential. Future research focused on specific pathway inhibitors and downstream effectors holds significant potential for enhancing clinical outcomes in CRC patients, particularly those exhibiting aggressive metastatic disease.
