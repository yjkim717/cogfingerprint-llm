**Abstract**

India’s burgeoning population and evolving healthcare demands necessitate a critical evaluation of its allied health professional workforce. This paper posits that the current decentralized and largely unregulated training landscape within India contributes significantly to a pronounced workforce shortage and compromises the quality of healthcare delivery.  A central, standardized council is proposed as a foundational solution to mitigate these challenges. Such a council would establish rigorous national standards for allied health curricula, accreditation processes, and professional licensure.  Addressing the lack of standardization directly impacts workforce competency and hinders effective resource allocation. Furthermore, the absence of unified professional pathways exacerbates existing shortages, particularly in rural and underserved regions.  Implementation of this structural reform is deemed crucial to optimizing the utilization of allied health professionals and ensuring equitable access to essential healthcare services within the Indian context, particularly as highlighted in the 2020 global health landscape.
