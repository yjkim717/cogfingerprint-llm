**Abstract**

Dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC), profoundly influencing tumor progression and metastasis. This study investigates the intricate relationship between Wnt/β-catenin activity and angiogenesis within the CRC microenvironment. Specifically, we demonstrate that elevated Wnt signaling robustly stimulates the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key regulator of angiogenesis. Increased VEGF levels, in turn, contribute to the formation of new blood vessels supplying the tumor, facilitating metastasis to distant sites.  Consequently, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway represents a critical node in the metastatic cascade. Targeting this signaling network offers a compelling therapeutic strategy for CRC. Further research in 2020 highlighted the potential for Wnt inhibitors to simultaneously suppress angiogenesis and impede tumor dissemination, warranting continued investigation into this pathway’s role in CRC pathogenesis.
