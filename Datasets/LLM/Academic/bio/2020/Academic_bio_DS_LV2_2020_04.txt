**Abstract**

The Indian healthcare system confronts a critical deficit, quantified at approximately 6.5 million, in its allied health professional (AHP) workforce. This human resource crisis constitutes a primary bottleneck to achieving equitable and effective healthcare delivery, particularly in the context of a growing burden of non-communicable diseases. The prevailing regulatory landscape for AHPs is fragmented, characterized by a lack of standardized education, scopes of practice, and credentialing mechanisms. This analysis posits that the absence of a unified regulatory body perpetuates workforce inefficiencies, limits career progression, and ultimately compromises patient safety and care outcomes. We argue that the establishment of a centralized, statutory Allied Health Services Council is an indispensable policy intervention. Such a council would be mandated to enforce national educational standards, define professional competencies, and maintain a centralized registry. The implementation of this centralized governance structure is projected to enhance workforce planning, increase professional mobility, and significantly strengthen the overall capacity and quality of India's healthcare infrastructure, thereby addressing a fundamental constraint on public health efficacy.
