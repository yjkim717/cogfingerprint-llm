**Abstract**

Intracellular transport exhibits significant heterogeneity, posing challenges for mechanistic understanding and predictive modeling. Existing approaches often struggle to capture the complex, non-Markovian dynamics observed in rapidly moving organelles, particularly within neuronal networks. This study presents a novel neural network methodology designed to quantitatively analyze this heterogeneous transport behavior. Leveraging principles of fractional Brownian motion and incorporating the Hurst exponent – a measure of long-range dependence – our framework allows for the characterization of transport trajectories beyond traditional Brownian motion assumptions.  The developed network architecture effectively identifies and models the underlying stochastic processes driving organelle movement. Preliminary results demonstrate improved accuracy in predicting transport variability compared to conventional statistical methods.  Further research will focus on validating these findings within diverse cellular contexts and exploring the implications for neuronal function.
