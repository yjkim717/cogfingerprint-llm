Title: Unveiling Heterogeneous Intracellular Transport Dynamics using Fractional Brownian Motion-Informed Neural Networks

Abstract:
Intracellular transport is a complex, multi-scale process essential for cellular function, yet its heterogeneous behavior hinders comprehensive understanding. Traditional analysis methods often falter when dealing with short time series data, prevalent in live-cell imaging. In response, we introduce a novel neural network framework informed by fractional Brownian motion (fBm) to resolve the intricacies of intracellular transport. By integrating the Hurst exponent, a characteristic parameter of fBm, our model effectively captures the underlying dynamics of transport processes. Applied to real-world datasets from 2020, our approach demonstrates superior performance in analyzing heterogeneous transport behaviors, even with limited data. This methodological advancement enables the quantification of subtle changes in transport dynamics, offering new insights into cellular physiology and pathology. Our framework paves the way for further investigation into the complex interplay between cellular structure and function, with implications for understanding various diseases.
