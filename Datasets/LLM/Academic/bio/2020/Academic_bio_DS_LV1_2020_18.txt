**Abstract**

The latter half of 2020 witnessed a significant epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) across Europe, necessitating a comprehensive epidemiological assessment. This study delineates the spatiotemporal patterns and etiological agents responsible for the surge in outbreaks within both wild avifauna and domestic poultry populations from August to December 2020. Through coordinated national surveillance programs and subsequent virus isolation and genetic sequencing, we identified the H5N8 subtype of HPAI A virus as the predominant causative agent. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the circulating viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b, demonstrating a high degree of genetic homology with strains previously identified in Asia, suggesting recurrent intercontinental transmission via migratory bird flyways. The primary epidemiological driver was the unprecedented scale of viral circulation in wild birds, particularly among waterfowl (Anseriformes) and raptors, which served as a pervasive reservoir and dissemination mechanism. This widespread environmental viral load precipitated numerous incursions into commercial and backyard poultry holdings, often linked to indirect contact through contaminated fomites or environments. Despite the intense epizootic activity and substantial economic impacts on the agricultural sector, the zoonotic risk was assessed as persistently low. This assessment is based on the absence of reported human infections linked to this specific H5N8 lineage during the study period and the lack of molecular markers associated with enhanced binding to human-type Î±2,6-linked sialic acid receptors or resistance to antiviral neuraminidase inhibitors in the viral hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes, respectively. We conclude that the 2020 HPAI H5N8 epizootic underscores the critical role of wild bird migration in the continental spread of avian influenza and highlights the necessity for robust, integrated surveillance systems at the wildlife-domestic animal interface to facilitate early detection and implement effective biosecurity countermeasures.
