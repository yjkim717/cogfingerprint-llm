**Abstract**

Recent advancements in single-cell multiomics necessitate robust methods for temporal analysis of cellular dynamics. This study introduces protaccel, a novel framework extending RNA velocity by integrating protein abundance estimates, offering a comprehensive reconstruction of cellular trajectories. Protaccel leverages quantitative proteomic data alongside transcriptomic measurements to predict past, present, and future cell states within single-cell datasets.  We demonstrate the method’s efficacy through extensive validation across multiple independent datasets, revealing consistent patterns in both cell landscape reconstruction and phase portrait analysis.  Specifically, protaccel facilitates the identification of distinct cellular phases and highlights conserved temporal relationships irrespective of experimental conditions.  These findings underscore the potential of protaccel to provide a more holistic understanding of cellular behavior, bridging the gap between transcriptomic and proteomic information – a critical step towards a truly integrated single-cell biology.
