Title: Enhancing Cancer Genomics Research through Interactive Online Tools for PCAWG Data Exploration

Abstract:
The advent of whole genome sequencing has revolutionized cancer genomics research, with initiatives like the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) generating vast amounts of complex genomic data. To facilitate the exploration and interpretation of this data, we present five online tools designed to enable dynamic querying and visualization of PCAWG data. These tools integrate seamlessly into the genomics ecosystem, providing researchers with a robust framework for investigating cancer genomics. By leveraging these interactive tools, scientists can uncover novel insights into the genomic landscape of cancer, driving advancements in our understanding of tumorigenesis and the development of targeted therapies. Our work underscores the importance of accessible and user-friendly data exploration platforms in accelerating cancer genomics research, ultimately enhancing our capacity to translate genomic discoveries into clinical benefits.
