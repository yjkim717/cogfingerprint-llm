**Abstract**

The precise orchestration of intracellular transport is fundamental to cellular function, yet often exhibits complex, heterogeneous behavior. This study investigates the dynamics of endocytic organelle movement within mammalian cells, employing a novel neural network approach to quantify and characterize this process. Traditional analyses relying on Brownian motion models frequently fail to capture the observed non-Gaussian fluctuations indicative of more sophisticated transport mechanisms. We demonstrate that a neural network, trained on time-lapse microscopy data, successfully models the observed heterogeneity, revealing deviations from standard fractional Brownian motion.  Specifically, we observed a statistically significant correlation between observed movement patterns and Hurst exponents, suggesting a degree of long-range dependence.  These findings indicate that neural network modeling provides a powerful tool for dissecting the intricacies of intracellular transport, offering insights into the emergent properties of neural networks within cellular systems and highlighting the limitations of simplified stochastic descriptions.
