Title: Resolving Heterogeneous Intracellular Transport Dynamics using Deep Learning Neural Networks

Abstract:
Intracellular transport is a complex process characterized by heterogeneous behavior, hindering the accurate quantification of transport dynamics. Traditional methods, such as fractional Brownian motion analysis, rely on extensive data sets to estimate the Hurst exponent, a measure of transport behavior. Here, we demonstrate that a deep learning neural network can accurately resolve heterogeneous intracellular transport dynamics using significantly fewer data points than established methods. By leveraging the representational power of neural networks, our approach achieves robust estimation of the Hurst exponent, enabling the characterization of diverse transport behaviors. Our results show that deep learning-based analysis can outperform traditional methods, providing a reliable and efficient tool for investigating intracellular transport dynamics. This advancement has significant implications for understanding cellular processes and deciphering the underlying mechanisms governing heterogeneous transport behavior. (2020)
