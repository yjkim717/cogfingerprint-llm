Title: Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Colorectal Cancer: A Critical Regulator of Angiogenesis and Metastasis

Abstract:

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metastasis being the primary contributor to poor prognosis. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has emerged as a pivotal regulator in CRC carcinogenesis, influencing tumor progression and metastasis. As of 2020, research has elucidated the intricate mechanisms by which Wnt/β-catenin signaling modulates CRC angiogenesis, a critical process facilitating tumor growth and dissemination.

The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway is aberrantly activated in CRC, resulting in the accumulation of β-catenin in the nucleus, where it regulates the transcription of target genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Recent studies have demonstrated that Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes CRC angiogenesis by upregulating pro-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and enhancing the migration and tube formation of endothelial cells.

Moreover, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has been implicated in the regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process crucial for CRC metastasis. By modulating EMT-related genes, Wnt/β-catenin signaling enables CRC cells to acquire a more invasive and migratory phenotype, facilitating their dissemination to distant organs.

The complex interplay between Wnt/β-catenin signaling, angiogenesis, and metastasis in CRC highlights the potential for therapeutic targeting of this pathway. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to suppress CRC angiogenesis and metastasis in preclinical models, underscoring its promise as a novel therapeutic strategy.

In conclusion, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating CRC angiogenesis and metastasis, making it a prime target for the development of innovative therapies. Further research is warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC and to explore its therapeutic potential in the clinical setting.
