**Abstract**

The enzymatic degradation of lignin, a recalcitrant component of plant cell walls, represents a critical process in the ecology of white-rot fungi. *Pleurotus ostreatus* is a prominent example, exhibiting variable capacity for ligninolysis. This study, conducted in 2020, utilized transcriptional analysis to dissect the regulatory mechanisms governing lignin degradation in a suite of *P. ostreatus* mutant strains deficient in this key metabolic pathway. Comparative gene expression profiling demonstrated significant alterations in the transcriptional output of cellulolytic and xylanolytic genes within these mutants.  Specifically, a reduction in the expression of genes associated with cellulose hydrolysis was observed alongside a concomitant upregulation of those involved in xylan breakdown.  These findings suggest a complex interplay between ligninolytic and polysaccharide-degrading pathways, potentially mediated by transcriptional feedback loops. Further investigation into the specific ligninolytic genes and their regulatory networks will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of fungal adaptation to lignocellulosic substrates.
