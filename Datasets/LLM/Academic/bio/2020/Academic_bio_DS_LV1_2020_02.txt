**Title:** Dysregulated Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Orchestrates the Angiogenic Switch in Colorectal Carcinogenesis via VEGF-Mediated Mechanisms

**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metastatic dissemination representing the principal determinant of poor clinical outcome. A critical prerequisite for metastasis is angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature, which facilitates tumor growth and hematogenous spread. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a cornerstone of intestinal epithelial homeostasis, is aberrantly activated in approximately 90% of CRC cases, primarily through inactivating mutations in the *APC* (Adenomatous Polyposis Coli) tumor suppressor gene. While its role in initiating tumorigenesis is well-established, its specific contribution to the subsequent angiogenic switch is a subject of intense investigation. This review synthesizes recent advances elucidating how constitutive Wnt/β-catenin signaling, driven by *APC* loss, directly promotes tumor angiogenesis. We delineate the mechanistic framework wherein nuclear accumulation of β-catenin in CRC cells transactivates a pro-angiogenic transcriptional program. A central effector of this program is the potent angiogenic cytokine Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). We discuss evidence demonstrating that β-catenin/TCF complexes directly bind to the promoter region of the *VEGF-A* gene, upregulating its expression and secretion into the tumor microenvironment. This VEGF-rich milieu then acts in a paracrine fashion on adjacent endothelial cells, stimulating their proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Furthermore, we explore emerging data from circa 2020 suggesting that Wnt/β-catenin signaling may also modulate other angiogenic regulators, such as Angiopoietin-2 and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and may promote vessel abnormalization and maturation, creating a permeable and inefficient vascular network that paradoxically favors intravasation and metastasis. The convergence of oncogenic signaling and angiogenesis underscores the potential of targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, not only to suppress tumor cell-autonomous proliferation but also to dismantle its critical supportive vasculature. We conclude by evaluating pre-clinical and nascent clinical strategies aimed at intercepting this axis, positing that dual-targeting approaches represent a promising frontier for managing metastatic CRC.
