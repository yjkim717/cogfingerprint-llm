**The Aberrant Crosstalk Between Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling and Angiogenesis: A Critical Driver of Metastatic Progression in Colorectal Cancer**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metastasis representing the primary challenge to effective treatment.  While significant advances have been made in early-stage CRC management, the development of therapeutic interventions targeting advanced disease, particularly metastatic lesions, remains a critical unmet need.  This review synthesizes current understanding of the complex interplay between the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and angiogenesis, highlighting its significance in promoting CRC metastasis. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, classically involved in embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, is frequently dysregulated in CRC through mutations in *APC*, *CTNNB1*, or other pathway components, leading to constitutive activation and subsequent transcriptional changes.  These changes not only drive uncontrolled proliferation but also profoundly influence the tumor microenvironment, specifically modulating angiogenesis.

Accumulating evidence demonstrates that activated β-catenin directly upregulates the expression of pro-angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) [1]. Furthermore, β-catenin can translocate to endothelial cells, directly influencing their behavior and promoting tube formation and vascular permeability [2].  This aberrant angiogenesis, in turn, supports tumor growth, facilitates intravasation, and enhances the establishment of distant metastases. The non-canonical Wnt pathways, notably the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, also contribute to angiogenesis by regulating endothelial cell migration and alignment [3].

Importantly, the reciprocal relationship between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and angiogenesis creates a feed-forward loop that accelerates metastatic progression. Tumor-derived angiogenic factors stimulate further Wnt signaling within the tumor and surrounding stromal cells, reinforcing the pro-metastatic phenotype.  Given the critical role of this crosstalk, targeting both Wnt/β-catenin signaling and angiogenesis represents a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC. Current research focuses on developing selective Wnt inhibitors and anti-angiogenic agents, and exploring combination therapies that simultaneously disrupt both pathways to achieve synergistic effects [4]. Future studies should prioritize elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction and identifying predictive biomarkers to guide personalized therapeutic approaches in CRC patients.
