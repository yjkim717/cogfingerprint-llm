**Abstract**

The year 2020 witnessed an unprecedented expansion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), variant H5N8, across Europe, with alarming incursions into wild bird populations alongside confirmed outbreaks within poultry farming operations. This geographically dispersed emergence presented a substantial biosecurity threat, demanding immediate and sustained epidemiological investigation. Surveillance efforts, primarily focused on wild bird monitoring, revealed widespread viral circulation among waterfowl and scavenging species, suggesting a complex transmission pathway. Notably, two human cases of HPAI infection were reported, highlighting the zoonotic potential of this evolving strain.  The rapid spread necessitated the implementation of stringent biosecurity protocols within the poultry sector, coupled with enhanced veterinary surveillance programs.  Further research is crucial to fully delineate the evolutionary dynamics of HPAI, predict future spillover events, and refine preventative strategies – specifically targeting wild bird populations – to mitigate the risk of broader epizootic and human health consequences.
