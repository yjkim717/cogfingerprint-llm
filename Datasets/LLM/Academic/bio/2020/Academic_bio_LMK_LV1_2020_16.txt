"Unveiling the Molecular Basis of Lignin Degradation in Pleurotus ostreatus: A Comparative Transcriptome Analysis"

White-rot fungi, notably Pleurotus ostreatus, play a crucial role in lignin degradation. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of wild-type and ligninolysis-deficient mutant strains of P. ostreatus. Our results revealed significant differential expression of key ligninolytic genes, including laccases and peroxidases. The analysis identified novel candidate genes potentially involved in lignin degradation. The findings provide insights into the complex regulatory networks governing ligninolysis and shed light on the molecular basis of this process, contributing to the understanding of P. ostreatus' lignin degradation capabilities as of 2020.
