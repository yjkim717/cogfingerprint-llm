Title: Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalytic Activity in FeOOH-Decorated LaNiO3 Perovskite via Lattice Oxygen Oxidation Mechanism

Abstract:
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for renewable energy applications. Herein, we report a significant enhancement in OER catalytic activity upon decorating LaNiO3 perovskite with FeOOH. The FeOOH decoration promotes lattice oxygen oxidation, a key mechanistic pathway for OER, by weakening the Ni-O bond and facilitating oxygen release. Consequently, the FeOOH-LaNiO3 composite exhibits improved catalytic performance, underscoring the importance of surface modification in optimizing perovskite-based OER electrocatalysts. Our findings provide insights into the design of advanced electrocatalysts via strategic surface engineering, with implications for sustainable energy conversion technologies. (2020)
