**Abstract**

The enzymatic degradation of lignin, a recalcitrant component of plant cell walls, represents a significant challenge in biofuel production and bioremediation. This study investigated the impact of *Pleurotus ostreatus* mutant strains on ligninolytic gene expression using transcriptome analysis. Specifically, we examined several mutants exhibiting altered ligninolytic capacity compared to the wild-type strain. Results demonstrated a consistent downregulation of key ligninolytic genes – including those encoding laccases and peroxidases – within the mutant lineages. Conversely, a concurrent upregulation of genes associated with cellulose hydrolysis was observed. These findings suggest a metabolic shift within the fungal metabolism, prioritizing readily accessible carbohydrates over lignin degradation.  The observed gene expression patterns highlight a potential regulatory mechanism whereby fungal mutants compensate for reduced ligninolytic activity by enhancing cellulolytic capabilities. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise molecular interactions governing this coordinated transcriptional response.
