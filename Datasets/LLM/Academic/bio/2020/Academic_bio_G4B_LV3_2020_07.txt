**Abstract**

Understanding the influence of microclimates on biological diversity and ecosystem processes necessitates detailed spatial temperature data. This study introduces the SoilTemp database, a novel resource designed to bridge a significant deficiency in ecological monitoring. Leveraging a network of near-surface temperature sensors, the database provides high-resolution soil temperature measurements across diverse biomes.  Crucially, the database’s spatial resolution facilitates the quantification of microclimatic variation, offering a critical component for predictive modeling of organismal physiological responses – particularly concerning species distribution and phenology – under projected climate change scenarios.  Data aggregation and analysis within the SoilTemp framework allows researchers to assess the relationship between soil temperature and broader ecosystem functioning, representing a valuable tool for advancing our understanding of climate-driven ecological shifts.
