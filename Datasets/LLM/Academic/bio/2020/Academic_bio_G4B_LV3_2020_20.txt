**Abstract**

The accurate characterization of microclimates is increasingly vital for predicting ecological responses to environmental change. This study introduces the SoilTemp database, a comprehensive repository of high-resolution, time-series soil and near-surface temperature data, meticulously compiled to address a persistent limitation in biospheric monitoring. Utilizing data from diverse biome types – ranging from temperate grasslands to boreal forests – the SoilTemp database facilitates rigorous analysis of soil temperature variability and its influence on localized thermal regimes. These data, coupled with established predictive models, offer a powerful tool for forecasting organismal physiological performance and assessing ecosystem resilience under projected climate scenarios.  Specifically, the database’s granular temporal resolution allows for the investigation of subtle, yet significant, shifts in soiltemp, informing our understanding of plant phenology, decomposition rates, and overall biome stability.
