**Title:** Surveillance and Epidemiology of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (HPAIV) H5N8 Outbreaks in EU/EEA Countries and the United Kingdom during the 2020 Autumn Season

**Abstract:**

Between August and December 2020, the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and the United Kingdom (UK) experienced a significant surge in avian influenza outbreaks, primarily attributed to the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N8. This report summarizes the epidemiological findings and surveillance data collected during this period, shedding light on the dynamics of HPAIV H5N8 transmission among wild birds and poultry populations.

A total of [X] outbreaks were reported in [X] EU/EEA countries and the UK, with the majority occurring in poultry farms and involving [X] birds. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the circulating H5N8 strains belonged to clade 2.3.4.4b, which has been associated with recent global HPAIV outbreaks. The introduction of HPAIV H5N8 into European poultry populations is believed to have occurred through migratory wild birds, which serve as natural reservoirs for the virus.

Surveillance efforts during the reporting period highlighted the importance of wild bird surveillance in predicting and mitigating the risk of HPAIV outbreaks in poultry. Several wild bird species, including [list specific species, e.g., Anseriformes and Charadriiformes], were found to be infected with HPAIV H5N8, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring of wild bird populations.

The implementation of enhanced biosecurity measures on poultry farms and the enforcement of strict control measures, including stamping out infected flocks and movement restrictions, contributed to the containment of the outbreaks. However, the persistence of HPAIV H5N8 in wild bird populations and the potential for reassortment with other avian influenza viruses underscore the need for sustained vigilance and coordinated surveillance efforts across the EU/EEA and UK.

This report underscores the complexities of HPAIV epidemiology and highlights the importance of a multi-faceted approach to mitigating the risks associated with avian influenza outbreaks. The findings emphasize the need for continued investment in surveillance, research, and collaboration among animal health authorities, public health agencies, and the poultry industry to prevent and control future HPAIV outbreaks.
