**Abstract**

Dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a prevalent feature of colorectal cancer (CRC), profoundly impacting tumor progression and metastatic capacity. Recent investigations have established a strong correlation between aberrant Wnt signaling and increased angiogenesis within the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, this pathway promotes the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key regulator of new blood vessel formation. Consequently, enhanced angiogenesis facilitates nutrient supply and oxygenation to the tumor, supporting rapid growth and subsequent metastasis.  Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin signaling directly influences the production of matrix metalloproteinases, enzymes critical for extracellular matrix degradation and invasive behavior. Targeting this signaling cascade represents a compelling therapeutic strategy; preclinical studies in 2020 demonstrated significant reductions in metastasis following Wnt inhibitors, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target in CRC.
