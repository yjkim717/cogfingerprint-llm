**Abstract**

Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway represents a critical regulator of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and crucially, angiogenesis within the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding the intricate interplay between Wnt signaling, angiogenesis, and metastatic progression in CRC. Specifically, aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is frequently observed, driving excessive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and stimulating angiogenesis – a fundamental prerequisite for tumor growth and dissemination. 

Elevated β-catenin levels within CRC cells directly enhance endothelial cell proliferation and migration, fostering the formation of new blood vessels that supply the expanding tumor mass. Furthermore, this pathway promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key driver of metastasis, by modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other pro-metastatic factors.  

Consequently, the Wnt/β-catenin axis has emerged as a compelling therapeutic target in CRC. Current research explores strategies aimed at inhibiting pathway activation, including targeting upstream regulators and directly blocking β-catenin’s transcriptional activity.  Future investigations focusing on the specific angiogenic and metastatic consequences of Wnt signaling hold significant promise for the development of more effective and targeted CRC treatments.
