Title: Integrating Microclimatic Variability into Ecosystem Assessments: Introducing the SoilTemp Database

Abstract:
Microclimates, characterized by localized temperature fluctuations, significantly influence ecosystem processes and organismal responses to climate change. To address the knowledge gap in near-surface temperature dynamics, we present SoilTemp, a comprehensive global database compiling in-situ soil and near-surface temperature measurements. By aggregating data from diverse ecosystems and climates, SoilTemp facilitates the examination of microclimatic variability and its impact on biological processes. The database encompasses a wide range of variables, including soil depth, temperature, and corresponding meteorological data. By integrating SoilTemp with existing climate datasets, researchers can enhance their understanding of the complex interactions between microclimate, ecosystem function, and organismal responses. This synthesis will enable the development of more accurate predictions regarding the consequences of climate change on ecosystems, ultimately informing conservation and management strategies. By bridging the gap between microclimatic research and ecosystem assessments, SoilTemp has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of ecological responses to climate change.
