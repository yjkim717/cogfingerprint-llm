Title: Epidemiological Analysis of Avian Influenza Outbreaks in EU/EEA Countries and the UK during the Second Half of 2020

Abstract:

The ongoing circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) in wild bird populations poses a significant risk to poultry health in Europe. This report summarizes the epidemiological findings of avian influenza outbreaks in EU/EEA countries and the UK between August and December 2020. During this period, a total of 745 avian influenza cases were reported in poultry, with HPAIV subtype H5N8 being the predominant strain. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the viruses isolated from poultry were closely related to those detected in wild birds, suggesting a likely transmission link between the two populations.

The spatial distribution of outbreaks revealed a clustering of cases in northwest Europe, particularly in areas with high densities of poultry farms and waterfowl habitats. The timing of outbreaks coincided with the autumn migration of wild birds, which is thought to have facilitated the spread of HPAIV across the region. The risk of virus transmission to poultry was further exacerbated by the presence of HPAIV in resident wild bird populations, which likely served as a reservoir for the virus.

The findings of this report highlight the need for continued surveillance and monitoring of avian influenza in both wild birds and poultry. The implementation of enhanced biosecurity measures, such as reinforced farm hygiene and strict control of poultry movements, is crucial to mitigating the risk of HPAIV spread. Furthermore, the development of targeted surveillance strategies, focusing on high-risk areas and populations, is essential to early detection and rapid response to emerging outbreaks.

The results of this study underscore the complex interplay between wild birds, poultry, and the environment in the epidemiology of avian influenza. Further research is needed to elucidate the dynamics of HPAIV transmission and to inform the development of effective control measures. The findings of this report provide a critical foundation for the development of evidence-based policies aimed at reducing the impact of avian influenza on poultry health and the European agricultural economy.
