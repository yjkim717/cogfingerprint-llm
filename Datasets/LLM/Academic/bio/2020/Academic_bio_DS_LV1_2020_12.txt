Here we introduce ProtAccel, a computational framework that extends the concept of RNA velocity to the protein level by integrating single-cell multiomics data. By jointly modeling nascent and mature protein expression, ProtAccel infers protein velocity vectors, providing a direct and dynamic view of cellular transitions. This approach enables more accurate temporal ordering of cell states and reveals post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, thereby offering a more comprehensive understanding of cell fate decisions.
