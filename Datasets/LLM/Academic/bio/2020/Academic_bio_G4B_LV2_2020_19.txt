**Abstract**

The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a significant bottleneck in various energy conversion technologies. This research investigates a novel approach to enhancing OER performance utilizing a layered deposition strategy. Specifically, LaNiO₃ perovskite materials were decorated with FeOOH clusters, demonstrating a marked improvement in catalytic activity.  Our findings indicate that this FeOOH 'decoration' facilitates lattice oxygen oxidation within the perovskite structure, effectively lowering the activation energy associated with OER.  Furthermore, we observed a concomitant increase in hydroxyl (OH⁻) adsorption on the modified surface, suggesting a crucial role in stabilizing the key intermediates during the reaction pathway.  Detailed electrochemical analysis revealed a substantial reduction in overpotential and an augmentation in the observed OER current density.  These results underscore the potential of controlled surface modification strategies for optimizing electrocatalytic systems and advancing sustainable energy solutions.
