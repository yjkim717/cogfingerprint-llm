**Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomic Signatures Reflecting APOE ε4 Genotype in Alzheimer’s Disease**

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is increasingly understood as a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and neuropathological hallmarks.  The *APOE ε4* allele remains a significant genetic risk factor, yet its precise mechanisms of action within the disease process require further elucidation. This study investigated the utility of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to discern protein signatures associated with *APOE ε4* status in a cohort of individuals diagnosed with AD. Utilizing targeted mass spectrometry, we quantified a panel of over 200 proteins within CSF samples, correlating protein abundance with both *APOE ε4* genotype and clinical AD progression. 

Our analysis revealed statistically significant differential protein expression patterns, notably elevated levels of several amyloid beta-related proteins in individuals carrying the *APOE ε4* allele. Furthermore, we observed alterations in astrocyte-derived proteins suggesting a potential role for glial dysfunction. These findings establish a distinct CSF proteomic fingerprint linked to *APOE ε4*, offering a novel avenue for early detection and potentially informing personalized therapeutic interventions.  Future research will focus on validating these signatures in larger cohorts and exploring their predictive value for treatment response.
