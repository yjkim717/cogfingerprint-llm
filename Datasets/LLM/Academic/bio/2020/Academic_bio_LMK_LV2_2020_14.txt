Title: Resolving Heterogeneous Intracellular Transport with Deep Learning Neural Networks

Abstract:
Intracellular transport is a complex, stochastic process governing the movement of biomolecules within cells. Characterizing its heterogeneous behavior is crucial for understanding cellular function and dysfunction. Traditional methods, such as fractional Brownian motion analysis, rely on extensive datasets to estimate the Hurst exponent, a measure of transport dynamics. In this study, we leverage deep learning neural networks to accurately resolve heterogeneous intracellular transport behavior using significantly fewer data points. By training a neural network on simulated trajectories, we demonstrate its ability to infer the Hurst exponent with high precision. Our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of data efficiency, enabling the analysis of limited datasets. This advancement has significant implications for the study of intracellular transport in biological systems, particularly in situations where data is scarce, such as in live-cell imaging.
