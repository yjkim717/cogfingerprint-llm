**Abstract**

The critical role of microclimate in modulating species' responses to macroclimate change necessitates high-resolution spatiotemporal data for robust ecological forecasting. However, a significant gap persists between the coarse resolution of standard climate data and the fine-scale thermal environments—particularly soil temperature—that organisms actually experience. This study leverages the global, harmonized SoilTemp database to address this mismatch. We analyzed over 120 million temperature records from more than 20,000 sensors worldwide to quantify the persistent and often substantial deviations between near-surface microclimates and gridded climate products. Our spatiotemporal analysis reveals that these deviations are not random but are systematically influenced by vegetation structure, topography, and soil properties. By integrating these fine-scale measurements, we demonstrate a marked improvement in the predictive accuracy of species distribution models and phenological forecasts. Our findings, contextualized in 2020, underscore that the SoilTemp framework provides an indispensable empirical foundation for moving beyond coarse climate proxies. This work establishes that incorporating organism-relevant microclimate data is paramount for advancing our understanding of biogeographic patterns, species vulnerability, and ecosystem processes under accelerating global change, thereby refining the mechanistic basis of ecological forecasting.
