Here we present a deep learning framework for resolving heterogeneous intracellular transport dynamics in live cells. While traditional mean-squared displacement analysis often fails to capture complex organelle behavior, our approach leverages fractional Brownian motion theory to train a feedforward neural network for robust estimation of the Hurst exponent. This method enables precise classification of anomalous diffusion regimes, distinguishing between subdiffusive, Brownian, and superdiffusive transport modes with high accuracy. Applied to endocytic organelles, our analysis reveals distinct transport characteristics between early and late compartments, suggesting differential regulation by cytoskeletal elements and molecular motors. This computational advance provides a powerful tool for quantifying intracellular trafficking, offering new insights into organelle-specific dynamics and their implications for cellular function in health and disease.
