**Abstract**

The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele constitutes the most prevalent genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), though the precise molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity remain incompletely delineated. This study employed high-resolution, quantitative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to characterize the differential pathophysiological processes associated with APOE genotype and clinical disease stage. We analyzed CSF from a well-characterized cohort of amyloid-β (Aβ)-positive individuals, stratified by APOE ε4 carrier status and severity of cognitive impairment (cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia). Our analysis revealed that APOE ε4 carriers exhibit a distinct CSF proteomic signature, characterized by pronounced dysregulation in two key pathways. First, we observed an exacerbated upregulation of proteins within the complement cascade (e.g., C1q, C3), indicative of enhanced innate immune activation and neuroinflammatory signaling. Second, we identified a marked decrease in pre- and post-synaptic protein concentrations (e.g., neurogranin, GAP-43), suggesting an accelerated rate of synaptic degeneration. Importantly, the magnitude of these alterations was not uniform across disease stages; the most significant proteomic divergence between ε4 carriers and non-carriers was evident in the pre-dementia stages. These findings, generated in 2020, posit that the APOE ε4 genotype drives a more aggressive trajectory of AD pathogenesis, primarily by potentiating Aβ-aggregation-triggered complement activation and concomitant synaptotoxicity early in the disease continuum. This genotype-specific pathobiological cascade has profound implications for the stratification of patients in clinical trials and the development of targeted, mechanistically informed therapeutics, particularly those aimed at modulating the complement pathway or bolstering synaptic resilience.
