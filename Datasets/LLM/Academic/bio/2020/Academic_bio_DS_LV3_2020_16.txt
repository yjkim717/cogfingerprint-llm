In this study, we employed comparative transcriptomics to investigate the molecular basis of lignin degradation in white-rot fungi, using *Pleurotus ostreatus* as a model system. We generated and analyzed transcriptome profiles of wild-type and mutant strains exhibiting differential ligninolytic activity. Our analysis revealed significant transcriptional reprogramming in the mutants, characterized by the concerted upregulation of key lignocellulolytic genes encoding lignin-modifying peroxidases and auxiliary enzymes. These findings suggest the existence of a previously uncharacterized regulatory network that orchestrates the expression of the enzymatic machinery required for lignocellulose deconstruction. This research, conducted in 2020, provides crucial mechanistic insights into fungal lignin degradation, with significant implications for advancing biotechnological applications in biomass conversion and the development of sustainable biorefining processes.
