Title: Deciphering Ageing Dynamics through Multi-Omics Analysis: Unveiling Organ-Specific Temporal Signatures in Mus musculus

Abstract:

Ageing is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive physiological decline and increased susceptibility to disease. Despite significant advances in understanding ageing mechanisms, the intricacies of ageing dynamics across different organs remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive multi-omics analysis of Mus musculus across its lifespan, integrating transcriptomic and plasma proteomic data to elucidate organ-specific temporal signatures associated with ageing. Our analysis revealed pronounced gene expression shifts and changes in protein levels that exhibit distinct temporal patterns across various organs, underscoring the heterogeneity of ageing processes. Notably, we observed significant alterations in the expression of genes involved in intercellular communication pathways, suggesting a pivotal role for these processes in orchestrating ageing dynamics. Furthermore, our plasma proteomics analysis identified a subset of proteins that not only change with age but also exhibit strong correlations with specific organ functions, highlighting their potential as biomarkers for monitoring ageing progression. Our findings provide a comprehensive map of ageing dynamics in Mus musculus, shedding light on the organ-specific changes that occur across the lifespan. The identification of distinct temporal signatures associated with ageing in different organs has significant implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying ageing and age-related diseases. Moreover, the discovery of ageing-related biomarkers in plasma proteomics data offers a promising avenue for the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools to monitor ageing progression and evaluate the efficacy of interventions aimed at promoting healthy ageing. By elucidating the complex interplay between gene expression, protein levels, and intercellular communication during ageing, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the ageing process and lays the groundwork for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate age-related decline. As the global population continues to age, the insights gained from this study are poised to inform research into ageing and age-related diseases, ultimately contributing to the improvement of human healthspan.
