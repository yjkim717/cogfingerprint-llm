Title: Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity of LaNiO3 Perovskite via FeOOH Decoration for Oxygen Evolution Reaction

Abstract:
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial process in various energy conversion and storage technologies. In 2020, research focused on optimizing perovskite-based electrocatalysts to enhance OER efficiency. This study investigates the effect of FeOOH cluster decoration on the electrocatalytic activity of LaNiO3 perovskite. Our results demonstrate that FeOOH decoration significantly enhances the OER activity of LaNiO3 by promoting lattice oxygen oxidation. The FeOOH clusters facilitate the formation of active oxygen species, thereby increasing the reaction rate. The decorated LaNiO3 perovskite exhibits improved catalytic stability and a reduced overpotential, making it a promising candidate for electrochemical water splitting applications. This work provides insights into the role of FeOOH decoration in modulating the electrocatalytic properties of perovskite materials, shedding light on the design of efficient OER catalysts for renewable energy technologies.
