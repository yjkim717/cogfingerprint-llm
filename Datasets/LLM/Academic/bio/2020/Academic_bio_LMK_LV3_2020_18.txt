**Title:** Enhanced Surveillance and Biosecurity Measures in Response to Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Outbreaks in EU/EEA Countries and the UK, 2020

**Abstract:**

The emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in wild birds and poultry poses significant threats to animal and human health, as well as the poultry industry. Between August and December 2020, a total of 561 HPAI virus detections were reported across 15 European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and the United Kingdom, predominantly in wild bird populations. This surge in HPAI cases underscores the need for robust surveillance and biosecurity measures to mitigate the spread of the virus.

The HPAI outbreaks reported during this period were primarily attributed to the introduction of the virus by wild birds, which serve as natural reservoirs for avian influenza viruses. The subsequent transmission to poultry farms highlights the importance of stringent biosecurity protocols to prevent the introduction and spread of the virus within domestic bird populations.

In response to the escalating HPAI situation, EU/EEA countries and the UK implemented enhanced surveillance and control measures, including intensified monitoring of wild bird populations and poultry farms. These efforts aimed to rapidly detect and respond to HPAI outbreaks, thereby reducing the risk of virus transmission and mitigating the impact on the poultry industry.

The implementation of robust biosecurity measures, such as strict farm biosecurity protocols, movement controls, and culling of infected flocks, played a crucial role in containing the spread of the virus. Furthermore, the sharing of epidemiological data and coordination among EU/EEA countries and the UK facilitated a unified response to the outbreak, enabling the development of targeted control strategies.

This study highlights the critical importance of integrated surveillance and biosecurity measures in controlling HPAI outbreaks. The findings emphasize the need for continued vigilance and cooperation among countries to mitigate the risks associated with HPAI viruses. By strengthening surveillance and biosecurity protocols, we can reduce the likelihood of future outbreaks and protect both animal and human health. The lessons learned from the 2020 HPAI outbreak can inform the development of more effective strategies for preventing and controlling avian influenza in the future.
