Title: Enhancing Proteomics Analysis through Localization-Aware Open Search in Mass Spectrometry

Abstract:
The identification of post-translational modifications (PTMs) is crucial in understanding protein function and regulation. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting PTMs; however, conventional search strategies often suffer from limitations in sensitivity and accuracy. In 2020, advancements in computational methods led to the development of MSFragger, a tool facilitating open searches in mass spectrometry data. Building upon this, we introduce a refined open search strategy termed localization-aware open search. This approach integrates the localization of PTMs within peptides, thereby enhancing the confidence in modification identification. By applying this strategy to large-scale proteomics datasets, we demonstrate a significant improvement in the detection of modified peptides. Our results underscore the potential of localization-aware open search to advance PTM discovery, offering a more nuanced understanding of protein regulation and its implications in cellular processes.
