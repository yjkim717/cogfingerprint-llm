Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a biological/biophysics publication, and contextualized to a 2020 timeframe.  I've aimed for approximately 178 words.

**Abstract**

Intracellular transport, particularly within endosomal networks, is a critical process governing cellular signaling and homeostasis. The dynamics of cargo movement within these networks often exhibit complex, non-Gaussian behaviors, frequently characterized by long-range correlations detectable through fractal analysis. Traditionally, estimating Hurst exponents – a quantitative measure of these long-range correlations reflecting transport efficiency – from single-particle tracking data has been hampered by limitations in data acquisition and statistical inference, especially when dealing with small sample sizes. Here, we present a novel deep learning approach for robust Hurst exponent estimation in heterogeneous intracellular transport environments. Our methodology leverages a convolutional neural network trained on simulated trajectories generated using fractional Brownian motion (fBm), a stochastic process that accurately models persistent random walks. The network demonstrates exceptional accuracy in estimating Hurst exponents from relatively short trajectories, outperforming conventional methods when data is scarce. This approach allows for a more detailed characterization of endosomal transport dynamics and provides a powerful tool for analyzing complex cellular processes, potentially revealing insights into disease mechanisms associated with impaired intracellular trafficking.  The method is validated using synthetic and experimental data, demonstrating its applicability to real-world biological investigations.
