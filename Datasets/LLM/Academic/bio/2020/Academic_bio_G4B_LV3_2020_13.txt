**Abstract**

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic necessitated a rapid and multi-faceted response, demanding innovative diagnostic strategies and preventative interventions. This review synthesizes the critical advancements observed in 2020, focusing on the evolution of diagnostic methodologies – from initial RT-PCR assays to the deployment of rapid antigen tests – alongside the development and implementation of preventative measures including masking protocols and social distancing guidelines. Furthermore, the abstract addresses the evolving policy landscape shaped by the pandemic, noting the crucial role of governmental mandates and public health campaigns.  Crucially, the analysis underscores the accelerating impact of biomedical research, particularly in the development of vaccine candidates and therapeutic strategies.  Ultimately, this work highlights the synergistic relationship between technological innovation, epidemiological data, and public health policy in mitigating the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, shaping future preparedness for emergent infectious diseases.
