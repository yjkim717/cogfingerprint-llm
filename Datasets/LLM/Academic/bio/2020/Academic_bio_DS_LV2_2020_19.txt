**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a critical bottleneck in electrochemical water-splitting for sustainable hydrogen production. While perovskite oxides like LaNiO3 are promising catalysts, their performance is often limited by sluggish kinetics. This study investigates a novel strategy of FeOOH surface decoration to enhance the OER activity of LaNiO3. Through a combination of electrochemical analysis and spectroscopic characterization, we demonstrate that the FeOOH overlayer significantly promotes the adsorption of hydroxyl intermediates, a crucial step in the OER pathway. Furthermore, our findings indicate that this decoration induces an electronic interaction at the interface, leading to a pronounced weakening of the Niâ€“O bonds within the perovskite lattice. This weakening facilitates the participation of lattice oxygen in the reaction mechanism, thereby activating the more efficient lattice oxygen oxidation (LOO) pathway. The synergistic effect between enhanced hydroxyl adsorption and the facilitated LOO pathway results in a substantially lower overpotential and improved catalytic stability. This work, conducted in 2020, provides a compelling design principle for engineering next-generation perovskite-based electrocatalysts for advanced bio-energy conversion systems. (178 words)
