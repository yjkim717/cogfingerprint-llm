**Title: MSFragger 2.0: A Localization-Aware Open Search Algorithm for Enhanced Modified Peptide Identification in Proteomics**

**Abstract:**

The identification of post-translational modifications (PTMs) is crucial for understanding protein function and cellular signaling pathways. However, the complexity of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data, particularly the presence of stochastic localization effects during fragmentation, often limits the accurate and sensitive identification of modified peptides. Current *de novo* sequencing and peptide identification algorithms frequently fail to fully account for these localization biases, leading to false identifications and reduced confidence in PTM assignments. Here, we present MSFragger 2.0, a significant update to the MSFragger peptide identification software incorporating a novel localization-aware open search algorithm. This approach moves beyond traditional precursor ion scoring methods by explicitly modeling the probability of fragment ion localization across the peptide sequence, thereby mitigating the impact of stochastic fragmentation patterns.  We implemented an open search strategy, allowing for flexible precursor mass tolerances and improved handling of complex spectra.  Benchmarking against both simulated and experimental datasets demonstrates that MSFragger 2.0 exhibits significantly improved identification rates for modified peptides, particularly those with subtle modifications or unusual fragmentation patterns, compared to existing methods, including Mascot, Sequest, and Andromeda.  Furthermore, we observe a substantial reduction in false discovery rate (FDR) at both the peptide and protein levels. This advancement provides a valuable tool for researchers seeking to comprehensively characterize the proteome and gain deeper insights into PTM-mediated biological processes, representing a significant step forward in quantitative and qualitative proteomics analysis in 2020 and beyond.
