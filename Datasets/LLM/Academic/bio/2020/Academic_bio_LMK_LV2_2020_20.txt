Title: Introducing SoilTemp: A Global Database for Enhanced Understanding of Microclimate and Ecosystem Processes

Abstract:
Soil temperature is a critical determinant of ecosystem processes, influencing microbial activity, nutrient cycling, and root growth. As climate change continues to alter global temperature regimes, understanding the complex interactions between soil and near-surface temperature is increasingly important. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce SoilTemp, a comprehensive global database compiling soil and near-surface temperature data from diverse ecosystems. By aggregating data from multiple sources, SoilTemp provides a robust framework for analyzing microclimate variability and its impact on ecosystem processes. The database encompasses a wide range of environmental conditions, facilitating the examination of soil temperature dynamics across different biomes and climatic zones. By enhancing our understanding of soil temperature regimes, SoilTemp has the potential to inform predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change, ultimately contributing to the development of more accurate models of ecosystem functioning.
