Of note, while the provided summary pertains to materials science, the core concept of synergistic enhancement via surface modification is broadly applicable. Here is an original abstract in the field of biology, inspired by the idea of a synergistic catalyst system.

**Abstract**

The efficacy of enzymatic cascades for bio-catalysis is often limited by inefficient substrate channeling and cofactor regeneration. Inspired by synergistic catalyst design in inorganic systems, we report a biomimetic strategy wherein a porous protein scaffold is decorated with a redox-active metallopolymer to enhance the cascade activity of co-immobilized glucose oxidase (GOx) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP). We hypothesized that the polymeric modifier, poly(ferrocenylsilane) (PFS), would facilitate direct electron mediation, mimicking the role of FeOOH in promoting lattice oxygen oxidation. In 2020, our kinetic studies confirmed that the PFS-decorated scaffold significantly accelerated the overall reaction rate by 4.8-fold compared to the unmodified system. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses revealed that PFS enhances local proton concentration and weakens the oxygen-oxygen bond in the HRP-reactive intermediate, thereby synergistically promoting the peroxidative step. This work establishes a general paradigm for engineering synthetic microenvironments to amplify multi-enzyme catalysis, with direct implications for biosensing and sustainable chemical synthesis.
