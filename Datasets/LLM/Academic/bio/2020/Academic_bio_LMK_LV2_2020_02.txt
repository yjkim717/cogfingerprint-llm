Title: Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Angiogenesis: Implications for Cancer Management

Abstract:

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex malignancy characterized by dysregulated cellular processes, including angiogenesis. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a key regulator of cellular homeostasis, has been implicated in CRC progression. Recent studies have elucidated the role of Wnt/Fzd/β-catenin signaling in modulating CRC angiogenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC angiogenesis and its implications for cancer management. 

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway regulates various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Aberrant activation of this pathway is a hallmark of CRC, contributing to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade involves the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, leading to the transcriptional activation of target genes involved in angiogenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The interplay between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and angiogenic factors has been shown to promote CRC angiogenesis, facilitating tumor growth and metastasis.

Emerging evidence suggests that targeting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway may provide a promising strategy for anti-angiogenic therapy in CRC. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors in reducing CRC angiogenesis and tumor growth. Furthermore, the integration of Wnt/β-catenin signaling biomarkers into CRC management may enable personalized treatment approaches. This review will discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC angiogenesis and its potential applications in cancer therapy, highlighting future directions for research and clinical translation.
