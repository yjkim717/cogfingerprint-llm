**Abstract**

The comprehensive characterization of post-translational modifications (PTMs) remains a central challenge in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Traditional database search strategies, limited by pre-defined modification lists, fail to capture the vast landscape of potential peptide variants. In 2020, the introduction of localization-aware open search, as implemented in the MSFragger platform, represented a paradigm shift. This methodology leverages unrestricted precursor mass tolerance to detect both known and unexpected mass shifts, while a novel fragment ion indexing algorithm ensures computational efficiency. Crucially, the approach incorporates localization scoring to distinguish positional isomers, a critical step for accurate PTM assignment. By decoupling the discovery of mass shifts from their precise placement, this strategy achieves a substantial increase in sensitivity for modified peptides without compromising specificity. Consequently, it enables a more unbiased and profound exploration of the proteome, revealing previously obscured PTM dynamics and advancing our understanding of cellular signaling and regulation.
