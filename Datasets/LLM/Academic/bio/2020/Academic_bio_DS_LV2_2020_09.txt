**Abstract**

The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele constitutes the most prevalent genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the precise molecular pathways through which it potentiates disease pathogenesis remain incompletely delineated. This study aimed to characterize the dynamic influence of the APOE ε4 genotype on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome across the AD cognitive continuum, from cognitively unimpaired (CU) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. Utilizing high-throughput, tandem mass tag-based proteomics, we quantified over 1,200 proteins in CSF samples from a well-characterized cohort. Our analysis revealed distinct, stage-specific proteomic signatures associated with the ε4 allele. In CU ε4 carriers, we observed a pronounced upregulation of proteins directly implicated in the amyloid-β (Aβ) pathway, including modifiers of Aβ aggregation and clearance, suggesting an early, prodromal dysregulation of amyloid homeostasis. Conversely, at the MCI and dementia stages, the proteomic profile shifted markedly, with the most significant alterations occurring in proteins central to synaptic integrity and glutamatergic transmission. This included the downregulation of key pre- and post-synaptic scaffolding proteins, correlating with measures of cognitive decline and brain atrophy. Our findings posit a biphasic model of APOE ε4-mediated pathophysiology: an initial, compensatory phase in preclinical stages characterized by altered amyloidogenic processing, which transitions into a second, neurodegenerative phase dominated by profound synaptic failure. These stage-specific proteomic fingerprints not only elucidate the temporal dynamics of APOE ε4 effects but also nominate novel, context-dependent biomarker candidates and potential therapeutic targets for AD prevention and intervention.
