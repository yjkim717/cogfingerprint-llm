**Abstract**

The 2020 autumn migration season in Europe was marked by an unprecedented epizootic of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), signifying a pivotal shift in the virus's ecology and associated zoonotic risk. Between August and December 2020, active surveillance programs across 15 European Union/European Economic Area nations and the United Kingdom documented 561 confirmed HPAI virus detections. This event was characterized by the co-circulation of multiple HPAI virus subtypes, with a notable predominance of H5N8, alongside detections of H5N5 and H5N1, indicating several independent viral introductions into the region rather than a single, clonal expansion. The epidemiological pattern revealed a synergistic spillover dynamic between wild avifauna and domestic poultry populations. Initial outbreaks were primarily identified in wild birds, particularly in waterfowl and raptorial species, which served as a pervasive reservoir and a primary vector for widespread geographical dissemination. This was followed by a consequential surge in poultry outbreaks, with numerous commercial holdings and backyard flocks experiencing severe morbidity and mortality, leading to substantial economic losses and the mandatory culling of millions of birds.

The scale and intensity of this epizootic underscore a critical escalation in the persistence of HPAI viruses within wild bird populations, challenging previous paradigms that viewed these events as primarily seasonal. This endemic establishment in reservoir hosts necessitates a fundamental re-evaluation of surveillance and mitigation strategies. Enhanced, year-round genomic surveillance in wild birds is imperative for the early detection of emerging subtypes and the tracking of viral evolution. Concurrently, the implementation of stringent, compartmentalized biosecurity protocols in the poultry sector is non-negotiable to disrupt the transmission pathway from wild reservoirs to domestic stocks. Furthermore, the circulation of multiple subtypes with known mammalian adaptation markers elevates the potential for zoonotic transmission, warranting continuous risk assessment and interdisciplinary collaboration under a robust One Health framework. The 2020 HPAI epizootic thus represents a sentinel event, highlighting an urgent need for proactive, integrated approaches to mitigate the ongoing threat to animal health, food security, and public health.
