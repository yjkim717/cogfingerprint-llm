Title: Integrating Microclimatic Data to Understand Ecosystem Resilience Under Climate Change

Abstract:
As global temperatures continue to rise, understanding the complex interactions between microclimates and ecosystem processes is crucial for predicting biodiversity responses to climate change. The SoilTemp database initiative provides a comprehensive global dataset of near-surface soil temperatures, enabling researchers to investigate microclimatic variability and its impacts on ecosystem functioning. By integrating this data with existing climate models, we can improve our understanding of the mechanisms driving soil temperature regulation and its effects on below-ground ecosystem processes. This synthesis is critical for informing conservation strategies and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change on biodiversity. As of 2020, the availability of such datasets marks a significant step forward in ecological research, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of ecosystem resilience and the development of targeted management practices to preserve ecosystem services under a changing climate.
