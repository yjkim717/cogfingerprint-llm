The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical need for robust diagnostic and management strategies to mitigate viral transmission. This review synthesizes advancements in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, emphasizing molecular techniques such as RT-PCR and rapid antigen tests, which are pivotal for early detection and containment. Concurrently, we evaluate the evolution of personal protective equipment (PPE), focusing on material innovations that enhance barrier efficacy while addressing supply chain vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we explore the integration of machine learning algorithms into pandemic management, demonstrating their utility in predictive modeling of outbreak trajectories and optimization of resource allocation. These computational tools analyze multimodal data—including epidemiological metrics and mobility patterns—to forecast transmission dynamics with increasing accuracy. Collectively, these interdisciplinary approaches not only strengthen our immediate response capabilities but also establish a scalable framework for future public health crises. The synergy between diagnostic precision, PPE reliability, and data-driven forecasting represents a paradigm shift in proactive pandemic preparedness.
