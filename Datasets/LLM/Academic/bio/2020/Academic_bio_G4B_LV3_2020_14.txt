**Abstract**

Characterizing the intricate intracellular transport mechanisms governing organelle dynamics remains a significant challenge in cell biology. Traditional approaches often struggle to capture the heterogeneous and non-Brownian movement observed in systems like endosomes and lysosomes, particularly when experimental datasets are limited. This study presents a novel deep learning framework leveraging a recurrent neural network to model and analyze these complex trajectories. Utilizing the concept of fractional Brownian motion, quantified through the Hurst exponent, we demonstrate the network’s capacity to discern subtle variations in movement patterns indicative of distinct transport pathways.  The architecture’s ability to extrapolate from sparse data allows for the direct interpretation of experimental tracks, providing a statistically robust method for quantifying intracellular heterogeneity.  Preliminary results suggest the network effectively identifies subpopulations exhibiting accelerated or decelerated transport, offering a valuable tool for investigating cellular signaling and disease pathogenesis.  Further investigation in 2020 focused on validating these findings across multiple cell lines.
