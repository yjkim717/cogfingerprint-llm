**The Aberrant Crosstalk between Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling and Angiogenesis: Implications for Colorectal Cancer Metastasis and Therapeutic Intervention**

**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metastasis representing the primary challenge in effective treatment.  The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a crucial regulator of development and tissue homeostasis, is frequently dysregulated in CRC, contributing to tumorigenesis and disease progression.  While the role of Wnt/β-catenin in CRC proliferation and survival is well-established, its increasingly recognized interplay with angiogenesis – the formation of new blood vessels – is emerging as a critical determinant of metastatic potential. This review synthesizes current understanding of the complex relationship between aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling and angiogenesis within the CRC microenvironment, focusing on the molecular mechanisms underpinning this crosstalk.

Activation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, often driven by mutations in *APC* or *CTNNB1*, leads to the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors to promote target gene expression.  This transcriptional activation influences the expression of pro-angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), angiopoietins, and chemokines, thereby stimulating endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation [Cite relevant VEGF/Wnt studies]. Furthermore, Wnt ligands themselves can directly activate VEGF expression through β-catenin-independent mechanisms [Cite direct Wnt-VEGF interaction studies]. Conversely, angiogenic factors, particularly VEGF, can reciprocally modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, creating a positive feedback loop that sustains both angiogenesis and tumor growth.

The influence of Wnt/β-catenin signaling extends beyond direct factor expression. It also regulates the tumor microenvironment by modulating the recruitment and activity of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which further support angiogenesis and facilitate metastasis [Cite MDSC/CAF/Wnt literature].  The resulting neovasculature exhibits structural and functional abnormalities, characterized by increased permeability and impaired perfusion, contributing to tumor hypoxia and promoting a pro-metastatic niche.

Targeting Wnt/β-catenin signaling has shown promise in preclinical CRC models; however, the complex interplay with angiogenesis highlights the potential for therapeutic resistance and necessitates a more nuanced approach.  Future therapeutic strategies should consider simultaneously modulating both Wnt/β-catenin and angiogenic pathways, perhaps through combination therapies targeting β-catenin and VEGF, or by disrupting the feedback loops between them [Cite examples of combination therapies in development].  A deeper understanding of the specific Wnt ligands and receptors involved in angiogenesis within distinct CRC subtypes will be crucial for personalized therapeutic interventions and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.
