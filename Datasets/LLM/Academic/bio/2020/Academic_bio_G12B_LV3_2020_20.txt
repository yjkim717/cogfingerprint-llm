**Abstract**

Understanding the influence of soil temperature on biological processes remains a significant challenge in the context of accelerating climate change. Existing global climate models often lack the necessary resolution to accurately represent near-surface soil thermal regimes, hindering predictions of ecosystem responses to warming trends. The SoilTemp initiative (launched 2020) directly addresses this limitation by constructing a novel, globally accessible geospatial database of soil temperature measurements. This database integrates data from diverse biomes, providing unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution for characterizing microclimatic conditions. We posit that SoilTemp will facilitate more refined analyses of organismal physiology, phenology, and distribution, ultimately enabling improved projections of ecosystem vulnerability and resilience under future climate scenarios. The collaborative compilation of this resource represents a critical advancement in climate change research and offers a valuable tool for interdisciplinary ecological investigations.
