**Abstract**

The year 2020 witnessed a concerning escalation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically HPAI subtypes, across Europe, with simultaneous detections in both domestic poultry and wild bird populations. This unprecedented geographic distribution necessitates a re-evaluation of existing avian influenza surveillance strategies. Initial investigations revealed a complex transmission pathway, implicating migratory wild bird species as significant vectors for HPAI spread. The rapid emergence and persistence of the virus within multiple European nations underscored the vulnerability of established poultry farming practices to zoonotic introduction. Consequently, heightened biosecurity protocols, including stringent movement restrictions and enhanced disinfection procedures, were implemented across affected regions. Continued monitoring of wild bird populations, coupled with genomic sequencing to track viral evolution and identify potential transmission routes, remains paramount.  Further research is urgently required to fully delineate the ecological dynamics driving HPAI propagation and inform targeted preventative measures to mitigate future outbreaks and safeguard both agricultural and public health.
