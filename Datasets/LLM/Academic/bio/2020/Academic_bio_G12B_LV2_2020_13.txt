**Abstract**

The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the ensuing COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019 presented an unprecedented global health crisis, demanding rapid advancements in diagnostic capabilities, preventative strategies, and clinical management. This review synthesizes the evolving landscape of COVID-19 response within the first year of the pandemic, focusing on critical technological and biomedical developments. Initially, diagnostic efforts centered on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for viral detection, though challenges related to sensitivity, scalability, and turnaround time prompted exploration of alternative methodologies including antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests and antibody detection assays. Furthermore, the review details the widespread implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE) and non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as mask-wearing and social distancing, as primary tools for mitigating transmission. We examine the underlying pandemic biology informing these interventions, considering viral shedding patterns, modes of transmission, and the role of superspreading events. Finally, this work explores early therapeutic approaches, ranging from repurposed antiviral medications to experimental immunomodulatory therapies, acknowledging the urgent need for robust clinical trials and the development of targeted therapeutics. The rapid scientific response to COVID-19 underscores the critical interplay between diagnostic innovation, public health policy, and biomedical research in confronting emergent infectious diseases.
