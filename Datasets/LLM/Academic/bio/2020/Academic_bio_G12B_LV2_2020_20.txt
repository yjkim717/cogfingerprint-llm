>Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a bio-geoscience publication, based on the provided summary and adhering to the requested parameters (2020 context, precise terminology, structured reasoning).  I've aimed for a tone appropriate for a journal like *Ecosystems*, *Global Ecology and Biogeography*, or a similar venue.  I've included a few potential journal title suggestions at the bottom.

**Abstract**

The influence of near-surface soil temperature on terrestrial ecosystem processes is fundamental, yet comprehensive, high-resolution data remain critically scarce, limiting our ability to accurately model and predict ecosystem responses to global environmental change. This study introduces SoilTemp, a novel global geospatial database designed to address this significant data gap. SoilTemp integrates remotely sensed thermal infrared data, meteorological observations, and high-resolution topographic information to generate a continuous, gridded dataset of daily soil temperature at a 30-meter spatial resolution from 2010-2019. We employed a physics-informed, data-driven approach, utilizing machine learning algorithms trained on in-situ measurements to minimize biases inherent in solely relying on satellite observations. The resulting database provides unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution for soil temperature, enabling improved characterization of microclimatic variability across diverse biomes. This resource facilitates investigations into the temperature sensitivity of key ecosystem processes, including carbon cycling, decomposition rates, plant phenology, and microbial activity. Furthermore, SoilTempâ€™s accessibility through a standardized API allows for integration into existing Earth system models and biogeochemical simulations. We anticipate that SoilTemp will substantially advance our understanding of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics and enhance predictive capabilities regarding the impacts of climate change on global ecosystems. The database and associated methodology are publicly available, promoting collaborative research and furthering the application of microclimate data in ecological studies.
