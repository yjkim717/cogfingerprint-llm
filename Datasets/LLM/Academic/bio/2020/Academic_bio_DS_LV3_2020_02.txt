**Title:** The Wnt/β-Catenin/VEGF Axis: A Central Driver of Angiogenesis and Metastatic Progression in Colorectal Carcinoma

**Abstract:**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metastatic dissemination representing the principal determinant of poor patient prognosis. A critical prerequisite for metastasis is angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which supplies tumors with essential oxygen and nutrients. While Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a well-established master regulator of this process, the upstream oncogenic pathways governing its aberrant expression in CRC are not fully delineated. This review synthesizes recent evidence to posit that constitutive activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway serves as the primary molecular engine driving tumor angiogenesis in colorectal carcinogenesis. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin initiate a transcriptional program that promotes cell proliferation and survival. We present a structured argument that this program directly encompasses the upregulation of key pro-angiogenic factors, most notably VEGF. Mechanistically, β-catenin/TCF complexes bind to specific promoter elements of the *VEGFA* gene, stimulating its transcription and subsequent secretion by CRC cells. This autocrine and paracrine signaling fosters a pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment, facilitating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells to form a immature, permeable vascular network. This neovasculature not only sustains primary tumor growth but also provides a conduit for intravasation and systemic spread. Consequently, the Wnt/β-catenin/VEGF axis establishes a critical functional link between initial oncogenic transformation and the advanced, lethal stage of metastatic disease. As of 2020, while anti-VEGF therapies are clinically deployed, their efficacy is often transient. Therefore, this analysis underscores the compelling therapeutic rationale for targeting the upstream Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, either alone or in combination with anti-angiogenic agents, to achieve more durable control of angiogenesis and metastasis in colorectal cancer.
