**Abstract**

The burgeoning healthcare demands of India’s expanding population are increasingly strained by a demonstrable deficiency within its allied health workforce. Concurrent with this shortage, inconsistent training standards and a lack of formalized accreditation across allied health programs contribute to variable skill levels and compromised service quality. This paper argues for the urgent implementation of a national Allied Health Professionals Council (AHPC) to address these systemic challenges. Such a council, operating under established regulatory frameworks, would be instrumental in establishing standardized curricula, overseeing professional certification, and monitoring workforce distribution.  Effective AHPC oversight is hypothesized to bolster workforce adequacy, improve the quality of patient care, and ultimately contribute to more equitable access to essential healthcare services throughout India. Further research is needed to assess the council’s potential impact on workforce retention and long-term sustainability.
