Title: Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus (H5N8) in Wild Birds and Poultry across Europe during the 2020 Outbreak

Abstract:

The rapid dissemination of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) across Europe in 2020 underscores the complex interplay between wild birds, poultry, and environmental factors in the transmission dynamics of these pathogens. Between August and December 2020, a total of 561 detections of HPAIV subtype H5N8 were reported across the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK). This study aims to elucidate the spatiotemporal patterns and epidemiological characteristics of the H5N8 outbreak, with a focus on the relative roles of wild birds and poultry in the spread of the virus.

Phylogenetic analysis of H5N8 isolates revealed a high degree of genetic similarity, suggesting a common origin for the majority of the viruses detected during this period. Spatial analysis indicated that initial outbreaks were predominantly reported in wild birds, particularly waterfowl species, in Eastern Europe. Subsequent spread to Western Europe was characterized by an increasing proportion of detections in poultry farms, highlighting the potential for wild birds to act as vectors for the introduction of HPAIV into domestic poultry populations.

The temporal distribution of H5N8 detections exhibited a marked peak in November 2020, coinciding with the autumn migration of wild birds. This observation supports the hypothesis that migratory wild birds played a key role in the rapid dissemination of HPAIV across Europe. Furthermore, the identification of multiple primary cases in poultry farms in close proximity to wetlands and waterbird habitats underscores the importance of environmental and ecological factors in facilitating the transmission of HPAIV from wild birds to domestic poultry.

The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of targeted surveillance and control strategies aimed at mitigating the risk of future HPAIV outbreaks in Europe. Enhanced monitoring of wild bird populations, particularly during peak migration periods, and the implementation of stringent biosecurity measures on poultry farms are critical components of a comprehensive approach to reducing the spread of HPAIV. Ultimately, a nuanced understanding of the complex interactions between wild birds, poultry, and environmental factors is essential for the development of effective policies and interventions to protect both animal and human health.
