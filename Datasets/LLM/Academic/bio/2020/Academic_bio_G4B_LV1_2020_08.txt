**Unlocking Insights from PCAWG Whole-Genome Sequencing Data: A Comparative Analysis of Online Exploration Tools**

The PCAWG (Pan-Cancer Atlas Working Group) has generated a substantial volume of whole-genome sequencing data across diverse cancer types, presenting a significant challenge for comprehensive biological investigation. This study evaluates five publicly accessible online tools designed to facilitate data exploration and visualization within this dataset. We assessed each tool’s capacity to support exploratory data analysis, including dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the generation of informative visualizations.  The evaluation focused on features like interactive scatter plots, heatmaps, and the ability to filter data based on genomic markers.  Preliminary findings suggest that [tool name] and [tool name] offer particularly robust capabilities for initial data assessment, while further refinement of visualization options within [tool name] would enhance its utility for marker paper-style data interpretation.  These tools represent a valuable resource for researchers seeking to leverage PCAWG’s data to advance cancer genomics.
