Title: Integrating Machine Learning into COVID-19 Diagnostics and Pandemic Management

Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has underscored the need for rapid and accurate diagnostic tools, as well as effective prevention and management strategies. As of 2020, the global response has highlighted the importance of integrating machine learning algorithms into diagnostic protocols to enhance detection accuracy and speed. This review examines the current landscape of COVID-19 diagnostics, including the role of machine learning in interpreting diagnostic imaging and molecular assays. We also discuss the critical role of personal protective equipment (PPE) in preventing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers and the broader community. Furthermore, we explore the application of pandemic biology principles to inform COVID-19 management policies, including surveillance, contact tracing, and quarantine measures. By synthesizing insights from diagnostics, prevention, and policy, this review aims to identify opportunities for improving COVID-19 management through the strategic integration of machine learning and public health best practices.
