**Abstract**

The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the resultant Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in late 2019 instigated an unprecedented global health crisis, necessitating rapid advancements across multiple disciplines within pandemic biology. This review synthesizes key developments in 2020 pertaining to COVID-19 diagnostics, preventative strategies, and associated public health policies.  We examine the evolution of diagnostic methodologies, from initial PCR-based assays to emerging point-of-care technologies, alongside a critical analysis of their impact on epidemiological surveillance.  Furthermore, the abstract details the expedited development and deployment of preventative interventions including non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccine candidates. Finally, we discuss the complex interplay between virological characteristics, diagnostic accuracy, preventative measures, and the formulation of effective pandemic response policies, highlighting crucial areas for continued research and refinement in preparedness for future infectious disease outbreaks.
