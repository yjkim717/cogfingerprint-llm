The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project has generated a vast repository of whole-genome cancer sequencing data, offering unprecedented insights into the genomic landscape of cancer. To facilitate the exploration and interpretation of this complex data, we present a comprehensive user guide for five online bioinformatics tools. These tools enable researchers to visualize and analyze the PCAWG dataset, providing a robust framework for identifying patterns and correlations in cancer genomics. By leveraging these resources, investigators can elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis and progression, informing the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Our guide provides a structured approach to navigating the PCAWG dataset, empowering researchers to harness the full potential of this rich resource. As of 2020, these tools have become essential for advancing cancer research, facilitating a deeper understanding of the genomic drivers of cancer and accelerating the translation of genomic insights into clinical practice.
