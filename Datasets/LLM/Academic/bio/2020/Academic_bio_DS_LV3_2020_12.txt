The 2020 study by Gorin et al. introduces a multimodal extension of RNA velocity that integrates single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic data to enable robust cell state extrapolation. By leveraging protein velocity alongside RNA velocity, this framework enhances temporal inference of cellular dynamics in single-cell multiomics experiments. Validation across six diverse datasets demonstrates improved accuracy in predicting developmental trajectories. The methodology is implemented in the protaccel Python package, providing a scalable computational tool for advancing mechanistic studies of cellular differentiation and disease progression.
