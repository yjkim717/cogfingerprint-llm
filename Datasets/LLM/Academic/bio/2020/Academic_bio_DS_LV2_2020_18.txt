**Abstract**

The 2020 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H5N8, represented a significant ecological and economic threat across the European continent. This study synthesizes and analyzes surveillance data from national and international agencies to delineate the spatiotemporal dynamics, host range, and associated risks of this viral incursion during the latter half of 2020. Our analysis confirms that between August and December 2020, a total of 561 confirmed HPAI H5N8 detections were officially reported across Europe. The epidemiological profile revealed a pronounced predominance of cases within wild avian populations, which constituted the primary reservoir and vector for viral dissemination. Key affected species included waterfowl such as geese and ducks, alongside raptors exhibiting spillover infection, likely through predation on infected avian prey. The rapid westward and southward expansion of the outbreak was temporally correlated with the autumn 2020 migration, underscoring the critical role of wild bird movements in inter-regional transmission.

The persistent and widespread circulation of the virus within wild bird populations precipitated a substantially elevated risk of viral incursion into the poultry sector. Secondary outbreaks in domestic flocks were documented, leading to substantial economic losses from mortality and the requisite implementation of stringent control measures, including culling and the establishment of protection and surveillance zones. The data compellingly indicate that the interface between wild bird habitats and agricultural systems served as a primary hotspot for cross-species transmission. Consequently, this analysis underscores the imperative for enhanced, coordinated, and year-round surveillance programs that integrate both wild bird monitoring and poultry flock testing. We conclude that proactive, risk-based surveillance, coupled with robust biosecurity protocols at the wildlife-domestic animal interface, is indispensable for the early detection of HPAI H5N8 and the mitigation of its impact on animal health, agricultural stability, and potential zoonotic spillover.
