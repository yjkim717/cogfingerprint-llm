**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metastasis representing the primary challenge in effective treatment. A growing body of evidence implicates dysregulation of the Wnt/Fzd/β-catenin signaling pathway as a critical driver of CRC progression, particularly concerning angiogenesis and subsequent metastatic dissemination. This review examines the multifaceted role of this pathway in modulating tumor angiogenesis within the CRC microenvironment, focusing on recent advances documented through 2020. Aberrant activation of β-catenin, often resulting from mutations in *APC* or other pathway components, leads to constitutive signaling, promoting cellular proliferation, survival, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Crucially, Wnt signaling directly influences the expression of pro-angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), contributing to the formation of new blood vessels that support tumor growth and facilitate metastasis. We explore how β-catenin translocates to the nucleus, interacting with TCF/LEF transcription factors to upregulate target genes involved in angiogenesis, invasion, and migration. Furthermore, this review investigates the crosstalk between Wnt signaling and other key pathways, such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, amplifying the angiogenic response. Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies targeting the Wnt/β-catenin axis and its downstream angiogenic effects, including small molecule inhibitors of β-catenin and Fzd receptors, as well as approaches to disrupt VEGF signaling. Understanding the intricate mechanisms by which Wnt signaling fuels angiogenesis in CRC provides a foundation for developing targeted therapies aimed at preventing or inhibiting metastasis and improving patient outcomes.
