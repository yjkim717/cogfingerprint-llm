Title: Advancements in COVID-19 Diagnostics and Management: A Review of Recent Trends and Technologies

Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has underscored the need for effective diagnostics, prevention tools, and management policies. This review examines recent advancements in COVID-19 diagnostics, highlighting the role of machine learning in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and speed. We discuss various diagnostic approaches, including molecular and serological tests, and their implications for pandemic biology. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of personal protective equipment (PPE) on prevention strategies and review current policies for COVID-19 management. Our analysis reveals that recent technological developments, such as AI-driven diagnostic tools, have significantly improved COVID-19 diagnosis and management. We conclude that integrating machine learning and other emerging technologies into COVID-19 diagnostics and management will be crucial in controlling the pandemic and mitigating its biological and societal impacts. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of COVID-19 diagnostics and management, informing future research and policy development.
