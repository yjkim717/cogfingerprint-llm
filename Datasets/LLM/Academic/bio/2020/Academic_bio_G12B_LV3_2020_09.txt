**Abstract**

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics offers a promising avenue for identifying biomarkers predictive of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. This study, conducted in 2020, employed CSF proteomic analysis to investigate genotype-specific molecular pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis. We observed significant proteomic differences in individuals carrying the APOE ε4 genotype compared to non-carriers, particularly concerning amyloid β (Aβ) aggregation and its downstream effects. These findings suggest that APOE ε4 status modulates CSF protein profiles associated with cognitive impairment, potentially reflecting altered Aβ clearance or neuroinflammatory responses. Identifying these genotype-dependent proteomic signatures holds implications for developing personalized therapeutic strategies targeting specific molecular vulnerabilities within the AD continuum.
