Okay, here's an original academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in the style of a 2020 publication. I've aimed for formality, precision, and a logical structure, incorporating terminology relevant to electrocatalysis and materials science.  I've also included a brief "impact statement" at the end, common in many contemporary abstracts.

**Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity in LaNiO₃ via FeOOH Hetero-Decoration: A Mechanistic Investigation of Lattice Oxygen Involvement**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a critical bottleneck in numerous electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, necessitating the development of highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts. While perovskite oxides, particularly LaNiO₃, have demonstrated promise for OER catalysis, their intrinsic activity is often limited. This study investigates the impact of surface decoration with iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) on the OER performance of LaNiO₃. Electrochemical measurements, combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal a significant enhancement in OER activity upon FeOOH deposition.  Our results demonstrate that the catalytic improvement is fundamentally linked to the promotion of lattice oxygen oxidation within the LaNiO₃ structure. Specifically, FeOOH facilitates the extraction of oxygen ions from the Ni-O lattice sites, circumventing the kinetically challenging direct oxidation of water.  Furthermore, DFT simulations suggest that the presence of FeOOH weakens the Ni-O bond strength, further lowering the activation energy for oxygen release.  This synergistic effect, wherein FeOOH acts as an oxygen reservoir and modifies the electronic structure of LaNiO₃, leads to a substantial reduction in overpotential and improved Faradaic efficiency for OER. This work provides valuable insights into the mechanistic role of hetero-decoration in perovskite electrocatalysis and offers a pathway for designing advanced OER catalysts with improved performance and stability.

*Impact Statement:* This research contributes to the rational design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts by elucidating the crucial role of lattice oxygen oxidation and interfacial interactions, potentially accelerating the deployment of sustainable electrochemical energy technologies.
