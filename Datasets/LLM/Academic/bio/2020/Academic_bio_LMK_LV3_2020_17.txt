Title: Standardizing Allied Health Professionals in India: A Centralized Council for Enhanced Healthcare Delivery

Abstract:
The burgeoning healthcare needs in India necessitate a robust allied health workforce. However, the existing heterogeneity in training and practice among allied health professionals exacerbates the supply-demand gap, compromising healthcare delivery. As of 2020, the lack of standardization in education and training has resulted in a fragmented workforce, hindering the effective utilization of allied health professionals. To address this pressing issue, this paper advocates for the establishment of a centralized council to oversee the standardization of allied health professionals in India. A centralized regulatory framework would ensure uniformity in education, training, and practice, thereby enhancing the quality and efficacy of healthcare services. By bridging the existing gaps, a standardized allied health workforce can be leveraged to improve healthcare outcomes, ultimately contributing to the achievement of universal health coverage in India.
