Title: Advancing Microclimate Research: The Role of Soil Temperature in Ecosystem Processes under Climate Change

Abstract:
As global temperatures continue to rise, understanding the complex interactions between microclimate, soil temperature, and ecosystem processes is crucial for predicting biodiversity responses to climate change. The SoilTemp database initiative has aggregated a comprehensive global dataset of soil and near-surface temperature measurements, providing a valuable resource for researchers. By analyzing this dataset, scientists can elucidate the critical role of soil temperature in regulating ecosystem processes, such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and plant growth. This research has significant implications for understanding the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, as changes in soil temperature can have cascading effects on ecosystem function and resilience. As of 2020, leveraging the SoilTemp database, researchers can refine their understanding of microclimate-ecosystem interactions, ultimately informing conservation strategies and climate-resilient ecosystem management practices.
