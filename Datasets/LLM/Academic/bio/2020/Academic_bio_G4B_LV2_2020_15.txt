**Abstract**

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has emerged as a critical regulator of angiogenesis and metastatic progression in colorectal cancer (CRC), representing a significant therapeutic target. This review synthesizes current understanding of the intricate interplay between this pathway and vascular dynamics within the tumor microenvironment, specifically focusing on the implications for enhanced metastasis prediction and targeted intervention strategies.  Dysregulation of Wnt signaling, often characterized by constitutive β-catenin activation, promotes endothelial cell proliferation and migration, thereby fostering the formation of new blood vessels – a cornerstone of tumor angiogenesis. 

Furthermore, elevated Wnt activity directly influences the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key driver of CRC metastasis, by modulating downstream effectors like Slug and Twist. Recent research highlights the reciprocal relationship between angiogenesis and metastatic dissemination, with vascular remodeling facilitating tumor cell intravasation, extravasation, and ultimately, colonization of distant sites.  Consequently, therapeutic approaches aimed at inhibiting Wnt signaling, particularly in combination with anti-angiogenic agents, are increasingly investigated.  Despite advances, challenges remain in fully translating preclinical findings to clinical efficacy; however, a deeper comprehension of the pathway’s nuanced roles in modulating vascular architecture and metastatic behavior remains paramount for optimizing CRC management in 2020 and beyond.
