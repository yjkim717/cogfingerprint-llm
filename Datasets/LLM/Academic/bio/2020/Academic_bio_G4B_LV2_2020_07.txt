**Abstract**

Understanding the influence of microclimatic conditions is increasingly recognized as critical for predicting ecological responses to climate change. However, readily available climate datasets often lack sufficient resolution to capture the nuanced variability experienced within terrestrial biomes. This study introduces SoilTemp, a newly developed global database designed to address this critical data gap. SoilTemp compiles near-surface soil temperature time series, representing a spatially explicit record of microclimatic variation across diverse terrestrial environments.  The database leverages [mention specific data sources or methods used – *this would need to be filled in with details from the original text*] to generate high-resolution spatial data, facilitating detailed analyses of soil temperature dynamics.  Specifically, SoilTemp provides a valuable resource for investigating the relationship between soil temperature and key ecological processes, including plant phenology, microbial activity, and species distribution shifts.  By offering a standardized and accessible platform for examining near-surface thermal regimes, SoilTemp represents a significant advancement in our capacity to model and predict ecological responses to ongoing environmental change, particularly within sensitive biomes.
