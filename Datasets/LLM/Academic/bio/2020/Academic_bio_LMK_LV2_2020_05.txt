Title: Epidemiological Insights into the 2020 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Outbreak in Europe: A Focus on H5N8 Virus Detections in Wild Birds and Poultry

Abstract:

During the latter half of 2020, a significant outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) was observed across Europe, with a total of 561 detections of HPAI viruses reported in EU/EEA countries and the UK between August and December. The predominant subtype identified during this period was H5N8, a strain known for its high virulence in both wild birds and poultry. This study provides an overview of the epidemiological landscape of the 2020 HPAI outbreak, with a particular emphasis on the role of wild birds and poultry in the dissemination of the H5N8 virus. Our analysis reveals that wild birds were the primary hosts affected by the outbreak, with a substantial proportion of detections reported in this population. The widespread distribution of H5N8 viruses across Europe highlights the complex dynamics of avian influenza transmission, involving both migratory and resident wild bird populations, as well as commercial poultry operations. The findings of this study underscore the need for enhanced surveillance and monitoring of avian influenza viruses in both wild birds and poultry, to facilitate early detection and rapid response to emerging outbreaks. Furthermore, the results emphasize the importance of adopting a One Health approach to understanding and mitigating the impacts of avian influenza, by integrating insights from human, animal, and environmental health disciplines. The 2020 HPAI outbreak serves as a timely reminder of the ongoing threat posed by avian influenza viruses to animal health, food security, and potentially human health, and highlights the need for sustained investment in research, surveillance, and control measures to mitigate this threat. By examining the epidemiological characteristics of the 2020 outbreak, this study contributes to our understanding of the dynamics of HPAI virus transmission and informs strategies for the prevention and control of future outbreaks.
