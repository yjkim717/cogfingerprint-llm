**Abstract**

The ageing process is a complex systemic phenomenon characterized by a progressive decline in physiological function, yet the precise temporal dynamics across different organ systems remain inadequately characterized. While chronological age is a primary risk factor for multimorbidity, a comprehensive understanding of the molecular trajectories that drive organ-specific ageing is crucial for developing targeted interventions. To address this, we conducted a longitudinal, multi-omics analysis across the complete lifespan of Mus musculus, integrating RNA sequencing and plasma proteomics data from multiple tissues. Our investigation reveals that ageing is not a uniform process but is defined by distinct, organ-specific temporal patterns. We identified divergent transcriptional cascades in organs such as the liver, kidney, and spleen, each marked by unique shifts in pathways related to mitochondrial function, inflammatory response, and cellular stress. Crucially, our integrated proteomic analysis of plasma uncovered circulating biomarkers that closely reflect these tissue-specific ageing signatures, with a pronounced emphasis on proteins involved in the innate and adaptive immune response. This suggests a critical role for systemic immune communication in propagating age-related decline. Our findings demonstrate that the trajectory of immunological ageing, in particular, is highly tissue-dependent, with lymphoid organs exhibiting an accelerated inflammatory profile compared to others. This study provides a high-resolution, temporal map of the molecular underpinnings of mammalian ageing, establishing that organ systems age at different rates and through distinct mechanistic pathways. These insights are pivotal for the future development of diagnostic biomarkers and organ-specific therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the deleterious effects of ageing.
