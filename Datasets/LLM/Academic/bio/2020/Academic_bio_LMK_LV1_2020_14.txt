Title: Deep Learning-based Analysis of Intracellular Transport Dynamics: Enhancing Hurst Exponent Estimation for Short Time Series Data

Abstract:
The heterogeneous behavior of intracellular transport processes poses significant challenges for the accurate estimation of Hurst exponents, particularly when dealing with short time series data. To address this limitation, we develop a deep learning-based neural network that leverages the principles of fractional Brownian motion to resolve the complex dynamics underlying intracellular transport. By training the network on a large dataset of simulated trajectories with varying Hurst exponents, we demonstrate that our approach enables robust and accurate estimation of Hurst exponents even for short time series data. Our results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional estimation techniques, providing a reliable tool for characterizing the anomalous diffusion properties of intracellular transport processes. The enhanced accuracy and robustness of our approach have significant implications for the analysis of intracellular dynamics, enabling researchers to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms governing cellular behavior.
