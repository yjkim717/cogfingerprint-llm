**Abstract**

The burgeoning healthcare demands of India’s expanding population present a critical challenge: a persistent deficit within the allied health professional (AHP) workforce.  Concurrent with this shortage, inconsistencies in the accreditation and curricular standardization of AHP training programs across the nation contribute to variable skillsets and compromised service delivery. This study posits that the establishment of a nationally mandated Allied Health Council is a strategically vital intervention. Such a council, operating under defined regulatory frameworks, would facilitate the harmonization of training standards, bolster workforce capacity through targeted recruitment initiatives, and ultimately ensure a consistent baseline of competency amongst AHPs.  Data from 2020 indicated a widening gap between trained AHP availability and regional healthcare needs, highlighting the urgency of coordinated systemic reform.  Further research should investigate the council’s potential impact on patient outcomes and healthcare equity.
