**Abstract**

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid β (Aβ) plaque deposition and neurofibrillary tangle formation, ultimately leading to cognitive decline. While genetic risk factors, particularly the *APOE* ε4 genotype, are well-established contributors to AD susceptibility and progression, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiles in a cohort of individuals with varying *APOE* ε4 genotypes and degrees of cognitive impairment to identify novel biomarkers predictive of AD progression and potentially responsive to genotype-specific therapeutic interventions. Utilizing high-resolution mass spectrometry, we performed targeted proteomics on CSF samples collected longitudinally.  Differential abundance analysis revealed significant alterations in protein expression patterns associated with *APOE* ε4 carriage, independent of disease stage.  Specifically, we observed enhanced expression of several complement pathway components, including C1q and C3, in *APOE* ε4 carriers exhibiting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to non-carriers. Furthermore, a distinct proteomic signature correlated with Aβ aggregation, as measured by CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, was modulated by *APOE* ε4 status.  These findings suggest that *APOE* ε4 may accelerate AD pathogenesis, at least in part, by influencing the neuroinflammatory response via the complement cascade.  The identified CSF proteomic signatures offer potential diagnostic and prognostic utility, and, crucially, highlight opportunities for developing tailored therapeutic strategies targeting specific molecular pathways dysregulated by the *APOE* ε4 genotype.  Further validation in larger, independent cohorts is warranted to confirm these findings and to explore the therapeutic potential of complement-modulating agents in *APOE* ε4-positive individuals at risk for AD.
