**Abstract**

The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project has yielded a voluminous dataset of whole-genome sequencing data, necessitating robust methods for data exploration and interpretation. This publication, released in 2020, offers a critical resource – a user guide – detailing five specialized online tools designed to address this challenge. Specifically, the guide elucidates the functionalities of the ICGC Data Portal, UCSC Xena, Chromothripsis Explorer, Expression Atlas, and PCAWG-Scout. These tools facilitate targeted investigation into complex genomic alterations within diverse cancer types. By providing accessible interfaces, the presented resources empower researchers to effectively navigate and visualize the intricacies of PCAWG’s genomic landscape.  Ultimately, this collaborative effort aims to accelerate cancer genomics research through enhanced data accessibility and sophisticated analytical capabilities, fostering a deeper understanding of tumor heterogeneity and driving precision medicine initiatives.
