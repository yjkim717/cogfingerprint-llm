**Abstract**

Understanding the influence of microclimatic variability on biological processes necessitates accurate, spatially-resolved temperature data.  This study introduces SoilTemp, a novel global database compiling near-surface soil temperature time series, designed to enhance ecological forecasting and facilitate investigations into microclimate dynamics. Utilizing a spatiotemporal resolution focused on the uppermost soil layers, SoilTemp leverages geospatial database principles to archive and disseminate data with high fidelity.  The database’s construction prioritizes the acquisition of robust, near-surface temperature measurements, acknowledging their critical role in regulating plant physiology, microbial activity, and overall ecosystem function.  We posit that SoilTemp’s availability will significantly improve analyses of species distribution, phenological shifts, and responses to environmental stressors. Future research will explore the database’s integration with remote sensing data to further refine spatiotemporal assessments and provide a more comprehensive understanding of terrestrial biomes.
