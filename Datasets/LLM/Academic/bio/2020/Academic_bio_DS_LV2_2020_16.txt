**Abstract**

The white-rot fungus *Pleurotus ostreatus* is a model organism for elucidating the mechanisms of ligninocellulose degradation, a process central to global carbon cycling and biotechnological applications. To dissect the transcriptional regulation underlying this complex enzymatic system, we conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis of wild-type *P. ostreatus* and a series of lignin-deficient mutants. Our findings reveal a fundamental transcriptional reprogramming in response to the lignin-degradation deficiency. Specifically, we observed a significant downregulation of key ligninolytic genes, including those encoding lignin-modifying peroxidases and oxidases. Conversely, a compensatory upregulation of genes encoding cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes was detected. This inverse correlation suggests a tightly regulated, hierarchical transcriptional network that partitions metabolic resources between the degradation of lignin and holocellulose. These insights advance our understanding of fungal plant biomass deconstruction and have implications for strain engineering in industrial biocatalysis.
