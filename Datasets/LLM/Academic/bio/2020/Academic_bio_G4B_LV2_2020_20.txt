**Abstract**

Understanding the influence of environmental conditions on organismal distribution and ecosystem dynamics necessitates robust, spatially-resolved temperature data. Existing climate datasets frequently lack sufficient granularity at the near-surface, limiting our capacity to model microclimatic effects on biological processes. This study introduces SoilTemp, a newly compiled global database designed to address this critical gap. SoilTemp provides extensive time series of near-surface soil temperatures, facilitating investigations into the relationship between soil temperature and biome-specific responses. Utilizing spatial data analysis techniques, SoilTemp allows for the characterization of microclimates – localized temperature variations – across diverse biomes.  The database’s temporal resolution offers a valuable resource for examining seasonal and interannual shifts in soil temperature, and consequently, their impact on plant physiology, soil microbial communities, and broader ecosystem function.  We posit that SoilTemp represents a foundational tool for advancing research examining the ecological consequences of changing soil temperature regimes, particularly within the context of ongoing climate change.
