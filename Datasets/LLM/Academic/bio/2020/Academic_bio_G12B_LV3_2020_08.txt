The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project has yielded a vast repository of genomic data, necessitating user-friendly tools for effective exploration and interpretation. Goldman et al. (2020) introduce a practical guide detailing five key online resources—the ICGC Data Portal, UCSC Xena, Chromothripsis Explorer, Expression Atlas, and PCAWG-Scout—designed to facilitate this process. These integrated platforms provide researchers with capabilities for interactive data visualization, genomic annotation, and comparative analysis of somatic mutations, copy number alterations, and gene expression profiles across diverse cancer types. This resource empowers a broader research community to leverage the PCAWG dataset, accelerating discoveries in cancer genomics and ultimately contributing to improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
