This study introduces Protaccel, a computational framework extending RNA velocity to integrate protein expression from single-cell multiomics data. By jointly modeling nascent RNA and protein dynamics, we enable more accurate inference of cellular trajectories and transient states. Validation across hematopoiesis and neurogenesis datasets demonstrates Protaccelâ€™s enhanced resolution in delineating differentiation pathways compared to RNA-only methods. Our approach establishes a foundation for temporally resolved analysis of post-transcriptional regulation, advancing the mechanistic interpretation of cell fate decisions.
