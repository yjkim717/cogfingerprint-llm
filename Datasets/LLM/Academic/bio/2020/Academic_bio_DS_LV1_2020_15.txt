**Title:** Dysregulated Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Orchestrates the Angiogenic Switch in Colorectal Carcinogenesis via VEGF-Dependent and Independent Mechanisms

**Abstract:**

The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a cornerstone of intestinal epithelial homeostasis, is almost universally dysregulated in colorectal cancer (CRC), primarily through inactivating mutations in the *APC* tumor suppressor gene. While its role in initiating tumorigenesis is well-established, its continued activity is now recognized as a critical driver of advanced disease progression, particularly through the induction of angiogenesis. This review synthesizes recent evidence elucidating the mechanistic underpinnings of how constitutive β-catenin signaling orchestrates the "angiogenic switch" in CRC, a process indispensable for sustained tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. We delineate the primary axis of this regulation through the direct transcriptional upregulation of the pro-angiogenic master regulator, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A). β-Catenin/TCF complexes bind to specific promoter elements of the *VEGFA* gene, establishing an autocrine and paracrine signaling loop that stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and the formation of immature, dysfunctional tumor vasculature.

Beyond this canonical VEGF-centric model, we explore emerging evidence from the past decade revealing VEGF-independent mechanisms. These include the β-catenin-mediated induction of other angiogenic factors such as LEF1, CD44, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which collectively remodel the extracellular matrix and facilitate invasive budding. Furthermore, the review addresses how specific mutational landscapes, particularly the truncating nature of *APC* mutations, can generate distinct β-catenin signaling thresholds that differentially influence the angiogenic transcriptome. The clinical ramifications of this intricate relationship are profound. We critically evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting this signaling axis, discussing the rationale for combining Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitors—ranging from small molecule antagonists to biologics—with established anti-angiogenic agents like bevacizumab. Overcoming the challenge of pathway redundancy and developing strategies to selectively inhibit oncogenic β-catenin signaling without disrupting normal tissue homeostasis remain significant hurdles. A comprehensive understanding of the Wnt/β-catenin-VEGF nexus is therefore paramount for devising next-generation, mechanism-based anti-angiogenic therapies to curb CRC metastasis and improve patient outcomes.
