**Wnt/β-catenin Signaling Drives Angiogenesis and Metastatic Progression in Colorectal Cancer**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, largely attributed to its aggressive metastatic potential. Emerging evidence increasingly implicates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway as a central regulator of tumor progression, particularly in the context of angiogenesis and subsequent metastasis. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding the intricate interplay between Wnt signaling, β-catenin stabilization, and vascular endothelial responses within the CRC microenvironment. 

Specifically, aberrant Wnt activation frequently leads to constitutive β-catenin accumulation, promoting the expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Elevated VEGF levels stimulate neovascularization, providing the tumor with essential nutrients and oxygen, thereby fostering growth and facilitating distant colonization. Furthermore, Wnt signaling directly influences epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a key driver of metastasis, by modulating expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other adhesion molecules. 

Targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway represents a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC. Future research focusing on selective pathway inhibitors and combinatorial approaches holds significant potential for disrupting angiogenesis, inhibiting metastasis, and ultimately improving patient outcomes.
