**Abstract: Dissecting Organ-Specific Ageing Signatures through Integrated Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analyses in the *Tabula Muris Senis***

Ageing is characterized by a complex interplay of cellular and systemic changes, often exhibiting significant tissue heterogeneity. While hallmarks of ageing have been proposed, a comprehensive understanding of their organ-specific manifestation remains elusive. Here, we leverage the *Tabula Muris Senis* (TMS), a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic resource for aged mice, in conjunction with quantitative proteomics, to investigate age-associated molecular alterations across multiple murine organs. Our integrated analyses revealed distinct and organ-specific trajectories of gene expression and protein abundance changes with age. Notably, a consistent theme across tissues was the heightened activation of immune cells, evidenced by increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and altered antigen presentation machinery components. This immune dysregulation was frequently correlated with shifts in metabolic pathways and alterations in extracellular matrix composition, suggesting a systemic impact extending beyond the immune compartment. Furthermore, we identified tissue-specific hubs of age-related gene expression and protein modifications, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for mitigating age-associated decline in particular organs.  These findings underscore the importance of considering organ-specific heterogeneity when investigating the molecular basis of ageing and provide a valuable resource for future studies aimed at understanding and potentially intervening in the ageing process.  The data generated herein facilitates a more nuanced perspective on the systemic consequences of localized age-related changes, promoting a systems-level approach to gerontological research.
