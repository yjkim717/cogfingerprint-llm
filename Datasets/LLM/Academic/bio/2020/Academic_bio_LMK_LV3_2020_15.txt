Title: Dysregulation of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Colorectal Cancer: Implications for Angiogenesis and Carcinogenesis

Abstract:

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has emerged as a pivotal regulator of carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer (CRC), with its dysregulation implicated in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. As of 2020, CRC remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis. Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in modulating angiogenesis, a hallmark of CRC. The aberrant activation of this pathway leads to the accumulation of β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of target genes involved in angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and survival. The resulting angiogenic phenotype promotes the formation of new blood vessels, facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, the interplay between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and other key pathways has been shown to contribute to the development of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC may provide novel insights into the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC, with a focus on its role in regulating angiogenesis and carcinogenesis, and to discuss potential therapeutic implications. By exploring the complex interactions between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and CRC pathogenesis, we may uncover new avenues for the treatment of this devastating disease.
