**Abstract**

The Project Cisplatin Active Wild-type Genome (PCawG) has generated a substantial volume of whole-genome sequencing data across diverse cancer types, presenting a unique opportunity to advance cancer genomics research.  This study details a practical guide to utilizing five publicly accessible online data visualization tools designed to facilitate exploration of the PCawG dataset. These tools – [Specifically name the tools if known, otherwise: ‘a suite of interactive platforms’] – enable researchers to effectively interrogate complex multi-omic data, integrating information derived from whole-genome sequencing with associated clinical and genomic annotations.  The guide outlines optimal workflows for dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and subsequent visualization of resultant data landscapes.  By promoting accessibility to this rich resource, we aim to accelerate investigations into cancer heterogeneity and therapeutic response prediction.  Furthermore, the documented approaches contribute to the broader ICGC-TCGA community’s capacity for integrative data analysis, fostering collaborative advancements in personalized oncology.
