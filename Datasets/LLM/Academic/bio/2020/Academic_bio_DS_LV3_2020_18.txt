**Abstract**

The 2020 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H5N8, represented a significant escalation in the virus's geographic spread and persistence within the European avifauna. Epidemiological surveillance conducted between August and December 2020 across 15 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom documented 561 independent HPAI detections. Genomic phylodynamic analysis indicates that this outbreak profile was not the result of a singular, linear expansion but rather stemmed from multiple, independent viral introductions into the region. These introductions are phylogenetically linked to endemic circulation in Asian bird populations, facilitated by overlapping migratory flyways. Our findings robustly identify wild aquatic birds—particularly Anatidae (ducks, geese, and swans) and *Laridae* (gulls)—as the principal reservoir and dissemination vector. The pervasive environmental viral load within wild populations precipitated numerous spillover events into the poultry sector, leading to severe outbreaks characterized by high mortality rates in both commercial and backyard holdings. Despite this heightened epizootic activity, comprehensive risk assessment concludes a persistently low zoonotic potential for the H5N8 clade circulating in 2020. The virus lacks critical molecular markers associated with efficient binding to human-type alpha-2,6 sialic acid receptors, and no sustained human-to-human transmission was documented. Consequently, the primary epidemiological concern remains the ongoing threat of viral incursion into poultry systems, necessitating enhanced biosecurity protocols, active wild bird surveillance, and timely depopulation strategies to mitigate economic losses and prevent potential viral adaptation. This study underscores the critical role of migratory wild birds in the panzootic spread of HPAI H5N8 and highlights the imperative for integrated, One Health-based surveillance at the wildlife-domestic animal interface.
