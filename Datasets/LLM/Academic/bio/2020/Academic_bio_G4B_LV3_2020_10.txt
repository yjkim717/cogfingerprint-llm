**Abstract**

Shotgun proteomics, reliant on mass spectrometry (MS), increasingly demands robust strategies for identifying post-translational modifications (PTMs) within complex peptide mixtures. Current modification-focused tools often exhibit limitations in sensitivity and accuracy. This study presents MSFragger, an enhanced search algorithm incorporating localization-aware indexing and refined mass calibration techniques.  Specifically, the implementation of fragment ion indexing dramatically improves the identification of modified peptides, a critical challenge in characterizing protein turnover and signaling pathways.  Through rigorous validation using synthetic peptide datasets containing diverse PTMs, we demonstrate a substantial increase in sensitivity compared to conventional modification-based searches.  The resultant localization-aware search process minimizes false positives, offering a significant advancement for proteomic workflows requiring detailed PTM profiling.  These findings contribute to more reliable and comprehensive biological insights derived from MS data.
