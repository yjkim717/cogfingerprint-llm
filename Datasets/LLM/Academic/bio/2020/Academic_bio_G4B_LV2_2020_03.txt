**Abstract**

Lignin, a complex polymer abundant in plant cell walls, presents a significant barrier to the efficient decomposition of plant biomass. White-rot fungi, particularly *Pleurotus ostreatus*, employ a suite of enzymatic pathways to degrade lignin, primarily mediated by ligninolytic enzymes. This study utilized a transcriptomic approach to investigate the molecular responses of *P. ostreatus* mutants exhibiting reduced lignin content.  Analysis of the fungal transcriptome revealed a striking downregulation of genes encoding lignin biosynthetic and modifying enzymes. Conversely, a concomitant upregulation of genes associated with cellulose degradation – a key initial step in ligninolysis – was observed. These findings suggest a coordinated transcriptional shift within *P. ostreatus* in response to altered lignin availability. Specifically, the fungus prioritizes cellulolytic pathways, potentially facilitating initial biomass breakdown before engaging in lignin degradation.  Further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms governing this transcriptional reprogramming could offer insights into optimizing fungal ligninolytic activity and enhancing biomass conversion strategies.
