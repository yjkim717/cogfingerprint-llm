**Abstract**

The efficient catalysis of oxidative phosphorylation, a fundamental process in cellular respiration, presents a significant challenge in biomimetic systems. This research investigates the utility of incorporating iron oxide hydroxide (FeOOH) nano-decoration onto a synthetic peptide scaffold designed to mimic mitochondrial membrane structure. We hypothesize that strategically positioned FeOOH clusters facilitate enhanced oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, mirroring the role of lattice oxygen in biological respiration. Spectroscopic analysis revealed increased hydroxyl adsorption onto the FeOOH surface, suggesting a primed state for electron transfer. Furthermore, electrochemical measurements demonstrated a substantial augmentation in OER efficiency within the modified peptide matrix compared to the unmodified control. These findings suggest that mimicking the localized redox potential of FeOOH within a biomimetic framework can effectively lower energy barriers associated with OER, potentially paving the way for the development of novel bio-inspired catalysts for oxidative metabolic pathways.
