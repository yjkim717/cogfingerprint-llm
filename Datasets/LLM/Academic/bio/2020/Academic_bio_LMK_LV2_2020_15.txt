Title: Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Angiogenesis: Implications for Tumor Progression and Therapeutic Strategies

Abstract:

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenesis. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. Recent studies have highlighted the critical involvement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC angiogenesis, a complex process that enables tumor growth and metastasis by facilitating the formation of new blood vessels. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, mediated by the interaction between Wnt ligands and Frizzled receptors, leads to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which in turn regulates the expression of target genes involved in angiogenesis. The dysregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC has been associated with increased angiogenic potential, tumor aggressiveness, and poor prognosis. Furthermore, the crosstalk between Wnt/β-catenin signaling and other angiogenic pathways, such as VEGF signaling, has been shown to contribute to the development of resistance to anti-angiogenic therapies. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC angiogenesis and its implications for cancer progression and treatment. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt/β-catenin-mediated angiogenesis in CRC may provide valuable insights into the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway, ultimately improving treatment outcomes for patients with CRC.
