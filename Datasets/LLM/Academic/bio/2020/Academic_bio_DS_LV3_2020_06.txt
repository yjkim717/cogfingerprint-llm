In this study, we demonstrate that FeOOH-decorated LaNiO3 perovskite catalysts exhibit a fivefold enhancement in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity, attributed to synergistic mechanisms promoting lattice oxygen oxidation. Through electrochemical analysis and density functional theory calculations, we reveal that FeOOH nanostructures facilitate hydroxyl adsorption at active sites, thereby weakening adjacent Ni–O bonds in the perovskite lattice. This bond destabilization lowers the energy barrier for lattice oxygen participation in the OER pathway, shifting the mechanism toward more efficient catalysis. The modified catalyst achieves a low overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and maintains stability over 100 hours in alkaline media. These findings, contextualized within 2020’s push for sustainable energy conversion, establish a design principle for leveraging metal oxyhydroxide–perovskite interfaces in electrocatalysis, with implications for developing high-performance, non-precious-metal catalysts for water-splitting technologies.
