Amidst India's escalating healthcare demands, this study examines the critical deficit of approximately 6.5 million allied health professionals (AHPs) and proposes a structural intervention for workforce augmentation. The analysis identifies fragmented regulatory frameworks and heterogeneous training curricula as primary impediments to scaling AHP production and ensuring competency. We posit that the absence of a centralized regulatory authority perpetuates inconsistencies in credentialing, scope of practice, and continuing education, thereby compromising systemic healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. To address this, the research advocates for the establishment of a statutory Allied Healthcare Professionals Council. This centralized body would be mandated to standardize undergraduate and postgraduate curricula nationally, synchronize accreditation protocols, and maintain a national registry. Such institutional consolidation is argued to be a prerequisite for enhancing workforce plasticity, facilitating skill-based mobility, and ultimately strengthening the resilience of India's public health infrastructure against current and future epidemiological challenges.
