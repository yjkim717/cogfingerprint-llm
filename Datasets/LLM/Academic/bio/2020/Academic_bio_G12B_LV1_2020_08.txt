## Navigating the PCAWG Landscape: Interactive Tools for Whole-Genome Sequencing Data Exploration

**Abstract:** The Pediatric Cancer Genome Project (PCAWG) has generated a substantial and complex dataset of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from pediatric cancer samples, representing a significant resource for advancing cancer research. However, effectively leveraging this data requires sophisticated analytical and visualization approaches. This work details the functionality and application of five interactive online tools developed to facilitate comprehensive data exploration within the PCAWG genomics ecosystem. These tools, accessible via a centralized web portal, empower researchers to investigate somatic mutations, copy number alterations, structural variants, and gene expression profiles within the context of individual patients and across cohorts. Specifically, we describe tools enabling interactive visualization of variant landscapes, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) profiles, and integrated multi-omic data analysis. Furthermore, we highlight their utility in identifying driver mutations, characterizing tumor heterogeneity, and exploring potential therapeutic targets. By providing intuitive and accessible interfaces, these tools lower the barrier to entry for researchers seeking to analyze PCAWG data, fostering collaborative discovery and accelerating translational research in pediatric oncology. These resources are freely available and designed to integrate seamlessly with existing bioinformatics pipelines, contributing to the broader goal of personalized cancer medicine.
