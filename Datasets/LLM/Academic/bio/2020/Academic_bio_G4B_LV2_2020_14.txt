**Abstract**

Accurate quantification of intracellular transport heterogeneity remains a significant challenge in cell biology research. Traditional methods often necessitate extensive experimental datasets, limiting their applicability. This study presents a novel neural network framework designed to efficiently analyze and characterize complex intracellular transport patterns. Leveraging insights from fractional Brownian motion and the Hurst exponent, we demonstrate the capacity of this approach to discern subtle variations in vesicle movement within cells.  The proposed methodology significantly reduces data requirements compared to conventional techniques, offering a more accessible route for investigating the dynamics of intracellular trafficking.  Specifically, the neural network architecture learns to identify and categorize transport ‘modes’ exhibiting diverse temporal correlations, effectively capturing the inherent heterogeneity observed. Results suggest that this technique provides a robust means of probing the organization of intracellular networks and their potential role in cellular signaling and disease processes. Further validation and expansion of this method are warranted.
