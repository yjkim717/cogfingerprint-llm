## Exploring the Landscape of Pan-Cancer Genomic Data: A User Guide to PCAWG Data Exploration Tools

**Abstract:** The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project has yielded an unprecedented wealth of genomic data across a diverse range of human tumor types, presenting both opportunities and challenges for the research community. Effective data exploration and visualization are crucial for deriving meaningful biological insights from this complex dataset. This paper presents a user guide detailing five online tools developed to facilitate comprehensive analysis and interpretation of PCAWG whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. These tools, accessible through a centralized portal, offer functionalities ranging from interactive visualization of somatic mutations and copy number alterations to pan-cancer comparisons of genomic aberrations and the identification of potential therapeutic targets. The guide provides a structured overview of each tool's purpose, input requirements, analytical capabilities, and output formats, accompanied by illustrative examples demonstrating their application to key research questions.  We emphasize the importance of understanding the underlying data processing pipelines and quality control measures inherent in the PCAWG data.  By providing clear and concise instructions, this work aims to empower researchers, regardless of their bioinformatics expertise, to effectively leverage the PCAWG WGS data resource for advancing our understanding of cancer genomics and ultimately informing precision oncology strategies.  The accessibility and usability of these tools are critical for maximizing the impact of the PCAWG investment and fostering collaborative discovery within the field.
