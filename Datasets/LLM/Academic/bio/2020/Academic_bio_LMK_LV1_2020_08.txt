The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) dataset represents a landmark resource for cancer genomics research, comprising whole-genome sequencing data from over 2,600 cancer samples. To facilitate the exploration and interpretation of this complex dataset, we have developed a suite of online tools that enable researchers to query and visualize PCAWG data in a user-friendly manner. Our platform integrates PCAWG data with external genomic and clinical information, allowing investigators to contextualize their findings within the broader landscape of cancer genomics. By leveraging data visualization tools and intuitive interfaces, our platform streamlines the process of hypothesis generation and validation, empowering researchers to uncover novel insights into the genomic basis of cancer. This resource has the potential to accelerate cancer research by providing a comprehensive and accessible framework for exploring PCAWG data, and we anticipate it will be a valuable resource for the research community in 2020 and beyond.
