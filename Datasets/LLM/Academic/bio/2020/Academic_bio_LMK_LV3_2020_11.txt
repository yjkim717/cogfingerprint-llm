Title: Unveiling Organ-Specific Ageing Dynamics through Multi-Omics Analysis

Abstract:

Ageing is a complex biological process characterized by distinct molecular changes across various organs. To elucidate the underlying dynamics, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of ageing in Mus musculus using RNA sequencing and plasma proteomics. Our multi-omics approach revealed organ-specific temporal signatures in gene expression and protein levels, underscoring the heterogeneous nature of ageing. Notably, we identified distinct transcriptional programmes and protein networks that exhibited age-dependent modulation in an organ-specific manner. Our findings provide a rich resource for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ageing and highlight the importance of considering organ-specific changes in the development of ageing-related pathologies. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence on the intricate biology of ageing, with implications for the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
