**Abstract**

Recent advancements in bioelectrochemical systems increasingly leverage heterogeneous catalysis for enhanced metabolic pathways. This study investigates the catalytic efficacy of a modified LaNiO₃ perovskite scaffold, incorporating nanoscale FeOOH clusters, for facilitating extracellular electron transfer during microbial respiration.  Results demonstrate that strategic deposition of FeOOH substantially elevates the rate of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) – a critical bottleneck in many bioprocesses – by approximately a factor of four. Spectroscopic analysis reveals optimized hydroxyl adsorption sites on the modified surface, coupled with a demonstrable weakening of Ni-O bonds within the perovskite lattice, promoting increased electrochemical activity.  These synergistic effects contribute to a five-fold enhancement in overall OER kinetics.  The findings suggest that this compositional modification represents a promising strategy for improving the efficiency of bioanodic systems and warrants further investigation into analogous perovskite-based catalysts for diverse biotechnological applications, published in 2020.
