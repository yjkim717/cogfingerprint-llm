Title: Enhancing Modified Peptide Identification in Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics via Localization-Aware Open Search

Abstract:
The identification of post-translationally modified peptides remains a significant challenge in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. Traditional database search strategies often suffer from limited sensitivity and accuracy due to the vast search space and the complexity of modification patterns. To address this limitation, we present a novel localization-aware open search method, integrated with the MSFragger search engine. This approach leverages an unrestrictive search paradigm, allowing for the unbiased identification of modified peptides. By incorporating site localization information and utilizing a probabilistic scoring framework, our method enhances the detection of modified peptides with high confidence. Evaluated on diverse datasets, our approach demonstrates improved sensitivity and accuracy compared to conventional search strategies. The proposed method has the potential to revolutionize MS-based proteomics by facilitating comprehensive profiling of post-translational modifications, thereby advancing our understanding of protein function and regulation in 2020's proteomic research landscape.
