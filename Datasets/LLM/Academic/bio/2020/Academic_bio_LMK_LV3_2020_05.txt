Title: Assessing the 2020 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Outbreak in EU/EEA Countries and the UK: Implications for Poultry Biosecurity and Wild Bird Surveillance

Abstract:

The latter half of 2020 witnessed a significant surge in highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus detections across 15 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with a total of 561 reported cases primarily in wild bird populations. This outbreak underscores the persistent threat HPAI poses to both wild birds and poultry, necessitating a comprehensive examination of its epidemiological dynamics and the efficacy of current biosecurity measures. Our analysis focused on the spatiotemporal distribution of HPAI cases, the role of wild birds in virus transmission, and the impact on poultry farms. The findings indicate a complex interplay between wild bird migration patterns, environmental factors, and poultry farm biosecurity practices. Notably, the majority of detections were in wild birds, suggesting that these populations continue to play a crucial role in the virus's epidemiology. However, the virus also affected poultry farms, highlighting vulnerabilities in biosecurity protocols. The outbreak's magnitude and distribution call for enhanced surveillance and stricter biosecurity measures on poultry farms to mitigate the risk of transmission. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the need for continued monitoring of wild bird populations to understand better their role in HPAI virus dissemination. The data from this outbreak provide valuable insights into the virus's transmission dynamics, informing policy and management strategies aimed at controlling future outbreaks. By integrating enhanced wild bird surveillance with robust poultry farm biosecurity, EU/EEA countries and the UK can improve their preparedness and response to HPAI outbreaks, ultimately protecting both animal health and the poultry industry. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on avian influenza management, underscoring the importance of a multi-faceted approach that addresses the complexities of HPAI epidemiology. As the global landscape of avian influenza continues to evolve, the lessons learned from the 2020 outbreak will be instrumental in shaping effective public health and animal health policies.
