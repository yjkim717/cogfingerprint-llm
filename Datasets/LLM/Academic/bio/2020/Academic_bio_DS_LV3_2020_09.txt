**Abstract**

The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) allele remains the most potent genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet the precise molecular mechanisms through which it potentiates disease pathogenesis are not fully elucidated. This study leverages high-resolution cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to delineate the specific pathophysiological signatures associated with the APOE ε4 genotype across the AD continuum. We quantified over 1,200 proteins in CSF samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, comprising cognitively normal controls, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with AD dementia, stratified by APOE ε4 carrier status. Our analysis revealed distinct CSF proteomic profiles that are intrinsically modulated by the APOE ε4 genotype. In ε4 carriers, we observed a pronounced upregulation in proteins directly implicated in the amyloid-β (Aβ) pathway, including those associated with amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and Aβ aggregation, even at the pre-symptomatic MCI stage. Concurrently, ε4 carriers exhibited a marked dysregulation in a network of proteins involved in synaptic integrity, neuroinflammation (particularly complement activation and microglial reactivity), and lipid transport, which correlated strongly with the severity of cognitive impairment. Crucially, these proteomic alterations were not uniform but demonstrated significant stage-specificity, with inflammatory signatures becoming more dominant as clinical symptoms progressed from MCI to AD dementia. These findings indicate that the APOE ε4 genotype drives AD pathophysiology through genotype- and stage-specific molecular pathways. This refined understanding underscores the limitations of a one-size-fits-all therapeutic strategy and strongly advocates for the development of tailored, precision medicine approaches that target the unique biological cascades active in APOE ε4 carriers at different disease stages.
