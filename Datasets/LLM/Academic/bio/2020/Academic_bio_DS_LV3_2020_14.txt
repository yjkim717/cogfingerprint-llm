In 2020, Korabel et al. addressed the analytical challenge of resolving heterogeneous intracellular transport dynamics by introducing a novel deep learning framework. The authors trained a convolutional neural network on simulated trajectories of fractional Brownian motion, a stochastic process characterized by its Hurst exponent, which serves as a quantitative measure of anomalous diffusion. This methodology enables the robust, high-throughput classification of organelle motility directly from experimental single-particle tracking data, overcoming limitations of traditional mean-squared displacement analysis. When applied to endocytic organelles, the network's estimations revealed statistically significant differences in their Hurst exponents, thereby exposing distinct, organelle-specific transport regimes. These findings suggest that such data-driven approaches can precisely delineate subtle variations in underlying biophysical mechanisms, such as differences in motor protein engagement or cytoskeletal interactions. Consequently, this work establishes machine learning as a powerful tool for dissecting complex spatiotemporal behaviors in live cells, with broad implications for understanding cargo trafficking, organelle biology, and the pathophysiology of transport-related disorders.
