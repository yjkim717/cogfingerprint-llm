Title: Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Angiogenesis: A Critical Review of Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications

Abstract:

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the regulation of various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. In the context of colorectal cancer (CRC), aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and angiogenesis. The formation of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis, is a hallmark of CRC and a critical factor in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the growing tumor.

Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt/β-catenin-mediated angiogenesis in CRC. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway involves the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which subsequently activates the transcription of target genes involved in angiogenesis, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-2. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway also interacts with other pro-angiogenic pathways, including the PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways, to promote angiogenesis in CRC.

Furthermore, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway has been shown to regulate the expression of various microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs that modulate angiogenesis in CRC. For instance, the Wnt/β-catenin-mediated upregulation of miR-210 has been implicated in the promotion of angiogenesis by targeting the anti-angiogenic factor, Ephrin-A3.

The critical role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC angiogenesis has significant implications for cancer management. Targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of CRC. Several Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors, including small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, are currently under investigation in preclinical and clinical trials.

In conclusion, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating angiogenesis in CRC. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt/β-catenin-mediated angiogenesis is essential for the development of effective therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway. Further research is warranted to explore the therapeutic potential of Wnt/β-catenin inhibitors in the management of CRC.
