**Abstract**

Understanding the systemic nature of aging remains a central challenge in biomedical research. This study, conducted in 2020, investigates age-associated molecular alterations across multiple murine organ systems by integrating bulk RNA sequencing and plasma proteomics. Our analysis reveals consistent trajectories of gene expression changes with advancing age, despite asynchronous manifestation across different tissues. Specifically, we observed shared patterns of dysregulation in genes related to established aging hallmarks, including genomic instability, proteostasis impairment, and cellular senescence. Furthermore, we identified significant correlations between organ-specific gene expression profiles and circulating protein biomarkers, suggesting systemic communication of age-related processes. These findings underscore the complexity of organ-specific aging and highlight the importance of considering integrated, multi-omic approaches to fully elucidate the dynamics of aging and its impact on the immune response. This comprehensive view contributes to a more nuanced understanding of age-related decline and may inform the development of targeted interventions.
