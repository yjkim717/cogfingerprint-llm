**Abstract**

Understanding the multifaceted nature of aging necessitates a comprehensive investigation into temporally-resolved changes across diverse tissue types. This study leverages integrative analyses of bulk RNA sequencing and plasma proteomics data to characterize the aging process in the murine model. Utilizing the Tabula Muris Senis resource, we examined 17 distinct mouse organs, identifying both temporally consistent and organ-specific signatures of senescence. Our findings demonstrate that aging manifests as a coordinated, yet nuanced, shift in gene expression profiles within each organ, accompanied by alterations in immune cell populations. Specifically, we observed differential expression of key inflammatory mediators and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors.  These results underscore the importance of considering organ-specific vulnerabilities during aging research.  Furthermore, the identification of synchronized temporal patterns across multiple organs suggests potential targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at mitigating age-related decline. Future work will focus on validating these findings through independent cohorts and exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of observed proteomic changes.
