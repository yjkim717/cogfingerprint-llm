**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, characterized by complex metastatic pathways and a pressing need for novel therapeutic interventions. This review synthesizes current understanding of the critical interplay between aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling and angiogenesis in the progression of CRC, with a focus on implications for metastatic dissemination. Dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, frequently observed in CRC, stimulates cellular proliferation, survival, and stemness – all factors contributing to increased metastatic potential. Concurrently, tumor angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is essential for supplying nutrients and oxygen to rapidly proliferating cancer cells, facilitating invasion and distant metastasis. Emerging evidence demonstrates a reciprocal relationship between these two processes; activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling promotes the expression of pro-angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), while angiogenesis, in turn, can modulate Wnt/β-catenin activity within the tumor microenvironment. This complex crosstalk establishes a positive feedback loop that accelerates tumor growth and metastasis. Consequently, targeting either Wnt/β-catenin signaling or angiogenesis, or ideally, both concurrently, represents a promising therapeutic strategy. This review examines current preclinical and clinical investigations evaluating Wnt inhibitors and anti-angiogenic agents in CRC, highlighting challenges and future directions. A deeper mechanistic understanding of the Wnt/β-catenin-angiogenesis axis is crucial for developing more effective and targeted therapies to improve patient outcomes and combat CRC metastasis, particularly in the context of personalized medicine approaches.
