**Abstract**

Lignin degradation represents a critical process in the decomposition of plant biomass, and *Pleurotus ostreatus* (white-rot fungus) is renowned for its potent lignolytic capabilities. This study employed transcriptome analysis to characterize transcriptional responses within lignin-deficient mutants of *P. ostreatus*, aiming to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms governing lignocellulose processing.  Results demonstrate a marked downregulation of genes associated with lignin biosynthesis and oxidation – specifically, those encoding peroxidases and laccases – following lignin removal. Conversely, a significant upregulation was observed in genes involved in cellulose and xylane hydrolysis, indicative of a metabolic shift favoring efficient polysaccharide breakdown. These findings suggest a finely tuned, plasticity within *P. ostreatus* metabolism, where lignin absence triggers a compensatory upregulation of cellulolytic and xylanolytic pathways.  Further investigation into these transcriptional changes holds substantial promise for optimizing fungal strains for enhanced biomass conversion and biofuel production.
