**Abstract**

Intracellular transport, particularly via endocytosis, is a fundamental process governing cellular function and signaling. Characterizing the dynamics of cargo movement within the cytoplasm remains a significant challenge, especially when dealing with heterogeneous environments and complex transport networks. Traditional analytical approaches often struggle to capture the nuanced, non-diffusive behaviors observed in these systems. Here, we present a novel deep learning framework for the quantitative analysis of intracellular transport trajectories. Our method enables automated and dynamic segmentation of individual transport events, circumventing limitations of conventional clustering techniques. Critically, we demonstrate the frameworkâ€™s capacity to identify anomalous transport dynamics by estimating fractional Brownian motion (fBm) parameters, specifically the Hurst exponent, from the segmented trajectories. This allows for the differentiation between typical Brownian motion and persistent or anti-persistent transport behaviors. Validation against simulated data and experimental microscopy recordings reveals superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods. This approach provides a powerful tool for dissecting the complexity of intracellular networks and offers new insights into the regulatory mechanisms governing cargo delivery within cells.
