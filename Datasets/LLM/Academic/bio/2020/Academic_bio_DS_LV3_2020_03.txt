This study employs comparative transcriptomic profiling of wild-type *Pleurotus ostreatus* and its ligninolysis-deficient mutant strains to elucidate the transcriptional networks governing wood decay. Our 2020 analysis reveals a marked transcriptional reprogramming in mutants, characterized by the significant downregulation of a core suite of ligninolytic genes, including lignin peroxidases and laccases. Concurrently, we observed a compensatory upregulation of genes encoding cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzymes. These findings indicate a previously underappreciated regulatory divergence between the degradation pathways for lignin and holocellulose. We propose that this differential gene expression underscores a hierarchical regulatory mechanism, where the suppression of lignin-degrading machinery redirects fungal metabolic resources toward the more accessible polysaccharide components of lignocellulose. This work provides a refined model for the transcriptional coordination of lignocellulolytic systems in white-rot fungi.
