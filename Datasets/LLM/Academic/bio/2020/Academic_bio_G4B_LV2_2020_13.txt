**Abstract**

The global COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid innovation across multiple biomedical disciplines. This review synthesizes emerging strategies in diagnostics, preventative measures, and therapeutic management, reflecting critical advancements observed within the context of 2020.  A central theme is the evolving landscape of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, moving beyond traditional PCR techniques to incorporate novel machine learning algorithms for rapid and accurate detection.  Furthermore, the pandemic highlighted vulnerabilities in personal protective equipment (PPE) supply chains, spurring investigations into readily accessible, “do-it-yourself” (DIY) PPE solutions. 

Crucially, the sustained demand for respiratory support underscored the imperative for optimizing ventilator management.  Data-driven approaches utilizing machine learning are increasingly being explored to predict patient deterioration and personalize ventilation strategies.  However, significant gaps remain regarding long-term pandemic biology and the potential for viral evolution.  Continued interdisciplinary research, encompassing epidemiological modeling, immunological studies, and technological innovation, is paramount to effectively mitigate future infectious disease threats and inform evidence-based clinical practice.
