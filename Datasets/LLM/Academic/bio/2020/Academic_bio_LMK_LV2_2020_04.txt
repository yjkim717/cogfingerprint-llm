Title: Enhancing Healthcare Delivery in India through Standardization of Allied Health Professionals' Training: A Call for a Centralized Regulatory Framework

Abstract:
India's healthcare system is grappling with a significant shortage of allied health professionals (AHPs), compromising the quality of healthcare delivery. The absence of a unified regulatory framework has resulted in disparate training standards, further exacerbating the issue. As of 2020, the need for a centralized council to oversee AHP education has become increasingly pressing. This paper argues that the establishment of a centralized regulatory body is crucial for standardizing AHP training, thereby enhancing the healthcare workforce's quality and augmenting India's healthcare delivery. By examining the current landscape of AHP education in India, this study highlights the imperative for a unified regulatory framework. The proposed centralized council would facilitate the development of standardized curricula, accreditation protocols, and certification processes, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes in India.
