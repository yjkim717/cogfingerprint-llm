Title: Elucidating Ligninolytic Mechanisms in Pleurotus ostreatus through Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Mutant Strains

Abstract:
Lignin degradation is a crucial step in the carbon cycle, and white-rot fungi, such as Pleurotus ostreatus, play a key role in this process. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ligninolysis, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of wild-type and ligninolysis-deficient mutant strains of P. ostreatus. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we identified a total of 245 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two strains. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses revealed that the DEGs were predominantly associated with lignocellulolytic enzymes, including laccases, peroxidases, and cellulases. Our results indicate that the disruption of specific transcriptional regulators and ligninolytic enzymes contributes to the impaired ligninolytic capacity in the mutant strains. This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms governing lignin degradation in P. ostreatus and has implications for the development of biotechnological applications in biomass conversion.
