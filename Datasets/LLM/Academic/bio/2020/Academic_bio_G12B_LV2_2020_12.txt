**Abstract**

Inferring dynamic cellular trajectories remains a central challenge in developmental biology and disease research. RNA velocity, a computational method utilizing spliced mRNA abundance and nascent RNA transcription rates, has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting cellular fate. However, reliance solely on RNA data presents limitations, as transcriptional changes often precede protein abundance shifts. Here, we introduce Protaccel, a novel extension of RNA velocity that integrates single-cell RNA and protein abundance measurements to enhance trajectory inference. By incorporating protein levels, Protaccel provides a more comprehensive representation of cellular state and dynamics, enabling improved predictions of both past and future cellular states. We demonstrate Protaccelâ€™s efficacy through simulations and application to experimental datasets, highlighting its ability to resolve complex developmental transitions and potentially reveal previously obscured regulatory relationships. This integrated multiomic approach offers a significant advancement in the field of single-cell temporal analysis, promising a deeper understanding of cellular differentiation and responses to stimuli.
