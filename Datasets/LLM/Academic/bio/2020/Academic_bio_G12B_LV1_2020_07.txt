## Spatiotemporal Soil Temperature Data: Introducing SoilTemp, a Global Geospatial Database for Ecosystem Process Modeling

Understanding the influence of soil temperature on ecosystem function is crucial for predicting responses to ongoing climate change. While temperature at the air-soil interface is frequently modeled, near-surface soil temperatures, which directly govern critical biological and biogeochemical processes, remain poorly characterized at global scales. This limitation hinders accurate parameterization of ecological models and impedes comprehensive assessments of climate change impacts. Here, we introduce SoilTemp, a novel global geospatial database integrating a diverse compilation of near-surface soil temperature (0-10 cm) observations. The database aggregates data from a variety of sources, including meteorological stations, research networks, and remote sensing products, spanning the period 2000-2020.  A rigorous data assimilation protocol was employed, incorporating quality control measures and spatial interpolation techniques to generate a continuous, gridded dataset with a 0.05Â° spatial resolution.  SoilTemp's high spatiotemporal resolution allows for detailed characterization of soil thermal regimes across diverse biomes, capturing microclimatic variability often missed by coarser-resolution climate datasets. We anticipate that SoilTemp will significantly advance research in areas such as decomposition rates, plant phenology, microbial activity, and carbon cycling, providing a valuable resource for model development and validation, and ultimately improving projections of ecosystem responses to future climate scenarios.
