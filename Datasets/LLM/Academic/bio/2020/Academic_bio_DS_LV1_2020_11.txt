**Title:** Multi-omic Profiling Reveals Asynchronous and Tissue-Specific Trajectories of Immunosenescence and Mitochondrial Dysregulation in Mammalian Aging

**Abstract**

Aging is a systemic process characterized by a progressive decline in physiological integrity, yet it manifests disparately across different tissues. While genomic instability and telomere attrition are established hallmarks of aging, the precise spatiotemporal dynamics of molecular aging, particularly in the post-genomic era, remain incompletely mapped. In this study, we employed a multi-omics approach—integrating RNA sequencing and plasma proteomics—to delineate organ-specific aging signatures across five key tissues (liver, kidney, brain, skeletal muscle, and spleen) in a murine model. Our analysis reveals that the progression of aging is not a synchronous process but is defined by distinct, tissue-specific timelines of molecular alteration. We identified a pronounced dichotomy in the aging trajectories of immune and metabolic pathways. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of splenic and hepatic tissue uncovered an early and sustained activation of innate immune signaling pathways, characterized by the upregulation of interferon-responsive genes (e.g., *Isg15*, *Oasl2*) and complement system proteins, indicative of a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state, or inflammaging. Conversely, tissues with high metabolic demand, such as skeletal muscle and kidney, exhibited a later-onset decline in the expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, particularly those involved in oxidative phosphorylation (e.g., *Ndufs1*, *Cox5b*). This was corroborated by a corresponding decrease in mitochondrial respiratory chain complex proteins in plasma-derived extracellular vesicles, suggesting systemic metabolic rewiring. Our findings, generated in 2020, demonstrate that immunosenescence and mitochondrial dysfunction are not uniformly accelerated hallmarks but are instead subject to tissue-autonomous regulation. This refined understanding of asynchronous aging has profound implications for developing targeted anti-aging interventions, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all chronological approach may be less effective than strategies tailored to specific organ systems and their unique molecular aging clocks.
