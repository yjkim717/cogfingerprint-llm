**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial bottleneck in electrochemical water splitting, necessitating the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts. This study investigates the synergistic catalytic effect of incorporating iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) as a surface decoration on lanthanum nickelate (LaNiO3) perovskite for enhanced OER performance. Characterization reveals that FeOOH deposition facilitates the adsorption of hydroxyl intermediates, a key step in the OER mechanism, through increased surface active sites and modified electronic structure.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of FeOOH induces a weakening of the Ni-O bonds within the LaNiO3 lattice, promoting the release of lattice oxygen and contributing to the overall catalytic activity. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate a significant reduction in overpotential and an improved Faradaic efficiency for OER on the FeOOH-decorated LaNiO3 catalyst compared to pristine LaNiO3. These findings highlight a facile and effective strategy for designing advanced OER electrocatalysts by leveraging interfacial interactions between metal oxides to optimize catalytic activity and stability. The observed enhancement provides valuable insights into the rational design of perovskite-based materials for sustainable energy applications.
