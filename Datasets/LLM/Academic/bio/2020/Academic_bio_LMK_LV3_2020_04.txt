Title: Standardizing Allied Health Education in India: A Centralized Approach

Abstract:

India's healthcare system is confronted with a substantial shortage of allied health professionals, compromising the quality of care and hindering the achievement of universal health coverage. As of 2020, the absence of a unified regulatory framework has resulted in disparate training standards and inconsistent deployment practices across the country. To address this pressing issue, this paper advocates for the establishment of a centralized council to oversee the standardization of allied health education. By developing and implementing uniform curricula, accreditation protocols, and certification processes, such a council can ensure that allied health professionals receive high-quality training, meeting the evolving needs of India's healthcare workforce. This centralized approach can facilitate the development of a skilled and adaptable workforce, ultimately enhancing the resilience and responsiveness of India's healthcare system. A standardized framework can also facilitate the integration of allied health professionals into the broader healthcare system, promoting more effective care delivery.
