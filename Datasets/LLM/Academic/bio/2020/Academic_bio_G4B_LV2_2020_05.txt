**Abstract**

The year 2020 witnessed a significant escalation in the global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically the H5 subtype, triggering widespread outbreaks within European poultry populations and, critically, documented prevalence in wild bird species. This study examines the emergent dynamics of HPAI during the period August – December 2020, focusing on the geographically distributed impact and underlying transmission pathways. Initial detections predominantly occurred in wild waterfowl, suggesting a role for migratory populations in disseminating the virus across national borders. Subsequent outbreaks within domestic poultry – encompassing both commercial and small-scale farming – underscored the zoonotic potential and economic ramifications of the pathogen. 

Analysis of available surveillance data revealed a complex interplay between environmental factors, viral subtypes, and host susceptibility. While specific circulating HPAI subtypes varied across affected regions, the consistent association with wild bird reservoirs necessitates enhanced biosecurity protocols and targeted surveillance programs. The rapid spread within poultry, coupled with the potential for human exposure, represents a heightened public health concern. Further investigation into viral evolution, host immune responses, and the precise mechanisms of transmission from wild birds to poultry is crucial.  Ultimately, a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach integrating veterinary epidemiology, wildlife monitoring, and public health preparedness is paramount to mitigating future outbreaks and minimizing the risk of human infection within this evolving epidemiological landscape.
