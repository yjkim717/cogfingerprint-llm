Title: Strengthening Healthcare Infrastructure in India: The Imperative of a Centralized Council for Allied Health Professionals

Abstract:

India's healthcare delivery system is confronted with a significant shortage of allied health professionals (AHPs), compromising the quality of care and hindering the achievement of universal health coverage. The absence of a centralized regulatory framework has resulted in disparate training standards, exacerbating workforce estimation challenges. As of 2020, the need for a unified council to oversee AHP education and training has become increasingly pressing. This paper argues that the establishment of a centralized council is essential to standardize AHP training, enhance workforce planning, and improve healthcare delivery. By analyzing existing literature and workforce data, this study demonstrates that a centralized council can facilitate accurate workforce estimation, promote skill-based training, and foster a more responsive healthcare system. The proposed council can play a pivotal role in addressing India's healthcare workforce shortages and augmenting the overall quality of care.
