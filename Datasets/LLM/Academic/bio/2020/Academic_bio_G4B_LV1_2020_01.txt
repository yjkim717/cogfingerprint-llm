**Abstract**

Intracellular transport processes are increasingly recognized as critical determinants of cellular organization and function, yet their inherent heterogeneity presents significant analytical challenges. This study proposes a novel neural network-based approach to dissect and quantify the complex dynamics of intracellular cargo movement. Utilizing a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) framework, we characterize the stochastic nature of transport pathways, employing the Hurst exponent to discern the degree of long-range dependence within observed trajectories.  Our methodology allows for the systematic investigation of intracellular transport within defined cellular structures, revealing previously obscured patterns of spatial organization.  Specifically, we demonstrate the utility of this network architecture in modeling and predicting the distribution of molecules across neuronal networks.  The resulting insights offer a refined understanding of how cellular architecture influences transport efficiency and are poised to inform future research into disease mechanisms involving disrupted intracellular trafficking.
