**Abstract**

The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) consortium has generated a foundational compendium of whole-genome sequences from a diverse array of tumor types, presenting both an unprecedented resource and a significant computational challenge for the research community. The complexity and scale of these multi-dimensional genomic datasets necessitate robust, accessible platforms for integrative analysis and hypothesis generation. This review delineates a curated suite of five publicly available bioinformatic portals specifically tailored for the exploration of the PCAWG resource. We evaluate the distinct analytical capabilities of the ICGC Data Portal for primary data access, UCSC Xena for integrative genomic and phenotypic visualization, the Chromothripsis Explorer for interrogating patterns of catastrophic chromosomal rearrangements, and the Expression Atlas for concurrent transcriptomic profiling. By providing a structured framework for navigating these tools, this guide empowers researchers to overcome barriers in big data analysis, thereby facilitating the extraction of novel biological and clinical insights from complex cancer genomes, from driver mutation identification to the characterization of non-coding alterations and structural variant phenomena.
