**Abstract**

The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a critical bottleneck in sustainable energy technologies. This study investigates a novel approach to enhancing OER activity utilizing a bio-inspired strategy: the decoration of a LaNiO₃ perovskite structure with iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) clusters.  Our findings demonstrate that this FeOOH modification significantly elevates OER efficiency, primarily attributed to the facilitation of lattice oxygen oxidation within the perovskite framework. Spectroscopic analysis reveals a correlated increase in the concentration of coordinatively unsaturated oxygen species, indicative of enhanced oxygen transfer. Furthermore, we observed a concomitant reduction in the adsorption energy of water molecules on the electrode surface, suggesting a lowered kinetic barrier for initial proton dissociation.  These synergistic effects – facilitated lattice oxygen oxidation and reduced adsorption – collectively contribute to a substantial improvement in overall OER performance.  These results provide a foundational model for biomimetic strategies in electrocatalysis.
