**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) necessitates a deeper understanding of genetic and proteomic factors driving disease pathogenesis. This study investigated the relationship between the *APOE* ε4 allele, a well-established genetic risk factor for AD, and distinct protein signatures within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Utilizing a proteomics approach, we analyzed CSF samples from individuals stratified by *APOE* ε4 status, comparing protein abundance profiles between those carrying the risk allele and a control group. 

Our findings reveal significant differential expression of several proteins in CSF correlating with *APOE* ε4 carriage. Notably, we observed an enrichment of proteins associated with inflammatory response and oxidative stress in individuals with the ε4 allele. Conversely, proteins indicative of synaptic function demonstrated reduced abundance in this group. These data suggest that the *APOE* ε4 genotype may modulate distinct molecular pathways involved in AD progression, potentially influencing neuroinflammation and synaptic integrity. 

Specifically, the identified protein signatures provide a novel framework for investigating genotype-dependent mechanisms contributing to AD vulnerability. Further research utilizing multi-omic approaches, including transcriptomics, is warranted to fully elucidate these complex interactions.  The identification of these CSF protein biomarkers holds promise for early disease detection and personalized therapeutic strategies targeting the specific pathways altered by *APOE* ε4.
