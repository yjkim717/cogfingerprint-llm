**Abstract**

The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a cornerstone of intestinal epithelial homeostasis, and its dysregulation is a pivotal initiating event in the vast majority of colorectal cancers (CRC), primarily through inactivating mutations in the *APC* tumor suppressor gene. While the role of constitutive β-catenin activation in driving uncontrolled cellular proliferation is well-established, its critical function in promoting tumor angiogenesis—a prerequisite for sustained tumor growth and metastatic dissemination—remains a subject of intense investigation. This review synthesizes current evidence elucidating the mechanistic links between aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling and the angiogenic switch in CRC. We detail how nuclear β-catenin complexes with T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) transcription factors to directly transactivate key pro-angiogenic factors, with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) being a principal target. This direct transcriptional upregulation establishes a paracrine signaling axis whereby tumor cells stimulate neighboring endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and new vessel formation. Furthermore, we explore indirect mechanisms, including β-catenin-mediated cross-talk with other oncogenic pathways such as COX-2/PGE2 and HIF-1α, which synergistically amplify the angiogenic signal within the tumor microenvironment. The clinical ramifications of this relationship are profound, as the Wnt/β-catenin-driven angiogenic phenotype is strongly correlated with advanced disease stages and poor patient prognosis. Consequently, this review critically evaluates emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting this specific oncogenic-angiogenic axis. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of targeting downstream effectors of Wnt signaling, including the use of anti-VEGF biologics in combination with conventional chemotherapy, and the preclinical development of novel small-molecule inhibitors that directly intercept the β-catenin transcriptional machinery, offering a promising avenue for curtailing CRC progression and metastasis.
