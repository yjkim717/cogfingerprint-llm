Title: APOE ε4 Genotype-Modulated Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteome Signatures in Alzheimer's Disease Pathology and Cognitive Decline

Abstract:
The apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE ε4) genotype is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), influencing amyloid β aggregation and cognitive impairment. This study (2020) employed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to investigate APOE ε4-dependent molecular signatures associated with AD pathology. Using mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we analyzed CSF samples from AD patients with varying APOE ε4 genotypes. Our results revealed distinct proteomic profiles correlated with APOE ε4 status, highlighting alterations in protein networks related to amyloid β aggregation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Notably, APOE ε4 carriers exhibited elevated levels of inflammatory modulators and decreased abundance of synaptic proteins, correlating with cognitive decline. These findings elucidate the APOE ε4-modulated CSF proteome in AD, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for APOE ε4 carriers. Our study contributes to the understanding of AD heterogeneity and the development of precision medicine approaches.
