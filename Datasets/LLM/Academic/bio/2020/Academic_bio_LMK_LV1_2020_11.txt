Title: Unveiling Age-Related Organ-Specific Changes through Integrated Transcriptomics and Proteomics Analysis

Abstract:

Ageing is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive deterioration in physiological function across various organs. Understanding the molecular underpinnings of ageing dynamics is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms driving age-related diseases. In this study, we leveraged bulk RNA sequencing and plasma proteomics to investigate organ-specific changes in gene expression and protein abundance in the context of ageing. Utilizing the Tabula Muris Senis dataset, a comprehensive resource detailing ageing-related changes in mice, we analyzed transcriptomic profiles across 17 organs at various life stages.

Our analysis revealed distinct ageing trajectories among organs, with some exhibiting pronounced changes in gene expression during early life, while others displayed more gradual alterations throughout the lifespan. Notably, organs with high metabolic activity, such as the liver and kidney, demonstrated significant age-related changes in gene expression related to energy metabolism and cellular stress response pathways. Conversely, organs with lower metabolic rates, such as the brain and heart, showed more subtle changes in gene expression, suggesting a potential link between metabolic rate and ageing dynamics.

To further investigate the systemic consequences of ageing, we integrated our transcriptomic data with plasma proteomics analysis. This approach enabled the identification of age-related changes in circulating protein levels, which were found to correlate with organ-specific changes in gene expression. Specifically, we observed increased plasma levels of proteins associated with inflammation and cellular stress in older mice, which corresponded to upregulated expression of related genes in organs such as the liver and adipose tissue.

Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of ageing dynamics at the molecular level, highlighting the importance of organ-specific changes in gene expression and their systemic consequences. The integration of transcriptomics and proteomics data offers a powerful approach for elucidating the complex mechanisms underlying ageing and age-related diseases. Furthermore, this study underscores the value of the Tabula Muris Senis dataset as a resource for investigating ageing-related changes in mice, providing a framework for future studies aimed at understanding the molecular basis of ageing and developing targeted therapeutic interventions.
