**SoilTemp: A Global Geospatial Database of Near-Surface Soil Temperature for Enhanced Ecosystem Process Modeling**

Understanding the influence of microclimatic conditions on terrestrial ecosystem function is crucial for predicting responses to ongoing climate change. While macroclimatic trends are well-documented, the critical role of near-surface soil temperature, a key driver of biological activity and biogeochemical cycling, remains comparatively under-resolved at global scales. We introduce SoilTemp, a novel global geospatial database integrating a diverse compilation of near-surface (0-10 cm) soil temperature measurements collected from a variety of sources, including meteorological stations, research networks, and remote sensing products. This database provides unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution (daily to monthly data, 2000-2019) for a critical environmental variable.

SoilTempâ€™s structure facilitates the analysis of soil temperature variability across biomes and latitudes, enabling improved parameterization of ecosystem models used to simulate processes such as decomposition, respiration, and nutrient mineralization.  A key innovation lies in the rigorous quality control procedures applied to the data, incorporating automated outlier detection and spatial interpolation techniques to minimize biases.  We demonstrate the utility of SoilTemp through a preliminary analysis revealing significant regional differences in soil temperature seasonality and highlighting areas where current climate models may underestimate thermal influences on ecosystem processes. This resource addresses a critical data gap and is publicly available to promote collaborative research aimed at refining our understanding of ecosystem vulnerability and resilience in a changing climate.  Future work will focus on expanding temporal coverage and integrating data from soil moisture and other relevant environmental variables.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Tone:** I used precise language, avoided contractions, and structured the sentences to reflect academic writing conventions.
*   **Precise Terminology:** I included terms like "biogeochemical cycling," "spatiotemporal resolution," "parameterization," "respiration," "mineralization," and "ecosystem vulnerability and resilience."
*   **Structured Reasoning:**
    *   **Introduction/Problem:** I started by establishing the context and the need for better soil temperature data.
    *   **Solution:** I introduced SoilTemp as the solution.
    *   **Methodology (briefly):** I mentioned the data sources, resolution, and quality control.
    *   **Results/Demonstration:** I included a preliminary finding to showcase the database's value.
    *   **Conclusion/Future Directions:** I stated the impact and outlined potential future developments.
*   **Year Context (2020):** The temporal range of the data (2000-2019) is appropriate for a publication in 2020, reflecting the data available at that time.  I also framed the work within the context of ongoing climate change, a significant focus of research in that era.
*   **Bio-Focused:** The emphasis on ecosystem processes (decomposition, respiration, nutrient mineralization) aligns with a biological sciences audience.
*   **Geospatial Aspect:**  The abstract consistently highlights the geospatial
