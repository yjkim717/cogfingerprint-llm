**Transcriptional Response to Lignin Degradation Deficiency in *Pleurotus ostreatus***

White-rot fungi (WRF) are pivotal in natural ecosystems due to their capacity for lignin degradation, a complex process mediated by a suite of oxidative enzymes. Understanding the transcriptional mechanisms governing this process is crucial for biotechnological applications. This study investigates the transcriptional response in *Pleurotus ostreatus* mutants exhibiting reduced ligninolytic activity. Utilizing transcriptome analysis, we compared gene expression profiles between the mutant strains and wild-type controls. Our results demonstrate a significant downregulation of genes encoding ligninolytic peroxidases and laccases within the mutant lines, confirming a direct correlation between functional lignin degradation and the expression of these key enzymes. Conversely, we observed a notable upregulation of genes associated with cellulolytic activity, including endoglucanases and exoglucanases, suggesting a compensatory shift in metabolic priorities towards carbohydrate utilization in the absence of efficient lignin breakdown. These findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory networks controlling lignocellulolytic enzyme production in *P. ostreatus*, offering a platform for targeted genetic manipulation to enhance lignin degradation capabilities for biomass valorization. Further research will focus on elucidating the signaling pathways involved in this observed transcriptional reprogramming.
