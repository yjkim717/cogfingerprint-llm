**The Aberrant Intersection of Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling and Angiogenesis: A Critical Driver of Metastatic Progression in Colorectal Cancer**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with metastasis representing the primary challenge in effective clinical management. While significant advances have been made in early-stage CRC treatment, the complex interplay of signaling pathways driving metastatic dissemination remains incompletely understood. This review synthesizes current literature concerning the crucial and increasingly recognized role of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in modulating angiogenesis within the CRC microenvironment, ultimately contributing to metastatic progression. The canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway, normally involved in developmental processes, is frequently dysregulated in CRC through mutations in *APC*, *CTNNB1*, or other upstream regulators, leading to constitutive activation of β-catenin and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus. Nuclear β-catenin then interacts with TCF/LEF transcription factors, driving the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, survival, and crucially, angiogenesis.

Emerging evidence highlights that activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling directly influences the production of pro-angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietins, within CRC cells and stromal cells.  Furthermore, Wnt ligands can directly activate angiogenesis through non-canonical Wnt pathways, independent of β-catenin. This pathway-mediated angiogenesis supports tumor growth, facilitates intravasation, and promotes the establishment of pre-metastatic niches. Importantly, the interplay between Wnt/β-catenin and VEGF signaling appears synergistic, creating a positive feedback loop that intensifies angiogenesis and enhances metastatic capacity.

This review examines recent preclinical and clinical studies that explore the therapeutic potential of targeting both Wnt/β-catenin and angiogenic pathways in CRC.  Strategies including β-catenin inhibitors, Wnt antagonists, and anti-VEGF therapies, either alone or in combination, are discussed in the context of their efficacy and potential for overcoming drug resistance.  We conclude that a comprehensive understanding of the intricate molecular mechanisms linking Wnt/β-catenin signaling and angiogenesis is essential for developing novel, targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at disrupting metastatic progression and improving outcomes for patients with CRC. Further research is warranted to identify biomarkers predictive of response to these targeted therapies and to elucidate the role of the tumor microenvironment in modulating this critical signaling axis.

**Notes and Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Specificity:** This abstract could be further refined by mentioning specific inhibitors or antagonists being investigated (e.g., Porcupine inhibitors, small molecule Wnt antagonists).
*   **Microenvironment Focus:** The abstract touches on the microenvironment, but could be expanded to explicitly discuss the role of immune cells and fibroblasts in mediating Wnt/β-catenin-driven angiogenesis.
*   **Drug Resistance:** Mentioning specific mechanisms of drug resistance (e.g., epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by Wnt signaling) would strengthen the abstract.
*   **Combination Therapies:** Expanding on the
