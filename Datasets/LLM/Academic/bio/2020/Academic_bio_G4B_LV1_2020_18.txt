**Abstract**

The year 2020 witnessed a concerning escalation in the global epidemiology of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically HPAI subtype H5N8, with significant implications for both wild bird populations and poultry sectors across Europe. Extensive surveillance efforts, commencing in August 2020 and extending through December, revealed widespread detection of the virus within a diverse range of wild bird species, including passerines and waterfowl, alongside confirmed outbreaks in domestic poultry. This represents a notable departure from previous seasonal patterns, suggesting a potentially expanded reservoir and increased transmissibility. 

Analysis of circulating virus subtypes demonstrated a prevalent genetic profile consistent with migratory pathways, raising concerns about long-range dissemination and subsequent spillover events. The persistent presence of HPAI within wild bird populations represents a critical ecological factor contributing to the sustained risk of poultry infection. Furthermore, the rapid spread observed within poultry farms underscores the vulnerability of intensive production systems.  Understanding the dynamics of virus evolution, host susceptibility, and environmental transmission factors remains paramount. Future research should prioritize genomic sequencing, spatial modeling of virus distribution, and targeted biosecurity interventions to mitigate the ongoing threat posed by HPAI to both wildlife and agricultural economies.
