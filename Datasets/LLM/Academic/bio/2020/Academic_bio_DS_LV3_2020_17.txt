The critical deficit of approximately 6.5 million allied healthcare professionals (AHPs) in India represents a systemic vulnerability within the national healthcare infrastructure, directly impeding the delivery of comprehensive medical services. This profound supply-demand gap, exacerbated by fragmented training protocols and non-standardized curricula, compromises patient outcomes and restricts the operational capacity of primary and tertiary care facilities. To address this, the establishment of a centralized statutory council is proposed as a pivotal intervention for 2020. Such a regulatory body would enforce nationwide standardization of AHP education, credentialing, and scope of practice, thereby enhancing workforce interoperability and professional mobility. Furthermore, a centralized registry would facilitate accurate real-time workforce estimation and strategic planning, enabling targeted interventions to bridge the quantitative and qualitative deficits. This institutional reform is posited as an essential prerequisite for building a resilient, scalable, and equitable healthcare ecosystem, ultimately strengthening India's capacity to meet its public health objectives and universal health coverage commitments.
