The SoilTemp initiative represents a pivotal advancement in biogeographical research by addressing the critical scale mismatch between coarse-resolution climate data and the fine-grained thermal environments that directly govern biological processes. Launched in 2020, this global database systematically aggregates high-resolution, near-surface microclimate measurements, thereby providing an unprecedented spatiotemporal resource for ecological forecasting. Traditional macroclimatic models often fail to capture the operative temperatures experienced by most terrestrial organisms, leading to significant inaccuracies in predicting species distributions, phenological shifts, and ecosystem responses to anthropogenic change. By bridging this resolution gap, SoilTemp enables a mechanistic understanding of how microclimatic heterogeneity—driven by topography, vegetation, and soil properties—mediates climate change impacts on biodiversity. This empirical foundation is crucial for refining species distribution models, assessing thermal safety margins, and developing robust conservation strategies. Consequently, the database serves as an indispensable tool for projecting future ecological dynamics under various climate scenarios, moving the field beyond broad-scale correlations toward a more physiologically relevant and predictive science.
