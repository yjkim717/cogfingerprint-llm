**Abstract**

The canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is a cornerstone of intestinal epithelial homeostasis, and its dysregulation is a primary initiating event in the vast majority of colorectal cancers (CRC), largely through inactivating mutations in the *APC* tumor suppressor gene. While the role of constitutive β-catenin activation in driving uncontrolled cellular proliferation is well-established, its specific and critical function in promoting tumor angiogenesis—a prerequisite for sustained tumor growth and metastatic dissemination—remains a focal point of ongoing investigation. This review synthesizes contemporary evidence to delineate the mechanistic framework through which aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling orchestrates the angiogenic switch in the CRC microenvironment. We posit that nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, consequent to *APC* loss or other genetic lesions, directly transactivates a pro-angiogenic transcriptional program. A central effector of this program is the potent mitogen Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). β-catenin/TCF complexes bind to promoters of VEGF genes, leading to its robust secretion by CRC cells, which in turn stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and new vessel formation. Furthermore, we explore the pathway's regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly MMP-2, MMP-7, and MMP-9, which facilitate angiogenesis not only by degrading the extracellular matrix to enable endothelial cell migration but also by releasing matrix-bound pro-angiogenic factors. This dual-pronged strategy—induction of VEGF and MMPs—establishes Wnt/β-catenin signaling as a master regulator of the vascular niche in CRC. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms, particularly the crosstalk between genetic drivers like *APC* mutations and the resulting angiogenic phenotype, is paramount for developing novel anti-angiogenic therapeutics aimed at curtailing tumor progression and metastasis in colorectal cancer.
