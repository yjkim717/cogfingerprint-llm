**Abstract**

Lignin, a complex phenylpropanoid polymer, represents a significant recalcitrant barrier to biomass utilization. White-rot fungi (WRF) are renowned for their ability to degrade lignin, a process mediated by a suite of extracellular lignocellulolytic enzymes. *Pleurotus ostreatus*, a widely studied WRF, possesses a complex regulatory network governing the expression of these enzymes. This study employed comparative transcriptome analysis to elucidate transcriptional mechanisms underlying lignin degradation in *P. ostreatus* mutants exhibiting reduced ligninolytic capacity. RNA sequencing was performed on wild-type and mutant strains under lignin-inducing conditions to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).  Bioinformatic analyses revealed significant alterations in gene expression patterns related to carbohydrate active hydrolases (CAHs), lignin peroxidases (LiP), and manganese peroxidases (MnP) in the mutants.  Furthermore, we identified key transcription factors and regulatory pathways impacted by the lignin degradation deficiency.  These findings provide insights into the intricate transcriptional control of lignocellulolytic gene expression in *P. ostreatus*, contributing to a deeper understanding of fungal lignin degradation and potentially enabling metabolic engineering strategies for enhanced biomass conversion.
