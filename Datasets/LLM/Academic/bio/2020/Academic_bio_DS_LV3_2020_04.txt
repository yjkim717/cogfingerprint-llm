The escalating deficit of approximately 6.5 million allied healthcare professionals (AHPs) in India represents a systemic crisis, critically undermining the nation's healthcare delivery and public health outcomes. This 2020 analysis posits that the fragmented regulatory landscape, characterized by disparate training standards and non-uniform curricula, is a primary driver of this workforce shortage. To address this, we propose the immediate establishment of a statutory, centralized Allied Healthcare Professionals Council. Such a body is essential for standardizing accreditation, enforcing curriculum uniformity across educational institutions, and instituting a robust framework for longitudinal workforce planning. By creating a cohesive and scalable pipeline of qualified AHPs, this intervention would directly enhance clinical support services, optimize patient care pathways, and strengthen the overall resilience of the Indian health system. The centralization of regulatory authority is therefore identified as a critical, non-negotiable prerequisite for achieving equitable and effective healthcare delivery across the country.
