Title: Enhanced Identification of Modified Peptides via Localization-Aware Open Search Strategy in Shotgun Proteomics

Abstract:
Mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics has revolutionized the field of protein analysis, yet the comprehensive identification of post-translational modifications (PTMs) remains a significant challenge. Traditional database search strategies often suffer from limitations in detecting modified peptides due to the expansive search space and stringent matching criteria. To address this, we present a localization-aware open search method that significantly enhances the sensitivity and accuracy of modified peptide identification. By leveraging an open search strategy that considers all possible modifications, our approach effectively localizes PTMs to specific residues, thereby reducing false positives and increasing the number of confidently identified modified peptides. Evaluated using large-scale proteomics datasets from 2020, our method demonstrates superior performance over conventional search strategies, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of protein modification landscapes and their regulatory roles in biological processes.
