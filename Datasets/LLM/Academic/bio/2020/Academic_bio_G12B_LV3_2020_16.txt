alytic mechanisms governing lignin degradation in the basidiomycete *Pleurotus ostreatus*. Transcriptome analysis of ligninolysis-deficient mutants was employed to identify altered gene expression patterns associated with this critical metabolic process. Our findings demonstrate a significant downregulation of genes encoding key ligninolytic enzymes, including peroxidases and laccases, in the mutants, suggesting their crucial role in the wild-type phenotype. Concurrently, we observed an upregulation of genes involved in cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities, indicating a compensatory shift in carbohydrate metabolism. This study highlights the intricate regulatory network controlling lignocellulase production in *P. ostreatus*, revealing a complex interplay between lignin and carbohydrate degradation pathways. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of fungal biomass deconstruction and offer potential avenues for metabolic engineering of fungal strains for enhanced biofuel production and sustainable bioprocessing applications.
