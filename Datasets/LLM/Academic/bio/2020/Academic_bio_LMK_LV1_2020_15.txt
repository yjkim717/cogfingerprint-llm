Title: Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Colorectal Cancer Angiogenesis: Emerging Insights and Therapeutic Implications

Abstract:

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex and multifactorial disease characterized by dysregulated cellular processes, including angiogenesis. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a key regulator of cellular homeostasis, has been increasingly implicated in CRC pathogenesis. Recent studies have elucidated the critical role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in modulating CRC angiogenesis, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC angiogenesis and its implications for cancer management.

The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is activated upon binding of Wnt ligands to Frizzled receptors, leading to the stabilization and nuclear translocation of β-catenin. In CRC, aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a hallmark of tumorigenesis, driving the expression of pro-angiogenic genes and promoting angiogenesis. The pro-angiogenic effects of Wnt/β-catenin signaling are mediated through the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other angiogenic factors.

Emerging evidence suggests that Wnt/β-catenin signaling modulates CRC angiogenesis through multiple mechanisms, including the regulation of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation. Furthermore, Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been shown to interact with other signaling pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways, to promote angiogenesis.

The therapeutic targeting of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC has gained significant attention in recent years. Several small molecule inhibitors and biologics have been developed to target various components of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, with promising results in preclinical studies. The potential of these therapeutic strategies to inhibit CRC angiogenesis and tumor growth is currently being explored in ongoing clinical trials.

In conclusion, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a critical role in CRC angiogenesis, and its dysregulation is a key factor in CRC pathogenesis. Further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC angiogenesis will provide valuable insights into the development of effective therapeutic strategies for the management of CRC.
