**Abstract**

Lignin, a complex polymer abundant in plant cell walls, presents a significant barrier to the efficient degradation of biomass for biofuel and biomaterial production. White-rot fungi, particularly *Pleurotus ostreatus*, possess enzymatic capabilities for extensive ligninolytic degradation. This study employed transcriptome analysis to dissect the transcriptional response within lignin-deficient *P. ostreatus* mutants, aiming to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms governing lignocellulolytic gene expression.  Comparative transcriptomic profiling revealed significant alterations in gene expression patterns following lignin removal, highlighting a compensatory upregulation of putative ligninolytic enzymes. Specifically, genes involved in manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) activity demonstrated heightened expression. These findings suggest a finely tuned transcriptional network controlling lignin degradation capacity within *P. ostreatus*, providing valuable insights for optimizing fungal strains for enhanced biorefining applications. Further investigation into the identified genes’ function is warranted.
