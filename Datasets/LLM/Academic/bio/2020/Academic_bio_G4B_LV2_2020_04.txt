**Abstract**

India’s burgeoning population and evolving healthcare demands necessitate a robust and standardized allied health workforce. This paper posits that the current decentralized structure of allied health professions within India contributes significantly to workforce shortages and hinders optimal patient outcomes. We argue for the establishment of a centralized, statutory council – a novel approach – to facilitate comprehensive workforce planning, accreditation, and professional standardization. Such a council would be instrumental in mitigating existing skill gaps and ensuring consistent competency levels across diverse allied health disciplines. 

Specifically, the proposed council could oversee the development and implementation of national curricula, standardize continuing professional development requirements, and establish robust mechanisms for workforce data collection and analysis.  Furthermore, a centralized framework would streamline regulatory oversight, promoting equitable access to high-quality allied health services throughout the nation.  Addressing this systemic challenge is paramount to realizing India’s healthcare ambitions and improving population health in the 21st century.
