**Abstract**

Recent investigations into intracellular transport mechanisms have highlighted deviations from classical Brownian motion, revealing a complex landscape of heterogeneous movement patterns. This study presents a novel deep learning architecture, implemented in 2020, designed to quantitatively analyze this non-Brownian behavior, specifically targeting the dynamic characteristics of membrane-bound organelles such as endosomes and lysosomes.  Employing advanced image analysis techniques, we demonstrate the network’s ability to accurately resolve the fluctuating trajectories observed in these structures.  Furthermore, the methodology incorporates the Hurst exponent, a statistical measure indicative of long-range dependence, alongside an examination of fractional Brownian motion signatures.  The resultant framework offers a significantly more precise and computationally efficient approach compared to traditional methods, providing new insights into the underlying stochastic processes governing cellular cargo distribution and network dynamics.
