The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium has generated comprehensive whole-genome sequencing data across diverse tumor types, necessitating accessible tools for genomic exploration. This methodological guide presents five web-based platforms enabling multi-faceted analysis of PCAWG datasets without requiring computational expertise. We evaluate tools supporting variant annotation, mutational signature decomposition, structural variant visualization, and transcriptional regulation analysis. Each platform facilitates pan-cancer comparative genomics through interactive visualizations of somatic alterations, copy number variations, and epigenetic modifications. Implementation demonstrates these resources effectively bridge the gap between raw genomic data and biological interpretation, empowering researchers to identify cancer-specific patterns and driver events. The curated toolkit addresses critical needs in cancer genomics by providing standardized frameworks for hypothesis generation and validation across 2,658 tumors. These democratized analytical capabilities significantly enhance accessibility to PCAWG data, accelerating oncogenic mechanism discovery in the precision medicine era.
