The escalating burden of non-communicable diseases and demographic aging in India (circa 2020) has exposed a critical vulnerability in its healthcare infrastructure: a profound deficit in the allied health workforce. This study investigates the systemic etiology of this supply-demand gap, positing that the absence of a centralized regulatory council is the primary impediment to workforce scalability and quality. Fragmented training protocols and non-standardized credentialing perpetuate heterogeneous service delivery, compromising diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy. We propose the establishment of a statutory National Allied Healthcare Council to mandate curricular uniformity, accredit institutions, and maintain a national registry. Utilizing demographic and epidemiological projections, we model workforce estimation requirements for 2030, demonstrating that such a centralized body is a prerequisite for strategic human resource planning. This institutional reform is imperative to build a resilient, standardized, and sufficient allied health cadre, thereby enhancing overall health system performance and achieving universal health coverage targets.
