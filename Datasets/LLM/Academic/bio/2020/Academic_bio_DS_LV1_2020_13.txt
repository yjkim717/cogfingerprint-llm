**Abstract**

The global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 has precipitated an unprecedented public health crisis, necessitating a multi-faceted response integrating biomedical and technological innovations. This review synthesizes the critical pillars of the early pandemic countermeasures, with a focus on diagnostic methodologies, clinical resource management, and the application of computational tools. We first evaluate the rapid development and deployment of molecular diagnostics, primarily reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the emergent role of serological assays for epidemiological surveillance. Concurrently, we analyze the pivotal importance of personal protective equipment (PPE) in mitigating nosocomial transmission and the strategic allocation of mechanical ventilators for managing severe COVID-19 respiratory sequelae. Furthermore, this article explores the integration of machine learning algorithms as a transformative approach for pandemic management. We discuss their application in augmenting diagnostic speed and accuracy through medical image analysis, forecasting disease trajectory for resource planning, and accelerating therapeutic discovery via in silico drug screening. This synthesis underscores the necessity of a synergistic strategy, combining foundational public health measures with advanced computational intelligence to effectively combat the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
