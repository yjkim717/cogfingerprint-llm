**Abstract**

The development of efficient biocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical challenge in sustainable bio-energy systems. While microbial oxidases are proficient, their catalytic turnover is often limited by the kinetics of the water-splitting step. Drawing inspiration from inorganic perovskite catalysts, where lattice oxygen participation enhances OER, we hypothesized that engineering a synergistic bio-inorganic interface could overcome this bottleneck. We report a hybrid biocatalyst comprising *E. coli*-expressed *Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans* rusticyanin, a key metalloenzyme in iron oxidation pathways, decorated with a synthetic FeOOH nanocoating. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses confirm that the FeOOH matrix promotes localized hydroxyl ion adsorption and perturbs the electronic structure of the enzyme's native copper center, effectively weakening the metal-oxo bond in the catalytic intermediate. This engineered interface facilitates a novel lattice-oxygen-mediated reaction pathway, resulting in a fivefold increase in OER catalytic activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. This work establishes a paradigm for enhancing enzymatic function through rational bio-inorganic hybridization, offering a promising route for next-generation biotechnological energy conversion.
