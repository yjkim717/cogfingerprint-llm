**Abstract**

This study, conducted in 2020, employed transcriptome analysis to characterize transcriptional responses in *Pleurotus ostreatus* mutants exhibiting impaired lignin degradation. Utilizing comparative transcriptomics, we identified a significant downregulation of established ligninolytic genes – notably those encoding peroxidases and laccases – within the mutant strains. Conversely, a pronounced upregulation of genes associated with cellulose and xylan hydrolysis was observed. These findings suggest a refined regulatory network governing lignocellulosic biomass decomposition in this fungal species. Specifically, the observed shift indicates a compensatory upregulation of cellulolytic and xylanolytic pathways in response to reduced ligninolytic activity.  Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms driving this transcriptional reprogramming could provide valuable insights for optimizing fungal strains for enhanced biorefining of agricultural residues and contribute to a more sustainable approach to biomass processing.
