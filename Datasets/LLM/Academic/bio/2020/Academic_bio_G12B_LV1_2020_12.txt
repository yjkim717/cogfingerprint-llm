## ProtAccel: Integrating RNA and Protein Dynamics for Enhanced Trajectory Inference in Single-Cell Systems

Inferring developmental trajectories and cellular dynamics from single-cell data remains a significant challenge in biological research. Existing methods often rely solely on RNA expression profiles, neglecting the crucial temporal lag between transcriptional changes and subsequent protein abundance shifts. Here, we introduce ProtAccel, a novel computational framework that integrates single-cell RNA and protein velocity data to enhance trajectory inference. ProtAccel leverages the complementary information contained within both modalities, accounting for the time-dependent relationship between mRNA transcription and protein translation. By explicitly modeling protein turnover and incorporating protein abundance measurements, ProtAccel provides a more accurate representation of cellular state transitions than RNA-based approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of ProtAccel on simulated datasets and experimental data, showcasing improved trajectory reconstruction, enhanced identification of key regulatory nodes, and a refined understanding of cellular fate decisions. This integrated approach promises a more holistic view of single-cell dynamics and expands the potential for uncovering nuanced biological mechanisms.
