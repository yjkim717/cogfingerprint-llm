**Abstract**

The burgeoning demand for sustainable energy solutions necessitates the development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a critical bottleneck in water electrolysis. While perovskite oxides, such as LaNiO<sub>3</sub> (LaNiO<sub>3</sub>), exhibit inherent OER activity, their performance is often limited by sluggish lattice oxygen mobility and insufficient active site density. Drawing inspiration from the oxidative stress response mechanisms observed in photosynthetic organisms, we introduce a biomimetic surface modification strategy utilizing iron oxyhydroxide (FeOOH) nanosheets to enhance the OER activity of LaNiO<sub>3</sub>. This approach leverages the inherent redox capabilities of FeOOH to facilitate the extraction of lattice oxygen from the LaNiO<sub>3</sub> framework, thereby creating vacancies that act as catalytically active sites.  Characterization via X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the formation of a well-dispersed FeOOH layer and reveals a significant increase in Ni<sup>3+</sup>/Ni<sup>2+</sup> ratio post-modification, indicative of enhanced oxygen release. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate a substantial decrease in overpotential (η) – approximately 150 mV – and a significantly improved Tafel slope compared to pristine LaNiO<sub>3</sub>, showcasing improved reaction kinetics. These findings highlight the potential of bio-inspired surface engineering strategies for optimizing OER electrocatalysts and advancing sustainable hydrogen production technologies.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Bio-inspired Framing:** I explicitly mention "biomimetic" and "bio-inspired" to align with the request for a bio focus.  The reference to "oxidative stress response mechanisms observed in photosynthetic organisms" provides a justification for the approach, tying it to biological processes. This adds a layer of novelty.
*   **Precise Terminology:**  I used standard electrochemical and materials science terminology: "OER," "overpotential (η)," "Tafel slope," "X-ray diffraction (XRD)," "scanning electron microscopy (SEM)," "X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)," "lattice oxygen," "vacancies," "redox capabilities."
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a clear structure:
    *   **Context/Problem:**  Highlights the importance of OER and the limitations of perovskites.
    *   **Approach:** Introduces the FeOOH modification strategy and its rationale (biomimicry).
    *   **Characterization:** Briefly mentions characterization techniques and key findings.
    *   **Results:** Reports the electrochemical improvements (overpotential and Tafel slope).
    *   **Conclusion/Significance:** Summarizes the implications and potential impact.
*   **Quantitative Data:**  Providing a specific value like "150 mV" for the overpotential reduction strengthens the claim and adds credibility.
*   **Year Context (2020):** The language and focus on sustainability are consistent with trends in materials science research around 2020.
