**Abstract**

The 2020 epizootic of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in Europe represented a significant escalation in the ecology and epidemiology of avian influenza viruses, necessitating a comprehensive assessment of its temporal progression, host range, and virological characteristics. This study analyzes surveillance data from August to December 2020 to delineate the spatiotemporal dynamics and zoonotic potential of the circulating strains. A total of 561 confirmed HPAI detections were recorded across the European continent during this period. Epidemiological investigation revealed a distinct pattern of viral incursion and spread, primarily mediated by wild aquatic birds (Order Anseriformes and Charadriiformes), which served as the initial introduction pathway and a persistent reservoir. Subsequent secondary spread led to numerous outbreaks in the commercial poultry sector, causing substantial economic losses and necessitating extensive culling operations. Genetic characterization identified multiple HPAI virus subtypes, with the H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b being the predominant variant. This clade demonstrated efficient intra-species transmission within wild bird populations and a high capacity for spillover into domestic gallinaceous poultry and other captive birds. While the primary focus remains on avian health and food security, the persistent and widespread circulation of these viruses in both wild and domestic populations raises significant concerns regarding their zoonotic potential. Although direct human infections with the H5N8 strain were not a dominant feature of this specific epizootic, the ongoing viral evolution and reassortment opportunities in densely populated poultry systems present a non-negligible risk for the emergence of novel variants with enhanced mammalian transmissibility. These findings underscore the critical importance of robust, integrated surveillance systems that bridge wild bird monitoring and poultry biosecurity. The data from the 2020 season highlight an urgent need for pre-emptive risk assessment and the development of mitigation strategies to manage the escalating threat posed by HPAI to animal and, potentially, public health.
