**Transcriptional Landscape of Lignin Degradation Deficiency in *Pleurotus ostreatus* Reveals Novel Regulatory Mechanisms**

Lignin, a complex aromatic polymer, represents a significant recalcitrant biomass component limiting the efficient utilization of lignocellulosic resources. White-rot fungi, renowned for their ligninolytic capabilities, offer a promising avenue for developing sustainable bioprocessing technologies. This study employed transcriptome sequencing to investigate the transcriptional response of *Pleurotus ostreatus* mutants exhibiting impaired lignin degradation. Comparative analysis of wild-type and mutant strains revealed significant alterations in the expression profiles of genes encoding known lignocellulolytic enzymes, including lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, and laccases. However, a more nuanced investigation uncovered substantial shifts in the expression of secondary metabolic pathways and a suite of previously uncharacterized genes, suggesting a broader regulatory network governing lignin degradation. Specifically, we identified a cohort of transcription factors exhibiting altered expression patterns in the mutants, potentially mediating the observed changes in lignocellulolytic gene expression. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underpinning lignin degradation in *P. ostreatus*, highlighting the complexity of this process and providing novel targets for metabolic engineering aimed at enhancing fungal biomass conversion.
