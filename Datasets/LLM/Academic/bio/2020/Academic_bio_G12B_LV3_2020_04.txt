**Abstract**

The escalating demand for healthcare services in India, coupled with a burgeoning population, has exposed a critical deficit in the allied health professions (AHPs). This shortfall, observed throughout 2020, poses a significant threat to the provision of equitable and high-quality patient care. Currently, AHP training programs across India exhibit considerable heterogeneity in curriculum, accreditation standards, and pedagogical approaches, resulting in variable competency levels among graduates. This paper argues that a centralized, nationally recognized professional council is essential to address this systemic challenge. Such a council would be tasked with the standardization of AHP curricula, ensuring alignment with contemporary clinical practice and evolving healthcare needs. Furthermore, the council could facilitate robust workforce planning initiatives, forecasting future demand and proactively addressing geographical maldistribution. The establishment of standardized assessment frameworks and continuing professional development programs would further contribute to enhanced quality assurance and professional accountability. Ultimately, the creation of a unified regulatory body for AHPs represents a crucial step towards strengthening Indiaâ€™s healthcare infrastructure and ensuring optimal patient outcomes in the face of increasing healthcare complexities.
