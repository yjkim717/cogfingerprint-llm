"In 2020, advancements in single-cell multiomics enabled the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data. Building upon the RNA velocity framework, our study introduces protein velocity, a novel approach that incorporates protein abundance dynamics to infer cellular trajectories. By analyzing multimodal experiments, we demonstrate the enhanced predictive power of our method, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of cellular state transitions and temporal processes."
