**Abstract**

Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing lignin degradation in white-rot fungi remains a key challenge in biomass utilization. This study employed transcriptome analysis to investigate transcriptional reprogramming in lignin degradation-deficient mutants of *Pleurotus ostreatus*. Our findings reveal a significant downregulation of genes encoding ligninolytic enzymes in these mutant strains, coupled with a concomitant upregulation of genes involved in cellulolytic and xylanolytic pathways. These observations suggest a complex regulatory network where lignin degradation proficiency directly influences the allocation of metabolic resources towards carbohydrate metabolism. This research contributes to a refined understanding of gene regulation within *P. ostreatus* and offers insights into manipulating fungal metabolism for enhanced biofuel production.
