Title: Addressing the Shortage of Allied Health Professionals in India's Healthcare Delivery System: A Case for a Centralized Regulatory Framework

Abstract:

The burgeoning healthcare needs of India's populace are severely constrained by a pronounced shortage of allied health professionals (AHPs), compromising the efficacy of the healthcare delivery system. As of 2020, the inadequacy of standardized training and regulatory frameworks for AHPs exacerbates this issue. This study argues that the establishment of a centralized council is imperative to rectify the prevailing heterogeneity in AHP education and training, thereby enhancing the quality and availability of skilled manpower. By analyzing the current landscape of AHP education and service delivery in India, this research underscores the need for a unified regulatory mechanism to ensure conformity to national standards. The proposed centralized council would facilitate the standardization of curricula, accreditation of training programs, and certification of AHPs, ultimately strengthening India's healthcare infrastructure and improving health outcomes.
