**Abstract**

Intracellular transport is a complex process governed by heterogeneous dynamics, often exhibiting anomalous diffusion. Quantifying this behavior via the Hurst exponent (H) is crucial for elucidating underlying biophysical mechanisms. However, robust estimation of H from experimental trajectories of endocytic organelles, such as endosomes and lysosomes, remains challenging due to their short, noisy nature. To address this, we developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) specifically designed for the analysis of short-time series. Our model was trained on extensive simulations of fractional Brownian motion, encompassing a spectrum of anomalous diffusion regimes. When applied to experimental single-particle tracking data, the network outperformed conventional statistical methods, providing accurate and robust H estimations even for trajectories as short as 50 data points. This approach establishes a powerful computational tool for dissecting the heterogeneous transport landscapes within living cells, offering new insights into organelle-specific motor-cargo interactions and cytoskeletal regulation.
