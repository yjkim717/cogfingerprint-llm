**Title:** The Wnt/β-Catenin/VEGF Axis: A Central Regulator of Angiogenic Switching and Metastatic Progression in Colorectal Carcinoma

**Abstract**

In colorectal cancer (CRC), the high frequency of metastasis remains the principal cause of mortality, underscoring the critical need to elucidate the molecular drivers of disease progression. A hallmark of this progression is the "angiogenic switch," wherein tumors acquire the capacity to induce new blood vessel formation to support their growth and invasive potential. While Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a well-established master regulator of angiogenesis, the upstream oncogenic pathways governing its aberrant expression in CRC are not fully delineated. This review synthesizes contemporary evidence to posit that the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway serves as a pivotal upstream orchestrator of tumor angiogenesis and metastatic dissemination in colorectal carcinogenesis. In the majority of sporadic CRCs, constitutive activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, often initiated by APC mutations, is a foundational oncogenic event. We detail the mechanistic evidence demonstrating that nuclear-localized β-catenin, in complex with TCF/LEF transcription factors, directly transactivates the expression of a repertoire of pro-angiogenic factors, with VEGF being a paramount target. This signaling axis facilitates the transition from avascular hyperplasia to robustly vascularized carcinoma, supplying the necessary nutrients and oxygen for expansive tumor growth. Furthermore, we explore the non-canonical, angiogenesis-independent roles of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), thereby enhancing tumor cell invasiveness and priming the microenvironment for metastatic seeding. The convergence of these functions—driving both the angiogenic switch and cellular invasion—positions the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as a critical linchpin in the metastatic cascade. Consequently, this consolidated understanding, current to 2020, provides a compelling rationale for therapeutically targeting this pathway. We discuss emerging strategies, including selective inhibitors and combination therapies aimed at disrupting the Wnt/β-catenin/VEGF axis, highlighting their potential to suppress angiogenesis and impede metastasis, thereby offering novel avenues for improving outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer.
