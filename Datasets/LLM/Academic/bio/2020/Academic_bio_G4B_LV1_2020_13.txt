**Abstract**

The global emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic necessitated an urgent and multifaceted response, with diagnostic capabilities forming a critical cornerstone. This review synthesizes recent progress in the development and deployment of diagnostic tools for SARS-CoV-2, encompassing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, rapid antigen tests, and emerging molecular techniques.  Despite significant advancements, challenges remain regarding sensitivity, specificity, and equitable access, particularly in resource-limited settings. Furthermore, the evolving nature of viral transmission – including variants of concern – underscores the imperative for adaptable diagnostic strategies.  Alongside technological innovation, this paper posits that effective pandemic management demands concurrent policy interventions focused on surveillance, testing infrastructure, and public health communication.  Future research should prioritize robust validation studies and the integration of diagnostic data with epidemiological modeling to inform targeted mitigation efforts and ultimately, control the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
