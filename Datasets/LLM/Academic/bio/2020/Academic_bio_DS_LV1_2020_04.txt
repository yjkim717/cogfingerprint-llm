**Abstract**

The Indian healthcare delivery system faces a critical and widening supply-demand gap in its allied health workforce, a deficit exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This crisis is fundamentally rooted in the absence of a standardized regulatory framework, leading to heterogeneous training, non-uniform credentialing, and fragmented service delivery. This paper posits that the establishment of a centralized statutory council is an imperative intervention to rectify this systemic failure. We analyze the current fragmented landscape of allied health education and practice, highlighting how the lack of standardization compromises both the quality of patient care and the efficient utilization of human resources. The proposed centralized council would be mandated to define scopes of practice, accredit educational programs, and maintain a national register of qualified professionals. We argue that such a structural reform is not merely administrative but is a prerequisite for building a resilient, scalable, and integrated healthcare ecosystem capable of meeting contemporary public health challenges and achieving universal health coverage in India.
