**Abstract**

Characterizing stochasticity in intracellular transport processes is crucial for understanding cellular function, particularly within dynamic systems like endocytosis. Traditional methods for quantifying transport dynamics, such as Hurst exponent estimation, often require lengthy time series data, limiting their applicability to rapidly occurring events. This study, presented in 2020, addresses this challenge by introducing a novel deep learning approach utilizing a feedforward neural network to analyze heterogeneous intracellular transport. Our model demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency in estimating the Hurst exponent from comparatively short time series, allowing for a more detailed investigation of transport behavior. Results reveal complex, stochastic dynamics within endocytic organelles, suggesting a departure from previously assumed diffusion models. This framework provides a powerful tool for researchers seeking to elucidate the nuanced temporal organization of intracellular cargo movement and its impact on cellular processes.
