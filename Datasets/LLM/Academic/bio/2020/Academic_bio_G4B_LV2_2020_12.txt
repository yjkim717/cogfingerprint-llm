**Abstract**

Single-cell multiomics technologies have revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity; however, effectively capturing dynamic cellular states remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel analytical framework for temporal cell state inference, integrating protein velocity and RNA velocity estimates derived from single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic data.  Leveraging these complementary datasets, we propose a method to disentangle transcriptional and translational dynamics, thereby providing a more comprehensive representation of cellular transitions.  Specifically, we utilize a cross-correlation analysis to assess the temporal relationship between protein and RNA expression profiles.  This approach allows for the identification of cell states exhibiting pronounced velocity, indicative of rapid phenotypic shifts.  Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this method in characterizing dynamic cell populations, suggesting a valuable tool for future investigations into developmental biology and disease modeling within the context of single-cell analysis.
