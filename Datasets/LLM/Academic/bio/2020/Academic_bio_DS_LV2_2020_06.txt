While the provided summary focuses on materials science, the underlying principle of synergistic catalysis through surface modification is broadly applicable to biocatalysis. This study investigates the enhancement of enzymatic oxygen evolution in cyanobacterial photosystem II (PSII) through the strategic decoration of the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) with synthetic manganese-oxo clusters. We hypothesized that these clusters, analogous to the FeOOH in the perovskite system, would function as synergistic co-catalysts by promoting substrate water binding and lowering the activation energy for Oâ€“O bond formation. Using a combination of site-directed mutagenesis to create specific binding sites and advanced spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrated a 2.3-fold increase in oxygen evolution rates in engineered Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Our findings confirm that the exogenous clusters facilitate proton-coupled electron transfer and stabilize high-valent manganese intermediates, thereby mitigating oxidative damage. This biomimetic approach, validated in 2020, establishes a novel paradigm for augmenting native metabolic pathways through rational interfacial engineering, with significant implications for sustainable biohydrogen production.
