**Abstract**

The escalating impacts of climate change necessitate a refined understanding of localized environmental conditions and their influence on biological systems. Current global climate models frequently lack the requisite spatiotemporal resolution to accurately represent near-surface soil temperatures, a critical factor governing numerous ecological processes. The SoilTemp initiative addresses this deficiency by constructing a comprehensive, globally-accessible geospatial database integrating high-resolution soil temperature measurements derived from distributed sensor networks. This resource facilitates enhanced characterization of microclimates and their direct effects on organismal physiology, phenology, and ecosystem function. By providing a foundation for improved predictive modeling, SoilTemp promises to advance research across diverse fields, including biogeochemistry, plant ecology, and wildlife conservation, ultimately contributing to more robust climate change vulnerability assessments.
