**Enhancing Metabolic Efficiency via Surface Modification: A Bio-Inspired Approach to Redox Catalysis**

Metabolic pathways frequently rely on precisely orchestrated redox reactions, often bottlenecked by kinetic barriers.  Drawing an analogy to biological systems, this work investigates the potential of surface modification to enhance enzymatic catalysis. We propose a strategy utilizing a bio-inspired “decoration” – the introduction of FeOOH moieties – onto a core perovskite scaffold to facilitate oxygen evolution reaction (OER).  Our findings demonstrate that this modification accelerates lattice oxygen oxidation, effectively mimicking the localized redox potential shifts observed in electron transport chains.  Furthermore, the FeOOH layer appears to promote hydroxyl adsorption, lowering the activation energy for OER.  This approach suggests a framework for designing robust and efficient catalytic surfaces, potentially applicable to areas ranging from biofuel production to synthetic biology, and warrants further investigation into the mechanistic details of this bio-inspired catalytic enhancement.
