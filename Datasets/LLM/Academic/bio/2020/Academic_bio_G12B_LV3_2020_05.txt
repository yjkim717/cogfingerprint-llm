**Abstract:**

The late summer and autumn of 2020 witnessed a concerning resurgence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) across Europe, characterized by widespread detections of the A(H5N8) subtype. This study highlights the significant impact of this outbreak on both wild bird populations and commercial poultry sectors, underscoring the complex interplay between avian reservoirs and domestic avian species. Surveillance data collected between August and December 2020 revealed a geographically extensive distribution of the virus, impacting diverse wild bird species, including migratory waterfowl, and resulting in confirmed HPAI infections within poultry farms. The rapid dissemination of A(H5N8) poses a substantial threat to global poultry production and public health, given the potential for zoonotic transmission and the economic consequences of widespread culling.  The observed prevalence in wild birds suggests a role for migratory pathways in long-distance viral spread, while concurrent outbreaks in poultry indicate effective interspecies transmission.  These findings emphasize the critical need for enhanced surveillance programs targeting both wild bird populations and poultry farms, coupled with rigorous biosecurity protocols to mitigate further viral propagation.  Furthermore, continued genomic characterization of circulating A(H5N8) strains is essential to monitor antigenic evolution and inform the development of effective preventative measures and potential vaccine strategies. The 2020 European HPAI outbreak serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing risk posed by avian influenza viruses and the imperative for proactive, multidisciplinary approaches to pandemic preparedness.
