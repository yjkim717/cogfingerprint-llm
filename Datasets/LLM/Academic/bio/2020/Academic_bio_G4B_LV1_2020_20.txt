**Abstract**

Understanding the influence of microclimates on biological processes is increasingly recognized as critical for predicting ecosystem responses to ongoing climate change. This study introduces SoilTemp, a novel global geospatial database designed to facilitate research in this area. SoilTemp compiles near-surface temperature time series data, offering enhanced spatiotemporal resolution compared to existing datasets. Utilizing advanced geospatial database management, SoilTemp integrates data from diverse sources to provide a contiguous, accessible resource.  Analysis of this data allows for the quantification of soil temperature variability and its relationship to localized microclimates.  Specifically, SoilTemp enables researchers to investigate how variations in soil temperature impact plant physiology, soil microbial communities, and ultimately, broader ecosystem dynamics.  We anticipate this resource will significantly advance our capacity to model and predict biological responses to climate change across a range of biomes.
