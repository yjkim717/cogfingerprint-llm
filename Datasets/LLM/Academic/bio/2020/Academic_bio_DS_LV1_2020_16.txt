**Abstract**

The white-rot fungus *Pleurotus ostreatus* efficiently degrades lignin, a key process in global carbon cycling and biotechnological applications. To elucidate the transcriptional network governing ligninolysis, we conducted comparative RNA-seq analysis of wild-type *P. ostreatus* and a suite of ligninolysis-deficient mutants cultivated on a lignocellulosic substrate. Our transcriptomic profiling revealed a significant downregulation of core ligninolytic enzymes, including manganese peroxidases and laccases, in the mutant strains, confirming their pivotal role in native lignin depolymerization. Intriguingly, we observed a concurrent and substantial upregulation of cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic gene suites. This inverse regulatory relationship suggests a compensatory metabolic rewiring, whereby the fungus reallocates transcriptional resources to alternative carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) when the primary lignin-degradation machinery is impaired. These findings, from a 2020 perspective, provide a refined model of the transcriptional interplay governing wood decay in basidiomycetes and highlight potential targets for strain engineering in industrial lignocellulose bioconversion.
