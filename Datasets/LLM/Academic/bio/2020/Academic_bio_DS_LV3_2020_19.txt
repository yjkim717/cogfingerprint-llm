The synergistic integration of FeOOH nanolayers with LaNiO3 perovskite substrates represents a transformative strategy for enhancing electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics. This 2020 investigation demonstrates that FeOOH decoration fundamentally alters the surface electronic structure, promoting favorable hydroxyl species adsorption and activating lattice oxygen oxidation mechanisms. Spectroscopic analyses confirm a significant weakening of Ni–O covalent bonds within the perovskite framework, thereby lowering the thermodynamic barrier for O–O bond formation. The resulting catalyst exhibits a fivefold increase in mass activity and superior operational stability over 100 hours, attributed to the synergistic interplay between the FeOOH adlayer’s proton-acceptor functionality and the perovskite’s inherent electronic conductivity. These findings establish a new paradigm for designing high-performance, non-precious metal OER electrocatalysts for sustainable energy conversion systems, highlighting the critical role of interfacial engineering in modulating reaction pathways.
