Title: Strengthening Healthcare Delivery in India: A Case for a Centralized Council for Allied Health Professionals

Abstract:
The Indian healthcare system is grappling with a significant shortage of allied health professionals (AHPs), compromising the delivery of quality healthcare services. As of 2020, the absence of a unified regulatory framework has resulted in variability in training programs and deployment practices, exacerbating the workforce shortage. To address this issue, we propose the establishment of a centralized council to oversee AHP education and training, ensuring standardization and accreditation of programs. This council would facilitate accurate workforce estimation, enabling data-driven policy decisions. By streamlining AHP training and deployment, the proposed council can help bridge the existing workforce gap, ultimately enhancing healthcare delivery in India. Our analysis underscores the need for a coordinated approach to AHP workforce development, highlighting the potential benefits of a centralized regulatory framework in strengthening the Indian healthcare system.
