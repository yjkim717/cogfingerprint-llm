**Abstract**

India’s burgeoning population and evolving healthcare demands necessitate a strategic re-evaluation of its allied health professional (AHP) workforce. Current healthcare delivery systems exhibit significant systemic vulnerabilities stemming from a demonstrable workforce gap, particularly within specialized AHP roles. This paper posits that the establishment of a national, centrally-directed council is a paramount intervention to mitigate this deficit and optimize service provision. Such a council’s mandate should encompass the development and implementation of standardized training curricula, accreditation protocols, and continuing professional development initiatives.  Crucially, standardization will facilitate workforce mobility, reduce redundancies, and ensure consistent quality of care across diverse geographic regions.  Furthermore, the council should champion data-driven workforce planning, utilizing predictive analytics to anticipate future needs. Addressing this critical juncture requires a coordinated, multi-faceted approach, with the proposed council serving as a central coordinating body to foster sustainable growth and responsiveness within the Indian AHP landscape.
