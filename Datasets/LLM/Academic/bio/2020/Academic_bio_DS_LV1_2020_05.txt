**Abstract**

The 2020 epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), predominantly of the subtype H5N8, represented a significant crisis for the European poultry sector and wild bird populations. This study provides a spatiotemporal analysis of the outbreak dynamics between August and December 2020, correlating the intensification of cases in wild avifauna with subsequent incursions into domestic poultry holdings. Epidemiological investigations confirmed that the H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4b was the primary etiological agent, demonstrating high pathogenicity and efficient transmission among migratory waterfowl, which served as a pervasive reservoir. The initial viral introduction and subsequent inter-regional spread were facilitated by the autumn migration pathways of wild birds, leading to a cascade of primary infections in poultry, often in regions with high densities of open-water habitats. A critical finding was the high frequency of secondary spread between domestic premises, underscoring substantial deficiencies in on-farm biosecurity protocols. Our analysis indicates that while wild bird-mediated introduction was the principal driver of the epizootic, suboptimal biosecurity measures were a major amplifying factor. Consequently, this study underscores the necessity of an integrated One Health approach. We conclude that enhanced, year-round surveillance of wild bird populations at key migratory sites, coupled with the mandatory implementation and auditing of strict compartmentalization and biosecurity measures in the poultry industry, is imperative for early detection, containment, and the mitigation of future economic and zoological impacts from HPAI viruses of similar evolutionary trajectories.
