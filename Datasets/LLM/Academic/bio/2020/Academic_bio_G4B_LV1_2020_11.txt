**Temporal Organ-Specific Aging Signatures Revealed Through Integrated Transcriptomic and Proteomic Analysis in *Mus musculus***

The concept of “aging hallmarks” increasingly recognizes the heterogeneity of the aging process across different tissues and organs. This study investigates the temporal dynamics of aging within the murine model, employing a multi-omic approach to identify distinct signatures of senescence. Utilizing bulk RNA sequencing and quantitative proteomics, we characterized gene expression and protein abundance profiles across multiple mouse organs at varying ages.  Data integration, facilitated by the Mouse Aging Cell Atlas, allowed for a comprehensive assessment of cellular changes associated with chronological age. 

Our analysis revealed significant organ-specific temporal signatures, demonstrating asynchronous progression of aging. Notably, alterations in gene expression were consistently correlated with corresponding shifts in protein levels, suggesting a robust mechanistic link between transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional protein modification.  Specific organ systems exhibited unique patterns of gene dysregulation, including elevated expression of stress response genes and altered protein turnover pathways in the liver and kidney. These findings provide a valuable resource for dissecting the complexity of aging and highlight the importance of considering tissue-specific responses.  Further investigation into the functional consequences of these identified signatures is warranted to inform targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating age-related decline.
