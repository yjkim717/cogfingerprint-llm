Title: Enhancing Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution via Bio-Inspired Perovskite Modification

Abstract:
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial process in various bio-electrochemical systems, including microbial fuel cells and electrogenic bioreactors. To improve the efficiency of these systems, it is essential to develop catalysts that can facilitate the OER at low overpotentials. In this study, we demonstrate that decorating LaNiO3 perovskite with FeOOH significantly enhances its OER catalytic activity. Our results indicate that the FeOOH modification promotes lattice oxygen oxidation, leading to a weakening of the Ni-O bond and an increase in the material's electrocatalytic activity. This bio-inspired approach to perovskite modification offers a promising strategy for improving the performance of bio-electrochemical systems, with potential applications in wastewater treatment and bioenergy production. By elucidating the mechanisms underlying the enhanced OER activity, our findings provide valuable insights into the design of more efficient electrocatalysts for bio-electrochemical applications.
