Title: Unveiling Ligninolytic Mechanisms in Pleurotus ostreatus: A Comparative Transcriptomic Analysis

Abstract:
Lignin degradation is a crucial step in the carbon cycle, and white-rot fungi, particularly Pleurotus ostreatus, play a key role in this process. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying ligninolysis, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis between wild-type P. ostreatus and ligninolysis-deficient mutant strains. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with lignocellulolytic processes. Our results revealed significant downregulation of genes encoding ligninolytic enzymes, including laccases and peroxidases, in mutant strains. Transcriptional analysis further indicated altered expression of genes involved in cellulose and hemicellulose degradation. This study provides insights into the transcriptional regulation of ligninolytic genes in P. ostreatus and sheds light on the molecular basis of lignin degradation, contributing to our understanding of fungal lignocellulolysis and its potential applications in biotechnological processes.
