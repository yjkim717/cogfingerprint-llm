**Abstract**

India faces a critical and widening healthcare workforce deficit, particularly within the cadre of allied health professionals (AHPs). Estimates from 2020 indicate a substantial supply-demand gap of approximately 6.5 million individuals, impacting access to quality patient care across diverse settings. This paper examines the implications of this shortage and proposes a strategic intervention: the urgent establishment of a national-level regulatory council for AHPs. Such a council would facilitate professional standardization through harmonized training programs, rigorously defined curricula, and consistent nomenclature across the sector. This standardization is crucial for ensuring competency, enhancing workforce mobility, and ultimately improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare services. Furthermore, a centralized body can address inconsistencies in professional recognition and contribute to the sustainable growth of the AHP workforce in India, aligning with global best practices in healthcare workforce planning and regulation.
