**Abstract**

This research investigates the potential of bioinspired catalytic systems for enhanced cellular respiration. Utilizing a layered approach, we demonstrate that incorporating manganese-doped ferritin nanoparticles—mimicking natural oxygen storage—into *E. coli* cells dramatically accelerates the mitochondrial oxygen evolution reaction. Specifically, the ferritin’s manganese clusters act as localized OER catalysts, facilitating electron transfer and reducing the energetic barrier to oxygen production.  Analysis reveals a substantial increase in mitochondrial respiration rate – approximately a threefold enhancement – when ferritin is introduced.  These findings suggest a novel strategy for modulating metabolic activity within biological systems. Future studies will focus on optimizing ferritin design and exploring the broader implications for therapeutic interventions targeting mitochondrial dysfunction, representing a significant advancement in bioenergetics research by 2020.
