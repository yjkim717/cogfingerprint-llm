**Abstract**

The prevailing view of aging often posits a uniform biological process; however, accumulating evidence suggests a more nuanced, organ-specific manifestation of age-related decline. This study investigates the heterogeneity of aging in murine models, employing a multi-omic approach to characterize inter-organ variability and delineate temporal gene expression dynamics. Utilizing plasma proteomics alongside transcriptomic data derived from a comprehensive ‘Mouse Aging Cell Atlas’, we identified significant divergence in protein signatures correlating with distinct gene expression profiles across multiple organs. 

Specifically, our analyses revealed consistent, albeit temporally staggered, gene expression patterns associated with established ‘aging hallmarks’ – including mitochondrial dysfunction and altered protein homeostasis – within each organ.  Notably, these hallmarks were not uniformly expressed across the entire organism, demonstrating a compartmentalized aging process.  Correlation analysis between gene expression and plasma protein levels revealed a strong predictive capacity, suggesting a mechanistic link between transcriptional regulation and circulating biomarkers of aging. 

These findings challenge the concept of a singular aging trajectory and underscore the importance of considering organ-specific responses to aging.  The integrated ‘Mouse Aging Cell Atlas’ provides a valuable resource for future investigations into the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving inter-organ aging disparities.  Further research utilizing this platform will be crucial for developing targeted interventions aimed at mitigating age-related decline in specific tissues and ultimately, improving healthy lifespan.
