In 2024, our understanding of DNA repair mechanisms is enhanced by a novel heterogeneous anomalous diffusion model, elucidating the dynamics of DNA double-strand breaks during non-homologous end-joining. By integrating subdiffusive motion and long-range directed movement, this model accurately captures the complexities of radiation-induced damage response. Our analysis reveals that the anomalous diffusion characteristics of DNA double-strand breaks significantly influence repair efficiency, underscoring the importance of considering heterogeneous motion in the study of genomic stability and radiation damage. This framework offers new insights into the intricate processes governing DNA repair.
