Title: Chronocell: A Biophysically-Informed Framework for Inferring Process Time from Single-Cell Transcriptomics Data

Abstract:

The advent of single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and dynamic processes. However, inferring the temporal dynamics underlying cellular state transitions remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce Chronocell, a novel computational framework that leverages single-cell genomics data to infer 'process time', a latent variable capturing the progression of biophysical processes governing cell state transitions. By formulating a probabilistic model that integrates transcriptomic data with a biophysical process model, Chronocell provides a mechanistic understanding of cellular dynamics. Our framework is grounded in the notion that cellular processes, such as differentiation and cell cycle progression, can be described by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations, which are solved to yield a probabilistic representation of process time. We demonstrate the efficacy of Chronocell by applying it to various single-cell datasets, showcasing its ability to accurately reconstruct cellular trajectories and identify key regulatory events. Notably, Chronocell outperforms existing trajectory inference methods by providing a biophysically interpretable representation of cellular dynamics. Furthermore, our framework enables the identification of process time-dependent gene regulatory networks, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms driving cellular state transitions. By bridging the gap between transcriptomics data and biophysical processes, Chronocell offers a powerful tool for elucidating the intricate dynamics of cellular systems, with far-reaching implications for our understanding of development, disease, and cellular reprogramming.
