## Enhanced Peptide Identification in Data-Dependent Acquisition Proteomics via Co-fragmentation Analysis with MSFragger-DDA+

**Abstract:**

Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) remains a cornerstone of quantitative proteomics workflows, yet peptide identification rates, particularly for low-abundance proteins, are often limited by spectral complexity and stochastic sampling. This study introduces MSFragger-DDA+, a novel algorithm designed to significantly improve peptide identification sensitivity within DDA-based workflows by leveraging the principle of co-fragmentation. MSFragger-DDA+ extends the capabilities of the established MSFragger search engine to incorporate analysis of co-fragmented ions – shared fragment ions arising from peptides co-isolated within a full isolation window – to enhance confidence in peptide identifications. 

Traditional DDA approaches focus primarily on single peptide spectral matches, potentially overlooking instances where multiple peptides, co-isolated due to narrow isolation window settings, share common fragment ions. MSFragger-DDA+ explicitly models these co-fragmentation events during database searching, significantly increasing the probability of identifying peptides that would otherwise be missed due to spectral interference or low signal intensity. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate that MSFragger-DDA+ recovers a greater proportion of peptides, particularly those exhibiting low abundance, compared to standard MSFragger DDA searches. This advancement holds considerable promise for improving the depth and comprehensiveness of proteomic analyses, facilitating more accurate quantification and a deeper understanding of complex biological systems. Further development will focus on optimizing computational efficiency and expanding applicability to diverse proteomic datasets.
