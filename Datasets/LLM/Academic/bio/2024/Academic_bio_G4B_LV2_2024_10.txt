**Abstract**

The identification of peptides within complex proteomics datasets remains a significant challenge, particularly when utilizing data-dependent acquisition (DDA) approaches.  Current strategies often struggle with the prevalence of co-fragmentation events, leading to reduced sensitivity and increased false discovery rates. This study introduces MSFragger-DDA+, an enhanced peptide identification pipeline designed to address these limitations.  MSFragger-DDA+ leverages a critical optimization: the implementation of a ‘full isolation window’ during mass spectrometry acquisition. This technique allows for the isolation and subsequent analysis of precursor ions exhibiting spectral interferences, minimizing the impact of co-fragmentation on subsequent peptide identification. 

Furthermore, the algorithm incorporates a robust filtering strategy, dynamically adjusting to the characteristics of the acquired data.  Preliminary analyses demonstrate a marked improvement in peptide identification sensitivity compared to conventional DDA workflows, particularly when utilizing wide-window acquisition strategies.  The integration of full isolation window acquisition and intelligent filtering within MSFragger-DDA+ represents a significant advancement towards more reliable and sensitive peptide identification in modern proteomics research.  Future work will focus on validating these findings across diverse proteomic samples and exploring computational refinements.
