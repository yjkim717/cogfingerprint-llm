**Title:** Integrating High-Resolution Microclimate Modelling into Conservation Biogeography for Climate-Resilient Management

**Abstract:**

In 2024, the accelerating pace of anthropogenic climate change necessitates a paradigm shift in conservation biogeography, moving from coarse-scale climate envelopes to the explicit integration of fine-scale microclimatic processes. This review synthesizes recent advances in microclimate ecology to argue that terrestrial microrefugia—local sites decoupled from regional macroclimate—are critical, yet underutilized, components in climate change management strategies. We first establish a conceptual framework linking microtopographic and biogenic drivers (e.g., canopy cover, rocky outcrops) to the creation of stable microclimates that buffer resident biota. Subsequently, we highlight methodological breakthroughs, particularly the coupling of high-resolution remote sensing (LiDAR, thermal imaging) with mechanistic microclimate models, which now allow for the accurate prediction of below-canopy temperatures and soil moisture at ecologically relevant scales (<100 m). These models are instrumental in systematically identifying and mapping potential microrefugia across landscapes. We then critically evaluate management applications, demonstrating how this spatially explicit knowledge can inform targeted interventions such as assisted migration to pre-identified refugia, silvicultural practices designed to maintain cool-air drainage, and the strategic design of ecological corridors that connect macro- and microrefugia. We conclude that the operationalization of microclimate science is paramount for developing proactive, resilient conservation frameworks capable of safeguarding biodiversity in an era of rapid environmental change.
