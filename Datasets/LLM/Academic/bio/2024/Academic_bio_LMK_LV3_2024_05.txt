Title: Unraveling the Evolutionary Dynamics of HPAI A(H5Nx) Viruses in Europe: A Phylodynamic Analysis

Abstract:
The ongoing avian influenza epidemic in Europe, driven by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5Nx) viruses, poses significant threats to animal and public health. To elucidate the spatiotemporal patterns of virus diffusion and evolution, we conducted a comprehensive phylodynamic analysis of 1,956 European HPAI A(H5Nx) virus genomes isolated during the 2020-2022 epidemic waves. Our results reveal a complex evolutionary landscape, characterized by multiple introductions of distinct viral clades and extensive reassortment events. The analysis highlights the critical role of migratory birds and poultry trade in shaping the virus's dispersal dynamics. Furthermore, our findings underscore the importance of enhanced surveillance and coordinated control measures to mitigate the risk of HPAI A(H5Nx) virus transmission to humans. This study provides valuable insights into the evolutionary dynamics of HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses, informing evidence-based public health strategies for the management of future outbreaks in 2024 and beyond.
