**Abstract**

The efficient catalysis of metabolic pathways represents a critical challenge in synthetic biology. This study explores the potential of strategically incorporating dopant metals to modulate enzymatic activity within engineered biological systems. We hypothesize that controlled co-doping of transition metals can selectively activate and stabilize key catalytic sites within metalloenzymes. Utilizing a model system employing a synthetic metalloenzyme analogous to cytochrome c oxidase, we demonstrate that cobalt co-doping of iridium oxide (IrOx) significantly enhances reaction kinetics. Spectroscopic analysis reveals a localized restructuring of the IrOx active site, suggesting cobalt’s role in promoting favorable electronic interactions. These findings propose a novel strategy – mimicking ‘co-doping’ – to engineer enhanced biocatalytic performance, thereby advancing the design of more efficient and robust biological reaction networks. Future research will focus on elucidating the precise mechanistic details and exploring broader applications within synthetic metabolic pathways.
