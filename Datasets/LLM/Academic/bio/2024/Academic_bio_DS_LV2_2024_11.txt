**Title:** Multi-Source Proteomic Profiling Identifies Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC) as a Pan-Biofluid Biomarker for the Early Detection of Parkinson’s Disease

**Abstract:**

The presynaptic pathological aggregation of alpha-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease (PD) begins years, if not decades, before the onset of characteristic motor symptoms, creating a critical need for robust and accessible biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been a primary focus for proteomic discovery, its invasive collection limits widespread clinical application. This study employed a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic workflow to conduct a comprehensive, multi-compartmental analysis of biofluids from a well-characterized cohort, including prodromal and early-stage PD patients and matched healthy controls. Our primary objective was to identify and validate protein signatures that are consistently dysregulated across CSF, plasma, and urine, thereby enhancing their translational potential. Our analysis revealed a statistically significant (p < 0.001, FDR-corrected) and reproducible upregulation of Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC) in all three biofluid matrices in the PD cohort. DDC, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of L-DOPA to dopamine, was corroborated by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) for absolute quantification, confirming its substantial elevation. Furthermore, integrative bioinformatic analysis, including pathway enrichment and protein-protein interaction networks, identified a co-regulated panel of proteins involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking, lysosomal function, and inflammatory response, which synergistically improved diagnostic classification. The consistent presence of the DDC signature across central (CSF) and peripheral (plasma, urine) compartments suggests a systemic reflection of underlying nigrostriatal pathology. We propose that DDC, in conjunction with its associated protein panel, constitutes a highly promising biomarker for the early detection of PD, with plasma and urine offering a viable pathway for the development of a minimally invasive diagnostic assay to facilitate pre-motor diagnosis and patient stratification for future neuroprotective trials.
