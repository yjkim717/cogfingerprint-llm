**Abstract**

Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant clinical challenge, necessitating continued investigation into novel therapeutic strategies. This review synthesizes current knowledge regarding the role of somatostatin (SST) in CRC progression, specifically examining its antitumor mechanisms and associated signaling pathways.  Emerging evidence suggests that SST exerts its effects not solely through direct cell growth inhibition, but also by modulating the complex tumor microenvironment (TME).  We explore the interplay between SST signaling and key downstream effectors, including the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase/protein kinase B (MAPK/ERK/Akt) pathway, frequently dysregulated in CRC. 

Specifically, this work highlights the potential of SST to influence TME dynamics, impacting factors such as angiogenesis and immune cell infiltration. Recent studies utilizing gep-net (a SST receptor agonist) have demonstrated promising preclinical results, suggesting a targeted approach to CRC treatment. However, the precise mechanisms by which SST influences MAPK/ERK/Akt signaling within the CRC TME remain incompletely elucidated.  Future research should prioritize a deeper understanding of these interactions, potentially identifying biomarkers predictive of SST responsiveness and informing the development of combination therapies.  Further investigation into the role of SST in modulating the tumor microenvironment represents a critical area for advancing CRC treatment strategies.
