**Abstract**

The ongoing circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses, specifically those belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, presents a significant and evolving threat to global poultry health and human safety. This study investigates the recent evolutionary trajectory of these viruses across European populations, employing comprehensive genomic surveillance data collected through 2023 and early 2024. Phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses reveal complex transmission dynamics, characterized by both sustained regional spread and sporadic intercontinental introductions. We identify evidence of recurrent reassortment events, contributing to substantial genetic diversity and the emergence of novel genotypes exhibiting adaptation to diverse avian host species. The observed evolutionary patterns underscore the challenges associated with predicting future viral evolution and geographic expansion. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for informing proactive risk mitigation strategies, including improved surveillance networks, targeted vaccine development, and the implementation of effective biosecurity protocols to minimize the impact of this rapidly evolving pathogen.
