**Abstract**

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by radiation represent a significant challenge to genome stability, often necessitating non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair. Current models frequently simplify the complex dynamics of this process, overlooking the potential for rare, long-range movements that can perturb repair pathways. This study proposes a novel stochastic model to investigate the heterogeneous dynamics of DSB repair during NHEJ, specifically incorporating features reminiscent of fractional Brownian motion to account for anomalous diffusion behavior.  We hypothesize that these infrequent, substantial movements contribute to the formation of dicentric chromosome lesions, representing a deviation from standard repair efficiency.  By simulating DSB progression under varying levels of these anomalous movements, we aim to quantify their impact on lesion persistence and the overall fidelity of NHEJ.  The resulting framework provides a refined understanding of DSB repair and offers predictive insights into genomic consequences following radiation exposure, with implications for radiation biology and therapeutic development (2024).
