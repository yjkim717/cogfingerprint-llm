**Abstract**

Emerging evidence suggests Alzheimer’s disease represents a heterogeneous disorder, prompting investigation into distinct pathological subtypes. Utilizing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics, this study identified five novel molecular subtypes of Alzheimer’s disease in 2024. Analysis revealed significant divergence in protein signatures, indicative of differing underlying molecular processes – including altered amyloid-beta metabolism and neuroinflammation – within each subtype. Critically, these subtypes exhibited nuanced associations with established genetic risk factors, such as *APOE4* allele status.  These findings demonstrate that CSF proteomics can effectively delineate clinically distinct Alzheimer’s disease populations.  The identification of these molecular subtypes holds substantial promise for stratification of disease progression and informs the development of targeted therapeutic interventions and personalized medicine strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and shifting towards a more precise diagnostic framework.
