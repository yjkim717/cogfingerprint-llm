Title: Unveiling Molecular Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease: Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomics Reveals Distinct Subtypes with Implications for Personalized Medicine

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by heterogeneous clinical manifestations and progression rates. Recent advancements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics have enabled the identification of molecular subtypes underlying this heterogeneity. Through a comprehensive analysis of CSF proteomes, we classified AD into five distinct molecular subtypes, each exhibiting unique genetic risk profiles and clinical outcomes. Our findings demonstrate that these subtypes are associated with differential expression of proteins involved in key pathological processes, including amyloidogenesis, neuroinflammation, and synaptic degeneration. The identification of these molecular subtypes has significant implications for personalized medicine, enabling tailored therapeutic strategies and improved patient stratification in clinical trials. This study underscores the potential of CSF proteomics to transform our understanding of AD heterogeneity and guide the development of targeted interventions, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.
