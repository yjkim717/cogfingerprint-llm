The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a critical challenge in advancing proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers for sustainable hydrogen production. In this study, we demonstrate that cobalt-doped SrIrO3 perovskites exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance in acidic media, significantly outperforming conventional IrO2 benchmarks. Through systematic spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses, we elucidate that Co doping induces electronic structure modulation, which activates surface lattice oxygen participation and optimizes the binding energy of oxygenated intermediates. This synergistic effect not only enhances intrinsic OER activity but also improves catalyst durability under operating conditions. Our findings establish Co-doped SrIrO3 as a promising alternative to noble metal catalysts, providing fundamental insights into the design of high-performance electrocatalysts through strategic cation substitution in perovskite oxides for renewable energy conversion technologies.
