**Abstract**

The reconstruction of developmental or dynamic cellular processes from single-cell transcriptomic data has traditionally relied on pseudotime ordering, a method that inherently lacks mechanistic grounding.  This study presents Chronocell, a novel computational framework designed to directly infer process time from single-cell genomic profiles, leveraging trajectory inference techniques coupled with a biophysical model. Chronocell moves beyond correlative approaches by integrating transcriptional dynamics with hypothesized biophysical constraints, specifically considering the energetic costs and regulatory networks associated with cell state transitions. 

Our method employs a variational autoencoder architecture to learn latent representations of single-cell states, subsequently utilizing a constrained trajectory algorithm to estimate the temporal ordering of cells. Crucially, we incorporate a biophysical model – parameterized by known metabolic pathways and regulatory interactions – to penalize trajectories that violate thermodynamic principles or established biological constraints. This integration allows for a more robust and physically plausible reconstruction of cellular dynamics. 

Preliminary results demonstrate Chronocell’s capacity to accurately infer process time in simulated datasets, exhibiting improved fidelity compared to conventional pseudotime methods.  We further report initial applications to [mention a specific dataset type, e.g., hematopoietic differentiation], highlighting the potential of Chronocell to provide a deeper understanding of cellular progression and identify key regulatory events. Future work will focus on expanding the biophysical model and validating Chronocell’s performance across diverse biological systems.
