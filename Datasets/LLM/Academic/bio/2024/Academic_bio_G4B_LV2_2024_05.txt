**Abstract: Genomic Surveillance Reveals Complex Transmission Dynamics of H5Nx Avian Influenza Viruses in Europe**

The ongoing European Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreak, driven by avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses, presents a significant challenge to biosecurity and animal health. This study utilized genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of circulating H5Nx viruses, specifically clade 2.3.4.4b, to characterize evolving transmission dynamics and assess genetic diversity across Europe during 2023-2024. Analysis of over 200 complete viral genomes revealed substantial genetic heterogeneity within the clade, exhibiting rapid evolution and evidence of multiple independent lineages. Notably, the emergence of the H5Nx variant, designated H5nx, demonstrated an increased propensity for sustained transmission, correlating with observed epidemic waves. 

Our findings underscore the limitations of relying solely on traditional epidemiological models to predict viral spread. The observed genomic plasticity of H5Nx viruses, coupled with the rapid accumulation of mutations, suggests a complex interplay between viral adaptation, host susceptibility, and environmental factors. Continued comprehensive genomic surveillance, coupled with advanced predictive modeling incorporating viral evolution, is crucial for implementing targeted mitigation strategies and minimizing the socio-economic impact of future HPAI outbreaks. Further research is warranted to elucidate the specific mutations driving enhanced transmissibility within this clade.
