**Abstract**

Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant clinical challenge, necessitating continued investigation into novel therapeutic strategies. This study reviews the emerging role of somatostatin (sst) signaling in modulating CRC progression and exhibiting antitumor activity. Specifically, we explore the intricate interplay between sst receptors and downstream signaling cascades, with a particular emphasis on the MAPK/ERK/Akt pathway â€“ a core regulator of cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. Recent preclinical evidence suggests that sst administration can induce apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis within CRC cell lines, potentially mediated by attenuation of Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, the gep-net system, a modified sst analogue, demonstrates enhanced receptor selectivity and improved therapeutic efficacy *in vitro*.  Understanding the precise mechanisms by which sst impacts these key pathways offers potential avenues for targeted intervention. Future research should focus on elucidating the role of specific sst subtypes (sst1-sst5) and their differential impact on CRC microenvironment interactions, ultimately informing the development of sst-based combination therapies.
