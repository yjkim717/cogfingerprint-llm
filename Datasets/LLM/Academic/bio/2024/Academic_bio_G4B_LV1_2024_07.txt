**Abstract**

Microclimate, defined as localized variations in environmental conditions, increasingly recognized as a critical driver of ecological patterns and responses, warrants focused investigation within the broader context of biodiversity conservation. This review synthesizes recent advances in microclimate ecology and its implications for biogeographic distribution and ecosystem management strategies. Traditional ecological approaches often operate at coarser spatial scales, obscuring the nuanced effects of microclimatic heterogeneity on species physiology, behavior, and community assembly.  We examine how modelling techniques, incorporating high-resolution microclimate data, are facilitating a more precise understanding of species niche requirements and predicting range shifts in response to climate change. 

Specifically, this work highlights the utility of agent-based modelling and statistical downscaling to translate regional climate projections into localized microclimatic forecasts. Furthermore, we discuss the application of these models in informing conservation prioritization, particularly concerning habitat fragmentation and the establishment of climate refugia.  Future research should prioritize the integration of physiological data with microclimate modelling to refine species vulnerability assessments.  Ultimately, a deeper comprehension of microclimate ecology is essential for developing effective, targeted conservation interventions in a rapidly changing world.
