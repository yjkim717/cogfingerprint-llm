Our study introduces a heterogeneous anomalous diffusion framework to elucidate the misrepair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). By integrating subdiffusive fractional Brownian motion with rare, long-range movements, we model the spatiotemporal dynamics of DSB ends in the crowded nuclear environment. This approach reveals that transient confinement, punctuated by directed relocations, increases the probability of incorrect end-joining. Such misrepair events culminate in the formation of dicentric chromosome lesions, a hallmark of genomic instability. Our simulations, validated against live-cell imaging data from 2024, demonstrate that this kinetic heterogeneity is a critical determinant of chromosomal translocations and radiation-induced carcinogenesis. These findings establish a mechanistic link between nuclear architecture, DSB mobility, and persistent genomic rearrangements, offering predictive insights for radioprotection strategies.
