**Abstract:**

Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) presents a significant clinical challenge, prompting investigation into novel therapeutic strategies. This review examines the multifaceted role of somatostatin (SST) and its analogues in CRC, focusing on modulation of key signaling pathways and interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Evidence suggests SST can attenuate CRC progression by inhibiting MAPK/ERK/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascades, thereby impacting cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, SST’s demonstrated antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties, alongside emerging data regarding its influence on the gut microbiome and modulation of immune cell activity within the tumor microenvironment, position it as a promising therapeutic target. Further research exploring optimized SST analogues and combination therapies is warranted to fully realize its clinical potential in CRC management.
