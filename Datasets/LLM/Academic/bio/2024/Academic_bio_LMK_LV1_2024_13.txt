Title: Integrating Spatial Morphoproteomics and Graph Neural Networks for Enhanced Disease Status Prediction in Human B-Cell Follicles

Abstract:
The advent of multiplex imaging has revolutionized single-cell analysis, enabling the simultaneous quantification of multiple cellular markers and morphological features. However, leveraging this complex data for disease-status prediction remains a significant challenge. In response, we present SNOWFLAKE+, an advanced graph neural network (GNN) pipeline that integrates spatial morphoproteomics with multiplex cell expression data to predict disease status in human B-cell follicles. By constructing a multiplex graph that captures both cellular expression profiles and spatial morphological features, SNOWFLAKE+ facilitates the learning of nuanced, context-dependent representations of cellular behavior. Our results demonstrate that SNOWFLAKE+ outperforms existing methods in predicting disease status, achieving an average accuracy of 92.4% on a held-out test dataset. The integration of spatial morphoproteomics and GNNs offers a powerful new paradigm for analyzing complex biological systems, with significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of immune-related disorders.
