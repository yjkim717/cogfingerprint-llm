**Abstract**

*Pleurotus ostreatus*, commonly known as the oyster mushroom, is rapidly emerging as a valuable model organism within mushroom science, driven by significant progress in molecular genetics and high-throughput genome sequencing technologies. This review examines the burgeoning utility of *P. ostreatus* as a research platform, contrasting its advantages with established fungal models. Recent advancements in CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing and whole-genome sequencing have facilitated detailed investigations into fungal development, metabolism, and stress response pathways.  Specifically, *P. ostreatus* offers a comparatively simpler genome architecture and faster growth rate, streamlining experimental design and data acquisition.  Furthermore, its established cultivation techniques and diverse genetic diversity present opportunities for functional genomics studies and trait mapping.  As research continues to refine techniques for manipulating and analyzing *P. ostreatus*’s genome, this “model mushroom” promises to yield substantial insights applicable to broader fungal biology and potentially inform biotechnological applications.
