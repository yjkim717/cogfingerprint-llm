In proteomic data analysis, conventional database search algorithms for peptide identification from tandem mass spectrometry data exhibit limited sensitivity when analyzing complex samples, primarily due to the prevalent yet underdetected phenomenon of co-fragmentation. This occurs when multiple precursor ions within an isolation window are fragmented simultaneously, generating chimeric spectra that confound standard search methodologies. To address this critical bottleneck, we introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a novel computational framework that implements a comprehensive full isolation window search strategy. Our method systematically interrogates all potential peptide combinations within a specified precursor mass tolerance, thereby enabling the confident identification of co-fragmented peptides that are typically discarded as unassigned spectra. Benchmarking on complex biological datasets demonstrates that MSFragger-DDA+ significantly increases peptide and protein identification rates by over 20% compared to state-of-the-art tools, without compromising the stringent control of the false discovery rate at 1%. This enhanced sensitivity, achieved through a rigorous probabilistic model for multi-peptide spectrum assignment, provides a deeper and more accurate characterization of proteomes, advancing the analytical capabilities of data-dependent acquisition mass spectrometry in systems biology research.
