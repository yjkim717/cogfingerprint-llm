**Abstract**  
Microclimate science has emerged as a pivotal interdisciplinary domain, fundamentally reshaping ecological and biogeographic paradigms in an era of accelerating climate change. By elucidating fine-scale organism-environment interactions—spanning thermal refugia, moisture gradients, and light regimes—this field bridges critical gaps between macroclimatic projections and species responses. Recent methodological innovations, including high-resolution sensor networks, LiDAR, and mechanistic niche models, have enabled unprecedented quantification of microclimatic heterogeneity across landscapes. These advances reveal how microrefugia buffer biodiversity against climatic extremes, directly informing conservation strategies such as assisted migration and habitat corridor design.  

In 2024, the integration of machine learning with biophysical models has further enhanced predictive accuracy, uncovering non-linear feedbacks between vegetation structure and subsurface microclimates. Concurrently, studies demonstrate that microtopographic variability mediates range shifts in thermally sensitive taxa, challenging coarse-scale distribution forecasts. However, critical knowledge gaps persist, particularly regarding soil-plant-atmosphere feedbacks in tropical canopies and anthropogenic microclimate modification in urban ecosystems. Future research must prioritize multi-scale monitoring frameworks and dynamic conservation planning to address escalating extinction risks. Ultimately, microclimate ecology not only refines climate resilience projections but also provides actionable insights for evidence-based ecosystem management in the Anthropocene.
