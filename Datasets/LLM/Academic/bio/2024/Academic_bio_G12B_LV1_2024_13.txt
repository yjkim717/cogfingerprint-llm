**Abstract:**

Spatial profiling techniques, particularly multiplex imaging, are revolutionizing our understanding of tissue organization and cellular interactions in health and disease. However, extracting meaningful biological insights from the high-dimensional data generated by these methods remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a novel computational framework, termed Spatial Interaction Network Decoding (SIND), designed to predict disease phenotypes directly from multiplexed tissue images by leveraging graph neural network (GNN) architectures. SIND constructs a spatial interaction network representing cells as nodes and their morphological and protein expression relationships as edges, thereby explicitly modeling the immune microarchitecture.  Our approach moves beyond traditional feature extraction by learning complex, non-linear relationships between cellular spatial morphology, marker expression, and disease status. Initial validation using a cohort of [mention specific disease/tissue type, e.g., human lung cancer samples] demonstrates that SIND significantly outperforms established machine learning methods in predicting disease status (AUC increase of X%, p < 0.05).  Furthermore, analysis of the learned interaction networks reveals the emergence of disease-relevant motifs – recurrent cellular groupings and interaction patterns – that are not readily apparent through conventional analysis.  Future work will focus on extending SIND to incorporate single-cell transcriptomics data, exploring its applicability across diverse disease contexts, and developing methods for causal inference within these spatial interaction networks to identify potential therapeutic targets.  This work underscores the power of GNNs in unlocking the predictive and mechanistic potential of multiplex imaging data, facilitating a deeper understanding of disease pathogenesis.
