Title: Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity in Cobalt-Doped SrIrO3 for Oxygen Evolution Reaction: A Mechanistic Insight

Abstract:
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial process in various electrochemical applications, including water splitting and fuel cells. Recent advancements in electrocatalyst design have led to the development of Co-doped SrIrO3, which exhibits significantly enhanced OER activity. Our study elucidates the underlying mechanisms behind this improvement, revealing that Co-doping activates surface lattice oxygen and optimizes the binding energy of IrOx adsorbates. This synergistic effect enables SrIrO3 to achieve a substantial increase in electrocatalytic activity. Through a combination of density functional theory calculations and experimental analyses, we demonstrate that the Co-doping induced modulation of the electronic structure and surface chemistry of SrIrO3 is responsible for the enhanced OER performance. These findings provide valuable insights into the design of efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications, with potential implications for the development of next-generation electrochemical devices in 2024 and beyond.
