**Abstract**

Single-cell genomic analyses increasingly rely on trajectory inference to understand cellular dynamics, yet conventional pseudotime ordering often lacks robust biological grounding. This study introduces Chronocell, a novel methodology integrating biophysical modeling with single-cell data to precisely estimate process time. Chronocell leverages a mechanochemical model to constrain trajectory inference, moving beyond purely computational approaches and providing a physically informed representation of cellular progression. We demonstrate Chronocell’s efficacy through comparative analyses against established pseudotime algorithms on publicly available datasets, revealing improved alignment with known biological pathways. Furthermore, simulations utilizing synthetic single-cell transcriptomic data showcase Chronocell’s ability to accurately capture process time shifts induced by defined biophysical perturbations. These findings suggest Chronocell offers a valuable tool for researchers seeking to interpret single-cell genomic data with enhanced biological fidelity and mechanistic insight, paving the way for more nuanced understandings of cellular differentiation and disease progression.
