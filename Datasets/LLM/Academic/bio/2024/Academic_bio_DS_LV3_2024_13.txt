The burgeoning field of spatial systems biology necessitates computational frameworks capable of deciphering the complex interplay between cellular phenotype and tissue architecture. Here, we introduce SNOWFLAKE, a novel analytical platform that integrates high-plex multiplex imaging data with graph neural networks (GNNs) to perform spatial morphoproteomic analysis. By representing tissue sections as cellular graphs, our model quantifies cell-cell interactions and spatial organization within distinct immune microenvironments. Applied to a COVID-19 cohort, SNOWFLAKE demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for disease severity compared to conventional histopathological or single-cell approaches. Crucially, the GNN's interpretability revealed disease-relevant motifs, identifying unique immune microarchitectural signatures within lymphoid follicles that are indicative of dysregulated humoral responses. These findings underscore the critical role of spatial context in immunopathology and establish SNOWFLAKE as a robust tool for the discovery of prognostic spatial biomarkers, with broad applicability to cancer and autoimmune disease research.
