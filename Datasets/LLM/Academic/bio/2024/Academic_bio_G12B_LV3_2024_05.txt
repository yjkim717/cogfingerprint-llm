**Abstract**

Recent analysis of 1,956 European highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5Nx) virus genomes (collected through 2023) demonstrates a concerning trend of escalating genetic diversity within the circulating clade 2.3.4.4b. This study highlights the prevalence of reassortment events, suggesting complex genetic exchange contributing to viral adaptation. Notably, the emergence of avian genotypes specifically adapted to gull populations represents a novel evolutionary trajectory potentially facilitating wider geographic dissemination. These findings underscore the increasing endemicity of HPAI in Europe and pose significant challenges for predictive modeling of future viral evolution, necessitating enhanced surveillance and revised mitigation strategies to safeguard poultry health and public safety.
