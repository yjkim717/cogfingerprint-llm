Abstract: 
This study leverages spatial morphoproteomics and graph neural networks to elucidate the intricate immune microarchitecture of COVID-19. Utilizing the SNOWFLAKE framework, we analyzed multiplex imaging data from human B-cell follicles, integrating cell expression profiles and morphological features. Our results demonstrate that SNOWFLAKE outperforms conventional machine learning approaches in predicting disease status. By uncovering the complex spatial interactions governing immune responses, this research advances our understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis and informs the development of targeted therapeutic strategies, paving the way for precision medicine interventions in 2024 and beyond.
