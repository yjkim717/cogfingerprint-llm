**Abstract**

Inferring developmental trajectories from single-cell genomic data remains a significant challenge, with traditional methods like pseudotime analysis often relying on heuristic assumptions and failing to capture underlying biological mechanisms. This paper introduces Chronocell, a novel computational framework designed to directly estimate process time within single-cell transcriptomes using a biophysical modeling approach. Chronocell leverages a user-defined biophysical model – representing cellular differentiation processes – to constrain trajectory inference and move beyond purely data-driven estimations. 

Our method incorporates process time as a key parameter within trajectory inference algorithms, allowing for a more robust and biologically interpretable reconstruction of cell state transitions. We demonstrate through simulations and preliminary data analysis that Chronocell significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of trajectory assignments compared to conventional pseudotime methods. Specifically, we quantify the reduction in inferred process time variance and enhance the correlation with known biological events. This approach offers a critical advancement towards elucidating the temporal dynamics of cellular differentiation, providing a foundation for integrating single-cell genomics with biophysical principles and ultimately, generating more nuanced and mechanistic understandings of developmental biology.  Future work will focus on expanding model applicability and incorporating experimental validation.
