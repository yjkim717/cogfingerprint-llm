**Abstract**

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent severe genomic damage necessitating robust repair mechanisms. While Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) is a primary DSB repair pathway, its dynamics remain incompletely understood, particularly concerning infrequent, long-range chromatin movements and the resulting propensity for misrepair events leading to dicentric chromosome lesions. Traditional diffusion models often fail to adequately describe the observed complex behavior. Here, we propose a novel framework incorporating heterogeneous anomalous diffusion to model DSB repair dynamics. This model posits that DSB repair factors exhibit spatially variable diffusion coefficients, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of chromatin structure and the influence of regulatory proteins. Specifically, we suggest that certain repair factors may undergo periods of confined diffusion within dense chromatin regions interspersed with rare, long-range translocation events, consistent with anomalous diffusion behavior. This framework provides a mechanistic explanation for the sporadic observation of extended DSB movements and the elevated risk of error-prone NHEJ. Simulations based on this heterogeneous anomalous diffusion model demonstrate improved fidelity in replicating experimental observations of DSB repair trajectories compared to conventional Brownian motion models.  Further investigation into the spatiotemporal regulation of DSB repair factors is warranted to refine and validate this model's predictive power in mitigating genomic instability.
