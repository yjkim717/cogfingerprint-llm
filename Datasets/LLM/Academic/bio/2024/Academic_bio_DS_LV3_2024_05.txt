Of particular concern is the global dissemination of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5Nx) viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b, which have demonstrated an unprecedented capacity for rapid geographical expansion and host range diversification. This study investigates the evolutionary mechanisms underpinning the sustained circulation and genetic diversification of these viruses within European wild bird populations since their initial incursion. Through comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and genomic surveillance of isolates collected between 2020 and 2024, we demonstrate that these viruses are undergoing frequent and complex genetic reassortment with co-circulating low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses. This continuous reassortment process is a primary driver of the high genetic diversity observed, leading to the emergence of numerous novel genotypes. Crucially, our findings indicate that this dynamic reassortment, coupled with the acquisition of adaptive mutations affecting viral properties such as receptor binding and environmental persistence, has facilitated a shift from episodic incursions to endemic circulation within wild avifauna. This endemic establishment creates a persistent reservoir, fueling unpredictable evolutionary trends and complicating predictive risk assessment. The expanding host range, now encompassing a wide array of wild bird species and an increasing number of mammalian cases, underscores the significant and evolving threat these viruses pose to both animal and human health. Our results highlight the critical need for intensified, coordinated genomic surveillance to monitor this fluid genetic landscape and inform preemptive public and animal health interventions.
