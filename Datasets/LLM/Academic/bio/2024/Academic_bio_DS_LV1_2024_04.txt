**Advancements in Artificial Intelligence for the Genomic Characterization and Therapeutic Targeting of Monogenic Disorders**

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genomics is catalyzing a paradigm shift in the diagnosis and treatment of monogenic disorders. While next-generation sequencing has exponentially increased the volume of genetic data, the functional interpretation of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and the development of targeted therapies remain significant bottlenecks. This review synthesizes recent advancements from 2023-2024, focusing on the application of sophisticated machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) architectures to these challenges. We first delineate how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are surpassing traditional bioinformatic pipelines in the prioritization of pathogenic non-coding variants and the prediction of splice-altering mutations from primary sequence data. Subsequently, we examine the transformative role of geometric deep learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs) in rational drug design. These models leverage three-dimensional protein structures, perturbed by genetic lesions, to expedite the *in silico* screening of small molecules and the *de novo* generation of candidate compounds targeting previously "undruggable" proteins. Finally, we critically assess the integration of multi-omics data—including transcriptomics and proteomics—within graph neural networks to stratify patient populations and advance genotype-specific, precision therapeutic strategies. We conclude that the principal challenge is no longer algorithmic capability but the curation of high-quality, ethically-sourced, and clinically-annotated datasets required to train these models, underscoring a pressing need for interdisciplinary collaboration between computational biologists and clinical geneticists.
