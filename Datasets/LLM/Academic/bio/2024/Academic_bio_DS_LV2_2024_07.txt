**Abstract**

Microclimate science has emerged as a critical discipline for elucidating the complex interplay between fine-scale atmospheric conditions and ecological processes. This review synthesizes recent advances in microclimate ecology and biogeography, emphasizing its pivotal role in addressing the multifaceted challenges of anthropogenic climate change. We posit that a mechanistic understanding of microclimatic heterogeneity is fundamental to predicting species distributions, physiological tolerances, and biotic interactions at ecologically relevant scales. A central theme explored is the concept of microrefugia—localized sites decoupled from regional macroclimate—which are increasingly recognized as vital buffers against climate change, potentially enhancing species persistence and ecosystem resilience. We critically evaluate the methodological evolution in this field, highlighting the integration of high-resolution remote sensing, spatially explicit in-situ sensor networks, and sophisticated microclimate modelling techniques. These tools now enable the downscaling of macroclimate projections to simulate biologically meaningful environmental parameters, such as near-ground temperatures and soil moisture regimes. Furthermore, we discuss the translation of this knowledge into applied conservation and ecosystem management, including the strategic identification and protection of microrefugia, assisted migration, and the design of climate-smart landscapes. We conclude that bridging the macro–microclimate gap is not merely a methodological refinement but a conceptual necessity for developing robust, predictive frameworks in 21st-century ecology and biogeography, ultimately informing effective climate adaptation strategies.
