Title: Unveiling Somatostatin's Therapeutic Potential in Colorectal Cancer: A Review of Antitumor Mechanisms and Tumor Microenvironment Modulation

Abstract:
Colorectal cancer remains a significant challenge in oncology, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. Recent research has underscored the multifaceted role of somatostatin in modulating the gastrointestinal tumor microenvironment. This review synthesizes current understanding of somatostatin's antitumor effects in colorectal cancer, elucidating its direct and indirect mechanisms of action. By binding to somatostatin receptors, this peptide hormone exerts antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic, and pro-apoptotic effects, thereby inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. Moreover, somatostatin modulates the tumor microenvironment by regulating immune responses and suppressing pro-tumorigenic signaling pathways. As the therapeutic landscape for colorectal cancer continues to evolve, the potential of somatostatin analogs as adjunct therapies is gaining attention. This review highlights the state-of-the-art evidence supporting somatostatin's therapeutic applications in colorectal cancer, providing a foundation for future clinical investigations.
