**Abstract**

Recent years have witnessed a surge in research leveraging *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom) as a model system, driven by advances in molecular genetics and high-throughput sequencing technologies. This review synthesizes current knowledge regarding the genomic landscape of *P. ostreatus*, highlighting its emerging utility beyond traditional mycology. The completed genome sequencing project, coupled with the refinement of genetic techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing and targeted mutagenesis, has enabled unprecedented investigation into fundamental biological processes. We explore how these tools are facilitating detailed analyses of developmental biology, metabolic pathways (particularly polysaccharide biosynthesis), and stress responses within *P. ostreatus*. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of this fungal model to inform research in material sciences, given its capacity for producing valuable biomolecules and sustainable materials. This review posits that *P. ostreatus*, with its relatively simple morphology and amenability to genetic manipulation, offers a compelling alternative to more complex eukaryotic systems for addressing a broad spectrum of biological and biotechnological questions, solidifying its position as a key organism for future research endeavors in 2024 and beyond.
