In this 2024 study, we delineate five distinct molecular subtypes of Alzheimer's disease through comprehensive cerebrospinal fluid proteomic profiling. Each subtype demonstrates unique genetic risk profiles, divergent clinical progression trajectories, and characteristic patterns of regional brain atrophy. Our integrative analysis reveals subtype-specific associations with amyloid-beta processing, tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and synaptic integrity pathways. These findings fundamentally challenge the prevailing model of Alzheimer's disease as a single-pathophysiology entity and provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the substantial heterogeneity in treatment response observed across clinical trials. The identification of these molecularly defined subgroups enables stratification of patients based on their underlying biological drivers rather than solely clinical presentation. This work establishes a critical foundation for developing personalized therapeutic strategies and precision medicine approaches, potentially revolutionizing clinical trial design and accelerating the development of effective, targeted interventions for this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.
