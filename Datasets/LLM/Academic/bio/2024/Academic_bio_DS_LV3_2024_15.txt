In this comprehensive 2024 review, we systematically evaluate the multifaceted antitumor mechanisms of somatostatin and its synthetic analogues in colorectal cancer pathogenesis. Through rigorous analysis of current literature, we demonstrate that somatostatin receptor (sst) activation orchestrates both direct and indirect tumor-suppressive effects via sophisticated signaling network modulation. Our findings reveal that sst analogues exert potent inhibitory control over the MAPK/ERK/AKT cascade, effectively disrupting proliferative signaling while simultaneously inducing cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, we establish compelling evidence for somatostatin-mediated interference with the Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway, thereby impeding critical processes in colorectal carcinogenesis including epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell maintenance. The indirect mechanisms encompass anti-angiogenic effects through vascular endothelial growth factor suppression and immunomodulatory actions via cytokine regulation. However, our critical assessment identifies significant limitations in monotherapeutic applications, primarily attributed to receptor subtype heterogeneity and compensatory pathway activation. This synthesis underscores the necessity for combinatorial therapeutic strategies that integrate sst analogues with conventional chemotherapeutic agents or targeted therapies to overcome resistance mechanisms. The review consequently advocates for personalized medicine approaches based on sst receptor profiling to optimize therapeutic efficacy in colorectal cancer management.
