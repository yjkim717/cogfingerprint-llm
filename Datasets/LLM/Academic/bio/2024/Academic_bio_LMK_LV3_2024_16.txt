Title: Advances in Genome Editing Propel Pleurotus ostreatus to the Forefront of Fungal Biotechnology

Abstract:
The oyster mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus, has emerged as a paradigmatic model organism in fungal molecular genetics and biotechnology. Recent breakthroughs in genome editing technologies have significantly enhanced its utility, enabling precise manipulation of its genome. This development has far-reaching implications for research in genetics, cell biology, and material sciences. Leveraging CRISPR-Cas9 and other cutting-edge genome editing tools, scientists can now elucidate the genetic basis of desirable traits, such as enhanced nutritional content and improved substrate utilization. As of 2024, these advances position P. ostreatus at the vanguard of fungal biotechnology, with potential applications in sustainable agriculture, bioremediation, and the production of high-value compounds. This review synthesizes current knowledge on genome editing in P. ostreatus, highlighting its potential to drive innovation in various fields and foster a more sustainable bioeconomy.
