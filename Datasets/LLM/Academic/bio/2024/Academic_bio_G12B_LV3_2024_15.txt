**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health challenge, prompting ongoing investigation into novel therapeutic strategies. This review synthesizes current knowledge regarding the antitumor potential of somatostatin (SST) and its analogues in sporadic CRC. Evidence indicates that SST analogs can modulate key oncogenic signaling cascades, notably the MAPK/ERK/AKT and Wnt/Î²-catenin pathways, thereby inhibiting CRC cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, the antiangiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of SST contribute to its observed antitumor effects. Despite these advances, substantial gaps remain in fully elucidating the mechanisms of action, particularly concerning the complex interplay between SST signaling, the tumor microenvironment, and the gut microbiome. Future research should prioritize these areas to optimize SST-based therapeutic interventions for CRC.
