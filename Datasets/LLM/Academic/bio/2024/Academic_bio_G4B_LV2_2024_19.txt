**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a critical bottleneck in various electrochemical processes, necessitating the development of efficient and durable electrocatalysts. This study explores the synergistic effects of cobalt co-doping within SrIrOâ‚ƒ perovskite structures for enhanced OER activity under acidic conditions. Utilizing a novel synthesis protocol, we demonstrate that the incorporation of cobalt significantly modifies the electronic structure of the IrOx active sites, promoting enhanced oxygen release kinetics. Spectroscopic analysis, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), reveals a distinct IrOx phase transformation facilitated by cobalt, leading to increased surface area and improved charge transfer. Electrochemical investigations, employing cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry, confirm a substantial rate enhancement in OER performance. These findings suggest that cobalt co-doping offers a viable pathway for tailoring perovskite catalysts, ultimately contributing to advancements in renewable energy technologies and electrocatalytic systems.
