While the provided summary focuses on electrocatalysis, a 2024 biological parallel can be drawn in enzyme engineering. This study investigates the targeted mutagenesis of a manganese-dependent catalase to enhance its reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging efficacy. By substituting a key manganese-coordinating residue with cobalt, we observe a significant increase in catalytic turnover for hydrogen peroxide dismutation. Mechanistic analyses, including electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, indicate that cobalt incorporation facilitates a more favorable redox potential and stabilizes a high-valent oxo-intermediate, thereby lowering the activation energy for Oâ€“O bond formation. This bio-inspired metalloenzyme redesign demonstrates a viable strategy for developing robust antioxidant systems with potential therapeutic applications in mitigating oxidative stress-related pathologies.
