**Abstract: Accelerated Genomic Discovery and Therapeutic Development Through Integrated Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Pipelines**

The exponential growth of genomic data, coupled with advancements in computational power, presents a transformative opportunity for biological research and clinical application. This review examines the increasingly critical role of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in accelerating genomic discovery and revolutionizing therapeutic development, specifically within the context of gene therapy. Traditional genomic analyses often struggle with the complexity of multi-omic datasets and the identification of subtle, non-linear relationships predictive of disease phenotypes or therapeutic response.  We argue that integrated AI/ML pipelines, encompassing deep learning architectures and sophisticated statistical modeling, are essential to overcome these limitations.

This work surveys current applications of AI/ML across diverse genetic domains, including variant prioritization for disease association studies, *de novo* gene function prediction, and the optimization of CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA design. A significant focus is placed on the application of generative AI models, particularly diffusion models and transformers, in *in silico* drug design targeting genetically defined disease mechanisms.  Furthermore, we explore the potential of AI to personalize gene therapy approaches by predicting patient-specific responses based on genomic profiles and clinical data. The integration of single-cell genomics with ML techniques is highlighted as a key area for future development, enabling a more granular understanding of cellular heterogeneity and its implications for targeted therapies.

However, challenges remain. Data bias, algorithmic transparency (explainable AI – XAI), and the need for robust validation strategies are critically discussed. Specifically, the reliance of deep learning models on large, curated datasets raises concerns about generalizability across diverse populations. We propose a framework for developing ‘genetically-aware’ AI algorithms that incorporate prior biological knowledge and actively mitigate bias. Finally, this review concludes by outlining promising future directions, including the development of federated learning approaches to enable collaborative model training across institutions without compromising data privacy and the integration of AI-driven experimental design to iteratively refine genomic hypotheses and therapeutic strategies.
