**Abstract**

The evolving understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis necessitates refined approaches to characterizing immune responses within lymphoid tissues. This study presents SNOWFLAKE, a novel graph neural network pipeline, designed to predict disease status using multiplexed cell expression and morphological data obtained from lymphoid follicles. SNOWFLAKE’s architecture leverages spatial morphoproteomics to identify critical cellular interactions, constructing subgraphs indicative of disease progression. Preliminary results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in predictive accuracy compared to conventional machine learning methods.  Specifically, SNOWFLAKE successfully delineates distinct immune microarchitectures associated with varying COVID-19 severity.  Further investigation utilizing this tool promises to illuminate the complex interplay between cellular phenotypes and disease outcome, offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention and informing future multiplex imaging strategies within immunology research.
