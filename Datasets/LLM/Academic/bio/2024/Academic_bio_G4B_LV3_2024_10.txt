**Abstract**

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based proteomics workflows increasingly rely on data-dependent acquisition (DDA) strategies, yet challenges remain in achieving optimal peptide identification rates, particularly within broad chromatographic windows.  This study introduces MSFragger-DDA+, a refined database search algorithm designed to enhance sensitivity in complex proteomic datasets. MSFragger-DDA+ distinguishes itself through a comprehensive strategy of searching across full isolation windows, thereby maximizing the detection of peptides exhibiting co-fragmentation – a common artifact in wide-window acquisition.  The algorithm incorporates advanced spectral grouping and a novel weighting system that prioritizes fragments exhibiting stronger evidence of originating from the target peptide.  Preliminary results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in peptide identification rates compared to conventional database search methods, suggesting a critical advancement for accurate protein quantification and post-translational modification analysis in 2024 proteomics research.
