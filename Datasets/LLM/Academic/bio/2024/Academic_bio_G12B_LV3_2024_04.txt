**Abstract:**

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genetics represents a transformative paradigm shift within biomedical research and clinical practice. This review examines the burgeoning role of AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methodologies, in accelerating advancements across key areas of genetics-driven healthcare. We explore current applications, including enhanced genomic data analysis for disease risk prediction, improved target identification in drug discovery pipelines, and the optimization of gene therapy delivery systems. DL algorithms are demonstrating remarkable efficacy in identifying complex genetic patterns associated with multifactorial diseases, surpassing traditional statistical approaches in predictive accuracy. Furthermore, ML models are proving instrumental in personalizing therapeutic interventions, tailoring gene therapy vectors and dosages based on individual genomic profiles.  However, the integration of AI into genetics is not without challenges. Concerns regarding data bias, algorithmic transparency ("explainable AI"), and the ethical implications of predictive genetic information necessitate careful consideration and robust regulatory frameworks.  Future directions will likely involve the development of federated learning approaches to leverage distributed genomic datasets while preserving patient privacy, and the refinement of AI models to account for complex gene-environment interactions. Ultimately, responsible development and deployment of these technologies hold immense promise for revolutionizing disease treatment and ushering in an era of precision medicine.
