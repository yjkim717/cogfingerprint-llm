**Abstract**

The spatial organization of cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a critical determinant of disease progression and patient outcome. While high-plex imaging technologies now enable the detailed molecular and morphological profiling of individual cells, computational methods to systematically decode the complex, multi-scale cellular interaction networks remain underdeveloped. Here, we introduce SNOWFLAKE (Subgraph-Identified Network of Omni-channel Weighted Features for Landscape Analysis and Kinetic Evaluation), a novel graph neural network (GNN) framework designed to analyze spatial biology data. SNOWFLAKE constructs cellular spatial graphs where nodes represent single cells, annotated with high-dimensional morphological and protein expression features, and edges encode their physical proximity. We demonstrate that our GNN architecture not only achieves superior accuracy in predicting clinical disease status directly from these spatial graphs but, crucially, employs a differentiable subgraph identification mechanism. This allows for the simultaneous discovery and interpretation of disease-relevant local cellular neighborhoods, or "pathogenic niches," revealing specific multicellular interaction patterns that are statistically associated with aggressive disease phenotypes. Our 2024 benchmark on multiplex immunofluorescence data from triple-negative breast cancer cohorts confirms SNOWFLAKE's utility as a powerful tool for both prognostic prediction and mechanistic insight into tumor ecology.
