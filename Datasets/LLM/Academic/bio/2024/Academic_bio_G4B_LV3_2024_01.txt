**Abstract**

The non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, crucial for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, is frequently associated with genomic instability. This study proposes a novel mechanistic framework utilizing a heterogeneous anomalous diffusion model to account for the observed subdiffusive behavior of DNA ends during NHEJ. We hypothesize that this anomalous motion, characterized by fractional Brownian motion, reflects a complex interplay of stochastic forces and repair dynamics. Specifically, our model predicts rare, long-range excursions of DNA fragments, facilitating aberrant recombination events.  Experimental evidence suggests that this mechanism contributes to the formation of dicentric chromosome lesions â€“ a hallmark of misrepair.  These lesions, characterized by multiple double-strand breaks, underscore the inherent limitations of the NHEJ pathway.  Further investigation into the parameters governing this anomalous diffusion offers potential for targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at mitigating genomic instability in diseases such as cancer.  This research, presented in 2024, advances our understanding of DNA repair complexity.
