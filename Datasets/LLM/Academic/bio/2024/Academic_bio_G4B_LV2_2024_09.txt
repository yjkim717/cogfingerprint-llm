**Abstract**

Emerging evidence suggests significant heterogeneity within Alzheimer’s disease (AD), impacting diagnostic precision and therapeutic responsiveness. This study leveraged cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics, employing high-resolution mass spectrometry, to delineate novel molecular subtypes of AD. Analysis of comprehensive CSF protein profiles revealed five distinct subtypes characterized by unique proteomic signatures.  Notably, each subtype exhibited a statistically significant correlation with specific genetic risk variants, as identified through genome-wide association studies, indicating a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, we observed differential associations between these subtypes and established clinical outcomes, including cognitive decline and amyloid deposition. These findings demonstrate the potential of CSF proteomics to stratify AD patients based on molecular characteristics, offering a pathway to refine genetic risk profiles and personalize therapeutic interventions. Future research will focus on validating these subtypes in larger cohorts and exploring their predictive value for clinical trial enrollment.
