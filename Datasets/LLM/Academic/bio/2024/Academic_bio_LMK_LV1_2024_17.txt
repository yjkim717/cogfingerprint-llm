Title: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Genetic Engineering: A Paradigm Shift in Precision Medicine

Abstract:

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genetics has revolutionized the field of genetic engineering, offering unprecedented opportunities for precision medicine. This review synthesizes current research on the applications of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in genetics, highlighting their potential to transform the diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. By leveraging large-scale genomic datasets, AI algorithms can identify complex patterns and predict disease susceptibility with high accuracy. Recent advances in DL have enabled the development of predictive models that can identify novel genetic variants associated with disease, facilitating the discovery of therapeutic targets. Furthermore, AI-driven genome editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, have improved the precision and efficiency of gene editing, holding promise for the treatment of genetic disorders. This paper discusses the current state-of-the-art in AI-driven genetic engineering, including the use of ML for genomic data analysis, DL for predicting gene expression, and AI-optimized genome editing. We also examine the challenges and limitations associated with integrating AI in genetic engineering, including issues related to data quality, interpretability, and regulatory frameworks. As the field continues to evolve, we anticipate that AI will play an increasingly prominent role in shaping the future of precision medicine, enabling personalized treatments tailored to an individual's unique genetic profile. Ultimately, the synergy between AI and genetic engineering is poised to revolutionize our understanding of genetic disease and transform the clinical landscape.
