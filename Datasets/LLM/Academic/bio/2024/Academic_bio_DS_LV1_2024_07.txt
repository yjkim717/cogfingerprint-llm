**Title:** Integrating Microclimate Modeling with Biogeography to Project Climate Change Refugia for Threatened Biota

**Abstract:**

The accelerating pace of anthropogenic climate change necessitates a refined understanding of species' potential for persistence. While macroclimate models predict extensive range shifts, they often overlook the critical role of fine-scale microclimatic decoupling, a key determinant of microrefugia. This study synthesizes recent advances in microclimate ecology and high-resolution modeling to evaluate the capacity of topographically complex landscapes to function as in-situ refugia for temperature-sensitive species. We posit that integrating mechanistic microclimate models, which account for terrain, vegetation structure, and soil properties, with species distribution data significantly enhances the predictive accuracy of biogeographic forecasts. Our 2024 analysis demonstrates that such an integrated approach can identify potential microrefugia that are obscured by coarse-scale climate grids, particularly in montane and riparian systems. These findings have direct implications for climate change management, enabling the prioritization of conservation areas not solely based on current biodiversity but on their projected future microclimatic stability. We conclude that the explicit incorporation of microclimate science into conservation biogeography is indispensable for developing robust, proactive strategies to safeguard biodiversity under future climate scenarios.
