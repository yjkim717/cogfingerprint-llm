**Abstract**

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by considerable clinical and pathological heterogeneity, which complicates the development of effective, universal therapies. To address this, we conducted a large-scale cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic analysis of individuals along the AD continuum. Unsupervised clustering revealed five distinct molecular subtypes, each defined by unique protein pathway alterations. Crucially, these subtypes exhibited significantly divergent genetic risk profiles, as determined by polygenic risk scoring, and were associated with specific trajectories of clinical progression and patterns of regional brain atrophy measured by MRI. Our findings demonstrate that AD is not a monolithic entity but comprises discrete biological entities with distinct underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This refined nosology, which integrates proteomic and genetic data, provides a critical framework for advancing personalized medicine, enabling future clinical trials and therapeutic strategies to be tailored to specific AD subtypes for improved efficacy.
