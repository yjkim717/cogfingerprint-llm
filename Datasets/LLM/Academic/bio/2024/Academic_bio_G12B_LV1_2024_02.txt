**Somatostatin Analogues: Modulation of the MAPK/ERK/AKT Pathway and Tumor Microenvironment in Colorectal Cancer â€“ A Mechanistic Review and Future Directions**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health burden, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. Somatostatin (SST) and its synthetic analogues have demonstrated promise in CRC treatment, though the precise mechanisms underlying their antitumor activity remain incompletely elucidated. This review synthesizes current understanding of SST's impact on CRC progression, focusing on the interplay between signaling pathways, particularly the MAPK/ERK/AKT cascade, and the tumor microenvironment (TME). We examine how SST analogues, through receptor subtype-specific interactions (SSTR1-5), influence cellular proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis within the CRC context. Evidence suggests that SST analogues can attenuate MAPK/ERK/AKT signaling, a pivotal pathway driving CRC cell growth and survival, reducing downstream phosphorylation of key effectors. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of SST analogues on the TME, including modulation of immune cell infiltration (e.g., macrophages, T lymphocytes), extracellular matrix remodeling, and cytokine secretion, ultimately impacting tumor growth and response to conventional therapies.  Despite encouraging preclinical and early clinical findings, challenges persist regarding predicting patient responsiveness and optimizing analogue selection.  Future research should prioritize the characterization of predictive biomarkers for SST analogue efficacy, investigation of combination therapies targeting both intracellular signaling and the TME, and development of novel SST analogues with enhanced receptor selectivity and improved pharmacokinetic properties.  Unraveling these complexities will be crucial for translating the therapeutic potential of SST analogues into improved clinical outcomes for patients with sporadic colorectal cancer.
