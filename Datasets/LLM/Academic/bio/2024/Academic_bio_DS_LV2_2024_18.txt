**Abstract**

The persistent circulation and evolution of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5Nx) viruses of clade 2.3.4.4b represent a significant threat to both avian populations and global public health. This study investigates the phylodynamic and genetic determinants underpinning the successful establishment and spread of these viruses within European wild bird reservoirs since their initial introduction. Through comprehensive whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral isolates collected from 2020 to 2024, we demonstrate that the evolutionary trajectory of H5Nx genotypes is characterized by frequent and complex genetic reassortment. Our findings reveal an extensive diversification of the H5Nx genotype constellation, driven by the co-circulation of multiple neuraminidase (NA) subtypes and internal gene combinations. This continuous reassortment, coupled with the identification of specific amino acid substitutions associated with enhanced viral polymerase activity in avian cells and altered receptor binding affinity, underscores a high degree of phenotypic adaptability. Consequently, the rapid emergence of novel reassortants with unpredictable virological properties complicates risk assessment and outbreak forecasting. We conclude that the evolutionary landscape of H5Nx in Europe is defined by an unstable genomic architecture, which facilitates viral fitness in diverse wild bird species and contributes to the unprecedented spatial and temporal scale of outbreaks. These results emphasize the critical need for intensified genomic surveillance to monitor the emergence of potentially pre-adaptive mutations that could alter host range or zoonotic potential.
