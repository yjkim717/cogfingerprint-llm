**Abstract**

Recent genomic surveillance of avian influenza viruses circulating across Europe in 2024 has illuminated a complex evolutionary landscape dominated by the H5Nx subtype. Analysis of 1,956 complete genome sequences, primarily belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, demonstrates widespread genetic diversity and a pronounced propensity for reassortment events. These findings challenge traditional models of avian influenza evolution, indicating a heightened level of viral plasticity within the European population. The observed frequency of reassortment suggests ongoing genetic exchange between different H5Nx lineages, potentially generating novel genotypes with altered pathogenicity and host range.  Further investigation into the mechanisms driving these reassortments, alongside detailed phylogenetic analyses, is crucial for forecasting future spread and informing targeted public health interventions.  The unpredictable nature of this evolutionary trajectory underscores the need for continued, comprehensive genomic monitoring of H5Nx viruses.
