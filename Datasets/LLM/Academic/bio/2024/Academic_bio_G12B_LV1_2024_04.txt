**Abstract: Accelerated Genomic Discovery and Therapeutic Development Through Integrated Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Pipelines**

The burgeoning volume of genomic data, coupled with advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies, presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant computational challenges for biological research in 2024. Traditional statistical methods are increasingly inadequate for extracting meaningful insights from these complex datasets, necessitating the incorporation of sophisticated computational approaches. This review examines the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) across the spectrum of genetics research, encompassing foundational genomic analysis, disease gene identification, and the development of personalized gene therapies.

Specifically, we explore the application of deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), for improved variant calling accuracy, non-coding region analysis, and prediction of gene regulatory networks.  Furthermore, we discuss the utility of ML algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests, in prioritizing candidate genes for complex diseases and refining polygenic risk scores. A critical focus is placed on the integration of multi-omics data – including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics – within AI-driven pipelines to enhance predictive power and facilitate a more holistic understanding of disease etiology.

Finally, we address the emerging role of generative AI models in *de novo* drug design for gene therapies, specifically targeting CRISPR-Cas systems and adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs).  We highlight current limitations, including data bias, interpretability challenges (the “black box” problem), and the need for robust validation strategies, and propose avenues for future research focused on developing explainable AI (XAI) approaches and federated learning frameworks to ensure ethical and responsible application of these technologies within the evolving landscape of genomic medicine. The convergence of AI/ML and genetics promises to accelerate the translation of genomic discoveries into effective clinical interventions.
