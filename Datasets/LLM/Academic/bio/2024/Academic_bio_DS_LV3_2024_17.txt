**Abstract**

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the field of genetics represents a paradigm shift, fundamentally altering the methodologies and potential outcomes of biomedical research and clinical practice. In 2024, this synergy is most profoundly demonstrated in three critical domains: genomic diagnostics, therapeutic development, and personalized medicine. Advanced machine learning algorithms, particularly deep neural networks, are now capable of deconvoluting the immense complexity of polygenic disorders. By analyzing whole-genome sequencing data alongside multimodal clinical information, these models can identify cryptic variants and epistatic interactions that elude conventional statistical methods, thereby enhancing the detection and risk stratification of hereditary diseases. Concurrently, AI is dramatically accelerating the drug discovery pipeline. Generative models can design novel molecular structures with high affinity for specific protein targets implicated in genetic pathologies, while predictive algorithms streamline the identification of promising drug candidates from vast compound libraries, reducing both the time and cost associated with preclinical development. This culminates in the refinement of gene therapy and precision treatments, where AI-driven analysis of individual patient genotypes, transcriptomes, and proteomes facilitates the design of bespoke therapeutic regimens, optimizing efficacy and minimizing adverse effects. However, the full realization of this potential is contingent upon overcoming significant implementation challenges. These include the imperative for large-scale, high-quality, and ethically-sourced genomic datasets, the inherent "black box" nature of some complex models which complicates clinical validation, and the evolving regulatory frameworks required to govern AI-augmented medical interventions. The ongoing research trajectory must therefore not only refine algorithmic performance but also address these translational hurdles to ensure the equitable and robust application of AI in shaping the future of genetic medicine.
