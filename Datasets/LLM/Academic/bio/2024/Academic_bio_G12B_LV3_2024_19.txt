**Abstract**

The pursuit of efficient and sustainable water splitting catalysts remains a critical challenge in renewable energy research. This study explores the potential of cobalt-doped strontium iridium oxide (SrIrO₃) as a high-performance electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Through systematic electrochemical and spectroscopic analyses conducted in 2024, we demonstrate that cobalt doping significantly enhances OER activity by facilitating surface lattice oxygen activation and fine-tuning the binding energy of key reaction intermediates. Notably, cobalt-doped SrIrO₃ exhibits superior catalytic performance compared to benchmark commercial IrO₂ catalysts across diverse electrolyzer architectures. These findings suggest a promising pathway towards developing cost-effective and highly efficient electrocatalytic systems for hydrogen production, contributing to advancements in sustainable energy technologies.
