**Abstract:**

The burgeoning field of cancer genomics demands sophisticated analytical tools for interpreting increasingly complex datasets. This study highlights the utility of the UCSC Xena platform – a web-based resource – in facilitating the visualization and integrated analysis of multi-omic data within the context of cancer research. Xena’s architecture allows for the seamless incorporation of gene expression data alongside genomic variation, epigenomic modifications, and relevant clinical annotations, providing a unified framework for investigation.  Crucially, the tool’s interactive visualizations enable researchers to explore intricate gene regulatory networks and identify potential prognostic biomarkers. Furthermore, Xena incorporates survival analysis capabilities, permitting the assessment of gene expression signatures and genomic alterations in predicting patient outcomes.  In 2024, Xena represents a vital resource for accelerating translational research, offering a standardized approach to navigate the challenges inherent in multi-omic cancer genomics and fostering a deeper understanding of disease heterogeneity.
