Title: Unraveling the Evolutionary Dynamics of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza A(H5Nx) Viruses in Europe: A Spatiotemporal Analysis (2020-2022)

Abstract:
The ongoing circulation of high pathogenic avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses in European poultry and wild bird populations poses significant threats to animal health, economies, and potentially, human health. This study undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics, genetic diversity, and evolutionary trajectories of A(H5Nx) viruses isolated in Europe between 2020 and 2022. By integrating epidemiological data with advanced phylogenetic and phylogeographic approaches, we elucidate the complex patterns underlying the emergence and dissemination of these viruses. Our results reveal a high degree of genetic diversity among the circulating A(H5Nx) viruses, driven by both mutation and reassortment events. The data indicate that certain clades have become predominant in specific geographical regions, suggesting adaptation to local avian hosts. Furthermore, we identify key transmission routes and hotspots that have facilitated the spread of these viruses across Europe. The findings underscore the critical role of wild birds in the long-distance dispersal of A(H5Nx) viruses and highlight the importance of continued surveillance in both poultry and wild bird populations. This research contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary processes shaping the epidemiology of A(H5Nx) viruses and informs strategies for mitigating the impact of future outbreaks. As the global epidemiology of avian influenza continues to evolve, these insights are crucial for the development of targeted surveillance and control measures.
