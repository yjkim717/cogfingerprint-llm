**Abstract**

The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the high-resolution dissection of cellular heterogeneity, yet a fundamental challenge remains in accurately ordering cells along dynamic biological trajectories, such as differentiation or metabolic activation. Current trajectory inference methods often rely on dimensional reduction and graph-based pseudotime, constructs that lack a direct biophysical basis and can be confounded by complex topologies or non-linear gene expression dynamics. To address this, we introduce Chronocell, a novel computational framework that infers a "process time" for each cell by modeling the underlying biophysical processes driving transcriptional changes. Chronocell leverages the coordinated shifts in gene expression modules to construct a continuous, quantitative metric of a cell's progression, grounded in the system's intrinsic dynamics. We demonstrate that this process time not only provides a more robust foundation for trajectory analysis and cluster identification but also serves as a critical quality control metric. By quantifying the coherence of the inferred temporal signal, Chronocell directly assesses a dataset's inherent suitability for studying a given biological process, distinguishing between true developmental continua and mere static heterogeneity. This paradigm shift from pseudotime to biophysically-informed process time enhances the interpretability and predictive power of single-cell transcriptomic studies.
