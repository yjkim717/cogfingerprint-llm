Title: Enhancing Peptide Identification Sensitivity in Data-Dependent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry using msfragger-dda+: A Novel Approach to Proteomics Analysis

Abstract:

Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry remains a cornerstone of proteomics analysis, enabling the identification of thousands of peptides in a single experiment. However, the complexity of DDA data poses significant challenges for peptide identification, particularly when dealing with co-fragmented peptides. To address this limitation, we present msfragger-dda+, a novel computational tool that leverages advanced algorithms to detect co-fragmented peptides with high sensitivity and speed. By integrating msfragger-dda+ with database search strategies, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in peptide identification sensitivity, thereby expanding the proteome coverage.

Our approach utilizes a sophisticated peak-picking algorithm to accurately identify co-fragmented peptides, which are subsequently incorporated into a database search workflow. This enables the detection of previously unidentified peptides, resulting in a substantial increase in proteome coverage. We evaluated the performance of msfragger-dda+ using a range of benchmark datasets, demonstrating its ability to identify a significantly larger number of peptides compared to existing methods. Notably, msfragger-dda+ achieved a marked improvement in sensitivity while maintaining a low false discovery rate.

The integration of msfragger-dda+ into existing proteomics pipelines has the potential to revolutionize the field by providing a more comprehensive understanding of complex biological systems. By enhancing peptide identification sensitivity, msfragger-dda+ is poised to play a critical role in advancing our understanding of protein function and regulation in the years to come, particularly in 2024 and beyond.
