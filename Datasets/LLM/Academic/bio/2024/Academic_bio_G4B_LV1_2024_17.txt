**Abstract**

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genomic sciences is rapidly transforming biomedical research and therapeutic development. This study examines the escalating integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques within genetic engineering, gene therapy, and personalized medicine initiatives.  Specifically, we analyze how AI algorithms are increasingly utilized to accelerate gene editing processes, predict therapeutic efficacy, and identify novel drug targets.  Current applications encompass enhanced CRISPR-Cas9 target identification through sequence analysis, improved allele-specific gene expression prediction, and the optimization of vector design for efficient gene delivery. 

Furthermore, DL models demonstrate considerable promise in analyzing complex multi-omic datasets – including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics – to stratify patient populations for gene therapy interventions. Challenges remain, including ensuring algorithmic transparency and mitigating potential biases embedded within training data.  Ethical considerations surrounding the application of AI in germline editing and the accessibility of these advanced technologies are also addressed.  We conclude that continued interdisciplinary collaboration between bioinformaticians, geneticists, and AI specialists is crucial to realize the full potential of AI-driven innovation in genetic healthcare by 2028.
