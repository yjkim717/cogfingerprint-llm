**Abstract**

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the field of genetics is precipitating a paradigm shift in biomedical research and therapeutic development. This review synthesizes the current landscape and projects the future trajectory of AI methodologies, primarily deep learning and probabilistic graphical models, as applied to complex genetic datasets. We first delineate AI's role in enhancing the resolution of genomic analysis, enabling the high-throughput identification of pathogenic variants and polygenic risk scores for complex disorders, thereby revolutionizing predictive diagnostics. Subsequently, we examine the transformative impact of AI on drug discovery, where generative models and reinforcement learning are being leveraged to design novel molecular entities and repurpose existing pharmaceuticals against genetically validated targets with unprecedented efficiency. A critical analysis is dedicated to the application of AI in precision gene therapy. Here, we discuss how machine learning algorithms optimize the design of CRISPR-Cas systems and viral vectors by predicting on-target efficacy and mitigating off-target effects, thus advancing the safety profile of these interventions. We conclude that the synergistic convergence of AI and genetics is not merely augmenting existing workflows but is fundamentally enabling new scientific inquiries. However, this rapid progression necessitates concurrent critical discourse on associated ethical considerations, data standardization, and model interpretability to ensure equitable and responsible translation into clinical practice.
