**Abstract**

The epidemiological trajectory of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5Nx) viruses of the Gs/GD lineage, specifically clade 2.3.4.4b, has undergone a critical paradigm shift in the European context. Previously characterized by episodic incursions, this clade has now established endemic circulation within wild bird reservoirs, fundamentally altering the regional threat landscape. This transition is not a consequence of a single adaptive event but is driven by a complex interplay of evolutionary mechanisms. Our 2024 genomic surveillance data and phylodynamic analysis demonstrate that frequent genetic reassortment with circulating low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses serves as a primary engine of diversification, generating novel H5Nx reassortants with altered phenotypic properties. Concurrently, sustained host jumps between diverse avian species, particularly within the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes orders, facilitate viral persistence and geographic spread. Crucially, we have identified a suite of adaptive mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein that enhance binding affinity for avian-like receptors and potentially modulate pH stability, alongside mutations in the polymerase complex (PB2) that may augment replication efficiency in new hosts. This triad of reassortment, host jumping, and targeted mutation complicates predictive modeling of the virus's evolutionary trajectory, posing significant challenges for pandemic preparedness and poultry biosecurity. The endemicity of HPAI H5Nx 2.3.4.4b in Europe now represents a persistent zoonotic pool, necessitating a sustained, integrated One Health approach to surveillance and risk assessment.
