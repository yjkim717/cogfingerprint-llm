**Abstract**

The white-rot basidiomycete *Pleurotus ostreatus* has emerged as a preeminent model organism in fungal biology, propelled by the recent maturation of its molecular toolkit. This review synthesizes advances from 2020-2024, highlighting how CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing and sophisticated molecular genetics have deconstructed the mechanisms underpinning its selective ligninolysis. We detail the orchestrated expression of lignin-modifying peroxidases and the role of specialized protein secretion systems in the efficient deconstruction of recalcitrant wood components. Beyond biodegradation, these genetic insights are being harnessed for molecular breeding of enhanced strains, optimizing hydrolytic enzyme production for industrial biorefining. Furthermore, the refined understanding of *P. ostreatus* extracellular machinery provides a blueprint for synthetic biology applications in sustainable material science. The integration of these discoveries solidifies *P. ostreatus* not only as a paradigm for studying wood decay but as a versatile cellular platform for biotechnological innovation.
