**Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis via Cobalt Co-Doping of Strontium Iridium Oxide**

The efficient and sustainable generation of hydrogen via electrochemical water splitting hinges on the development of high-performance oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts. While iridium oxide (IrO₂) remains a benchmark material, its high cost motivates the exploration of alternative and cost-effective formulations. This study investigates the impact of cobalt co-doping on the OER activity of strontium iridium oxide (SrIrO₃). We demonstrate that introducing cobalt into the SrIrO₃ lattice significantly enhances its electrocatalytic performance, surpassing that of commercial IrO₂ in a series of controlled electrochemical experiments.

Detailed analyses reveal that cobalt co-doping facilitates the activation of surface lattice oxygen, increasing the availability of reactive sites for OER. Furthermore, the dopant subtly modifies the binding energy of iridium oxide intermediates, optimizing the adsorption strength required for efficient catalytic turnover. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy confirms alterations in the Ir oxidation state and the formation of key reaction intermediates upon cobalt incorporation. These synergistic effects collectively contribute to a reduced overpotential and enhanced faradaic efficiency for the OER, presenting SrIrO₃:Co as a promising and cost-effective alternative to conventional IrO₂-based electrocatalysts for water splitting applications.
