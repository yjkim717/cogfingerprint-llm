Title: Phylogenetic Analysis and Epidemiological Insights into the Emergence of Clade 2.3.4.4b H5Nx Avian Influenza Viruses in European Wild Birds and Poultry, 2020-2022

Abstract:

The ongoing circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5Nx) viruses, specifically clade 2.3.4.4b, has posed significant threats to poultry industries and wild bird populations across Europe. To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics and epidemiological patterns of these viruses, we conducted a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of H5Nx strains isolated in Europe between 2020 and 2022. Our dataset comprised 250 H5Nx virus sequences obtained from wild birds and poultry, which were analyzed alongside global reference sequences using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods. The results indicate that the European H5Nx viruses belonged predominantly to clade 2.3.4.4b, with multiple introductions from Asia via migratory wild birds. The viruses exhibited a high degree of genetic diversity, with evidence of reassortment events between H5Nx and other avian influenza viruses. Notably, our analysis revealed the emergence of novel H5Nx subclades with distinct amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin protein, potentially influencing virus transmissibility and virulence. The study highlights the critical role of wild birds in the dispersal of HPAI H5Nx viruses across Europe and underscores the need for continued surveillance and monitoring to inform evidence-based control measures. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the complex interplay between virus evolution, epidemiology, and ecological factors driving the spread of HPAI H5Nx viruses in Europe.
