**Abstract**

Microclimate ecology, the study of localized environmental conditions within ecosystems, is increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of biodiversity and ecological function. This review synthesizes current understanding of microclimate’s pervasive influence across biogeographic gradients, highlighting its implications for species distribution, community assembly, and ecosystem resilience. Utilizing predictive modelling techniques – including species distribution models and niche-based approaches – we demonstrate how subtle variations in temperature, humidity, and light availability, often overlooked at broader scales, can significantly impact physiological performance and habitat suitability.  Furthermore, the paper examines the application of microclimate data in conservation planning, particularly concerning vulnerable species and fragmented landscapes.  Future research should prioritize high-resolution microclimate monitoring coupled with mechanistic modelling to better inform targeted management strategies.  Addressing the limitations of current data availability and integrating remote sensing technologies are crucial steps towards a more comprehensive understanding of microclimate’s role in shaping ecological dynamics and supporting effective conservation efforts in a rapidly changing world.
