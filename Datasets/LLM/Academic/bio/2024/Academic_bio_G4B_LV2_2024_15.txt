**Abstract: Somatostatin Modulation of Signaling Pathways and the Tumor Microenvironment in Sporadic Colorectal Cancer**

Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant clinical challenge, necessitating continued investigation into novel therapeutic strategies. This review synthesizes current knowledge regarding the role of somatostatin (SST) in modulating antitumor responses within this disease context, emphasizing its interactions with key signaling pathways and the tumor microenvironment (TME). SST, a potent peptide hormone, has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against CRC cells, largely attributed to its ability to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. However, the precise mechanisms underpinning these effects remain incompletely elucidated.

Emerging evidence suggests that SST influences CRC progression through the intricate regulation of MAPK/ERK/AKT signaling cascades, frequently dysregulated in CRC. Furthermore, SSTâ€™s impact extends to the TME, potentially modulating immune cell infiltration and angiogenesis. Specifically, SST signaling can alter the extracellular matrix composition and influence fibroblast activity, contributing to a pro-tumorigenic environment.  Recent studies highlight the role of gep-nets, a novel SST receptor subtype, in mediating these effects.  Future research should focus on translating these findings into targeted therapies, potentially employing SST analogs or receptor agonists to disrupt critical signaling loops and remodel the TME, ultimately enhancing treatment efficacy in sporadic CRC.
