Title: Unveiling the Antitumor Potential of Somatostatin in Colorectal Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications

Abstract:

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health burden, necessitating the exploration of innovative therapeutic strategies. Somatostatin, a naturally occurring peptide hormone, has garnered attention for its potential antitumor effects in various malignancies, including CRC. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of somatostatin's mechanisms and antitumor activity in CRC. Somatostatin exerts its effects through interaction with its receptors (sst1-5), which are expressed on the surface of tumor cells and cells within the tumor microenvironment. The use of sst analogues has emerged as a promising therapeutic approach, capitalizing on somatostatin's antiproliferative, anti-angiogenic, and pro-apoptotic properties. By modulating the tumor microenvironment, sst analogues can inhibit tumor growth, reduce angiogenesis, and enhance immune surveillance. Recent studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying somatostatin's antitumor effects, including the inhibition of signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, the combination of sst analogues with conventional therapies has shown synergistic effects, enhancing treatment outcomes. This review synthesizes the current evidence on somatostatin's antitumor activity in CRC, highlighting the therapeutic potential of sst analogues and discussing future directions for clinical translation. By elucidating the complex interactions between somatostatin and the CRC tumor microenvironment, this review aims to inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the management of CRC.
