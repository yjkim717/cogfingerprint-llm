**Abstract**

The characterization of spatial immune microarchitectures is increasingly crucial for understanding complex diseases, particularly in the context of emerging viral pathologies like COVID-19. This work presents SNOWFLAKE, a novel computational framework leveraging multiplex imaging and graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict disease status from cellular expression and morphological data within human B-cell follicles. SNOWFLAKE constructs a graph representation of cellular spatial relationships, enabling GNNs to learn intricate patterns indicative of disease. Results demonstrate superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional methods, highlighting the potential of spatial morphology analysis. Furthermore, the framework facilitates the identification of disease-relevant cellular interactions, offering new avenues for elucidating pathogenic mechanisms and informing therapeutic strategies. This approach represents a significant advancement in the application of AI to biomedical research, with implications for precision medicine in 2024 and beyond.
