**Abstract**

*Pleurotus ostreatus*, commonly known as the oyster mushroom, is emerging as a compelling model organism within biological research, exhibiting considerable potential beyond traditional eukaryotic systems. Advances in high-throughput sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing have facilitated detailed investigations into fungal cell biology and genetics. This review synthesizes recent progress demonstrating *P. ostreatus*'s utility in elucidating novel fungal signaling pathways, morphogenesis, and stress response mechanisms. Furthermore, its relatively rapid growth rate and ease of cultivation position it favorably for protein engineering applications, specifically in the development of biocatalysts and biomaterials.  The growing genomic database and increasingly sophisticated molecular tools are fostering a deeper understanding of fungal evolution and metabolic processes, thereby paving the way for innovative biotechnological advancements and expanding the scope of biological inquiry in 2024 and beyond.
