In the evolving landscape of neurodegenerative diagnostics, the identification of robust biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a critical unmet need, particularly for early intervention strategies. This 2024 multi-omics investigation leverages advanced, high-throughput proteomic platforms—including liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and proximity extension assay (PEA) technology—to conduct a comprehensive, cross-compartmental analysis of biofluids. We systematically profiled the proteomic signatures of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and urine from a well-characterized cohort of early-stage PD patients and matched healthy controls. Our integrated bioinformatic pipeline, incorporating differential expression analysis and machine learning-based feature selection, identified Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC) as a consistently and significantly dysregulated protein across all three biofluids. The elevation of DDC, an enzyme central to dopamine synthesis, suggests a compensatory mechanism in pre-symptomatic dopaminergic dysfunction, positioning it as a compelling pathophysiological indicator.

Furthermore, our study delineates a panel of novel co-biomarkers, including proteins involved in lysosomal-autophagic pathways and neuroinflammation, which synergistically enhance diagnostic specificity. The development of a multivariate model incorporating these biomarkers demonstrated high discriminatory power (AUC >0.95) in distinguishing prodromal PD from controls, substantially outperforming existing clinical assessments. The concurrent detection in plasma and urine underscores the potential for developing minimally invasive, accessible screening tools. These findings not only provide pivotal insights into the molecular underpinnings of PD pathogenesis but also establish a validated, multi-analyte biomarker signature with profound implications for early diagnosis, patient stratification, and objective monitoring of disease progression and therapeutic efficacy in clinical trials.
