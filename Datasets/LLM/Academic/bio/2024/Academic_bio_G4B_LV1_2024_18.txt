**Abstract**

The persistent emergence of avian influenza viruses (A(H5Nx)) poses a significant threat to global poultry populations and potential zoonotic transmission. This study investigates the genomic evolution of a prevalent clade 2.3.4.4b H5N5 lineage, designated H5Nx, circulating within Europe during 2023-2024, utilizing whole-genome sequencing of over 200 isolates. Phylogenetic analysis revealed substantial genetic diversity indicative of ongoing reassortment events, suggesting a dynamic evolutionary landscape.  Specifically, we observed evidence of multiple independent reassortment events contributing to the observed heterogeneity.  Furthermore, comparative genomic analysis identified key genetic determinants associated with virulence and host range.  Predictive modeling, incorporating these genomic insights, anticipates potential future lineages exhibiting increased transmissibility and altered pathogenicity.  These findings underscore the critical need for continued surveillance and adaptive vaccine development strategies to mitigate the epidemiological impact of H5Nx viruses and proactively address emerging avian influenza threats.  Further research will focus on investigating the mechanisms driving reassortment and assessing the zoonotic potential of identified variants.
