**Abstract: *Pleurotus ostreatus* as an Emerging Model System for Fungal Functional Genomics and Biotechnological Innovation**

The accelerating demand for sustainable bioproducts and a deeper understanding of fungal biology necessitates the development of robust and tractable model systems. While *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* and *Neurospora crassa* have traditionally dominated fungal research, the filamentous fungus *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom) is rapidly gaining recognition as a compelling alternative. This review examines recent progress in *P. ostreatus* molecular genetics, demonstrating its increasing suitability for functional genomics studies and biotechnological applications. Significant advancements in genome sequencing, facilitated by high-throughput technologies, have yielded a comprehensive reference genome and transcriptomic resources. Critically, the development and refinement of gene editing tools, particularly CRISPR-Cas9-based knockout methodologies, are enabling targeted investigation of gene function with unprecedented precision. This allows for detailed elucidation of metabolic pathways, developmental processes, and stress responses relevant to both fundamental biology and industrial applications. We discuss the current landscape of *P. ostreatus* genetic manipulation, highlighting successes in manipulating ligninolytic enzyme production, polysaccharide synthesis, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis.  Furthermore, we explore the potential of *P. ostreatus* as a platform for heterologous protein expression and the development of novel biomaterials. Ultimately, continued investment in *P. ostreatus* molecular genetics promises to unlock significant opportunities for advancing fungal biology and fostering sustainable biotechnological innovations within the coming years.
