Title: Unraveling the Evolutionary Dynamics and Transmission Patterns of Clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI A(H5Nx) Viruses in Europe during the 2020-2022 Epidemic Waves

Abstract:

The ongoing avian influenza epidemic in Europe has been characterized by the dominance of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5Nx) viruses, specifically clade 2.3.4.4b. To elucidate the evolutionary dynamics and transmission patterns of these viruses, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 1,956 European HPAI A(H5Nx) virus genomes sampled during the 2020-2022 epidemic waves. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed a complex evolutionary landscape, with multiple introductions of clade 2.3.4.4b viruses into Europe, followed by local transmission and reassortment events. The results indicate that the H5Nx viruses underwent significant genetic diversification, resulting in the emergence of novel genotypes. We also observed a high degree of genetic heterogeneity among the viruses, suggesting multiple sources of introduction and ongoing virus evolution. Our epidemiological analysis revealed that the transmission dynamics of HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses were influenced by factors such as poultry trade, bird migration patterns, and environmental factors. The findings of this study provide critical insights into the evolution and transmission of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses, informing risk assessments and guiding the development of targeted control measures to mitigate the impact of future avian influenza outbreaks. The study's results have significant implications for the development of effective surveillance strategies and vaccines against HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses.
