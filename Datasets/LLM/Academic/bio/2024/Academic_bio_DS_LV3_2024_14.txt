In 2024, Korabel et al. present a novel biophysical framework elucidating the spatiotemporal dynamics of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The study introduces a heterogeneous anomalous diffusion model that accurately captures the predominant subdiffusive motion of DSB ends within the nucleus. Critically, this model incorporates rare, long-range movements, providing a mechanistic explanation for the misrepair events observed through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). The authors demonstrate that this kinetic heterogeneity—where most ends exhibit constrained motion punctuated by infrequent large displacements—significantly increases the probability of incorrect end-pairing. This misrepair is directly linked to the formation of dicentric chromosome lesions, a primary driver of genomic instability and cell death following ionizing radiation. This work establishes a quantitative link between nuclear architecture, DSB mobility, and catastrophic chromosomal rearrangements, offering a predictive tool for assessing radiation toxicity.
