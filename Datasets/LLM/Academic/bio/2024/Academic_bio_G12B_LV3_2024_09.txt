**Abstract**

Recent advances in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics have revealed a complex heterogeneity within Alzheimer's disease (AD). A 2024 study employing high-resolution proteomics identified five distinct molecular subtypes of AD, exhibiting divergent proteomic signatures and correlated with specific genetic risk profiles. These subtypes demonstrated differential associations with clinical progression, neurodegenerative patterns, and regional brain atrophy. This stratification highlights the limitations of a monolithic AD diagnosis and advocates for a precision medicine paradigm. Further investigation into subtype-specific therapeutic interventions represents a critical pathway towards improved patient outcomes and targeted disease modification in AD.
