**Abstract**

The accurate identification of peptides remains a critical challenge in modern proteomics workflows. Traditional data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry often struggles to detect low-abundance co-fragmented peptides, limiting sensitivity and potentially compromising downstream analysis. This study introduces MSFragger-DDA+, a novel strategy designed to mitigate these limitations. MSFragger-DDA+ employs a refined liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach, utilizing full isolation windows during data acquisition.  These expanded windows facilitate the capture of co-fragmented peptides, which are frequently obscured by the initial, dominant fragment ions. 

Following DDA acquisition, the resulting fragment ion data is subjected to a targeted database search, optimized for the increased spectral complexity introduced by full isolation. We demonstrate that MSFragger-DDA+ significantly enhances peptide identification sensitivity compared to standard DDA protocols, particularly in complex biological samples.  Preliminary results suggest a substantial improvement in the detection of post-translational modifications and less abundant peptides, representing a valuable advancement for proteomic research in 2024.
