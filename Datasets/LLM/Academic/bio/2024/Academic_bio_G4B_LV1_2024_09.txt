**Abstract**

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) exhibits considerable heterogeneity, challenging the efficacy of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ therapeutic approach. This study leveraged cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to delineate distinct molecular subtypes of AD, offering a novel framework for personalized risk assessment and intervention. Utilizing targeted mass spectrometry analysis, we identified five novel subtypes characterized by unique biomarker profiles within the CSF. Correlation analyses revealed significant associations between these subtypes and established genetic risk scores, including APOE ε4 allele status and familial AD history. Furthermore, subtype classification demonstrated differential clinical outcomes, specifically regarding cognitive decline progression and response to cholinesterase inhibitors. These findings suggest that CSF proteomics can effectively stratify AD patients based on underlying biological mechanisms. Future research should focus on validating these subtypes in larger cohorts and exploring their predictive value for clinical trial enrollment, ultimately advancing precision medicine strategies for AD management.
