**Abstract**

The advent of single-cell transcriptomics has fundamentally advanced our capacity to deconstruct cellular heterogeneity. A central challenge in analyzing such data lies in trajectory inferenceâ€”the computational reconstruction of dynamic processes like differentiation or cellular responses. However, prevailing methods often rely on pseudotime, a useful but abstract metric that lacks direct biophysical interpretability, thereby limiting the extraction of meaningful kinetic parameters. To address this, we introduce Chronocell, a novel biophysical modeling framework that redefines trajectory inference by estimating a "process time" intrinsic to the underlying cellular dynamics. Chronocell leverages principles from stochastic gene expression and reaction kinetics to model transcriptional changes not as a mere sequence, but as a continuous process governed by measurable rates. This approach enables the robust estimation of critical parameters, such as transition rates between cell states and the transcriptional burst frequencies that drive them, directly from snapshot single-cell RNA-sequencing data. By providing a biophysically-grounded temporal axis, Chronocell effectively bridges the gap between continuous trajectory models and discrete cluster-based analyses, offering a more unified and mechanistically insightful interpretation of cell fate decisions. We demonstrate that the fidelity of these parameter estimates is highly contingent upon dataset quality, underscoring the necessity for high-resolution, low-noise genomic data. In conclusion, Chronocell provides a powerful, principled framework for moving beyond descriptive pseudotime ordering towards a quantitative, predictive understanding of cellular dynamics.
