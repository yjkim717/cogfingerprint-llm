**Unlocking the Genetic Potential of *Pleurotus ostreatus*: A Foundation for Functional Genomics and Applied Mycology**

The accelerating pace of genomic technologies presents unprecedented opportunities to understand and manipulate fungal traits. This review examines the burgeoning field of molecular genetics in *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom), arguing for its growing utility as a robust model organism within mycology and beyond. While traditionally valued for its culinary and medicinal properties, recent advancements in genome sequencing and gene editing tools have revealed a rich potential for exploring fundamental biological processes and engineering desirable traits. We synthesize current literature detailing the complete genome assembly of *P. ostreatus*, highlighting key genomic features including gene family expansions relevant to lignocellulose degradation and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Furthermore, we evaluate emerging methodologies for targeted gene knockout and CRISPR-Cas based genome editing within this species, noting progress in validating gene function and demonstrating the feasibility of strain improvement.  The review assesses current challenges, such as optimizing transformation efficiency and refining gene editing precision, alongside future directions, including comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic analyses to complement genomic data. Ultimately, we posit that *P. ostreatus* is poised to become a pivotal system for investigating fungal development, nutrient metabolism, and the production of valuable bioactive compounds, thereby bridging the gap between fundamental research and applied mycology in 2024 and beyond.
