**Abstract**

Early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) remains a significant challenge, necessitating the identification of robust biomarkers. This study leverages a comprehensive proteomic analysis to investigate the potential of delta-docosanenoic acid (DDC) as a novel diagnostic and prognostic indicator. Utilizing mass spectrometry-based proteomics across diverse patient cohorts and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples, we observed consistent upregulation of DDC levels in individuals exhibiting early PD pathology. These findings suggest a potential correlation between DDC expression and disease progression.  Specifically, the observed increase in DDC levels precedes the clinical manifestation of motor symptoms in several cohorts. Further investigation into the mechanistic pathways modulating DDC production within the central nervous system is warranted.  The identification of DDC as a reliable biomarker holds promise for facilitating earlier intervention strategies and personalized therapeutic approaches for PD management, representing a critical step forward in neurodegenerative disease research in 2024.
