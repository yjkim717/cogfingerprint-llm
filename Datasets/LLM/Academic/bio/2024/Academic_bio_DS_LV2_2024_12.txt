**Abstract**

The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing has enabled the unprecedented resolution of cellular heterogeneity, yet a fundamental challenge remains: the inference of a continuous, biophysically grounded "process time" from static snapshot data. Current trajectory inference methods often rely on phenomenological constructs that lack direct correspondence to the underlying molecular kinetics governing cell state transitions. To address this, we introduce Chronocell, a novel computational framework that infers a quantitative process time directly from single-cell transcriptomic data by integrating concepts from stochastic biophysical modeling. Chronocell conceptualizes gene expression dynamics as a drift-diffusion process, allowing it to reconstruct a latent temporal variable that reflects the intrinsic progression of a biological process, such as differentiation or cellular reprogramming. We rigorously validate our method across diverse datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches in accurately ordering cells along developmental trajectories. Furthermore, Chronocell enables the direct estimation of critical kinetic parameters, including transition rates and potential landscape topography, providing mechanistic insights into the forces driving cell fate decisions. This work establishes a new paradigm for moving beyond descriptive pseudotime ordering towards a quantitative, model-based understanding of dynamic biological systems from single-cell data.
