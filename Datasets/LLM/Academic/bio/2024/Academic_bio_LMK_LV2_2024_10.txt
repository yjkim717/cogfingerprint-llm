Title: Enhancing Peptide Identification Sensitivity in Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry using MSFragger-DDA+

Abstract:
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a cornerstone technique in proteomics, with data-dependent acquisition (DDA) being a widely employed method for peptide identification. However, the sensitivity of traditional DDA approaches is often compromised by the complexity of fragment ion spectra and the presence of co-fragmented peptides. To address this limitation, we present MSFragger-DDA+, a novel database search algorithm that leverages advanced spectral analysis to detect co-fragmented peptides with high sensitivity and speed. By integrating MSFragger-DDA+ into the LC-MS workflow, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in peptide identification sensitivity, while maintaining a controlled false discovery rate. Our results show that MSFragger-DDA+ outperforms existing methods in identifying peptides from complex proteomic samples. The improved sensitivity and accuracy of MSFragger-DDA+ have far-reaching implications for proteomic research, enabling the detection of low-abundance peptides and facilitating a deeper understanding of biological systems. This advancement is poised to drive significant progress in the field of proteomics in 2024 and beyond.
