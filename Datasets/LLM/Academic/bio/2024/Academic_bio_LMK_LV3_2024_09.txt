Title: Unveiling Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease: Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomics and Genetic Risk Profiles Inform Personalized Medicine (2024)

Abstract:
Recent advances in cerebrospinal fluid proteomics have enabled the stratification of Alzheimer's disease into five molecular subtypes, each characterized by distinct genetic risk profiles and clinical trajectories. This classification, derived from a comprehensive proteomics analysis, underscores the heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease. By integrating proteomic signatures with genetic risk profiles, this study provides a framework for precision medicine approaches, tailoring therapeutic strategies to individual molecular subtypes. The findings have significant implications for the development of targeted interventions and improved patient outcomes in Alzheimer's disease management.
