**Abstract**

Parkinson’s disease (PD) represents a significant neurodegenerative challenge, characterized by progressive motor and non-motor deficits. Early and accurate diagnosis remains a critical unmet need, necessitating the development of robust biomarkers. This study investigated the potential of proteomic analysis to identify novel biomarkers for PD, focusing on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a primary source of diagnostic material. Utilizing a comprehensive proteomic workflow encompassing mass spectrometry analysis of CSF samples, we sought to characterize protein signatures associated with PD progression and disease onset. 

Our investigation revealed a statistically significant elevation of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDC) levels in individuals diagnosed with early-stage PD compared to age-matched healthy controls.  Further analysis indicated a strong correlation between DDC levels and both clinical measures of motor function and the presence of α-synuclein pathology within the CSF.  Importantly, we extended our investigation to include plasma and urine samples, demonstrating a reduced, albeit less pronounced, DDC signature, suggesting a predominantly CSF-derived biomarker. 

These findings strongly support DDC as a promising biomarker for the early detection and longitudinal monitoring of PD.  The identified DDC signature warrants further validation within larger, multi-center cohorts. Future research will explore the mechanistic underpinnings of DDC dysregulation in PD, investigating its role in dopamine neuron vulnerability and potential therapeutic targeting.  This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting a proteomic-based approach for improved PD diagnostics and personalized patient management strategies.
