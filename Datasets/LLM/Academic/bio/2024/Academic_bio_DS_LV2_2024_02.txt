**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic targets. This review synthesizes current evidence on the antitumor properties of the neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) and its synthetic analogues in CRC pathogenesis. We critically evaluate the mechanistic underpinnings of SST action, with a principal focus on its inhibition of key proliferative and survival signaling cascades, notably the MAPK/ERK and AKT pathways. SST, primarily through its G-protein coupled receptors (SSTRs), initiates a signaling network that culminates in cell cycle arrest, the induction of apoptosis, and the suppression of angiogenesis. The therapeutic potential of stable, long-acting SST analogues (e.g., octreotide, pasireotide) is a central theme, analyzing their efficacy in preclinical models and clinical settings. We discuss how these analogues modulate the tumor microenvironment and explore strategies to overcome limitations such as receptor desensitization. The evidence positions SST-based signaling not merely as a regulatory axis but as a promising avenue for targeted intervention, suggesting that SST analogues could serve as valuable adjuvants to conventional CRC chemotherapeutics, particularly in specific molecular subtypes.
