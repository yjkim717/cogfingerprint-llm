**Abstract**

The ongoing global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) caused by the H5N1 virus, particularly clade 2.3.4.4b, poses a significant and evolving threat to poultry industries and potentially human health. This study investigates the genetic landscape of 1,956 European H5N1 viruses circulating between [Start Year of Data Collection – e.g., 2021] and [End Year of Data Collection – e.g., 2023], aiming to characterize the evolutionary dynamics and transmission patterns of this clade. Phylogenetic analysis reveals a substantial increase in genetic diversity within the European population of 2.3.4.4b HPAI viruses, suggesting accelerated adaptation and potentially impacting the efficacy of existing control measures. We identified several key mutations and amino acid substitutions associated with increased transmissibility and virulence, though their precise contributions require further investigation.  Furthermore, our analysis detected evidence of reassortment events, albeit infrequent, indicating the potential for novel viral genotypes to emerge through the exchange of gene segments with other avian influenza subtypes. The observed genetic diversification and reassortment capacity underscore the unpredictable nature of this clade and highlight the need for continuous genomic surveillance.  This expanded understanding of the evolutionary trajectory of 2.3.4.4b is crucial for informing targeted interventions, developing robust diagnostic tools, and ultimately mitigating the risks associated with its continued spread. Future research should focus on characterizing the functional impact of identified mutations and predicting the potential for future evolutionary shifts.

*   **Specific Mutations:** If the study identified particular mutations, mentioning them briefly would strengthen the abstract.
*   **Geographic Scope:** If the study examined only a subset of Europe, specify the region.
*   **Methodology:** While avoiding excessive detail, briefly mentioning key methodologies (e.g., "whole-genome sequencing and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis") can add weight.
