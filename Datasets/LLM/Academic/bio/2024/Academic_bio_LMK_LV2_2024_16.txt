Title: Advancements in Molecular Genetics of Pleurotus ostreatus: Emerging Paradigms in Mushroom Science

Abstract:
Pleurotus ostreatus, a widely cultivated edible mushroom, has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential as a model organism in fungal research. This review aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge on the molecular genetics of P. ostreatus, with a focus on gene knockout and protein engineering techniques. Recent advancements in genome editing tools have enabled the functional characterization of key genes involved in developmental processes, lignocellulolytic enzyme production, and stress tolerance. The application of cutting-edge molecular genetics approaches has significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis underlying desirable traits in P. ostreatus. As a result, this species is poised to become a paradigm for mushroom science research, facilitating the development of novel biotechnological applications and improved cultivation strategies. This review highlights the progress made and discusses future directions for research in this rapidly evolving field.
