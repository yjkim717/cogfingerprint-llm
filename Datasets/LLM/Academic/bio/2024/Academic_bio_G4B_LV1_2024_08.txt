**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cancer genomics necessitates sophisticated tools for integrative data analysis and visualization. This study introduces UCSC Xena, a novel web-based platform designed to facilitate the exploration of multi-omic data within the context of cancer research. Xena’s core functionality centers on a dynamic, visual spreadsheet interface, enabling researchers to seamlessly integrate and interrogate genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic datasets. Leveraging the extensive resources of the UCSC Genome Browser, Xena provides access to a curated collection of publicly available cancer genomic data, encompassing diverse cancer types and experimental conditions.

Crucially, Xena facilitates comparative analysis through its interactive visualization capabilities, allowing users to identify correlations and patterns between gene expression levels and genomic alterations. The platform’s architecture supports the import of various data formats – including RNA-Seq, DNA methylation, and copy number variation data – transforming raw data into readily interpretable visual representations.  We posit that Xena’s user-friendly design and comprehensive analytical features will accelerate discovery by enabling researchers to move beyond traditional data mining and engage in more intuitive, hypothesis-driven investigations of cancer biology. Future development will incorporate advanced statistical analysis modules and enhanced data filtering options.
