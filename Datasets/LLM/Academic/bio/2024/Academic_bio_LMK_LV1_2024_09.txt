Title: Unveiling Molecular Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease: A Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomics Approach

Abstract:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by substantial clinical and pathological heterogeneity. Recent advances in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics have enabled the identification of distinct molecular subtypes underlying this variability. In this study, we employed a quantitative proteomics approach to investigate the CSF proteome of a large AD cohort. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed five molecular subtypes with distinct proteomic signatures, which were subsequently associated with differing genetic risk profiles and clinical outcomes. Notably, subtype-specific protein biomarkers were identified, providing novel insights into the underlying pathophysiology. Our findings demonstrate that CSF proteomics can be leveraged to stratify AD patients into molecular subtypes, facilitating the development of personalized therapeutic strategies. This molecular classification framework holds promise for improving diagnostic accuracy and tailoring treatment approaches to individual patients, marking a significant step towards precision medicine in AD.
