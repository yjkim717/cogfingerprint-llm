**Abstract**

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the field of genetics is catalyzing a paradigm shift in biomedical research and clinical practice. This review synthesizes recent advancements from 2020-2024, delineating the transformative role of AI and machine learning (ML) across three primary domains: genomic research, clinical diagnostics, and therapeutic development. In research, deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional and transformer-based networks, are now indispensable for the annotation of non-coding genomic regions, the prediction of variant pathogenicity from whole-genome sequencing data, and the deconvolution of complex polygenic risk scores. These models surpass traditional statistical methods in their ability to identify subtle, high-dimensional patterns associated with disease susceptibility.

Transitioning to the clinic, AI-driven decision support systems are enhancing the diagnostic odyssey for rare genetic diseases by integrating phenotypic data from electronic health records with genomic findings, significantly reducing time-to-diagnosis. Furthermore, in the realm of therapeutic intervention, AI is accelerating precision medicine. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning are being employed for *in silico* drug design, creating novel molecular entities that target specific pathogenic proteins identified through genetic screens. Concurrently, ML models are optimizing the design of gene-editing strategies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, by predicting off-target effects and enhancing the efficacy of guide RNA sequences for therapeutic gene correction. We conclude that the synergistic convergence of AI and genetics not only augments our fundamental understanding of biological systems but is also forging a direct path toward personalized, predictive, and pre-emptive healthcare, albeit necessitating ongoing critical evaluation of algorithmic bias and clinical validation.
