The escalating global demand for sustainable energy underscores the critical need for efficient electrocatalytic water splitting. This study investigates the role of cobalt-doping in SrIrO3 perovskites for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a key kinetic bottleneck. We demonstrate that strategic cobalt substitution activates surface lattice oxygen species, facilitating a lattice oxygen-mediated reaction pathway. Concurrently, cobalt integration optimizes the electronic structure of in-situ formed IrOx surface layers, fine-tuning their binding energy for oxygen intermediates. This synergistic effect significantly boosts OER activity and stability in neutral electrolytes, outperforming benchmark IrO2 catalysts. Our findings, validated through electrochemical analysis and computational modeling, establish a design principle for developing high-performance, cost-effective electrocatalysts by manipulating metal-oxygen covalency and surface dynamics, advancing the frontier of renewable hydrogen production technology.
