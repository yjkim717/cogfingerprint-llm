**Abstract**

Radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (dsBs) represent a significant challenge to genomic stability. The repair pathway, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), is frequently associated with complex and heterogeneous repair dynamics. This study proposes a novel computational model to investigate the spatial distribution of dsBs during NHEJ, incorporating principles of anomalous diffusion to account for deviations from Brownian motion. Specifically, we hypothesize that the repair process exhibits characteristics of fractional Brownian motion, reflecting the influence of chromatin architecture and repair protein clustering.  Our simulations predict a heterogeneous landscape of repair activity, leading to increased probabilities of dicentric chromosome lesion formation.  These findings suggest that understanding the stochastic nature of dsB repair, particularly the influence of anomalous diffusion, is crucial for predicting genome-wide consequences of radiation exposure and refining risk assessments. Further investigation into the mechanistic underpinnings of this observed distribution is warranted.
