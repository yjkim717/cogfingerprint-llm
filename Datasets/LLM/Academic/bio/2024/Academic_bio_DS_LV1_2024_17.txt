**Abstract**

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genomics is catalyzing a paradigm shift in biomedical science, offering unprecedented capabilities to decipher the complexity of genetic information. While foundational applications in variant calling and sequence analysis are well-established, the integration of sophisticated deep learning architectures is now propelling the field toward predictive and generative modeling. This review synthesizes recent advancements from 2023-2024, focusing on three transformative domains. First, in therapeutic genome editing, we examine how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer models enhance the precision of CRISPR-Cas systems by predicting on-target efficacy and mitigating off-target effects, thereby accelerating the development of novel gene therapies for monogenic disorders. Second, we explore the role of AI in de novo drug discovery, where generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning are being employed to design small molecule inhibitors and gene-based therapeutics targeting previously undruggable pathways. Finally, we analyze the maturation of AI-driven precision medicine, wherein multimodal learning integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data with clinical records to stratify patient populations, predict individual treatment responses, and identify novel biomarkers. We conclude that the principal challenge remains the interpretability of complex models and the integration of diverse, high-dimensional datasets. Overcoming these hurdles is critical for translating algorithmic predictions into clinically actionable insights, solidifying AI as an indispensable tool in the future of genetics and molecular medicine.
