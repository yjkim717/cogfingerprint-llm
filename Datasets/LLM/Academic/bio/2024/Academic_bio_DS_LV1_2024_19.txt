Of note, the strategic integration of transition metal dopants into perovskite oxides has emerged as a powerful methodology for engineering highly active and stable electrocatalysts for the acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a critical bottleneck in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWEs). Inspired by this principle, we investigate the structural and electronic modifications induced by cobalt doping within a strontium iridate (SrIrO3) matrix. Our findings reveal that the Co dopant facilitates the in-situ formation of surface-enriched IrOx active species during electrochemical activation. This process is concomitant with a favorable optimization of the oxygen intermediate binding energies on the catalyst surface, as confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The resulting Co-doped SrIrO3 electrocatalyst demonstrates a significantly reduced overpotential and enhanced operational stability compared to a commercial IrO2 benchmark, establishing a robust design paradigm for next-generation PEMWE anodes.
