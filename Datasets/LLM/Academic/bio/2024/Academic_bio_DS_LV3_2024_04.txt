**Abstract**

The year 2024 marks a pivotal juncture in the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genetics, heralding a paradigm shift in biomedical research and therapeutic development. This integration is fundamentally restructuring our approach to understanding and manipulating the human genome. The application of sophisticated machine learning algorithms, particularly deep neural networks and ensemble methods, to vast genomic datasets has dramatically accelerated the identification of pathogenic variants and polygenic risk factors associated with complex hereditary disorders. This enhanced diagnostic precision is a cornerstone of the evolving precision medicine landscape, enabling the stratification of patient populations for targeted interventions.

Concurrently, AI-driven methodologies are revolutionizing the pharmaceutical pipeline. In silico drug discovery, powered by generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement learning, now facilitates the de novo design of novel small molecules and biologics with high specificity for previously undruggable targets. These computational models predict binding affinities, optimize pharmacokinetic properties, and significantly truncate the preclinical development timeline from years to months. This acceleration is critically augmented by AI's role in repurposing existing therapeutics, identifying new indications through the analysis of multi-omic data and real-world evidence.

The most profound translational impact is observed in the realm of gene therapy. AI models are instrumental in refining CRISPR-Cas systems and other gene-editing platforms by predicting off-target effects with unprecedented accuracy and guiding the rational design of more efficient guide RNAs. Furthermore, machine learning optimizes the design of viral vectors, such as adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), by predicting tropism and immunogenicity, thereby enhancing the safety and efficacy of therapeutic delivery.

However, the full realization of this potential is contingent upon addressing significant implementation challenges. These include the imperative for robust, ethnically diverse training datasets to mitigate algorithmic bias, the "black box" nature of some complex models which complicates regulatory approval, and the critical need for interdisciplinary frameworks integrating computational science, clinical genetics, and bioethics. The ongoing research in 2024 is therefore not only technical but also socio-technical, focusing on creating transparent, equitable, and clinically actionable AI tools that can be seamlessly integrated into standard care pathways to fulfill the promise of a genetically-informed, personalized healthcare future.
