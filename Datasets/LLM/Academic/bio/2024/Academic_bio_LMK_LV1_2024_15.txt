Title: Unveiling Somatostatin's Antitumor Potential in Colorectal Cancer: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications

Abstract:
Somatostatin, a multifaceted peptide hormone, has garnered significant attention for its antitumor effects in colorectal cancer (CRC). As research advances, the intricate mechanisms underlying somatostatin's action via its receptors (sst) have become increasingly elucidated. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the antitumor activity of somatostatin and its analogues in CRC, with a focus on their impact on the tumor microenvironment. We examine the role of sst analogues in modulating key signaling pathways, influencing angiogenesis, and regulating immune responses within the tumor ecosystem. Furthermore, we discuss the therapeutic potential of somatostatin-based treatments, highlighting their capacity to enhance conventional CRC therapies. By exploring the complex interplay between somatostatin, sst receptors, and the CRC tumor microenvironment, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of somatostatin's antitumor effects, paving the way for innovative therapeutic strategies in CRC management.
