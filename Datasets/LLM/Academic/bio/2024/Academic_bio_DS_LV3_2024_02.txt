In recent years, the therapeutic potential of somatostatin (SST) and its synthetic analogues in colorectal cancer (CRC) has garnered significant attention, particularly regarding their multifaceted antitumor mechanisms. Current research, as of 2024, elucidates that these compounds exert inhibitory effects on tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis primarily through the modulation of key intracellular signaling cascades. A principal pathway implicated is the MAPK/ERK/AKT axis, where SST receptor activation leads to the suppression of mitogenic and survival signals, thereby inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting apoptosis in CRC cell lines. Concurrently, emerging evidence highlights the role of SST in antagonizing the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, a critical driver of colorectal carcinogenesis, through the downregulation of β-catenin transcriptional activity. Despite these promising mechanistic insights, the clinical application of SST analogues as monotherapeutic agents has demonstrated limited efficacy in advanced CRC patients, attributed to factors such as receptor subtype heterogeneity and compensatory pathway activation. Consequently, contemporary investigative efforts are increasingly directed towards combinatorial strategies, integrating SST analogues with conventional chemotherapeutics or targeted agents to overcome resistance and enhance therapeutic outcomes. This evolving paradigm underscores the necessity for further preclinical validation and biomarker-driven clinical trials to fully realize the translational promise of somatostatin-based interventions in colorectal oncology.
