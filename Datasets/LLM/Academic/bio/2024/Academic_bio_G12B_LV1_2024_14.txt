**Abstract:**

The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is a critical cellular process maintaining genomic integrity. While traditionally modeled as a diffusion-limited reaction governed by Brownian motion, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that DSB repair intermediates, particularly those involved in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), exhibit anomalous diffusion characteristics. This study proposes a novel theoretical framework integrating heterogeneous anomalous diffusion to more accurately describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of DSB repair and predict the occurrence of misrepair events. We develop a mathematical model wherein repair factors exhibit a range of anomalous diffusion coefficients, reflecting variations in their binding affinities, chromatin environment, and molecular crowding. This heterogeneity is crucial as it allows for the capture of sub-diffusive and super-diffusive behaviors observed *in vivo*. Specifically, we demonstrate that the distribution of diffusion coefficients directly influences the probability of error-prone NHEJ outcomes.  Our simulations reveal a strong correlation between regions of high molecular crowding and increased misrepair frequency.  Furthermore, the model predicts that transient, localized fluctuations in chromatin structure can significantly alter the effective diffusion of repair factors, impacting repair fidelity. This framework provides a mechanistic basis for understanding how the complex microenvironment surrounding DSBs modulates repair pathways and offers a predictive tool to assess genomic instability risks in various biological contexts. Future work will focus on validating these predictions through single-molecule tracking experiments and incorporating dynamic chromatin remodeling processes into the model.
