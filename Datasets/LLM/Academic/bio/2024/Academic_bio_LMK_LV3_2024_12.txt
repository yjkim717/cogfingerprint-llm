Title: Advancing Single-Cell Trajectory Inference with Chronocell: A Biophysically Informed Process Time Model

Abstract:
The advent of single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular dynamics, yet inferring cellular trajectories remains a significant challenge. Traditional 'pseudotime' approaches, while useful, lack a direct physical interpretation, hindering the extraction of meaningful biological insights. In response, we introduce Chronocell, a novel 'process time' model that redefines trajectory inference through a biophysically informed framework. By integrating single-cell genomics data with fundamental biophysical principles, Chronocell provides a more accurate and interpretable representation of cellular processes. Our model enables the quantification of process time, a variable that directly correlates with the progression of cellular events. Through rigorous validation and application to diverse datasets, we demonstrate Chronocell's superiority over existing methods, offering a transformative tool for elucidating complex biological processes at the single-cell level. As single-cell genomics continues to evolve, Chronocell is poised to significantly advance our understanding of cellular dynamics in 2024 and beyond.
