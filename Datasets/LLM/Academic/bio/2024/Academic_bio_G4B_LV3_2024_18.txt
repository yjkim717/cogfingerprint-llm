**Abstract**

Recent genomic analyses of avian influenza viruses circulating across Europe in 2024 have illuminated the dynamic evolutionary landscape of H5Nx strains.  A comprehensive investigation of 1,956 viral genomes, predominantly belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b, demonstrated substantial genetic diversity and a notable propensity for reassortment events.  These findings suggest a complex evolutionary trajectory driven by host adaptation, potentially leading to the emergence of geographically distinct and antigenically divergent genotypes.  Specifically, the prevalence of novel H5Nx variants underscores the limitations of relying solely on phylogenetic models for predicting future spread.  Further research is critically needed to characterize the mechanisms driving reassortment and host specialization within this clade, informing targeted surveillance strategies and bolstering pandemic preparedness efforts in the face of evolving avian influenza threats across the European continent.
