**Abstract**

Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant clinical challenge, necessitating continued investigation into novel therapeutic strategies. This review synthesizes current understanding of somatostatin’s antitumor effects within CRC, with particular emphasis on its modulation of key intracellular signaling cascades. We explore the intricate relationship between somatostatin and the MAPK/ERK/AKT pathway, a critical regulator of cell proliferation and survival, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, frequently aberrantly activated in CRC progression. Emerging evidence suggests somatostatin can effectively inhibit these pathways, thereby attenuating tumor growth and inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, this study considers the expanding role of somatostatin within the complex tumor microenvironment, investigating its interactions with stromal cells and immune populations.  Finally, we address recent research indicating potential microbiome-mediated influences on somatostatin’s efficacy, proposing a multi-faceted approach to harnessing its therapeutic potential. Future research should prioritize elucidating the precise mechanisms governing these interactions to optimize somatostatin-based interventions in CRC treatment.
