**Abstract**

The accelerating pace of anthropogenic climate change has intensified the search for mechanisms that buffer biodiversity against macroclimatic shifts. This review synthesizes recent advances in **microclimate ecology** and **biogeography**, arguing that a mechanistic understanding of fine-scale climatic variation is critical for predicting species responses and informing effective conservation strategies. We posit that terrestrial **microclimates**, decoupled from free-air conditions by complex terrain, vegetation structure, and substrate properties, constitute a fundamental yet often overlooked dimension of ecological complexity. A primary focus is the role of **microrefugia**—stable, buffered microsites—in enhancing species persistence by providing local habitats that remain suitable even as regional climates become inhospitable. The proliferation of high-resolution **microclimate modelling** techniques, coupled with advances in sensor technology and remote sensing, now enables the quantification of these phenomena at ecologically relevant scales. However, significant knowledge gaps persist, particularly in translating modelled microclimate data into robust forecasts of population dynamics, community reassembly, and ecosystem function. We conclude that integrating microclimate science into mainstream ecological theory and **ecosystem management** is no longer optional but essential. Future research must prioritize bridging the scale gap between microclimatic measurements and macroecological patterns, thereby refining our capacity to identify and protect resilient landscapes in an era of rapid global change.
