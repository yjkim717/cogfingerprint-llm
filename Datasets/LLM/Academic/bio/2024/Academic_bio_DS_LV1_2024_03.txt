Of the myriad fungal species capable of lignocellulose degradation, the white-rot basidiomycete *Pleurotus ostreatus* has emerged as a preeminent model organism, owing to its sophisticated and adaptable genetic toolkit. This review synthesizes recent advancements in the molecular genetics of *P. ostreatus*, with a particular focus on the application of CRISPR-Cas9 and other genome editing technologies to elucidate the complex enzymatic machinery governing wood component deconstruction. We detail how targeted gene knockouts and promoter engineering have precisely delineated the roles of specific lignin-modifying peroxidases, lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases, and accessory enzymes in the synergistic breakdown of plant biomass. Furthermore, we explore the burgeoning field of *P. ostreatus* protein engineering, where rational design and directed evolution are being leveraged to enhance enzyme thermostability, catalytic efficiency, and substrate specificity for industrial biocatalysis. The integration of these genetic approaches not only deepens our fundamental understanding of fungal physiology and developmental pathways but also positions *P. ostreatus* as a versatile cellular platform for the sustainable production of biofuels, biomaterials, and high-value chemicals from lignocellulosic waste streams.
