Title: Advancing Cancer Genomics Research through Integrative Analysis with UCSC Xena: A Multi-Omic Data Visualization Platform


#### Abstract

The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized the field of cancer genomics, yielding a vast array of multi-omic data that necessitate sophisticated analytical tools for comprehensive understanding. In response to this challenge, we leverage UCSC Xena, a robust web-based platform designed for the visual integration and analysis of diverse cancer genomics datasets. By facilitating the simultaneous examination of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data, UCSC Xena enables researchers to elucidate complex biological interactions and identify novel patterns of tumorigenesis. This platform supports a wide range of data types, including but not limited to, DNA sequencing, RNA expression, and DNA methylation profiles, thereby providing a holistic view of cancer biology. Key features of UCSC Xena include its capacity for differential gene expression analysis, survival analysis, and correlation analysis across multiple datasets, empowering investigators to contextualize their findings within large-scale cancer genomics studies. By streamlining the analytical process and enhancing data visualization, UCSC Xena fosters a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of cancer and accelerates the translation of genomic insights into clinical applications. As the cancer genomics landscape continues to evolve, platforms like UCSC Xena will remain indispensable for researchers seeking to unravel the complexities of tumor biology and uncover novel therapeutic targets. As of 2024, UCSC Xena stands as a pivotal resource in the ongoing quest to decipher the intricacies of cancer genomics.
