**Title: *Pleurotus ostreatus*: An Emerging Model System for Fungal Molecular Genetics and Biotechnological Innovation**

**Abstract:**

*Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom) is increasingly recognized as a compelling model organism within fungal molecular biology. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding the genetic architecture of *P. ostreatus*, facilitated by the completion and refinement of its genome sequence. While initial sequencing efforts provided a foundational resource, contemporary research leverages this data for targeted gene knockout studies and transcriptomic analyses, revealing intricate regulatory networks governing key biological processes.  Specifically, investigations into fruiting body development, polysaccharide production, and ligninolytic enzyme activity are demonstrating the power of this model system.  Furthermore, the relatively facile genetic manipulation of *P. ostreatus* compared to other fungal species, coupled with its rapid growth rate and established cultivation practices, presents significant advantages for functional genomics. This review examines current methodologies employed in *P. ostreatus* molecular genetics, including CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing and heterologous expression systems. We highlight applications extending beyond basic research, encompassing bioremediation, sustainable materials production, and the development of novel bioactive compounds.  Future research directions should focus on comprehensive phenotyping of knockout mutants, elucidating the complex interplay of genes within metabolic pathways, and exploring the potential for strain improvement through targeted genetic modifications to enhance biotechnological applications.
