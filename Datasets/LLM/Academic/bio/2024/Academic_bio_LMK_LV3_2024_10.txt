Title: Enhancing Peptide Identification in Data-Dependent Acquisition Mass Spectrometry with MSFragger-DDA+

Abstract:
Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mass spectrometry remains a cornerstone of proteomics research, yet its efficacy is often compromised by the presence of chimeric spectra resulting from co-fragmented peptides. To address this challenge, we introduce MSFragger-DDA+, a novel database search algorithm designed to augment peptide identification sensitivity in DDA datasets. By leveraging advanced spectral deconvolution techniques, MSFragger-DDA+ accurately detects and identifies co-fragmented peptides, thereby enhancing the overall proteome coverage. Our results demonstrate that MSFragger-DDA+ significantly outperforms existing algorithms in identifying peptides from complex biological samples. The improved sensitivity and accuracy of MSFragger-DDA+ have far-reaching implications for proteomics research, enabling the detection of low-abundance proteins and facilitating a deeper understanding of cellular processes. As the field continues to evolve, MSFragger-DDA+ is poised to become an indispensable tool for researchers seeking to elucidate the intricacies of the proteome. (2024)
