Title: Advancing Microclimate Ecology and Biogeography for Biodiversity Conservation in a Changing Climate

Abstract: Microclimate ecology has emerged as a crucial discipline for understanding the complex interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and climate change. As global temperatures continue to rise, microclimates play an increasingly important role in mediating the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. Recent research has highlighted the significance of microclimates in shaping species distributions, community composition, and ecosystem processes. However, significant knowledge gaps remain in our understanding of microclimate-ecosystem interactions. This review synthesizes current knowledge on microclimate ecology and biogeography, identifying key research directions for the field. We discuss the implications of microclimate research for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management, highlighting the need for fine-scale climate data and predictive models. By advancing our understanding of microclimate ecology, we can develop more effective strategies for conserving biodiversity in a rapidly changing world (2024).
