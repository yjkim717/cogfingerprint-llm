**Abstract**

Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant clinical challenge, necessitating continued investigation into novel therapeutic strategies. This review synthesizes current evidence regarding the antitumor effects of somatostatin (SST), specifically examining its modulation of key signaling pathways within the tumor microenvironment. We posit that SST influences CRC progression through interactions with MAPK/ERK/AKT cascades, potentially attenuating cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, SST demonstrates anti-angiogenic properties, inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and subsequently reducing neovascularization – a critical factor in tumor growth and metastasis. However, clinical application of SST analogues has been hampered by limited efficacy.  Future research must prioritize elucidating the complex interplay between SST and the tumor microenvironment, including stromal cell interactions and immune cell modulation.  Targeted investigation into SST’s effects on specific CRC subtypes and the development of novel SST delivery systems represent promising avenues for enhancing antitumor activity and ultimately improving patient outcomes by overcoming current therapeutic limitations.
