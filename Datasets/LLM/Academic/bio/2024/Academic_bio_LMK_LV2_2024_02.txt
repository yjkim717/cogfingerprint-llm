Title: Unveiling the Antitumor Potential of Somatostatin and its Analogues in Colorectal Cancer: A Mechanistic Insight

Abstract:
Colorectal cancer remains a significant global health burden, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies. Somatostatin, a naturally occurring peptide hormone, has garnered attention for its antitumor properties. This review elucidates the mechanisms underlying somatostatin's antitumor effects in colorectal cancer, with a focus on its synthetic analogues (sst analogues). By modulating the tumor microenvironment, somatostatin and its analogues exert anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic, and pro-apoptotic effects, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. The expression of somatostatin receptors in colorectal cancer cells facilitates the targeted action of sst analogues, which have shown promise in preclinical and clinical studies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of somatostatin's role in colorectal cancer, highlighting its therapeutic potential and the future directions for research into sst analogues as a viable treatment option. By exploring the intricate relationships between somatostatin, tumor biology, and the microenvironment, this review aims to contribute to the development of innovative therapeutic approaches.
