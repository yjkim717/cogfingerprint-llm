Of note, the design of bio-inspired molecular catalysts often seeks to emulate the precise electronic and structural control found in enzymatic active sites. Here, we report a synthetic metalloprotein, constructed via cobalt-directed assembly within a de novo designed four-helix bundle, that functions as a highly efficient catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses confirm that the cobalt centers modulate the electronic structure of a proximal, non-heme iron site, effectively generating a high-valent Fe(IV)=O species as the catalytic intermediate. This synergistic metal-ion cooperation lowers the kinetic overpotential and optimizes the binding energy of oxygenated intermediates, mirroring principles observed in inorganic perovskites. The engineered protein catalyst demonstrates a turnover frequency exceeding that of the heterogeneous benchmark IrOâ‚‚, while maintaining exceptional stability under physiological conditions. This work establishes a new paradigm for engineering multi-metallic cooperativity in protein scaffolds for sustainable energy conversion.
