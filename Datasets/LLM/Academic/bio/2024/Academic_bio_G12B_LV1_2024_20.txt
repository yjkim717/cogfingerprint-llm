**Abstract: The Expanding Role of Microclimate Ecology and Microrefugia in Biodiversity Conservation Under Accelerating Climate Change**

The escalating impacts of global climate change necessitate a paradigm shift in biodiversity conservation strategies, moving beyond broad-scale approaches to incorporate the crucial role of microclimates and microrefugia. This review synthesizes recent advances in microclimate ecology and biogeography, emphasizing their significance as critical determinants of species persistence and ecosystem resilience in a rapidly changing world. We examine the theoretical framework underpinning microclimate ecology, detailing how localized environmental conditions – including temperature, humidity, solar radiation, and wind – can deviate substantially from macroclimatic averages, creating heterogeneous habitats that buffer species against extreme events.  Furthermore, we explore the concept of microrefugia, spatially discrete areas offering more stable or favorable microclimatic conditions, acting as vital havens for vulnerable populations and facilitating range shifts.

Recent methodological innovations in data acquisition, particularly the deployment of high-resolution sensor networks, drone-based thermal imagery, and remote sensing techniques, are revolutionizing our ability to characterize microclimates at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales. Concurrently, advancements in microclimate modelling, integrating biophysical processes with species-specific physiological tolerances, are enabling predictive assessments of microrefugium suitability and potential for climate change adaptation.  We highlight the growing application of process-based models, incorporating factors such as topography, vegetation structure, and soil properties, to forecast microclimate responses to future climate scenarios.

However, significant knowledge gaps remain.  A critical need exists for improved integration of microclimate data into landscape-scale conservation planning, particularly in understanding how microrefugia networks function and interact to support regional biodiversity. Furthermore, research into the evolutionary and adaptive responses of species to microclimatic variation is crucial. This review underscores the importance of incorporating microclimate ecology into ecosystem management practices, advocating for strategies that enhance microrefugium quality and connectivity to bolster biodiversity conservation in the face of ongoing climate change. Future research should prioritize the development of scalable modeling approaches and the incorporation of biotic feedbacks within microclimate models to improve predictive accuracy and inform effective conservation interventions.
