**Abstract**

The efficient and controlled generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is increasingly recognized as a critical regulator of cellular signaling and stress responses. This study investigates the potential of a cobalt-doped SrIrO₃ (Co-SrIrO₃) composite material as a biomimetic catalyst for ROS production under acidic conditions. We hypothesize that strategic co-doping can selectively activate iridium oxide (IrOx) sites, mimicking enzymatic redox mechanisms observed within biological systems. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we demonstrate that Co-SrIrO₃ exhibits enhanced activity in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) compared to pristine SrIrO₃.  Specifically, Co incorporation appears to stabilize and promote IrOx formation, driving a measurable increase in ROS generation.  These findings suggest a pathway towards engineering synthetic catalysts with tailored redox capabilities, offering potential applications in studying oxidative stress and developing novel therapeutic strategies.
