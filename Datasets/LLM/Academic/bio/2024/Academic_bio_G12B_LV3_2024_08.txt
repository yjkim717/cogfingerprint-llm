**Abstract:**

The accelerating accumulation of multi-omic data within cancer research presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant analytical challenges. Addressing this bottleneck, the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Xena platform continues to evolve as a pivotal resource for the integrative visualization and exploration of cancer genomics data. This work highlights recent advancements within Xena, emphasizing its expanded capabilities for analyzing complex datasets, particularly those incorporating clinical annotations and emerging single-cell genomic profiles. Xena’s core functionality enables researchers to readily query and visualize genomic data spanning DNA sequencing, RNA expression, copy number variation, and epigenetic modifications, facilitating the identification of potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Furthermore, the platform’s user-friendly interface allows for interactive exploration of these data layers in conjunction with patient-level clinical information, fostering hypothesis generation and enabling robust validation of findings. Recent updates demonstrate enhanced support for single-cell data visualization, allowing for the dissection of tumor heterogeneity and the identification of rare cell populations driving disease progression.  The accessibility and scalability of Xena, coupled with its continuous development to incorporate cutting-edge analytical tools, solidify its role as an indispensable resource for the cancer genomics community.  Future directions include the integration of spatial transcriptomics data and the development of advanced machine learning pipelines within the Xena environment to unlock deeper biological insights and accelerate the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical applications. The ongoing refinement of Xena remains critical for maximizing the utility of vast cancer genomics datasets in the era of precision medicine.
