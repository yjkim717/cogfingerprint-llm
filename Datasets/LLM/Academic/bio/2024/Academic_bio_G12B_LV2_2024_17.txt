Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a bio-focused journal publication, based on the provided keywords and summary. I've aimed for approximately 328 words and adhered to a structured, reasoned argument typical of academic writing in 2024.  I've also included some potential journal targets at the bottom, as that can influence style.

**Abstract: The Convergence of Artificial Intelligence and Genetics: Transforming Research, Drug Discovery, and Clinical Precision**

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, is fundamentally reshaping the landscape of genetic research and its translational applications. This review synthesizes the current state and explores prospective trajectories of AI integration within genetics, focusing on its transformative potential across foundational research, pharmaceutical development, and clinical practice.  Historically, analyzing complex genomic data has been limited by computational constraints and the inherent challenges of identifying subtle patterns indicative of disease susceptibility or therapeutic response. AI methodologies, however, provide unprecedented capabilities for processing vast datasets including whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomic profiles, and proteomic analyses, enabling the discovery of novel genetic variants and their functional relationships with phenotypic outcomes.

We examine the application of ML algorithms in accelerating gene therapy development, specifically in optimizing vector design, predicting off-target effects, and enhancing gene editing precision via CRISPR-Cas systems. Further, the review details how DL models are being leveraged to predict protein structure and function from genomic sequences, facilitating target identification and drug design.  The role of AI in personalized medicine is also critically assessed, analyzing its utility in predicting individual responses to pharmacogenomic interventions and tailoring therapeutic strategies based on genomic profiles.  Current limitations, including data bias, the “black box” nature of some DL models, and the need for robust validation strategies, are discussed.  Finally, we propose future research directions, emphasizing the importance of developing explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enhance transparency and trustworthiness in genetic AI applications, alongside the exploration of federated learning techniques to overcome data accessibility challenges while preserving patient privacy. The convergence of AI and genetics holds immense promise for advancing our understanding of biological systems and revolutionizing healthcare delivery.
