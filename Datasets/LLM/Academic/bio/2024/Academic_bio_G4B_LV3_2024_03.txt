**Abstract**

*Pleurotus ostreatus*, commonly known as the oyster mushroom, is increasingly recognized as a compelling model organism within biological research.  Recent technological breakthroughs, specifically accelerated genome sequencing and refined molecular genetic methodologies, have propelled *P. ostreatus* to the forefront of investigations into fundamental cell biology and genetic mechanisms. This review synthesizes current research demonstrating the organism’s utility. Notably, its rapid growth rate, ease of cultivation, and relative genomic accessibility offer significant advantages compared to traditional model systems.  Further, the mushroom’s complex cellular architecture and demonstrated capacity for induced genetic modifications are facilitating detailed studies of morphogenesis, stress response, and secondary metabolite production.  Continued exploration of *P. ostreatus*’s genetic landscape promises to yield valuable insights applicable to diverse fields, including fungal biotechnology and human health research by 2026.
