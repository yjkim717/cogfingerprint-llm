Title: Advancing Microclimate Ecology and Biogeography: Understanding Terrestrial Ecosystem Responses to Climate Change for Effective Biodiversity Conservation

Abstract:

Microclimate ecology and biogeography have emerged as crucial disciplines in understanding the complex interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and climate change. As global temperatures continue to rise, the need to elucidate the mechanisms governing microclimatic variability and its impacts on biodiversity has become increasingly pressing. This review synthesizes current research in microclimate ecology and biogeography, highlighting the significance of these fields in predicting and mitigating the effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. We examine the role of microclimates in shaping species distributions, community composition, and ecosystem processes, and discuss the implications of microclimatic heterogeneity for biodiversity conservation. Furthermore, we identify key knowledge gaps and methodological limitations that must be addressed to advance our understanding of microclimate-ecosystem interactions. By integrating insights from microclimate ecology and biogeography, we can develop more effective conservation strategies that account for the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems. As we move forward in the Anthropocene, a nuanced understanding of microclimate-ecosystem interactions will be essential for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of microclimate ecology and biogeography, and charts a course for future research in these rapidly evolving fields (2024).
