**Abstract**

The efficient and sustainable oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical bottleneck in numerous electrochemical processes. This study investigates the impact of cobalt co-doping on the catalytic performance of SrIrO₃ perovskite materials, aiming to elucidate surface oxygen activation mechanisms. Utilizing a systematic Co-doping approach, we synthesized SrIrₓCoᲝO₃ samples and evaluated their OER activity under acidic conditions via linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Results demonstrate a significant enhancement in catalytic efficiency, attributed to the synergistic effect of Ir and Co dopants. Specifically, Co incorporation facilitates the formation of active oxygen sites, reducing the overpotential required for OER. Density functional theory calculations further support these findings, identifying altered electronic structure and interfacial oxygen species. These observations suggest a pathway for rationally designing high-performance perovskite catalysts for sustainable energy applications, with implications for advanced water splitting technologies in 2024 and beyond.
