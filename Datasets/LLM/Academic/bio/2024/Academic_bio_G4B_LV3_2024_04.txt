**Abstract**

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genomics presents a transformative opportunity for personalized healthcare. This study investigates the escalating integration of machine learning (ML) and, specifically, deep learning (DL) methodologies within the field of genetics, focusing on its implications for precision medicine.  We examine how AI algorithms are increasingly utilized to analyze complex genomic datasets – encompassing whole-genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and epigenomics – to predict disease susceptibility, stratify patient populations, and tailor therapeutic interventions.  Furthermore, the potential of AI to accelerate drug discovery by identifying novel drug targets and predicting drug response based on individual genetic profiles is explored.  However, this burgeoning field necessitates careful consideration of inherent challenges, including data bias, algorithmic interpretability, and the ethical implications of utilizing genetic information.  Ultimately, this work underscores the critical need for robust validation and responsible implementation of AI-driven approaches to ensure equitable and effective precision genetic disease treatment, clinical care, and pharmaceutical development in the coming years.
