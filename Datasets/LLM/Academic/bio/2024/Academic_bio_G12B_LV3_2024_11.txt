**Abstract**

Early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease (PD) remains a significant clinical challenge. This study, conducted in 2024, leverages advancements in proteomics to identify novel biomarkers predictive of PD onset and progression. A comprehensive analysis of multiple biofluids, utilizing high-resolution mass spectrometry, revealed DOPA decarboxylase (DDC) as a particularly promising candidate, alongside a cohort of differentially expressed proteins. Elevated DDC levels were consistently observed in preclinical stages, suggesting a potential role in early disease detection. Further investigation into the proteomic landscape identified pathways related to mitochondrial function and neuroinflammation, providing insights into the underlying pathophysiology of PD. These findings underscore the utility of proteomics-based biomarker discovery for improved diagnostic accuracy and prognostic stratification in PD, facilitating targeted therapeutic interventions and advancing translational research efforts.
