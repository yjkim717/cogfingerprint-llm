**Abstract:**

Single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized our ability to characterize cellular heterogeneity and infer developmental or differentiation trajectories. However, existing trajectory inference methods often lack a robust framework for explicitly modeling the temporal dimension of cellular change, frequently treating cells as static snapshots along a continuum. Here, we introduce Chronocell, a novel computational model that addresses this limitation by incorporating a biophysical concept of 'process time'—the duration a cell spends undergoing a particular biological transition—directly into trajectory inference. Chronocell leverages single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to simultaneously cluster cells and estimate their process times along inferred trajectories. The model is founded on the assumption that transcriptional states reflect the integrated effects of preceding biophysical processes, and utilizes a stochastic differential equation framework to model temporal dynamics. Unlike traditional methods that rely on pseudotime ordering based solely on transcriptional similarity, Chronocell estimates time elapsed *within* a biological process, allowing for the identification of branching points and rate variations across cellular populations. We demonstrate Chronocell’s efficacy using simulated datasets and experimental scRNA-seq data from murine embryonic stem cell differentiation, revealing nuanced temporal patterns previously obscured by conventional approaches.  This framework provides a powerful tool for dissecting dynamic biological processes, offering a deeper mechanistic understanding of cellular fate decisions and opening new avenues for investigating developmental biology, disease progression, and therapeutic interventions. Future work will focus on extending Chronocell to incorporate spatial transcriptomics data and modeling multi-cellular interactions.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Tone:** I used phrases like "Here, we introduce," "demonstrate efficacy," "robust framework," and avoided contractions to maintain a formal, academic tone.
*   **Precise Terminology:** I included specific terms like "single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)," "stochastic differential equation," "pseudotime," and "cellular heterogeneity" to signal expertise and accuracy.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow:
    *   **Context/Problem:** Briefly establishes the current limitations of trajectory inference.
    *   **Solution/Innovation:** Introduces Chronocell and its core concept of process time.
    *   **Methodology:** Briefly describes the underlying principles (stochastic differential equations).
    *   **Results/Demonstration:** Mentions validation through simulations and experimental data, highlighting a key benefit (identifying branching points).
    *   **Significance/Future Directions:**  Discusses the broader implications and outlines potential future research.
*   **2024 Context:**  The language and focus reflect current trends in single-cell biology, such as the increasing interest in incorporating biophysical principles and the desire for more mechanistic models.  Mentioning spatial transcriptomics acknowledges a burgeoning field.
*   **Word Count:** The abstract is approximately 247 words, fulfilling the request.
