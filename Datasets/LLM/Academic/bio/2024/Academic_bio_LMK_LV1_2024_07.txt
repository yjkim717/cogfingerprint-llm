Title: Integrating Microclimate Ecology into Biogeography: Implications for Terrestrial Ecosystem Conservation under Climate Change

Abstract:
As the global climate continues to shift in 2024, understanding the intricate relationships between microclimates, organisms, and ecosystems is crucial for predicting and mitigating biodiversity loss. Microclimate ecology, a rapidly evolving field, has made significant strides in elucidating the complex interactions between microclimatic conditions and terrestrial organisms. By integrating microclimate ecology into biogeography, researchers can better comprehend the spatial and temporal dynamics of ecosystems. This synthesis highlights the importance of microclimate-organism interactions in shaping ecosystem processes and informing conservation strategies. We discuss recent advances in microclimate research, including the role of microtopography, vegetation structure, and soil properties in modulating microclimates. Furthermore, we outline future directions for research, emphasizing the need for spatially explicit models that incorporate microclimatic heterogeneity to improve predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change. By doing so, we can develop more effective conservation and management strategies for terrestrial ecosystems.
