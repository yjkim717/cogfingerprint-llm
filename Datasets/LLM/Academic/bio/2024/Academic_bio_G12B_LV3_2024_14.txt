**Abstract**

DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose a significant threat to genomic integrity, necessitating robust repair mechanisms such as non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). While conventional models depict DSB-end dynamics as Brownian motion, accumulating evidence suggests subdiffusive behavior. This study introduces a novel computational framework incorporating heterogeneous anomalous diffusion to more accurately model DSB-end trajectories during NHEJ in 2024. Our model integrates rare, long-range directed movements alongside persistent random walks, accounting for the observed subdiffusive dynamics. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this heterogeneous diffusion regime can facilitate the formation of dicentric chromosome lesions, a hallmark of NHEJ-related misrepair. This refined understanding of DSB-end dynamics offers critical insights into the mechanisms governing NHEJ fidelity and potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
