**Abstract**

The accelerating impacts of climate change on global biodiversity necessitate a refined understanding of ecological processes operating at spatial scales smaller than macroclimates. This review synthesizes contemporary research exploring the critical role of microclimate ecology and biogeography in mediating species responses to broader climatic shifts. We examine how microclimatic refugia, heterogeneity, and buffering effects influence species distributions, persistence, and adaptive potential, particularly within the context of ongoing environmental change. Furthermore, we assess advancements in data acquisition methodologies—including high-resolution remote sensing and micro-sensor networks—and their integration into predictive ecological models. The review highlights the growing sophistication of computational approaches for characterizing microclimatic variability and projecting its impact on biodiversity patterns. Finally, we identify key knowledge gaps, including the need for improved mechanistic understanding of microclimate-mediated physiological tolerances and the development of spatially explicit conservation strategies that prioritize the preservation and restoration of microclimatic diversity to enhance ecosystem resilience in a rapidly changing world.



I aimed for a formal tone, incorporated the keywords naturally, and structured the argument to reflect a review article’s purpose (synthesis, assessment, and identification of future directions).
