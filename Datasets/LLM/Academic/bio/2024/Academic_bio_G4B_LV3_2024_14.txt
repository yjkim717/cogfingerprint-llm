**Abstract**

The non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, critical for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, is frequently associated with genomic instability and chromosome aberrations, particularly following ionizing radiation exposure.  This study proposes a novel mechanistic framework utilizing a heterogeneous anomalous diffusion model to account for the observed subdiffusive and infrequent long-range movements of DNA ends during NHEJ.  We hypothesize that this “fractional Brownian motion” behavior reflects the stochasticity inherent in the repair process and contributes to the formation of dicentric chromosome lesions.  Specifically, the model incorporates spatial heterogeneity in repair factors and obstacles, predicting deviations from classical Brownian motion.  Computational simulations demonstrate that this anomalous diffusion significantly impacts DSB resolution fidelity, increasing the likelihood of misrepair events.  Further research will investigate the influence of chromatin structure on this phenomenon, potentially offering insights into targeted therapeutic interventions for mitigating radiation-induced genomic damage in 2024 and beyond.
