Title: Unraveling the Evolutionary Dynamics of HPAI A(H5Nx) Clade 2.3.4.4b Viruses in European Wild Bird Populations

Abstract:
The ongoing circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5Nx) viruses, specifically clade 2.3.4.4b, poses significant threats to animal and human health. By analyzing 1,956 European HPAI A(H5Nx) virus genomes, this study elucidates the complex evolutionary dynamics underlying the persistence of these viruses in wild bird populations. Our results reveal extensive genetic diversity, with frequent reassortment events contributing to the emergence of novel genotypes. Notably, a newly identified gull-adapted genotype has driven the endemicity of HPAI A(H5Nx) viruses in European wild birds. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this genotype has undergone significant adaptation, potentially enhancing its transmissibility and stability within avian hosts. These findings underscore the need for continued surveillance and molecular epidemiological studies to predict and mitigate the risks associated with HPAI A(H5Nx) virus evolution. As of 2024, understanding these dynamics remains crucial for informing public health strategies and mitigating the impact of avian influenza on global health security.
