**Abstract**

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genomic sciences is rapidly transforming biomedical research and clinical practice. This study examines the burgeoning integration of advanced AI methodologies, specifically machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), within the domains of genetic engineering, gene therapy, and personalized medicine.  We synthesize current literature to demonstrate AI’s accelerating impact across multiple facets of genetics, including enhanced target identification for drug discovery, prediction of gene editing outcomes, and the optimization of gene therapy vector design. 

Recent advancements in DL algorithms, coupled with the exponential growth of genomic datasets, are facilitating the de novo design of therapeutic interventions with unprecedented precision. Furthermore, AI-driven predictive models are being deployed to stratify patient populations for gene therapy trials, potentially mitigating adverse events and improving treatment efficacy.  However, this integration presents significant challenges.  Data bias, algorithmic transparency, and the ethical considerations surrounding the application of AI in altering the human genome require careful scrutiny.  Future research must prioritize robust validation strategies and address potential limitations to ensure responsible and equitable implementation of these transformative technologies by 2028.
