Title: Somatostatin and its Analogues in Colorectal Cancer: Unveiling Anti-Tumor Effects through Modulation of the Tumor Microenvironment

Abstract:

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a significant global health burden, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. Somatostatin (SST), a naturally occurring peptide hormone, has garnered attention for its potential anti-tumor properties. This review elucidates the state-of-the-art mechanisms underlying SST's antitumor effects in CRC, with a focus on its analogues (sst analogues). SST exerts its effects by binding to specific receptors (SSTRs) overexpressed on CRC cells and within the tumor microenvironment (TME). The activation of SSTRs triggers anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic cascades, ultimately inhibiting tumor growth. Sst analogues, designed to overcome SST's short half-life, have demonstrated promising anti-tumor efficacy in preclinical and clinical settings. By modulating the TME, sst analogues suppress angiogenesis, immune evasion, and metastasis. This review synthesizes current knowledge on SST's role in CRC, highlighting the therapeutic potential of sst analogues in targeting the complex interplay between cancer cells and their microenvironment. As research continues to uncover the intricacies of SST's anti-tumor effects, its analogues may emerge as valuable adjuncts in CRC treatment.
