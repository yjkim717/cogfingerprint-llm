**Abstract**

Radiation-induced DNA damage, particularly radiation-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs), presents a significant challenge to genomic stability. Following irradiation, the predominant repair pathway, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), is frequently associated with error-prone outcomes, including dicentric chromosome lesions. This study investigates the complex dynamics of DNA repair following radiation exposure, proposing a novel mechanistic framework incorporating anomalous diffusion processes. We hypothesize that rare, long-range movements within the repair machinery contribute to deviations from classical Brownian motion, manifesting as a fractional Brownian motion (fBM) model.  This fBM component is theorized to facilitate the propagation of damage and influence the formation of anomalous lesion distributions.  Computational modeling demonstrates that integrating such long-range diffusion effectively accounts for observed misrepair rates and the generation of structurally aberrant chromosome lesions.  Further research will explore the specific cellular factors governing these anomalous movements and their broader implications for genomic integrity.
