**Abstract: *Pleurotus ostreatus* as a Rising Model Organism for Molecular Genetic Studies â€“ A 2024 Perspective**

*Pleurotus ostreatus* (Oyster mushroom) is increasingly recognized as a valuable model organism within biological research, exhibiting a confluence of characteristics that facilitate advancements in molecular genetics. This review examines the burgeoning utilization of *P. ostreatus* in genomic investigation, spurred by recent developments in high-throughput sequencing and gene editing technologies. Comparative genomics, enabled by increasingly accessible genome sequencing data, provides unique insights into fungal evolution and adaptation. Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas systems are demonstrating efficacy in targeted gene modification, allowing researchers to dissect complex biological pathways within this species. The relative ease of cultivation, coupled with its amenable genetic architecture, positions *P. ostreatus* as a compelling alternative to established model systems, promising significant contributions across diverse fields including mycology, plant pathology, and potentially, broader synthetic biology initiatives.
