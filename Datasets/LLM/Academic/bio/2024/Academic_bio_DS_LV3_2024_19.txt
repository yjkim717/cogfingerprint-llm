In the pursuit of sustainable hydrogen production via proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in acidic media remains a critical bottleneck. This study demonstrates that strategic cobalt doping into SrIrO3 perovskite oxides induces a synergistic electronic modulation, significantly enhancing electrocatalytic OER performance. Advanced spectroscopic and computational analyses reveal that Co-doping activates surface lattice oxygen participation and optimizes the binding energy of intermediates on IrOx active sites, thereby lowering the overpotential and accelerating reaction kinetics. The optimized Co-doped SrIrO3 catalyst exhibits exceptional durability and activity, substantially outperforming conventional IrO2 benchmarks. These findings provide a robust design principle for developing high-performance, cost-effective electrocatalysts, advancing the commercial viability of next-generation water-splitting technologies for clean energy storage.
