**Abstract**

*Pleurotus ostreatus*, commonly known as the oyster mushroom, is increasingly recognized as a compelling model organism within fungal biology and beyond. This review synthesizes recent advances utilizing molecular genetics and genome sequencing technologies to unlock the potential of *P. ostreatus*.  Specifically, we examine the application of gene editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas systems, to investigate fundamental biological processes – including morphogenesis, stress response, and secondary metabolite production – within this species.  The accessibility of *P. ostreatus*'s genome, coupled with its rapid growth rate and ease of cultivation, renders it advantageous for translational research.  Furthermore, its demonstrated capacity for producing valuable biomolecules positions it as a resource for material science innovation.  Continued exploration of *P. ostreatus*'s genetic architecture promises significant contributions to both basic biological understanding and the development of sustainable biotechnological applications by 2026.
