**Abstract**

Somatostatin (SST) and its synthetic analogues (SSTa) have emerged as promising candidates for targeted therapy in colorectal cancer (CRC), yet their precise antitumor mechanisms and clinical translatability remain incompletely defined. This review synthesizes recent advances elucidating the molecular pathways modulated by SST signaling in CRC pathogenesis. A primary focus is the inhibitory crosstalk between SST receptors (SSTRs) and the MAPK/ERK/AKT signaling axis, a critical driver of cellular proliferation and survival. We detail evidence demonstrating that SSTR activation attenuates this pathway, leading to suppressed tumor growth and enhanced apoptosis. Concurrently, we explore the nuanced interaction with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, where SST signaling appears to promote the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of β-catenin, thereby impeding a fundamental oncogenic cascade in CRC. Despite these compelling preclinical findings that underscore a potent multimodal antitumor effect, the clinical application of SSTa has yielded limited success. This discrepancy highlights a critical knowledge gap concerning tumor-specific SSTR subtype expression, pharmacokinetic challenges of current analogues, and potential compensatory resistance mechanisms. This analysis concludes that future therapeutic development must prioritize next-generation SSTa with improved receptor affinity and stability to effectively translate robust mechanistic insights into tangible clinical benefits for CRC patients.
