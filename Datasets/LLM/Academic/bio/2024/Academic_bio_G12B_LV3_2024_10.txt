**Abstract**

The increasing complexity of proteomic investigations necessitates continuous refinement of data analysis pipelines to maximize peptide identification rates, especially for low-abundance proteins. This study introduces MSFragger-DDA+, a novel database search algorithm integrated within the FragPipe software environment, designed to address limitations in traditional data-dependent acquisition (DDA) workflows. MSFragger-DDA+ leverages advanced co-fragmentation constraints during database searching, significantly improving the identification of peptides originating from precursor ions that fragment in a correlated manner. Preliminary benchmarking analyses utilizing diverse proteomic datasets demonstrate a substantial increase in peptide identification sensitivity compared to standard search engines, particularly when analyzing samples containing low-abundance proteins or those exhibiting complex post-translational modifications. The implementation of MSFragger-DDA+ represents a significant advancement in quantitative proteomics, enabling more comprehensive proteome coverage and facilitating deeper biological insights. Further development and validation are ongoing to optimize performance across varied experimental conditions and instrumentation platforms, with anticipated broad applicability in 2024 and beyond.
