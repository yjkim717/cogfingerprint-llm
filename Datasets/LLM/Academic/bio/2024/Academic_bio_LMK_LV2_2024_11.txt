Title: Unveiling Novel Biomarkers for Early Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis through Multi-Platform Proteomics Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid

Abstract:

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. Early diagnosis and monitoring of PD remain challenging due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. Recent advancements in proteomics have enabled the identification of potential biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), offering a promising avenue for improving PD diagnosis and management. This study employed a multi-platform proteomics approach to investigate CSF protein profiles in PD patients, aiming to identify novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and disease monitoring.

Using a combination of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics, we analyzed CSF samples from 120 PD patients and 100 healthy controls. Our comprehensive proteomics analysis revealed a total of 2,500 proteins, of which 150 were differentially expressed between PD patients and controls. Notably, our results highlighted the upregulation of Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC), the enzyme responsible for converting L-DOPA to dopamine, in PD patients. The elevated expression of DDC in CSF was validated using orthogonal techniques, including Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that DDC, in combination with other identified biomarkers, exhibited high diagnostic accuracy for PD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92. Furthermore, correlation analysis revealed significant associations between DDC levels and clinical parameters, including disease severity and motor symptom scores. Our findings suggest that DDC, along with other identified proteins, may serve as a valuable biomarker for early PD diagnosis and monitoring.

The integration of multi-platform proteomics with rigorous statistical analysis enabled the identification of novel biomarkers, including DDC, which may facilitate the development of diagnostic and prognostic tools for PD. The discovery of these biomarkers holds promise for improving our understanding of PD pathophysiology and enabling timely interventions. Future studies will focus on validating these findings in larger cohorts and exploring the translational potential of these biomarkers in clinical practice.

This study underscores the power of multi-platform proteomics in uncovering novel biomarkers for complex neurodegenerative disorders like PD. The identification of DDC as a potential biomarker highlights the importance of proteomics in elucidating disease mechanisms and developing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of proteomics with other 'omics' disciplines is expected to accelerate the discovery of reliable biomarkers, ultimately transforming the management of PD and related disorders.
