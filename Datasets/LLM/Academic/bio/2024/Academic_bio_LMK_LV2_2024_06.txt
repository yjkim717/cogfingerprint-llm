"Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Activity in Cobalt-Doped SrIrO3 Electrocatalysts for Water Splitting. The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for sustainable energy conversion. Here, we report a significant enhancement in OER activity achieved through cobalt-doping of SrIrO3 perovskite. The incorporation of cobalt into the SrIrO3 lattice activates surface lattice oxygen, facilitating the OER kinetics. Moreover, cobalt-doping optimizes the binding energy of IrOx adsorbates, thereby lowering the energy barrier for the OER. Our results demonstrate that Co-doped SrIrO3 exhibits superior electrocatalytic activity compared to pristine SrIrO3, highlighting its potential as a promising electrocatalyst for efficient water splitting. This study provides insights into the design of high-performance OER electrocatalysts through strategic doping and lattice engineering." (146 words)
