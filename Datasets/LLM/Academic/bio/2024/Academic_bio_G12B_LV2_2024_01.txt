**Abstract**

The repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) is a critical cellular process, with nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) representing a major, albeit error-prone, pathway. While conventional models depict DSB end dynamics as a homogeneous diffusion process, accumulating experimental evidence suggests a more complex reality, particularly concerning the prevalence of misrepair events leading to genomic instability and potentially oncogenesis. This study introduces a novel theoretical framework predicated on *heterogeneous anomalous diffusion* to more accurately model the spatiotemporal behavior of DSB ends during NHEJ. We posit that DSB ends do not exhibit uniform motion but rather display a range of diffusive behaviors influenced by local chromatin environment and protein interactions. This heterogeneity is crucial for understanding the formation and behavior of dicentric chromosomes, a hallmark of NHEJ-mediated misrepair.  Through computational simulations incorporating this heterogeneous anomalous diffusion model, we demonstrate a significantly improved ability to reproduce observed frequencies of genomic rearrangements and the characteristic dynamics of dicentric chromosome instability compared to traditional diffusion models. Our findings highlight the importance of considering dynamic heterogeneity in DSB end behavior and offer a refined mechanistic understanding of NHEJ error-proneness, potentially informing targeted therapeutic strategies to mitigate the consequences of DSB misrepair in cancer and aging-related diseases. Further experimental validation of these predictions is warranted.
