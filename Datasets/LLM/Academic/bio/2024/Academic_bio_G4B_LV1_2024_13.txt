**Abstract**

Lymphoid follicle architecture is increasingly recognized as a critical determinant of immune response and disease susceptibility. However, comprehensively characterizing this complex microenvironment remains a significant challenge. This study presents SNOWFLAKE, a novel computational pipeline leveraging graph neural networks (GNNs) to integrate spatial morphoproteomic data with single-cell analysis within lymphoid follicles. SNOWFLAKE constructs a network representation of cellular spatial relationships and expression profiles, enabling prediction of disease status – specifically, [mention a specific disease if the original text alluded to one, e.g., “autoimmune response” or “tumor microenvironment dynamics”] – with unprecedented granularity.  The pipeline’s ability to capture non-linear dependencies between cellular morphology and gene expression is hypothesized to provide novel insights into the immune microarchitecture.  Preliminary results demonstrate SNOWFLAKE’s potential for multiplex imaging analysis, offering a robust method for deciphering the intricate spatial organization of immune cells and informing targeted therapeutic strategies. Future work will focus on validating SNOWFLAKE across diverse lymphoid compartments.
