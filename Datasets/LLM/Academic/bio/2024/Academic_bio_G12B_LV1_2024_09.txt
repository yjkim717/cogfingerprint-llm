## Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomic Subtyping Reveals Distinct Genetic Architectures and Trajectories of Brain Atrophy in Alzheimer's Disease

**Abstract**

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous disorder, challenging traditional diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This study, conducted in 2024, leverages advances in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to investigate the underlying molecular complexity of AD. We employed unsupervised machine learning techniques on CSF proteomic data from a cohort of [Insert cohort size and characteristics – e.g., cognitively unimpaired to advanced AD patients] to identify distinct molecular subtypes. Our analysis revealed five robust subtypes, each characterized by a unique proteomic signature reflecting differential regulation of pathways involved in amyloid processing, tau phosphorylation, neuroinflammation, and synaptic dysfunction. Crucially, we observed significant associations between these CSF-defined subtypes and established AD genetic risk factors, identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Subtype-specific enrichment of risk variants associated with *APOE4*, *TREM2*, and other key AD genes suggests distinct pathogenic mechanisms driving disease progression within each group. Furthermore, longitudinal neuroimaging data demonstrated divergent trajectories of brain atrophy across the subtypes, indicating varying vulnerability to neurodegeneration. These findings highlight the potential of CSF proteomics to refine AD classification, facilitate personalized risk assessment, and inform targeted therapeutic interventions based on an individual’s molecular subtype and genetic predisposition.
