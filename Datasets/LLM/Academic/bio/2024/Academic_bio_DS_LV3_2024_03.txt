The basidiomycete *Pleurotus ostreatus* has consolidated its status as a premier model organism for fungal molecular genetics, providing an indispensable platform for interrogating complex biological processes. In 2024, the deployment of advanced genome editing tools, particularly CRISPR-Cas9 systems optimized for its dikaryotic life cycle, has enabled unprecedented functional genomics studies. These techniques facilitate the precise manipulation of metabolic pathways, allowing for the targeted enhancement of lignocellulolytic enzyme production and the biosynthesis of novel biomaterials. Concurrently, sophisticated protein engineering approaches are being leveraged to redesign native *P. ostreatus* enzymes, augmenting their catalytic efficiency, thermostability, and substrate specificity for industrial biocatalysis. The integration of these molecular toolkits is accelerating the development of high-yield strains for sustainable bioproduction and bioremediation applications. Consequently, *P. ostreatus* serves as a critical testbed for translating fundamental mycological research into tangible biotechnological innovations, bridging the gap between basic science and industrial application in the circular bioeconomy.
