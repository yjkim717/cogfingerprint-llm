In the rapidly evolving field of proteomics, the accurate identification of peptides from complex mixtures remains a central challenge, particularly due to the prevalence of co-fragmented peptides in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) experiments. Traditional database search algorithms often overlook these co-eluting species, leading to reduced analytical sensitivity. This study evaluates MSFragger-DDA+, an advanced computational workflow integrated into the FragPipe platform, which addresses this limitation through a comprehensive full isolation window search strategy. By systematically interrogating all potential precursor ions within each isolation window, the method significantly enhances the detection of low-abundance peptides that are co-fragmented with dominant precursors. Our 2024 benchmark analyses, using diverse biological samples, demonstrate that MSFragger-DDA+ increases peptide identifications by 15â€“30% compared to conventional search engines, without compromising false discovery rate thresholds. The implementation within FragPipe ensures scalability and accessibility for the proteomics community, facilitating more complete proteome coverage. These findings underscore the critical importance of computational innovations in maximizing data extraction from mass spectrometry-based experiments, thereby advancing foundational research in biomarker discovery and systems biology.
