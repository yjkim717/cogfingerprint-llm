**Abstract**

*Pleurotus ostreatus*, commonly known as the oyster mushroom, is increasingly recognized as a valuable model organism within fungal biology. This review details the burgeoning applications of *P. ostreatus* in advancing research across diverse scientific disciplines. Recent advancements in molecular genetics, specifically facilitated by high-throughput genome sequencing, have enabled comprehensive analyses of its unique genetic architecture. Furthermore, the development of targeted gene editing techniques, such as CRISPR-Cas systems, is now routinely employed to investigate gene function and regulation.  The relative ease of cultivation and established genetic tools position *P. ostreatus* as a compelling alternative to traditional model systems.  Consequently, this species is proving instrumental in elucidating fundamental cellular processes and exploring novel biotechnological applications, particularly within material science and sustainable biomaterial production – a trend expected to accelerate in the coming years.
