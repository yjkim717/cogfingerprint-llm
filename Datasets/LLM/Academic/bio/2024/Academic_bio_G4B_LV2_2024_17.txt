**Abstract**

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genomic sciences is rapidly transforming biomedical research and therapeutic development. This review examines the burgeoning integration of machine learning (ML) and, increasingly, deep learning (DL) methodologies within the field of genetics, specifically focusing on applications with significant translational potential. Traditional genetic analysis, while foundational, often struggles with the complexity and scale of modern genomic datasets. AI algorithms offer a powerful solution, enabling the identification of novel genetic markers associated with disease susceptibility, progression, and treatment response. 

We detail current applications including predictive modeling of gene expression, personalized gene therapy design, and the accelerated discovery of therapeutic targets. DL architectures, in particular, demonstrate enhanced capabilities in analyzing high-dimensional genomic data, such as whole-genome sequencing and transcriptomics, leading to improved accuracy in identifying subtle genetic variations. Furthermore, AI is facilitating advancements in gene editing technologies, optimizing CRISPR-Cas systems and predicting off-target effects.  

Despite the substantial progress, challenges remain concerning data bias, interpretability of complex models, and the ethical considerations surrounding AI-driven genomic interventions. Future research must prioritize robust validation strategies and a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying AI’s predictive power to fully realize the promise of this synergistic field.
