**Abstract: A Heterogeneous Anomalous Diffusion Model for Double-Strand Break End Dynamics in Non-Homologous End Joining**

The cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is paramount for genomic stability. While non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is a primary DSB repair pathway, the intricate dynamics of DSB termini prior to ligation remain incompletely understood. Traditional models of DNA diffusion, relying on Brownian motion, are insufficient to explain observed long-range movements and the frequent formation of dicentric chromosome lesions, a hallmark of NHEJ errors. Here, we propose a novel model incorporating heterogeneous anomalous diffusion (HAD) to describe the spatiotemporal behavior of DSB ends during NHEJ. This model posits that DSB termini do not exhibit uniform diffusion, but rather transition between phases of normal and anomalous diffusion characterized by varying anomalous exponents. These exponents reflect the local chromatin environment and the presence of dynamic protein interactions influencing movement. Specifically, we hypothesize that transient interactions with chromatin remodelers and repair factors induce periods of ‘stickiness’ or spatial confinement, leading to sub-diffusive behavior, punctuated by infrequent, long-range ‘bursts’ of super-diffusive motion.  Furthermore, the probabilistic nature of these transitions, coupled with inherent end-binding asymmetry, is proposed to increase the likelihood of erroneous end-joining and dicentric bridge formation.  We present a theoretical framework for HAD in this context and discuss potential experimental approaches, including single-molecule tracking microscopy and computational simulations, to validate the model’s predictions and ultimately refine our understanding of NHEJ fidelity and its role in genome maintenance. This framework offers a refined perspective on DSB repair, potentially informing strategies to mitigate genomic instability in cancer and aging.

    *   **Context/Problem:**  Importance of DSB repair and the inadequacy of existing models.
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Introduction of the HAD model.
    *   **Mechanism:** Explanation of how HAD works in this specific context (phases of diffusion, influence of chromatin and proteins).
    *   **Consequence/Link to Error:**  Connection between HAD and dicentric formation.
    *   **Future Directions:**  Mention of experimental approaches for validation.
    *   **Significance:** Potential implications for genome stability, cancer, and aging.
