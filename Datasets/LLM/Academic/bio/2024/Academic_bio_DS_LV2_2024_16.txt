The basidiomycete *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom) has emerged as a pivotal model organism in fungal molecular genetics, offering a tractable system for advanced genome editing and protein engineering. This review consolidates recent advances in the field, highlighting the establishment of CRISPR-Cas9 and homologous recombination techniques that enable precise manipulation of its lignocellulolytic enzyme arsenal. We systematically evaluate how these genetic tools facilitate the study of complex biological processes, including wood-decay mechanisms and hyphal network communication. Furthermore, we explore the applied dimensions of this research, detailing the engineering of *P. ostreatus* strains for enhanced production of industrially relevant biocatalysts, such as lignin-modifying peroxidases and versatile lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases. The integration of these genetic strategies with systems biology approaches is positioning *P. ostreatus* at the forefront of sustainable biotechnology, with significant implications for bioremediation, biofuel production, and the development of novel biomaterials.
