**Abstract**

Lymphoid follicle architecture and cellular composition represent critical determinants of immune responses, yet comprehensive characterization remains a significant challenge. This study introduces SNOWFLAKE, a novel graph neural network (GNN) framework, designed to predict disease status through the integrated analysis of spatial morphoproteomic data within b-cell follicles. Leveraging multiplex imaging techniques, SNOWFLAKE constructs a network representation of follicle structure, incorporating spatial relationships between immune cell types – specifically, b-cell follicles – and their corresponding gene expression profiles. The GNN’s ability to learn complex, non-linear correlations between spatial features and disease phenotypes is evaluated. Preliminary results suggest SNOWFLAKE demonstrates a capacity to discern subtle variations in immune microarchitecture predictive of disease progression.  This framework offers a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of the spatial organization of the adaptive immune system and holds promise for identifying novel biomarkers. Future work will focus on expanding the network to incorporate additional immune cell populations and validating SNOWFLAKE’s predictive accuracy across diverse immunological contexts.
