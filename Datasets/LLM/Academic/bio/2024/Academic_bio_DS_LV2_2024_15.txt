**Abstract**

Somatostatin (SST), a multifunctional cyclic neuropeptide, has garnered significant interest for its potential antitumor properties beyond its classical endocrine roles. This review synthesizes current evidence elucidating the molecular mechanisms underpinning somatostatin's inhibitory effects on colorectal cancer (CRC) pathogenesis. A primary focus is placed on the pleiotropic signaling cascades modulated by SST, with particular emphasis on its antagonism of the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT) pathways. These pathways are critically implicated in CRC cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis. We critically evaluate the therapeutic potential of synthetic somatostatin analogues (SSAs), which offer enhanced metabolic stability and receptor affinity. The discussion centers on their efficacy in preclinical and clinical settings, highlighting their capacity to induce cell cycle arrest and promote apoptosis via SST receptor (SSTR)-mediated signaling. Despite promising mechanistic data, we also address the translational challenges and heterogeneous patient responses, underscoring the necessity for biomarker-driven patient stratification. This analysis posits that a refined understanding of SSTR subtype-specific actions is paramount for harnessing the full therapeutic potential of the somatostatin axis in future CRC management strategies.
