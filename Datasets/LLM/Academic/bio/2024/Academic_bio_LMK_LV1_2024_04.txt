Title: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Genetic Research: Advancements and Prospects in Gene Therapy and Precision Medicine

Abstract:

The burgeoning synergy between artificial intelligence (AI) and genetics has revolutionized the landscape of biomedical research, offering unprecedented insights into the complex interplay between genetic factors and disease manifestation. As of 2024, the integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in genetic studies has enabled the analysis of vast genomic datasets, facilitating the identification of novel genetic associations and the elucidation of underlying molecular mechanisms. This abstract reviews the current state-of-the-art applications of AI in genetics, with a particular focus on gene therapy and precision medicine.

Recent advancements in AI-driven genomics have led to the development of predictive models capable of identifying genetic variants associated with disease susceptibility and treatment response. Furthermore, the application of DL techniques has enabled the accurate prediction of gene expression levels and the identification of potential gene therapy targets. The incorporation of AI in gene therapy has also enhanced the design of gene editing strategies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, by optimizing guide RNA selection and predicting off-target effects.

The convergence of AI and genetics holds great promise for the future of precision medicine, enabling the tailoring of therapeutic interventions to individual genetic profiles. As the field continues to evolve, we anticipate that AI-driven genetic research will yield novel diagnostic biomarkers, therapeutic targets, and personalized treatment strategies, ultimately transforming the management of genetic diseases. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current applications and future prospects of AI in genetics, highlighting the potential for AI to revolutionize the field of gene therapy and precision medicine.
