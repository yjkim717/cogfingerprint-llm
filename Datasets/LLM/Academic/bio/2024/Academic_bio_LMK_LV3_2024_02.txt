Title: Unveiling Somatostatin's Therapeutic Potential in Colorectal Cancer: Insights into Antitumor Mechanisms and Tumor Microenvironment Modulation

Abstract:
Colorectal cancer remains a significant global health burden, necessitating innovative therapeutic strategies. Recent research has underscored the multifaceted role of somatostatin in modulating tumor biology. This review synthesizes current knowledge on somatostatin's antitumor effects in colorectal cancer, with a focus on its impact on signaling pathways and the tumor microenvironment. By inhibiting key proliferative and angiogenic pathways, somatostatin exerts antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, somatostatin's immunomodulatory properties reshape the tumor microenvironment, attenuating tumor-promoting inflammation and immune evasion. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying somatostatin's actions provides a rationale for its therapeutic application in colorectal cancer. As of 2024, emerging evidence supports the potential of somatostatin analogs as adjunct therapies, enhancing treatment outcomes and patient prognosis. This review highlights the promise of somatostatin-based therapies in colorectal cancer, informing future research directions and clinical trials.
