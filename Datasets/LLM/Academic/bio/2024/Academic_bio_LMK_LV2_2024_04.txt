Title: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Genetic Engineering: Advancements and Future Directions in Gene Therapy

Abstract:

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genetics has precipitated a paradigm shift in the field of genetic engineering, offering unprecedented opportunities for advancements in gene therapy and clinical care. As of 2024, the integration of machine learning algorithms with genetic data analysis has significantly enhanced the precision and efficacy of genetic engineering techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive examination of the current applications and future prospects of AI in genetics, with a particular focus on its role in disease treatment and management.

Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of AI-driven approaches in identifying novel genetic targets for therapy, predicting gene expression outcomes, and optimizing gene editing tools such as CRISPR/Cas9. Moreover, machine learning models have been successfully employed to analyze large-scale genomic datasets, facilitating the discovery of novel genetic variants associated with complex diseases.

The application of AI in gene therapy has shown considerable promise, enabling the development of personalized therapeutic strategies tailored to individual genetic profiles. Furthermore, AI-assisted gene editing has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of genetic disorders by allowing for precise modifications to the genome.

This review aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge on the intersection of AI and genetic engineering, highlighting key advancements, challenges, and future directions in the field. By examining the current landscape and future prospects of AI-driven genetic engineering, this paper seeks to contribute to the ongoing discourse on the potential of this technology to transform the field of gene therapy and clinical care.
