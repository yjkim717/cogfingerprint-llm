**Abstract**

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genetics represents a paradigm shift in biomedical research and clinical practice. This review examines the burgeoning integration of AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques, within the field of genetics, focusing on advancements achieved and future trajectories anticipated as of 2024. We delineate the impact of these technologies on key areas, including the accelerated identification of disease-associated genetic variants, improved precision in gene therapy vector design and delivery, and enhanced predictive capabilities for disease risk assessment.  Specifically, we explore how DL algorithms are revolutionizing genomic data analysis, enabling more accurate phenotypic prediction from complex genetic architectures. Furthermore, the review assesses the role of AI in streamlining drug discovery pipelines, from target identification to clinical trial optimization. While acknowledging the transformative potential, this analysis also addresses critical challenges, such as data bias, algorithmic transparency (“explainable AI”), and the ethical considerations surrounding genetic data privacy. We conclude by forecasting the continued expansion of AI-driven approaches in genetics, emphasizing the necessity of robust validation frameworks and ethical guidelines to ensure responsible and equitable implementation for improved human health outcomes.
