**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical bottleneck in electrochemical water splitting, demanding highly efficient and durable electrocatalysts. This study investigates the impact of cobalt-doping on the electrocatalytic performance of strontium irirate (SrIrO3) for OER. We demonstrate that incorporating cobalt into the SrIrO3 lattice significantly enhances OER activity, surpassing that of benchmark iridium dioxide (IrO2) catalysts. Through a combination of electrochemical characterization and computational modeling, we attribute this improved performance to a dual mechanism: (1) activation of surface lattice oxygen, facilitating its participation in the OER pathway, and (2) optimization of the binding energy of key reaction intermediates, minimizing kinetic barriers. The cobalt-doping strategy effectively tunes the electronic structure of SrIrO3, resulting in a favorable synergy between oxygen vacancy formation and enhanced metal-oxygen covalency. These findings highlight cobalt-doped SrIrO3 as a promising, cost-effective, and high-performance OER electrocatalyst for sustainable hydrogen production, advancing the field of electrocatalysis and renewable energy technologies.
