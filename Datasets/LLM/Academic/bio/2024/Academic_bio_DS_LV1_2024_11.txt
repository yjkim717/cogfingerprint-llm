**Abstract**

The urgent need for reliable biomarkers for the early diagnosis and stratification of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a central challenge in neurology. While alpha-synuclein pathology is a hallmark of PD, its variability and presence in other synucleinopathies limit its diagnostic specificity. This study employed a high-resolution, quantitative proteomics pipeline to conduct an unbiased screening of multiple biospecimens, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), plasma, and urine, from a multi-center cohort comprising individuals with early-stage, de novo PD, matched healthy controls, and patients with atypical parkinsonism. Our integrated multi-omics analysis identified a consistent and significant dysregulation in the expression of Dopa Decarboxylase (DDC), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of L-Dopa to dopamine, across all sample types. Furthermore, we constructed a novel protein signature, the DDC-Correlative Proteomic Cluster (DDC-CPC), comprising five additional proteins involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and neuroinflammatory pathways. Validation in an independent, longitudinal cohort confirmed that the combined measurement of DDC and the DDC-CPC panel significantly outperformed existing biomarkers, achieving a high diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing PD from controls (AUC = 0.94) and from multiple system atrophy (AUC = 0.88). Crucially, longitudinal analysis revealed that dynamic changes in DDC and specific DDC-CPC components correlated with measures of motor progression and cognitive decline over a 24-month period. These findings establish DDC as a cornerstone of a robust, multi-analyte biomarker signature. The DDC-CPC panel presents a transformative tool for enhancing early, pre-motor diagnosis, improving differential diagnosis, and objectively monitoring disease progression and therapeutic response in clinical trials, thereby paving the way for a new era of precision medicine in Parkinson's disease.
