Title: Chronocell: A Biophysically-Informed Framework for Inferring Process Time from Single-Cell Transcriptomics Data

Abstract:

The advent of single-cell transcriptomics has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and dynamic processes. However, inferring the temporal progression of cellular states remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce Chronocell, a novel framework that integrates trajectory inference with a biophysical formulation to estimate 'process time' from single-cell genomics data. By modeling the underlying cellular dynamics as a stochastic process, Chronocell provides a robust and interpretable representation of cell trajectories. Our approach leverages a process time model, which abstracts away the complexities of real time, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of cellular progression.

Chronocell's biophysical formulation is grounded in the concept of cellular energetics, where the probability of transitioning between cellular states is governed by the relative energetic costs. This framework enables the inference of a cell's 'process time', a latent variable that captures the cell's progress through a biological process, such as differentiation or cell cycle progression. By applying Chronocell to various single-cell datasets, we demonstrate its ability to accurately reconstruct cellular trajectories and identify key regulatory events.

Our results show that Chronocell outperforms existing trajectory inference methods, particularly in cases where cellular progression is non-linear or asynchronous. Furthermore, the process time model provides a natural framework for integrating multi-modal data, such as gene expression and protein abundance. By providing a more accurate and interpretable representation of cellular dynamics, Chronocell has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of complex biological processes, enabling new insights into cellular decision-making and behavior. As such, Chronocell represents a significant advancement in the field of single-cell biology, with far-reaching implications for biomedical research and regenerative medicine.
