**Abstract**

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genomics is rapidly transforming biomedical research and clinical practice, presenting unprecedented opportunities for precision medicine. This paper examines the escalating integration of machine learning (ML) and, increasingly, deep learning (DL) techniques within genetic analysis in 2024.  Specifically, we investigate how AI algorithms are facilitating more accurate identification of disease-causing genetic variants, predicting individual responses to therapeutic interventions, and accelerating the discovery of novel drug targets.  The application of DL models, trained on expansive genomic datasets, demonstrates enhanced capabilities in identifying subtle patterns indicative of complex diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. 

However, the implementation of these advanced AI systems necessitates careful consideration of inherent challenges.  Data bias, algorithmic transparency, and the potential for misinterpretation of complex predictive models represent significant concerns.  Furthermore, the ethical implications of utilizing genetic information for personalized treatment require robust regulatory frameworks.  Future research should prioritize the development of explainable AI (XAI) methodologies to bolster clinical trust and ensure equitable access to these powerful diagnostic and therapeutic tools, ultimately driving a paradigm shift towards proactive and tailored healthcare strategies.
