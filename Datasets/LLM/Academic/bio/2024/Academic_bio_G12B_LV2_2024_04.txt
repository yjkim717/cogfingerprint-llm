**Abstract**

The accelerating convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genetics is rapidly reshaping biomedical research and clinical practice. This review examines the burgeoning applications of AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), within the field of genetics, focusing on their transformative potential for disease understanding, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention. We delineate current utilizations, including AI-driven genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for enhanced variant prioritization and polygenic risk score refinement, and its role in predicting gene expression patterns from genomic data. Furthermore, we explore the application of DL architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in analyzing complex genomic sequences, identifying non-coding regulatory elements, and predicting the structural variations impacting gene function. A significant focus is placed on the integration of AI with gene therapy, examining its potential to optimize vector design, predict therapeutic efficacy, and mitigate off-target effects through *in silico* modeling. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions within this interdisciplinary space, including the need for robust validation datasets, addressing algorithmic bias inherent in training data, and the ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of AI-guided genetic interventions. The review concludes that continued advancements in AI methodologies, coupled with increasingly comprehensive genomic datasets, will be crucial for realizing the full potential of AI in revolutionizing precision medicine and ultimately improving patient outcomes.
