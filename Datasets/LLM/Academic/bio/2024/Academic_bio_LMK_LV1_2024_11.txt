Title: Unveiling Novel Biomarkers for Early Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis through Multi-Tissue Proteomics Analysis

Abstract:

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive motor dysfunction and cognitive decline. Early diagnosis and monitoring of PD remain challenging due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. Recent advances in proteomics have enabled the identification of novel protein biomarkers in various tissues and biofluids. In this study, we employed a multi-tissue proteomics approach to investigate protein expression changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain tissue, and peripheral tissues from PD patients and age-matched controls. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analysis, we identified a panel of differentially expressed proteins in PD samples, including dopa decarboxylase (DDC), a key enzyme involved in dopamine synthesis. Our results showed that DDC was significantly downregulated in CSF and brain tissue of PD patients compared to controls. Furthermore, we validated the expression levels of DDC and other candidate biomarkers using orthogonal techniques, including Western blotting and ELISA. Our findings suggest that DDC and other identified proteins may serve as potential biomarkers for early PD diagnosis and monitoring. Notably, the combination of DDC with other biomarkers, such as Î±-synuclein and tau protein, demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy compared to individual biomarkers. The multi-tissue proteomics approach employed in this study provides a comprehensive understanding of protein expression changes in PD and highlights the potential of CSF and peripheral tissues as valuable sources of biomarkers. Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the utility of proteomics in identifying novel biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases. The discovery of DDC as a potential biomarker for PD diagnosis and monitoring has significant implications for the development of early therapeutic interventions and disease management strategies. Future studies will focus on validating these findings in larger cohorts and exploring the functional significance of DDC and other identified biomarkers in PD pathogenesis. This research has the potential to advance our understanding of PD biology and contribute to the development of effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for this debilitating disorder.
