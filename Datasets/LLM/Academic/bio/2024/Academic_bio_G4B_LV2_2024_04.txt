**Abstract: Integrating Artificial Intelligence for Precision Genetic Medicine – A 2024 Overview**

The convergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and genetics represents a transformative paradigm shift within biomedical research and clinical practice. This review synthesizes recent advancements demonstrating the burgeoning utility of machine learning (ML) and, specifically, deep learning (DL) methodologies within the field of genetics.  Traditionally reliant on statistical inference, genetic analysis is increasingly leveraging AI’s capacity for complex pattern recognition, enabling novel approaches to disease etiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic intervention. 

We examine current applications including predictive modeling of complex genetic disorders, accelerated identification of therapeutic targets through transcriptomic and proteomic data analysis, and the optimization of gene therapy protocols.  DL architectures, in particular, are proving effective in deciphering intricate genomic sequences and predicting protein structure with unprecedented accuracy, facilitating a deeper understanding of gene function. Furthermore, AI algorithms are being employed to personalize gene therapy strategies based on individual patient genetic profiles, maximizing efficacy and minimizing adverse effects. 

Despite significant progress, challenges remain, including data bias, interpretability of “black box” models, and the need for robust validation across diverse populations.  Future research should prioritize the development of explainable AI (XAI) techniques to foster trust and facilitate clinical translation, solidifying the role of AI as a crucial tool in the advancement of precision genetic medicine by 2028.
