**Abstract**

Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant clinical challenge, necessitating continued investigation into novel therapeutic strategies. This review synthesizes recent evidence regarding the role of somatostatin (SST) in modulating CRC progression, with particular emphasis on its interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Emerging data suggests that SST exerts antitumor effects not solely through direct cell cycle arrest, but also by influencing key signaling cascades. Specifically, we explore the intricate relationship between SST signaling and the MAPK/ERK/Akt pathway, a critical regulator of cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis within the CRC TME. 

Preliminary studies indicate that SST can attenuate these pathways, potentially reducing tumor growth and metastatic potential. Furthermore, the review highlights the potential for gep-net-based therapies, utilizing SST receptor agonists, to selectively target CRC cells while minimizing systemic side effects.  Future research should prioritize elucidating the precise mechanisms of SST action within the complex CRC TME and determining the optimal strategies for integrating SST-directed interventions into multimodal treatment regimens.
