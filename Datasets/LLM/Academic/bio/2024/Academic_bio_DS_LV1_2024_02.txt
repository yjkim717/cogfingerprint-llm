**Abstract**

Somatostatin (SST) and its synthetic analogues (SSAs) represent a promising therapeutic avenue in colorectal cancer (CRC), yet their precise molecular mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This review synthesizes recent advances from 2020-2024, critically evaluating the antitumor efficacy of SST signaling beyond its classical antisecretory role. We posit that SST-mediated growth inhibition is primarily orchestrated through the suppression of key oncogenic pathways. A principal mechanism involves the attenuation of the MAPK/ERK/AKT signaling cascade, thereby impinging upon critical cellular processes including proliferation, survival, and metabolic reprogramming. Concurrently, emerging evidence underscores a pivotal role for SST in modulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, a cornerstone of CRC pathogenesis. SST receptor activation appears to facilitate β-catenin degradation and disrupts downstream transcriptional programs driving tumor initiation and stemness. The therapeutic potential of SSAs is explored in this context, highlighting their ability to selectively engage somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) overexpressed on CRC cells to reactivate these endogenous tumor-suppressive circuits. This consolidated perspective clarifies the integrated signaling network through which somatostatin exerts its cytostatic effects, providing a mechanistic rationale for the continued development of SSTR-targeted therapies in precision oncology for colorectal cancer.
