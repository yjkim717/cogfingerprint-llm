"Advancements in genome editing technologies have positioned Pleurotus ostreatus as a paradigm for interdisciplinary research, bridging molecular genetics, cell biology, and material sciences. As a model organism, P. ostreatus has facilitated significant breakthroughs in understanding fungal biology and its applications in biotechnology. Recent studies have leveraged cutting-edge genome editing tools to elucidate the genetic basis of desirable traits in P. ostreatus, such as lignin degradation and fruiting body development. The insights garnered from these investigations have far-reaching implications for the development of sustainable biotechnologies, including mycoremediation and fungal-based materials. As research continues to unravel the complexities of P. ostreatus biology, this organism is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of biotechnology. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular genetics of P. ostreatus and highlights the potential applications of genome editing in advancing mushroom science and biotechnology, as of 2024."
