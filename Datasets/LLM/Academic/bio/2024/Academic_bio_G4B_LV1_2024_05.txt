**Abstract**

The ongoing European Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) outbreaks, primarily driven by avian influenza A(H5Nx) viruses belonging to clade 2.3.4.4b and frequently exhibiting H5N5 subtypes, necessitate a deeper understanding of viral evolution dynamics. This study investigates the genomic architecture of circulating HPAI viruses across Europe, employing whole-genome sequencing to characterize genetic diversity and identify instances of reassortment. Our analysis demonstrates a significantly elevated level of genetic variation within the studied clade, exceeding previously reported values for H5N5 viruses. Notably, we observed recurrent reassortment events, suggesting a complex evolutionary history shaped by multiple avian host interactions.  These findings highlight the potential for rapid adaptation and diversification within clade 2.3.4.4b, introducing substantial uncertainty into predictive modeling efforts concerning future spread and virulence.  Continued surveillance and genomic characterization are crucial to inform targeted mitigation strategies and anticipate emergent viral strains.
