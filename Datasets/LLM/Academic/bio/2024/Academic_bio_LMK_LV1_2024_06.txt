Title: Enhancing Electrocatalytic Water Splitting through Cobalt-Doping in SrIrO3: A Mechanistic Insight into Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity

Abstract:
The sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a significant bottleneck in electrocatalytic water splitting. In this study, we demonstrate that cobalt-doping in SrIrO3 (Co-SrIrO3) significantly enhances OER activity by activating surface lattice oxygen and optimizing IrOx adsorbate binding energy. Through a combination of density functional theory calculations and experimental analyses, we elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of this enhancement. Our findings reveal that Co-doping modulates the electronic structure of SrIrO3, facilitating the formation of highly active IrOx species and promoting lattice oxygen participation in the OER. Consequently, Co-SrIrO3 exhibits a substantially reduced overpotential and improved stability compared to pristine SrIrO3. These results offer valuable insights into the design of high-performance electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications, highlighting the potential of transition metal doping in perovskite oxides for enhanced OER activity.
