**Abstract**

Transcriptional noise, a pervasive phenomenon in gene expression, presents a significant challenge to elucidating cellular regulatory mechanisms. This study develops a novel theoretical framework integrating stochastic transcription dynamics with the complexities of RNA splicing, employing stochastic differential equations to model these interlinked processes. We investigate how mechanical strain – a recently recognized modulator of gene expression – interacts with transcriptional noise and splicing variability.  A key methodological contribution lies in the development of analytical techniques to disentangle competing hypotheses regarding the origins of transcriptional noise, specifically examining the relative influence of stochasticity versus post-transcriptional regulation.  The proposed model underscores the critical importance of theory-driven experimental design, advocating for targeted data acquisition to effectively probe the underlying causes of transcriptional heterogeneity.  These findings provide a foundation for future investigations into the role of mechanical cues and splicing fidelity in shaping cellular phenotypes.
