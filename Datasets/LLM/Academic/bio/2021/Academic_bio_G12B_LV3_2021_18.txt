**Abstract:**

The period spanning September to December 2021 witnessed an unprecedented surge in the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses across the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom, necessitating a critical reassessment of avian influenza preparedness and control strategies. This report synthesizes surveillance data indicating widespread dissemination of HPAI, primarily clade 2.3.4.H5, impacting both wild bird populations and commercial poultry sectors. The rapid geographic expansion and high pathogenicity underscore the ongoing viral evolution of these H5N1 strains, exhibiting significant antigenic drift and potentially impacting the efficacy of existing poultry vaccines. A key concern emerging from this outbreak is the potential for increased zoonotic spillover risk to humans, particularly given the documented instances of limited human infections associated with earlier HPAI strains. Enhanced biosecurity measures within poultry farms, including strict movement controls, improved hygiene protocols, and enhanced surveillance, are demonstrably crucial in mitigating virus spread. However, the pervasive presence of HPAI in wild bird reservoirs poses a substantial challenge to complete eradication. Further research is urgently required to elucidate the ecological drivers facilitating viral transmission within wild bird populations, to monitor for novel mutations conferring increased transmissibility, and to develop robust predictive models for forecasting future outbreaks. These findings highlight the need for a coordinated, pan-European, and internationally collaborative approach to HPAI surveillance, prevention, and response to safeguard both animal and public health.
