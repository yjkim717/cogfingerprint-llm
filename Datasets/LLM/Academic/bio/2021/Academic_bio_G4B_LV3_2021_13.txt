**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of chronic inflammatory conditions necessitates advanced diagnostic approaches. This study presents SpatialViz, a novel algorithm designed to facilitate the comprehensive analysis of multiplexed tissue imaging data, specifically targeting single-cell pathology investigations. Utilizing imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data, SpatialViz quantifies the spatial relationships between individual cells and their corresponding protein expression profiles within tissue microenvironments. We demonstrate the efficacy of SpatialViz through its application to tonsillitis samples, differentiating between healthy and chronically inflamed tissue.  The algorithm’s capacity for spatialviz – visualizing complex multi-dimensional data – allows for the identification of distinct cellular clusters and their associated biomarker signatures.  These findings highlight the potential of SpatialViz to advance our understanding of disease pathogenesis by providing a detailed, spatially resolved perspective on cellular heterogeneity.  Further research will explore the broader utility of this methodology in characterizing other complex tissue landscapes and informing targeted therapeutic interventions.
