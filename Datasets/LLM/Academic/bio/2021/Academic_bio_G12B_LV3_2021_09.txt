**Abstract**

Recent advancements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics offer novel avenues for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection and risk stratification. This study investigated CSF proteomic profiles in cognitively normal individuals, a population largely devoid of detectable amyloid pathology, to identify potential pre-clinical AD subtypes. Utilizing unsupervised machine learning techniques, we delineated three distinct proteomic subtypes characterized by unique biomarker signatures. Notably, these subtypes demonstrated differential associations with subsequent cognitive trajectories and AD-related clinical outcomes. The observed proteomic divergence suggests a heterogeneity in pre-symptomatic AD pathogenesis, potentially reflecting varying underlying biological mechanisms independent of amyloid accumulation. These findings highlight the potential of CSF proteomics to identify individuals at elevated risk for AD development prior to amyloid deposition, offering a crucial window for therapeutic intervention and disease-modifying strategies. Further longitudinal validation is warranted to confirm the predictive power of these subtypes and elucidate their relationship to AD progression.
