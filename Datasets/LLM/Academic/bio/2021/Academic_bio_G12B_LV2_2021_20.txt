**Abstract**

Understanding the influence of microclimatic conditions on forest ecosystems is increasingly critical in the context of accelerating climate change. While macroclimatic data provide a broad overview of regional trends, forest sub-canopy environments exhibit markedly different thermal regimes, significantly impacting species distribution, phenology, and overall biodiversity. This study investigates the spatial variability of forest sub-canopy temperatures across Europe, employing a novel machine learning (ML) approach to generate high-resolution temperature predictions. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset integrating remotely sensed environmental variables (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index, land surface temperature, elevation), topographical data, and climate records, we developed and validated several gradient boosting algorithms to model sub-canopy temperature dynamics. Results demonstrate substantial deviations from regional macroclimatic temperatures, with localized areas exhibiting significantly warmer or cooler conditions than predicted by larger-scale climate models. These microclimatic refugia and stress zones can profoundly influence the persistence of sensitive species and the resilience of forest communities under future climate scenarios. Furthermore, the ML-based predictive framework presented here offers a powerful tool for biodiversity conservation planning, enabling targeted assessments of habitat suitability and vulnerability. The methodology's adaptability and scalability allows for future integration of physiological data and species-specific responses, thereby enhancing our ability to forecast the ecological consequences of climate change on European forests. This research highlights the importance of incorporating fine-scale microclimatic factors into climate change impact assessments and provides a robust methodological foundation for future research in this area.
