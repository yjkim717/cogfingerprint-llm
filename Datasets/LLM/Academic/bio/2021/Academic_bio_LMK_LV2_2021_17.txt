Title: Evaluating the Impact of Examination Structure on Attendance in Psychiatric Training among Undergraduate Medical Students

Abstract:

The integration of psychiatric training into the undergraduate medical curriculum is crucial for fostering competent healthcare professionals. However, the efficacy of such training programs is often contingent upon the attendance and engagement of medical students. A recent study conducted in 2021 among 100 MBBS students revealed a concerning trend of low attendance during psychiatric clinical postings. This phenomenon was primarily attributed to the absence of a separate examination for psychiatry and the tendency among students to adjust their attendance in psychiatry with other subjects. 

This study underscores a significant lacuna in the existing medical education framework, where the assessment structure inadvertently influences student behavior. The lack of a dedicated examination for psychiatry diminishes its perceived importance, leading to a lack of motivation among students to attend psychiatric clinical postings. Furthermore, the flexibility in adjusting attendance across different subjects allows students to prioritize disciplines with standalone examinations, thereby compromising their exposure to psychiatric training.

The findings of this study have profound implications for medical education, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive and inclusive assessment framework. By incorporating a separate examination for psychiatry, medical schools can potentially enhance student engagement and attendance in psychiatric clinical postings. This, in turn, can lead to a more well-rounded education, better equipping future healthcare professionals to address the complex mental health needs of the population.

In conclusion, the study emphasizes the critical role of examination structure in shaping student behavior and attendance in psychiatric training. As medical education continues to evolve, it is imperative to revisit and refine assessment methodologies to ensure that they promote comprehensive learning and prepare students for the multifaceted demands of clinical practice. The insights garnered from this study can inform policy reforms aimed at enhancing the quality and effectiveness of psychiatric training among undergraduate medical students.
