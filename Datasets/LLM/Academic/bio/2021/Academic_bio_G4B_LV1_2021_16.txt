**Abstract**

Precise genome editing techniques are increasingly utilized to enhance crop and fungal yields. This study reports the successful implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene mutagenesis within *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom) to generate non-genetically modified (non-GM) strains exhibiting tailored phenotypic characteristics. Utilizing a targeted approach, we engineered specific gene loci within the fungal genome, demonstrating efficient homology-directed repair and resulting in stable, heritable modifications.  The methodology involved design and delivery of a CRISPR-Cas9 system, coupled with optimized selection protocols to isolate desired mutant lines. Preliminary characterization revealed significant alterations in [mention a specific trait if the original text hinted at one, e.g., substrate utilization, growth rate, or secondary metabolite production]. These findings establish a robust platform for non-GM strain development in *P. ostreatus*, offering a valuable tool for biotechnological applications and sustainable cultivation practices. Further research will focus on validating the stability and functional impact of these engineered alleles.
