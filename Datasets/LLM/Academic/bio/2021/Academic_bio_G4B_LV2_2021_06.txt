**Abstract: Carboxylate Ligand Coordination Modulates Electrocatalytic Performance in Layered Double Hydroxide-Metal-Organic Framework Composites for Oxygen Evolution Reaction**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a critical bottleneck in sustainable energy technologies. This study investigates the impact of carboxylate ligand coordination on the electrocatalytic activity of a composite material comprising layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), specifically focusing on NiFe-LDH/MOF architectures. Utilizing advanced electrochemical techniques in 2021, we demonstrate that strategically incorporating carboxylate ligands within the MOF structure significantly elevates OER performance. 

Our findings indicate that carboxylate coordination facilitates enhanced electron redistribution between the NiFe LDH and the MOF, promoting a more efficient charge transfer pathway. Furthermore, the ligand framework accelerates proton transfer kinetics, crucial for the overall OER process. Spectroscopic analysis corroborated these electrocatalytic improvements, revealing altered surface properties and a refined electronic structure within the composite.  These results suggest a mechanistic pathway wherein carboxylate ligand coordination serves as a pivotal modulator, optimizing the synergistic interaction between the LDH and MOF components for superior OER electrocatalysis.
