**Abstract**

This study investigates the concerning issue of low attendance rates among medical students undertaking psychiatric training within the MBBS curriculum in central India. Data collected in 2021 reveals a pervasive pattern of suboptimal engagement, with attendance figures significantly below established benchmarks for clinical rotations. A primary contributing factor identified is the lack of dedicated summative assessments specifically evaluating psychiatric knowledge and clinical skills. Consequently, students often prioritize attendance in subjects with direct examination consequences, effectively marginalizing psychiatric training. This observation highlights a systemic weakness within the current pedagogical approach, potentially compromising the quality of psychiatric education and the future workforce preparedness of medical graduates. The findings underscore the urgent need for curricular reform, advocating for the implementation of dedicated psychiatric assessments and a re-evaluation of attendance policies to ensure equitable weighting across all disciplines within the MBBS program, ultimately supporting robust psychiatric training and improved patient care.
