**Abstract**

Recent advances in proteomics have highlighted the critical need for methods capable of discerning subtle proteome-wide selectivity profiles of reactive electrophiles. This study details a novel, unbiased workflow designed to comprehensively characterize such selectivity, utilizing competitive residue-specific proteomics coupled with amino acid monitoring. The methodology’s robustness was demonstrated through the analysis of a diverse panel of electrophiles, revealing significant differences in binding affinities across multiple protein isoforms. Specifically, the technique enabled the precise quantification of nine distinct amino acids – glycine, alanine, serine, threonine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, proline, and phenylalanine – during electrophile interactions.  Furthermore, this approach facilitated the identification of tryptophan, histidine, arginine, methionine, aspartate, and glutamate as key residues exhibiting preferential engagement.  These findings establish a valuable platform for developing targeted probes and gaining deeper mechanistic understanding of covalent inhibitor formation and protein modification, with implications for drug discovery and biomarker identification.
