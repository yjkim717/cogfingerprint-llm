Title: Proteome-Wide Profiling of Electrophile Selectivity using Alkyne Probes

Abstract:
Covalent inhibitors have emerged as a promising class of therapeutics, yet their development is often hampered by limited understanding of electrophile selectivity. To address this challenge, we developed a competitive residue-specific proteomics workflow to assess the proteome-wide selectivity of 54 alkyne probes harboring diverse reactive groups. By leveraging click chemistry and quantitative mass spectrometry, we systematically profiled the reactivity of these probes against a complex proteome. Our results reveal distinct selectivity profiles for various electrophilic warheads, highlighting the importance of nuanced reactivity patterns in determining proteome-wide targeting. Notably, certain probes exhibited high selectivity for specific cysteine residues, underscoring the potential for rational design of covalent inhibitors. This study provides a comprehensive framework for characterizing electrophile selectivity, thereby facilitating the development of targeted covalent therapeutics. Our findings demonstrate the power of competitive residue-specific proteomics in illuminating the intricate interactions between electrophiles and the proteome.
