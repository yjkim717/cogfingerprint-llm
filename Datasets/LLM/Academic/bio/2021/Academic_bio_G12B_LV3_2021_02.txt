**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits a profound metabolic reprogramming, frequently characterized by the Warburg effect â€“ a reliance on glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation even in the presence of oxygen. This review synthesizes current understanding of the intricate relationship between Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling and glucose metabolism in CRC, highlighting its contribution to this metabolic shift. Emerging evidence indicates that aberrant IGF-1 signaling, often amplified in CRC, directly modulates key glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters, promoting increased glucose uptake and lactate production. Furthermore, we explore the convergence of IGF-1 signaling with metabolic syndrome, a recognized risk factor for CRC development and progression, demonstrating how systemic insulin resistance and dyslipidemia exacerbate the Warburg effect within the tumor microenvironment. This interplay suggests that targeting IGF-1 pathways may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating impaired glucose metabolism in CRC. Finally, we discuss current preclinical and clinical investigations evaluating IGF-1 receptor inhibitors and downstream signaling modulators, alongside combinatorial approaches integrating metabolic interventions, as potential avenues for improved CRC treatment outcomes. This review underscores the critical need for a deeper understanding of these metabolic dependencies to develop targeted therapies that disrupt the metabolic vulnerabilities of CRC cells.
