**Abstract**

The autumn migration of 2021 marked a significant epidemiological shift in the circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), primarily driven by the H5N1 subtype, across Europe. This period witnessed an unprecedented surge in outbreak frequency and geographical spread, affecting both domestic poultry holdings and wild bird populations. The intensification of viral activity was characterized by the widespread detection of the H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, a lineage demonstrating enhanced fitness in a broad range of wild avifauna, which served as a pervasive reservoir and dissemination vector. This ecological dynamic facilitated continuous viral spillover into naive poultry sectors, overwhelming conventional biosecurity protocols. The high viral load in the environment, coupled with the migratory pathways of Anatidae and other aquatic birds, created a persistent epizootic front, challenging containment efforts. Consequently, this crisis underscored critical vulnerabilities in existing risk management frameworks. We argue that the 2021 epizootic necessitates a paradigm shift from reactive culling towards a more robust, integrated mitigation strategy. This strategy must be predicated on a dual-pronged approach: first, the stringent reinforcement of on-farm biosecurity measures, including compartmentalization and heightened surveillance at the wildlife-domestic interface. Second, the proactive development and strategic deployment of next-generation vaccines, tailored to circulating genotypes, must be seriously considered as a complementary tool to prevent economic devastation and reduce the viral load in the environment. Furthermore, enhanced, real-time wild bird surveillance is imperative for early warning and for monitoring potential virus reassortment events, which pose a non-negligible risk for the emergence of novel strains with altered host tropism, including zoonotic potential.
