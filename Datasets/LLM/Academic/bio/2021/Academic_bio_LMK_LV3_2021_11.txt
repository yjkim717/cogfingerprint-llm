Title: Unveiling the Therapeutic Potential of GRF6019 in Alzheimer's Disease: Insights from Longitudinal Proteomics Profiling

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a pressing healthcare challenge. Recent advancements in proteomics profiling have enabled the elucidation of biological pathways modulated by GRF6019, a potential therapeutic agent. Our analysis of two 2021 clinical trials revealed that deep longitudinal proteomics profiling can identify GRF6019-induced changes in AD-related protein networks. By interrogating these proteomic data, we uncovered key biological pathways responsive to GRF6019 treatment, shedding light on its therapeutic mechanisms. This study provides novel insights into GRF6019's potential to modify AD progression, informing future investigations into its efficacy in mitigating age-related cognitive decline.
