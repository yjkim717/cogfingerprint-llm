**Abstract**

The persistent global burden of neuropsychiatric disorders necessitates a robust and well-trained physician workforce, yet significant deficits in psychiatric education persist. This 2021 study, conducted within the medical education framework of Central India, investigates a critical pedagogical challenge: suboptimal attendance in undergraduate psychiatric rotations. We hypothesize that structural and curricular factors, rather than student disinterest alone, are primary determinants of this engagement deficit. A mixed-methods approach was employed, analyzing institutional attendance records and administering structured questionnaires to a cohort of final-year medical students. Quantitative analysis revealed a markedly low mean attendance rate of 58% in psychiatry clerkships, in stark contrast to the >85% average observed in other major clinical disciplines. Subsequent qualitative data identified two predominant systemic drivers: the absence of a dedicated, high-stakes summative examination in psychiatry and the presence of highly flexible, non-enforced attendance policies. These factors collectively diminished the perceived academic value and clinical imperative of the discipline among trainees. The findings indicate that the integration of psychiatry into a composite examination and the lack of mandatory attendance requirements inadvertently signal its secondary importance within the core medical curriculum. Consequently, this study concludes that ad hoc curriculum inclusion is insufficient. It advocates for a paradigm shift towards structural reform, specifically recommending the implementation of a mandatory, discipline-specific examination and the standardization of attendance protocols. Such enhancements are critical to elevating the pedagogical stature of psychiatry, thereby improving student engagement and, ultimately, competency in addressing mental health comorbidities in future clinical practice.
