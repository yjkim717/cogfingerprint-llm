>Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a peer-reviewed publication, based on the provided summary and set in a 2021 context. I've aimed for precision, clarity, and a structure appropriate for the field of biology/mycology.  I've included a few potential expansions and justifications within the text itself (in brackets) to show the thought process.

**CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing in *Pleurotus ostreatus* via Homology-Directed Repair: A Pathway Towards Non-GMO Strain Improvement**

Genome editing technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for targeted modification of organismal traits, yet their application in fungal systems, particularly those with significant biotechnological relevance, remains comparatively underdeveloped. Here, we report the successful implementation of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for genome editing in *Pleurotus ostreatus*, the oyster mushroom, demonstrating a viable route towards targeted strain improvement without the need for traditional genetic modification approaches.  [ *P. ostreatus* is a globally important edible mushroom with diverse industrial applications, motivating the need for improved strains.]  We employed a Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex delivered transiently, coupled with donor DNA templates designed to promote homology-directed repair (HDR) as the primary mechanism of genome modification. Analysis of edited progeny revealed successful targeted insertions and deletions at a predetermined locus in the *P. ostreatus* genome. [Specific details about the targeted locus and editing efficiency would ideally be included here if available for the full paper.] This study establishes a functional CRISPR/Cas9 system in *P. ostreatus*, providing a powerful tool for enhancing desirable traits such as yield, nutritional content, and resistance to pathogens. The reliance on HDR, rather than random integration, aligns with increasingly stringent regulatory frameworks surrounding non-GMO food production, allowing for the potential development of improved mushroom varieties that circumvent conventional genetic modification concerns. Further research will focus on optimizing HDR efficiency and expanding the range of targetable genomic regions.
