**Title:** Curricular Neglect and Its Ethical Implications: An Analysis of Systemic Drivers of Low Psychiatry Attendance in Indian Undergraduate Medical Education

**Abstract**

A significant deficit exists in the preparedness of medical graduates to address the global burden of neuropsychiatric disorders, a crisis acutely felt in resource-constrained settings like India. This 2021 bioethical analysis investigates the systemic factors within undergraduate medical curricula that perpetuate this deficit, focusing on the phenomenon of voluntary non-attendance in psychiatry clinical postings. We posit that this behavior constitutes a rational student response to perverse institutional incentives rather than a simple lack of interest. Drawing on data from a multi-institutional cohort study and a principles-based bioethical framework (encompassing non-maleficence, justice, and professional integrity), we identify the primary drivers: the absence of a dedicated, high-stakes summative examination in psychiatry and the common practice of permitting attendance "adjustments" where absences from psychiatry postings are tacitly accepted to accommodate demands from other, more heavily examined disciplines. This structural marginalization devalues psychiatry as a non-essential component of core medical competence, creating an ethical breach in the educational covenant. The consequence is the graduation of physicians ill-equipped to manage prevalent mental health conditions, thereby exacerbating health disparities and violating the ethical principle of justice in healthcare delivery. We conclude that reform is imperative and must be structural, advocating for the integration of mandatory, examination-backed psychiatry rotations to rectify this pedagogical failure and align educational outcomes with societal health needs. This is not merely a logistical issue but a fundamental bioethical challenge to the integrity of medical education.
