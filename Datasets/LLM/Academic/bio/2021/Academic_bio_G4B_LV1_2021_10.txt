**Abstract**

Advances in proteomic methodologies necessitate robust approaches for assessing the selectivity of small molecule probes. This study presents a novel, proteome-wide workflow designed to evaluate the differential binding affinities of electrophiles towards a complex biological milieu. Utilizing competitive proteomics, we systematically examined the interactions of a panel of diverse electrophiles with a quantitatively labeled proteome, focusing on identifying novel probes capable of sensitively monitoring variations in specific amino acid concentrations.  Our analysis revealed significant selectivity profiles, demonstrating the potential of these electrophiles as biomarkers. Specifically, we identified correlations between probe binding and the abundance of nine key amino acids, suggesting a direct influence on interaction.  These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of post-translational modifications and protein-small molecule interactions, offering a foundation for developing refined analytical strategies within competitive proteomics and potentially informing the design of covalent inhibitors with enhanced specificity.
