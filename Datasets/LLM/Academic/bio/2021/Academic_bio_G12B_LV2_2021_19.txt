**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a critical bottleneck in numerous electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, demanding the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have emerged as promising platforms for OER catalysis due to their tunable compositions and structural versatility. However, achieving high catalytic activity remains a challenge. This study investigates the role of surface-bound carboxylate ligands in modulating the OER performance of MOF/LDH hybrid materials, utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of carboxylate groups directly coordinated to the metal centers significantly enhances OER activity by facilitating advantageous electronic rearrangements within the catalyst structure. Specifically, these ligands promote electron density delocalization from the metal nodes to the reaction intermediates, lowering the activation energy for OER. Furthermore, computational analysis reveals that carboxylate functionalities act as efficient proton relays, accelerating proton transfer steps crucial for the multistep OER pathway. The observed synergistic effect of carboxylate coordination and LDH/MOF architecture provides a rational design strategy for developing high-performance OER electrocatalysts, potentially enabling more sustainable and efficient water splitting and electrochemical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction processes. This work highlights the importance of surface ligand engineering in optimizing the catalytic properties of heterogeneous materials for energy applications and opens avenues for future research focused on tailoring ligand environments to maximize OER efficiency.
