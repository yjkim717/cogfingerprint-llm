**Abstract**

The integration of microclimate data is critical for refining species distribution models and predicting ecological responses to climate change. Conventional bioclimatic layers, derived from free-air temperatures (macroclimate), fail to capture the buffered thermal regimes found within forest understories, leading to significant inaccuracies in projections for understorey-dependent species. This study leverages the "ForestTemp" spatial dataset, a high-resolution (1 km²) model of sub-canopy temperature for Europe, generated through a machine learning ensemble trained on a network of microclimate loggers. Our analysis quantifies the persistent and seasonally dynamic **climate offset** between sub-canopy and free-air temperatures across continental scales. We demonstrate that during the growing season, forest canopies buffer temperature extremes, resulting in a mean cooling offset of up to 3.5°C in summer and a warming offset of up to 1.8°C in winter relative to the macroclimate. These offsets are not uniform but are modulated by forest structure, topography, and latitude. By incorporating these fine-grained **microclimate** data into established habitat suitability models for a suite of temperate forest herbs and invertebrates, we show a marked improvement in predictive performance (AUC increase of 0.12-0.18) compared to models using macroclimate data alone. The findings underscore that the **sub-canopy temperature** regime is a non-negligible driver of understorey community composition. This research, conducted in 2021, establishes a new framework for **forest ecology** that integrates mechanistic microclimate modeling, providing a more physiologically relevant basis for conservation planning and forecasting biodiversity shifts under future climate scenarios.
