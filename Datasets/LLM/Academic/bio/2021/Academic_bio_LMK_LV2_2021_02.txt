Title: IGF-1 Signaling in Colorectal Cancer: Modulating Glucose Metabolism and the Warburg Effect

Abstract:

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignancy characterized by dysregulated cellular metabolism. The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway has been implicated in CRC progression, with emerging evidence suggesting a critical role in modulating glucose metabolism. This review aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF-1's involvement in the Warburg effect, a hallmark of cancer metabolism wherein cells exhibit enhanced glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen. We examine the interplay between IGF-1 signaling and key regulators of glucose metabolism, including glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes. Furthermore, we discuss the relevance of IGF-1's metabolic effects in the context of metabolic syndrome, a condition characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which is a known risk factor for CRC. The review also explores the therapeutic potential of targeting IGF-1 signaling in CRC, with a focus on strategies that modulate glucose metabolism and overcome resistance to conventional therapies. By synthesizing current knowledge on IGF-1's role in CRC metabolism, this review provides insights into the molecular mechanisms driving tumor progression and highlights potential avenues for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. As the incidence of CRC continues to rise, a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between IGF-1 signaling, glucose metabolism, and cancer progression is essential for the development of effective treatments.
