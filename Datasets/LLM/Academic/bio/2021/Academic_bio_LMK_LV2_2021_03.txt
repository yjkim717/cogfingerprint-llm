Title: Efficient Genome Editing in Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9 for Non-GM Molecular Breeding

Abstract:

The CRISPR/Cas9 system has revolutionized genome editing in various organisms, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the application of CRISPR/Cas9 in Pleurotus ostreatus, a commercially significant edible fungus, to facilitate molecular breeding without genetically modified (GM) classification. By leveraging homology-directed repair (HDR), we achieved targeted genome editing in P. ostreatus, enabling the introduction of desirable traits while maintaining non-GM status. Our results show that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing in P. ostreatus is highly efficient, with editing frequencies comparable to those reported in other organisms. The non-GM edited strains generated in this study exhibit improved characteristics, underscoring the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 for accelerating molecular breeding in P. ostreatus. This technology has significant implications for the development of novel, non-GM cultivated strains, providing a valuable tool for the fungal breeding community. As such, our findings contribute to the advancement of precision breeding in P. ostreatus, aligning with the growing demand for non-GM crops.
