**Abstract**

Recent advances in genome editing technologies have expanded opportunities for manipulating fungal genetics, presenting novel avenues for strain improvement and biotechnological applications. This study reports the successful implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing within *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom), a commercially significant edible fungus. Utilizing a non-genetically modified (non-GM) approach, we achieved targeted gene mutagenesis, specifically focusing on inducing drug resistance and introducing defined mutations within the fungal genome. Our methodology involved optimized guide RNA design and delivery protocols to maximize editing efficiency. Preliminary results demonstrate significant success in generating stable mutant lines exhibiting altered phenotypes, suggesting a versatile platform for tailoring *P. ostreatus* characteristics.  The absence of traditional genetic modification underscores the potential of this technique for producing pharmaceutical precursors and enhancing fungal resilience in controlled environments. Further research will investigate the functional consequences of these mutations and explore the broader implications for fungal biotechnology, highlighting the adaptability of CRISPR-Cas9 within a complex eukaryotic system.
