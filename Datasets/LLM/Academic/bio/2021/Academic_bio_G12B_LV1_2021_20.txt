**Abstract: Spatiotemporal Disparities in Forest Sub-Canopy Temperature and Implications for Biodiversity Modeling Across European Biomes**

Understanding the microclimatic conditions within forest ecosystems is crucial for accurately predicting species distributions and assessing vulnerability to climate change. While macroclimatic data provides a broad overview of temperature regimes, the thermal environment experienced by understory organisms can deviate substantially, impacting physiological processes and community assembly. This study investigates spatiotemporal variations in forest sub-canopy temperatures across a diverse range of European biomes, employing a novel machine learning (ML) approach to generate high-resolution temperature predictions. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset integrating remotely sensed environmental variables (NDVI, EVI, land surface temperature, topographic indices) and macroclimatic records (ERA5 reanalysis), we trained a gradient boosting regression model to estimate sub-canopy temperatures at a 1km resolution. Results demonstrate significant discrepancies between free-air temperatures and predicted sub-canopy temperatures, with average differences ranging from -5°C to +8°C dependent on forest structure and landscape context.  Furthermore, we observed substantial regional variation in these temperature offsets, reflecting biome-specific differences in canopy density, leaf area index, and topographic complexity.  The predictive model exhibited high accuracy (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.78, RMSE = 3.2°C), demonstrating its potential for large-scale biodiversity modeling.  We argue that neglecting sub-canopy microclimate in species distribution models (SDMs) can lead to inaccurate projections of species ranges and misinterpretations of climate change impacts.  These findings highlight the importance of incorporating fine-scale microclimatic data into ecological research and conservation planning, particularly as climate change exacerbates thermal stress on vulnerable populations. Future research should focus on integrating physiological responses to sub-canopy temperature into SDMs to enhance predictive capabilities.

**Explanation of Choices & Terminology:**

*   **Formal Tone & Structure:** The abstract follows a standard IMRaD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion) structure.
*   **Precise Terminology:** I used terms like "spatiotemporal," "biomes," "remotely sensed," "ERA5 reanalysis," "gradient boosting regression," "leaf area index," "species distribution models (SDMs)," "RMSE," and "topographic indices" to align with the field.
*   **Year Context (2021):**  The mention of ERA5 reanalysis (a widely used climate dataset released in 2019) and the focus on machine learning are consistent with trends in ecological research around that time.
*   **Building on the Summary:** The abstract expands on the core idea of predicting sub-canopy temperatures with ML, emphasizing the differences from macroclimate and the resulting landscape variation.
*   **Biodiversity Focus:** I explicitly linked the temperature predictions to biodiversity modeling and the potential for improved species distribution projections.
*   **Emphasis on Implications:** The discussion section highlights the consequences of ignoring sub
