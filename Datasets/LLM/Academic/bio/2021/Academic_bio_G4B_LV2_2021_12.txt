**Abstract**

Transcriptional noise, the inherent stochasticity in RNA transcription rates, represents a critical yet incompletely understood factor governing cellular heterogeneity. This study introduces a novel framework for modeling transcriptional noise, leveraging the integration of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and discrete RNA process representations. Traditional analyses often struggle to reconcile the continuous dynamics of transcription with the discrete nature of biochemical events. Our approach addresses this limitation by formulating a series of SDEs that capture the underlying stochastic mechanisms of RNA polymerase progression and termination, while simultaneously incorporating discrete representations for events such as promoter clearance. 

We demonstrate the utility of this combined approach in quantifying regulatory fluctuations across cell populations. Single-molecule quantification techniques, implicitly embedded within the modelâ€™s stochastic framework, allow for the dissection of transcriptional noise into distinct components reflecting both intrinsic molecular variability and extrinsic regulatory influences.  The resulting models offer enhanced interpretability, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving cell-to-cell variation in gene expression.  This work provides a foundation for future investigations into the functional consequences of transcriptional noise in diverse biological contexts.
