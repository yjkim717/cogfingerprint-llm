**Abstract**

The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a critical bottleneck in sustainable energy technologies. While metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have shown promise, their performance is often limited by sluggish kinetics and poor electrical conductivity. In this study, we report a novel bio-inspired electrocatalyst synthesized through the *in-situ* growth of a nickel-based LDH on a carboxylate-rich MOF, where the organic ligand is a synthetic analogue of the redox-active tyrosine side chain. We demonstrate that the pendant carboxylate groups are not merely structural linkers but play a pivotal functional role. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal that these moieties facilitate intramolecular electron redistribution, stabilizing high-valent nickel-oxo (Ni<sup>IV</sup>=O) intermediates analogous to those found in the oxygen-evolving complex of Photosystem II. This electronic modulation, coupled with the carboxylates' role in accelerating interfacial proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET), results in a composite material with exceptional OER activity, achieving an overpotential of 270 mV at 10 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> in alkaline media. This work establishes a new paradigm for designing bio-mimetic electrocatalysts by leveraging the multifunctionality of organic ligands.
