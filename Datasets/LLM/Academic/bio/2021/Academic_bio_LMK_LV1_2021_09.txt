Title: Unveiling Pre-Amyloid Aggregation Alzheimer's Disease Subtypes through Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomics in Cognitively Intact Individuals

Abstract:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a prolonged preclinical phase. Recent advancements in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics have enabled the identification of novel biomarkers and potential disease mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the CSF proteome of cognitively intact, amyloid-negative individuals to elucidate potential AD subtypes preceding amyloid aggregation. Using a discovery-based proteomics approach, we analyzed CSF samples from 150 cognitively normal participants, categorized as amyloid-negative based on amyloid-β 42/40 ratio. Unsupervised clustering revealed three distinct proteomic subtypes, characterized by differential expression of proteins associated with neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and cellular stress response. Notably, these subtypes were not correlated with age, sex, or APOE ε4 status. Pathway analysis revealed that subtype-specific protein signatures converged on distinct biological processes, including complement activation, cytoskeletal remodeling, and oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that cognitively intact, amyloid-negative individuals can exhibit distinct proteomic profiles that may predispose to AD. These pre-amyloid aggregation subtypes may provide novel insights into the earliest stages of AD pathogenesis, potentially enabling early intervention and prevention strategies. The identification of subtype-specific biomarkers may facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic approaches, underscoring the importance of CSF proteomics in elucidating the complex biology of AD. This study highlights the value of proteomic subtyping in understanding the heterogeneity of AD and its preclinical phase, paving the way for future research into early disease mechanisms and precision medicine applications.
