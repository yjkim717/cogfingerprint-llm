**Abstract**

The efficient utilization of cellular metabolic pathways necessitates a deeper understanding of enzyme-substrate interactions at the molecular level. This research investigates the impact of surface-bound carboxylate moieties on the catalytic performance of metalloenzyme mimics, specifically utilizing a layered double hydroxide (LDH) scaffold incorporating nickel and iron. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were employed to model interfacial electron redistribution dynamics during a simplified model reaction. Results indicate that strategically positioned carboxylate ligands significantly accelerate reaction rates, likely through enhanced proton transfer and stabilization of key catalytic intermediates. These findings suggest a novel approach for engineering biomimetic catalysts – leveraging surface adsorption of functional ligands to modulate electronic structure and promote substrate binding. Further investigation into analogous systems promises to contribute to advancements in synthetic biology and biocatalysis.
