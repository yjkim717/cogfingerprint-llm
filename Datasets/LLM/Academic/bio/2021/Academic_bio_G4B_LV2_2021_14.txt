**Abstract**

Intracellular vesicle trafficking, particularly of endosomes, exhibits significant heterogeneity, complicating mechanistic understanding. This study investigates the dynamic behavior of endosomes within living mammalian cells, employing single-particle tracking (SPT) to resolve this complexity. Utilizing advanced imaging techniques, we identified distinct subpopulations of endosomes characterized by markedly disparate movement speeds. Detailed local analysis revealed a pronounced dichotomy between slow- and fast-moving groups, suggesting spatially-resolved differences in trafficking dynamics.  To quantitatively model these observed disparities, we incorporated fractional Brownian motion (fBm) into our analysis, recognizing the deviation from classical Brownian motion observed in these vesicles.  Specifically, fBm parameters were fitted to the SPT data, providing a robust framework for describing the heterogeneous transport of endosomes.  These findings underscore the importance of considering spatial organization and non-Gaussian stochastic processes when characterizing endosomal dynamics and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of intracellular transport networks.
