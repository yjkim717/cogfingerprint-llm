**Abstract**

A 2021 cross-sectional investigation into undergraduate medical education in India identified a critical deficit in student engagement with psychiatry clinical postings, revealing a systemic vulnerability within biomedical training paradigms. The study, contextualized within the broader challenges of integrating mental health competencies into core medical curricula, quantified attendance rates that fell significantly below pedagogical benchmarks. Structured analysis of survey and institutional data pinpointed two primary etiological factors driving this educational disengagement. Firstly, the absence of a dedicated, high-stakes summative examination for psychiatry devalued the discipline's perceived academic currency, relegating it to an elective status in the cognitive hierarchy of students navigating a high-pressure environment. Secondly, the operationalization of lenient attendance monitoring protocols created a permissive environment, enabling students to strategically allocate their time to specialities perceived as more consequential for career progression without substantive academic penalty. These findings underscore a fundamental misalignment between curricular intent and the implicit incentives shaped by assessment structures and administrative policies. Consequently, the study posits that rectifying this engagement gap necessitates a dual-pronged intervention: the mandatory implementation of rigorous, discipline-specific examinations to confer academic weight and the systematic enforcement of stricter attendance mandates. Such structural reforms are imperative to recalibrate student priorities, thereby enhancing the acquisition of foundational psychiatric competencies and ensuring the development of a more holistically skilled biomedical workforce capable of addressing the population's burgeoning mental health needs.
