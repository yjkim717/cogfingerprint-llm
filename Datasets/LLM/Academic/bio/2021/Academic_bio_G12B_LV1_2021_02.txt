**Title: Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Signaling and Metabolic Reprogramming in Colorectal Cancer: Implications for Targeted Therapies**

**Abstract:**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits a profound metabolic shift towards glycolysis, a phenomenon commonly known as the Warburg effect, which supports rapid proliferation and survival even under hypoxic conditions. Accumulating evidence highlights the critical role of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling in orchestrating this metabolic reprogramming within the tumor microenvironment. This review synthesizes current understanding of the intricate interplay between IGF-1 signaling and glucose metabolism in CRC, focusing on downstream effectors and potential vulnerabilities for therapeutic intervention.

The IGF-1/IGF-1R axis, frequently overexpressed or activated in CRC, initiates a cascade of intracellular signaling events primarily mediated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC) pathway. Activation of this pathway not only promotes cell growth and survival but also directly influences glucose uptake, glycolysis, and lactate production. Specifically, IGF-1 signaling enhances the expression of glucose transporters (GLUTs), notably GLUT1, increasing glucose flux into cancer cells. Furthermore, it upregulates glycolytic enzymes, such as hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), thereby accelerating the conversion of glucose to lactate, even in the presence of oxygen.  The mTORC1 complex, a key downstream effector, plays a pivotal role in regulating ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis, further contributing to the heightened metabolic demands of proliferating CRC cells.

Emerging research indicates that disrupting IGF-1 signaling or targeting key components of the PI3K/Akt/mTORC pathway can effectively inhibit the Warburg effect and suppress CRC progression.  While traditional chemotherapy can induce metabolic stress, the development of highly selective inhibitors of IGF-1R, PI3K isoforms, Akt, and mTORC1 presents opportunities for more targeted therapeutic strategies. Combination therapies, integrating metabolic inhibitors with conventional treatments, represent a promising approach to overcome resistance and enhance treatment efficacy.  Future research should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers to stratify patients most likely to benefit from these targeted interventions, ultimately improving outcomes in CRC management. The complex metabolic dependencies of CRC, particularly those governed by IGF-1 signaling, offer a fertile ground for the development of innovative and personalized therapeutic approaches.
