**Abstract**

The autumn of 2021 marked a period of unprecedented epizootic activity of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), subtype H5N1, across the European continent, presenting a formidable challenge to both animal and public health infrastructures. This epidemiological surge, characterized by an anomalously early onset and widespread geographical dissemination between September and December, resulted in severe mortality events across wild bird populations and necessitated the large-scale culling of domestic poultry. The primary objective of this analysis is to delineate the drivers of this epizootic and to evaluate the efficacy of existing biosecurity protocols, thereby proposing a consolidated framework for enhanced mitigation. We posit that the convergence of three key factors precipitated the crisis: first, the persistence and viral evolution of H5N1 within resident wild bird populations, which acted as a perennial reservoir; second, altered migratory patterns potentially influenced by climatic variables, which facilitated viral introduction into previously unaffected regions; and third, significant vulnerabilities in the biosecurity measures implemented across the poultry production chain, from commercial facilities to backyard holdings. Our methodological approach involved a synthesis of outbreak reports from the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), coupled with a critical review of national surveillance and containment policies. The findings indicate that while conventional measures such as confinement orders and monitoring of high-risk areas were deployed, they proved insufficient to contain the virus's rapid spread. The unprecedented scale of environmental viral load led to incursions into facilities with previously adequate biosecurity, highlighting a new paradigm of transmission intensity. Consequently, this abstract concludes with a critical call for a paradigm shift in avian influenza management, advocating for the integration of advanced, real-time genomic surveillance of wild birds, the mandatory implementation of heightened, compartmentalized biosecurity standards across the poultry industry, and the development of robust cross-border collaboration frameworks. These enhanced strategies are imperative to safeguard global food security and mitigate zoonotic risk.
