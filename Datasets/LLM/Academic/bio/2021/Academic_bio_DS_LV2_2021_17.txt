**Title:** Systemic Curricular Deficits and Their Impact on Psychiatry Attendance in Indian Undergraduate Medical Education

**Abstract**

The integration of robust psychiatric training within the undergraduate medical curriculum is a critical bio-psychosocial imperative, given the escalating global burden of neuropsychiatric disorders. This study investigates a significant pedagogical challenge within Indian medical education: the persistently low attendance in compulsory psychiatry rotations. We hypothesize that this phenomenon is not primarily a function of student disinterest, but rather a direct consequence of systemic structural deficiencies within the curriculum itself. A cross-sectional, mixed-methods analysis was conducted across five major Indian medical institutions, employing quantitative attendance audits coupled with qualitative focus group discussions with final-year medical students (N=478). Our findings robustly indicate that the absence of a dedicated, high-stakes summative examination in psychiatry, in contrast to other major clinical disciplines, significantly diminishes its perceived academic valence among students. Concurrently, the prevalence of lenient attendance enforcement policies in competing, examination-heavy subjects creates a perverse incentive structure. This effectively encourages strategic resource allocation, where students prioritize attendance in subjects with stringent accountability measures and direct examination consequences. The data compellingly suggest that these curricular asymmetries devalue psychiatry's standing, inadvertently framing it as a non-essential component of core medical training. We conclude that low attendance is a symptomatic manifestation of deeper systemic flaws. Therefore, pedagogical interventions must extend beyond student engagement strategies to include fundamental curricular reforms. Mandating a separate psychiatry examination and standardizing attendance accountability across all disciplines are proposed as critical, evidence-based steps to rectify this bio-educational disparity and ensure a comprehensively trained physician workforce.
