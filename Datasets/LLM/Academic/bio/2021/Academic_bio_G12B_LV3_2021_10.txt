**Abstract**

The development of covalent inhibitors has revolutionized targeted protein modification, but a comprehensive understanding of their proteome-wide selectivity remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a novel, unbiased proteomic workflow to address this gap. Leveraging alkyne probes and click chemistry, our approach enables direct and quantitative assessment of electrophile reactivity across the entire proteome. We screened 54 distinct alkyne-containing probes, revealing nuanced variations in their binding preferences. Critically, this methodology facilitated the identification of probes exhibiting selective modification of nine key amino acid residues, including tryptophan, histidine, and arginine â€“ residues often implicated in protein function and signaling. This proteome-wide selectivity profiling provides an unprecedented resource for rational covalent inhibitor design and expands the applicability of alkyne probes for targeted amino acid modification studies. The resulting data will be invaluable for future investigations into protein function, drug discovery, and chemical biology.
