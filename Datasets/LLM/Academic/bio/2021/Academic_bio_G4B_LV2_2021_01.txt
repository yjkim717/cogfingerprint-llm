**Abstract**

Endosomal trafficking represents a fundamental yet complex process governing cellular homeostasis and implicated in various disease states. This study investigates the heterogeneous dynamics of endosome movement within living mammalian cells, employing single-particle tracking to resolve previously obscured spatial variability. Utilizing advanced microscopy techniques, we identified distinct subpopulations of endosomes exhibiting markedly divergent motility characteristics â€“ a discernible segregation into slow and fast-moving groups.  To quantitatively characterize this heterogeneity, we applied a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) framework, recognizing that conventional Brownian motion models fail to adequately represent the observed dynamics.  Our analysis reveals a significant fBm component within the endosome trajectories, suggesting a non-Markovian transport process.  Local analysis of these trajectories further highlights the importance of spatial context in dictating endosomal movement. These findings underscore the necessity of moving beyond simplistic models of endosomal transport and emphasize the potential for fractional Brownian motion to provide a more accurate description of this vital cellular mechanism.
