**Abstract**

Dysregulation of glucose metabolism and the emergence of metabolic syndrome represent significant risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Recent investigations have increasingly implicated insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling as a pivotal mediator in this complex interplay. This review synthesizes current literature examining the bidirectional relationship between IGF-1, glucose metabolism, the Warburg effect, and CRC pathogenesis, with a focus on insights gained in 2021. 

Elevated IGF-1 levels are frequently observed in CRC tissues, correlating with enhanced glucose uptake and proliferation, a phenomenon often termed the ‘Warburg effect’.  IGF-1 signaling promotes glycolysis and lactate production, contributing to the metabolic rewiring characteristic of malignant cells. Furthermore, chronic activation of the IGF-1/PI3K/AKT pathway has been demonstrated to exacerbate insulin resistance and dysregulate hepatic glucose production, key features of metabolic syndrome. 

These observations suggest a mechanistic link wherein metabolic disturbances drive IGF-1 signaling, which in turn fuels CRC progression.  Consequently, targeting IGF-1 signaling pathways presents a potentially viable therapeutic strategy for individuals with both metabolic syndrome and elevated CRC risk. Future research should prioritize delineating specific downstream effectors and exploring the feasibility of selective IGF-1 inhibition in combination with conventional CRC therapies.
