Here we present a comprehensive, proteome-wide selectivity profiling platform for covalent inhibitors, addressing a critical gap in chemical biology and drug discovery. Our competitive chemoproteomic workflow systematically evaluated 54 structurally diverse electrophilic probes against the human proteome, establishing an unbiased selectivity atlas. This high-throughput methodology enabled the identification of novel, highly selective chemical tools capable of monitoring nine distinct amino acid side chains and the protein N-terminus. By mapping electrophile reactivity across thousands of competing protein residues, we provide unprecedented insights into covalent probe behavior at proteomic scale. These findings establish new standards for covalent inhibitor development and offer transformative potential for targeted protein degradation and activity-based protein profiling applications. The identified probe sets represent valuable resources for advancing chemical biology research and developing more selective therapeutic agents.
