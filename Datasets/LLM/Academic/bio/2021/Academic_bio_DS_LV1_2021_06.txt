**Abstract**

The development of efficient bio-electrocatalytic systems for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a critical challenge in sustainable energy conversion. While synthetic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have shown promise, their integration with biological components for enhanced catalytic function is underexplored. Here, we report a novel bio-hybrid electrocatalyst engineered through the functionalization of a nickel-based LDH with a recombinant, carboxylate-rich peptide motif derived from native metalloenzyme cofactors. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses confirm that the carboxylate ligands facilitate critical electron redistribution at the nickel centers, stabilizing high-valent Ni(IV) species under operational conditions, a state analogous to the highly reactive S4 state of the oxygen-evolving complex in photosystem II. This peptide-induced electronic modulation significantly lowers the overpotential and accelerates the reaction kinetics compared to the pristine LDH. Furthermore, the bio-derived framework enhances proton-coupled electron transfer efficiency, as evidenced by a reduced Tafel slope. Our findings, obtained in 2021, demonstrate a rational design principle for next-generation bio-electrocatalysts, where engineered biological ligands can be harnessed to precisely tailor the electronic structure of inorganic centers, bridging the gap between synthetic materials and enzymatic efficiency for advanced energy applications.
