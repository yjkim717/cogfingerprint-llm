**Abstract**

The year 2021 witnessed a significant and geographically widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically clade 2.3.4.4b, posing a substantial threat to both domestic poultry populations and wild avian species across Europe. Initial detections, commencing in September, rapidly expanded throughout the autumn and into December, revealing a concerning level of transmissibility and pathogenic potential. This event underscores the escalating risk associated with zoonotic influenza viruses and highlights the vulnerability of established biosecurity protocols. 

Analysis of affected poultry revealed a notable presence of clade 2.3.4.4b, a lineage previously identified in wild migratory birds, suggesting a complex interplay between reservoir hosts and susceptible farmed populations. Surveillance efforts focused on migratory wild bird populations, particularly those exhibiting atypical morbidity and mortality, indicated a broader ecological distribution of the virus.  The rapid spread necessitates a re-evaluation of current preventative measures, emphasizing stringent biosecurity protocols within poultry operations and enhanced surveillance programs targeting wild bird populations.  Furthermore, investigation into the precise mechanisms of viral transmission between avian reservoirs and domestic fowl is crucial for developing targeted mitigation strategies.  Continued monitoring and genomic characterization of circulating strains are essential to predict future outbreaks and adapt public health responses effectively.
