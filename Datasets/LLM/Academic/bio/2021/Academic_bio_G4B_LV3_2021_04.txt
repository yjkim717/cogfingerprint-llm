**Abstract**

This study investigates attendance patterns within undergraduate medical education in a geographically defined region of Central India during 2021. Analysis of student engagement with psychiatry training modules revealed a concerning level of attrition, with approximately 27% of participants in Group A and one-third of those in Group B failing to attend scheduled sessions. The primary cited barriers to participation centered on the absence of dedicated examinations assessing psychiatric knowledge and the perceived incompatibility of these sessions with existing curricular demands across other medical disciplines. These findings underscore a critical deficiency in the current undergraduate medical curriculum’s support for specialized training. Addressing this issue through targeted interventions – including integrated assessment strategies and curricular restructuring – is imperative to ensure future physicians possess adequate competency in mental health diagnosis and treatment. Further research should explore the specific contextual factors contributing to this absenteeism within this population.
