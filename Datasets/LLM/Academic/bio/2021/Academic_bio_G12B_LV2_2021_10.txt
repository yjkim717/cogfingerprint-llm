**Abstract**

The development of highly selective chemical probes is crucial for targeted protein manipulation and detailed elucidation of biological processes. While covalent inhibitors offer advantages in terms of target engagement, achieving proteome-wide selectivity remains a significant challenge. Here, we present a novel workflow leveraging alkyne probes and residue-specific proteomics to comprehensively assess the selectivity profiles of 54 distinct covalent inhibitors against the human proteome. Our approach combines targeted chemical modification with high-resolution mass spectrometry to identify and quantify off-target labeling events, enabling a rigorous evaluation of probe specificity. Through this analysis, we identified previously unreported, high-selectivity probes for nine amino acid residues: Asparagine, Glutamine, Histidine, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Serine, Threonine, and Tryptophan. The resulting probes demonstrate minimal cross-reactivity across a broad range of proteins, representing a substantial advancement in the field of chemical proteomics. These selective tools facilitate more precise investigations into residue-specific protein functions and offer valuable resources for targeted protein degradation and chemical biology applications. The described workflow provides a robust framework for the rational design and evaluation of future covalent inhibitors, minimizing unintended consequences and accelerating the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
