Title: Quantifying Heterogeneous Endosomal Dynamics in Living Cells via Anomalous Diffusion Models

Abstract:
The intracellular transport of endosomes is a complex process essential for cellular homeostasis. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the motion of endosomes in living cells, categorizing their trajectories into slow and fast moving subpopulations. Our analysis revealed that both groups exhibit anomalous diffusion characteristics, deviating from traditional Brownian motion. We employed a heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion (FBM) model to capture the intricacies of endosomal dynamics. By quantifying the anomalous diffusion exponent and the generalized Hurst exponent, we distinguished between the two subpopulations and characterized their distinct motion patterns. Our results demonstrate that the FBM model effectively describes the heterogeneous motion of endosomes, providing insights into the complex intracellular transport processes. This study contributes to the understanding of cellular dynamics, shedding light on the underlying biophysical mechanisms governing endosomal transport in living cells (2021).
