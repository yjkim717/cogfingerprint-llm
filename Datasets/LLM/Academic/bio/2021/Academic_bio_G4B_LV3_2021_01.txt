**Abstract**

Recent investigations into intracellular trafficking have revealed significant heterogeneity in endosomal dynamics within eukaryotic cells. This study, conducted in 2021, utilizes single-particle tracking to characterize the movement of endosomes, identifying distinct subpopulations exhibiting markedly different speeds.  Traditional Brownian motion models fail to adequately capture this observed variability, necessitating a refined approach.  We propose a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) model to account for the non-Gaussian nature of endosomal trajectories, demonstrating that endosomes display intermittent, ‘jumps’ in their movement alongside continuous drift.  Local analysis of these trajectories reveals spatial clustering of slow-moving vesicles, suggesting a potential role for local regulatory mechanisms.  These findings underscore the importance of adopting a heterogeneous transport framework when studying endosomal function and highlight the predictive power of fBm in elucidating the complex choreography of intracellular cargo delivery.
