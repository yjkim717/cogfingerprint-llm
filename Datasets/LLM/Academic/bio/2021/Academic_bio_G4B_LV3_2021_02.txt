**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) frequently exhibits aberrant glucose metabolism, a phenomenon often termed the ‘Warburg effect,’ and is intricately linked to metabolic syndrome (Mets). Recent research increasingly implicates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling as a critical mediator in this complex interplay. This review synthesizes current evidence demonstrating that elevated IGF-1 levels promote CRC development by stimulating glycolytic flux and supporting the Warburg effect, thereby contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, IGF-1 signaling appears to exacerbate metabolic dysfunction characteristic of Mets, creating a positive feedback loop within the tumor microenvironment. Targeting IGF-1 pathways represents a promising therapeutic avenue for CRC, particularly in patients with metabolic comorbidities.  Future research should focus on elucidating the specific molecular mechanisms driving this connection and evaluating the efficacy of IGF-1 inhibitors in conjunction with established metabolic interventions to restore impaired glucose homeostasis within the tumor.
