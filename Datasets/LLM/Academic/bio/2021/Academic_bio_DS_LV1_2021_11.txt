**Title:** Deep Proteomic Profiling Elucidates Plasma Pathway Modulation in Response to GRF6019 in Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Clinical Trials

**Background:** The search for effective Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics is hampered by an incomplete understanding of drug-induced molecular responses. GRF6019, an investigational plasma-derived therapy, has shown promise in early clinical studies, yet its mechanism of action remains poorly characterized.

**Methods:** We conducted a large-scale, deep proteomic profiling analysis of longitudinal plasma samples collected from participants in Phase 2 clinical trials of GRF6019. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we quantified over 1,000 proteins to identify treatment-associated alterations.

**Results:** Comparative analysis revealed significant, dose-dependent modulation of a specific subset of plasma proteins in GRF6019-treated cohorts versus placebo. Bioinformatic pathway enrichment analysis implicated these proteins in key biological processes, most notably neurotrophic signaling, inflammatory regulation, and synaptic integrity.

**Conclusion:** Our findings provide the first human plasma-based molecular evidence that GRF6019 engages with core pathophysiological pathways in AD. These proteomic signatures serve as compelling pharmacodynamic biomarkers, offering critical insights for future clinical development and supporting the therapeutic potential of GRF6019.
