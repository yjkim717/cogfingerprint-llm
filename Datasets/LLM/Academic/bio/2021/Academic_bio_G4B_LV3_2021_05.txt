**Abstract**

The year 2021 witnessed a concerning escalation in the global spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically the H5N8 and H5N2 subtypes, manifesting as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).  Widespread detections impacted poultry populations across Europe and the United Kingdom, triggering significant economic disruption and necessitating immediate adaptive responses.  This study examines the rapid geographic expansion of HPAI, highlighting the critical role of wild bird populations as potential vectors of transmission.  Increased surveillance efforts, coupled with enhanced biosecurity protocols within poultry facilities, proved insufficient to contain the outbreaks, underscoring the complexity of managing zoonotic influenza threats.  Further research is required to fully delineate the ecological drivers of HPAI propagation and to refine predictive models for future incursions.  Consequently, a coordinated, multi-faceted approach integrating veterinary epidemiology, environmental monitoring, and robust biosecurity practices remains paramount to mitigating the risk posed by HPAI to the global poultry industry and public health.
