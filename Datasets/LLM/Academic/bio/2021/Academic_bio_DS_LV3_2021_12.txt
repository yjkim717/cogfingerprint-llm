In 2021, the field of transcriptional regulation was increasingly focused on dissecting the origins and functional consequences of transcriptional noiseâ€”the cell-to-cell variability in RNA output from identical genetic templates. While single-molecule quantification techniques, such as live-cell RNA imaging and single-cell RNA-seq, provide unprecedented resolution for observing stochastic bursts of gene activity, interpreting this empirical data requires robust theoretical frameworks. This work addresses that need by developing a suite of interpretable stochastic models grounded in first-principles biophysics. These models are deliberately constructed for analytical tractability, enabling the derivation of closed-form solutions for key noise statistics like the Fano factor and coefficient of variation. The primary utility of this theoretical approach lies in its capacity to formally discriminate between competing mechanistic hypotheses for observed transcriptional dynamics. For instance, the models can delineate whether noise signatures arise from promoter state switching, enzyme concentration fluctuations, or chromatin remodeling kinetics. By establishing a direct, mathematically rigorous link between specific biophysical parameters and experimental observables, this framework provides a critical roadmap for designing decisive single-molecule experiments. Consequently, it moves the field beyond mere phenomenological description toward a predictive, mechanistic understanding of gene expression heterogeneity.
