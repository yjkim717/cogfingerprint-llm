Title: Precise Genome Editing in Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9: A Novel Paradigm for Non-GM Molecular Breeding

Abstract:
The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system has revolutionized the field of molecular biology, enabling precise modifications to the genomes of various organisms. In 2021, we leveraged this technology to achieve efficient genome editing in Pleurotus ostreatus, a commercially significant edible fungus. By harnessing the CRISPR/Cas9 system's ability to induce homology-directed repair (HDR), we successfully introduced targeted mutations into the P. ostreatus genome. This breakthrough facilitates the development of novel, non-GM cultivated strains with desirable traits, thereby circumventing regulatory hurdles associated with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Our findings demonstrate the potential of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to accelerate the molecular breeding of P. ostreatus, paving the way for the creation of improved cultivars with enhanced nutritional and agronomic properties. This innovative approach has significant implications for the future of fungal biotechnology and sustainable agriculture.
