Title: Quantifying Transcriptional Noise: A Modeling Approach to Disentangle Stochastic Transcription Rate Variability

Abstract:

Transcriptional noise, arising from the inherent stochasticity of gene expression, plays a crucial role in various biological processes. Recent advances in single-molecule quantification have enabled the precise measurement of transcriptional variability, sparking a debate on the origins of transcription rate variation. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we developed a suite of interpretable mathematical models that capture the complexities of transcriptional noise. By incorporating stochastic transcription rates, our models provide a robust framework for analyzing the fluctuations in gene expression.

Our modeling approach allows for the systematic evaluation of competing hypotheses regarding transcription rate variability, facilitating the design of experiments to distinguish between them. By simulating various transcriptional scenarios, we demonstrate that distinct stochastic processes can be discerned through the careful analysis of single-molecule data. Furthermore, our models predict that the magnitude and dynamics of transcriptional noise are intricately linked to the underlying transcriptional regulation mechanisms.

The presented modeling framework offers a powerful tool for investigating the role of transcriptional noise in biological processes, enabling researchers to probe the intricacies of gene regulation with unprecedented precision. By providing a quantitative understanding of transcriptional variability, our work paves the way for the development of novel experimental strategies to elucidate the complex interplay between stochastic transcription rates and biological function. Ultimately, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate mechanisms governing gene expression, shedding light on the subtle yet significant impact of transcriptional noise on cellular behavior.
