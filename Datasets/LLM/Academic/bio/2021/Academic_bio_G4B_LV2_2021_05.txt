**Abstract**

The year 2021 witnessed a widespread and concerning epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically the H5N8 and H5N1 subtypes, impacting both domestic poultry populations and a significant number of wild bird species across multiple European nations.  This emergent threat necessitated immediate investigation and implementation of stringent biosecurity protocols to mitigate further spread and economic losses within the poultry industry.  Our analysis, drawing upon data collected between September and December 2021, reveals a geographically dispersed pattern of HPAI detection, highlighting the complex interplay between domestic and wild bird reservoirs.

Genetic analysis of circulating viral strains, conducted through phylogenetic sequencing, demonstrated evidence of sustained viral evolution and adaptation within the wild bird populations.  Notably, increased genetic diversity observed in *Gallus gallus* (red junglefowl) samples – a primary progenitor of commercially raised poultry – suggests a potential pathway for zoonotic transmission.  Furthermore, investigation into migratory patterns of affected wild bird species, primarily waterfowl and scavenging birds, indicated long-distance dispersal capabilities, contributing to the rapid expansion of the outbreak’s geographical reach. 

The observed prevalence of HPAI in wild birds underscores the critical role of these species as amplifying hosts and potential vectors for pathogen transmission.  Consequently, enhanced surveillance programs focused on wild bird populations, coupled with improved biosecurity measures within poultry farms, are paramount.  Future research should prioritize detailed studies of viral evolution, host-pathogen interactions, and the efficacy of various preventative strategies – including vaccination – to effectively manage and ultimately control future HPAI outbreaks.
