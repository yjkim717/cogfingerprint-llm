**Abstract**

Transcriptional noise is a fundamental source of phenotypic heterogeneity, yet discriminating its underlying mechanisms from single-cell data remains a significant challenge in quantitative biology. While single-molecule quantification techniques have revealed extensive cell-to-cell variation in RNA transcription, interpreting these data to distinguish between competing biophysical models—such as promoter state switching versus transcriptional bursting—is non-trivial. In this work, we develop a suite of interpretable stochastic models that explicitly map specific biological hypotheses to distinct statistical signatures in single-cell RNA count distributions. Our framework integrates key parameters such as burst frequency, size, and promoter activation kinetics to generate testable, quantitative predictions. We demonstrate how these models can rigorously guide experimental design by identifying the minimal resolution and sampling depth required to achieve statistical power for hypothesis discrimination. This approach provides a principled, model-based strategy to move beyond descriptive characterizations of noise, enabling the precise inference of kinetic parameters from live-cell imaging or single-cell RNA sequencing data. Our work establishes a critical bridge between theoretical biophysical modeling and empirical research, offering a generalizable methodology to elucidate the dynamic principles governing stochastic gene expression.
