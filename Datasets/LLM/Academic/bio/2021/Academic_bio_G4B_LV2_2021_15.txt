**Abstract**

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling has emerged as a significant modulator of metabolic homeostasis and a potential driver of colorectal carcinogenesis. This review synthesizes recent evidence highlighting the intricate interplay between IGF-1, glucose metabolism, and the Warburg effect – a hallmark of cancer characterized by aerobic glycolysis – within the context of colorectal tumor development.  We explore how aberrant IGF-1 signaling contributes to metabolic syndrome, frequently observed in colorectal cancer patients, through mechanisms impacting glucose uptake and utilization. 

Specifically, the study investigates the correlation between elevated IGF-1 levels and the intensified Warburg effect in colorectal cancer cells, suggesting a positive feedback loop wherein cancer metabolism fuels further IGF-1 production.  Further analysis reveals that IGF-1 signaling can directly influence key metabolic pathways, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, impacting cellular growth and survival.  Moreover, the review posits that IGF-1 may exacerbate the phenotypic consequences of the Warburg effect by promoting angiogenesis and facilitating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), crucial steps in colorectal tumor progression.  Future research should focus on elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms governing this complex relationship and identifying potential therapeutic targets for disrupting IGF-1 signaling to mitigate colorectal cancer risk and improve patient outcomes.
