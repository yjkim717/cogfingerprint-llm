Title: IGF-1 Signaling in Colorectal Cancer: Implications for Glucose Metabolism and Therapeutic Strategies

Abstract:

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent malignancy characterized by dysregulated cellular metabolism, with the Warburg effect being a hallmark of cancer cell metabolism. The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway has been implicated in CRC progression, with emerging evidence suggesting a critical role in modulating glucose metabolism. This review aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF-1-mediated regulation of glucose metabolism in CRC, with a focus on its involvement in the Warburg effect. We examine the current understanding of IGF-1 signaling in CRC, highlighting its impact on key glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters. The Warburg effect, a metabolic phenomenon characterized by enhanced glycolysis and lactate production, is a critical adaptation that enables cancer cells to meet their bioenergetic demands. We discuss the evidence linking IGF-1 signaling to the Warburg effect in CRC, including its regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1Î±) and other key transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, we explore the therapeutic potential of targeting IGF-1 signaling in CRC, including the use of IGF-1 receptor inhibitors and metabolic modulators. By examining the complex interplay between IGF-1 signaling, glucose metabolism, and the Warburg effect, this review provides insights into the molecular mechanisms driving CRC progression and identifies potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of this malignancy.
