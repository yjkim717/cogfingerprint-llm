Of particular interest in 2021 is the strategic integration of bio-inspired carboxylate ligands to engineer advanced electrocatalytic interfaces for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a critical process in biotechnological energy conversion. This research demonstrates that carboxylate-functionalized metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and their in-situ derived layered double hydroxides (LDHs) exhibit superior electrocatalytic activity in enzymatic fuel cell and bio-electrosynthesis applications. The enhanced performance is mechanistically attributed to the ligand-induced interfacial electron redistribution, which optimizes the valence state of key nickel active sites, mimicking the redox-active centers found in metalloenzymes. Furthermore, the carboxylate moieties function as Lewis bases, facilitating rapid proton-coupled electron transfer kinetics, thereby lowering the kinetic overpotential and improving the overall energy efficiency of the bio-electrochemical system. These findings establish a robust structure-activity relationship, providing a foundational design principle for developing next-generation, biomimetic electrocatalysts with tailored electronic structures for sustainable bio-energy technologies.
