Title: Precision Genome Editing in Pleurotus ostreatus via CRISPR/Cas9: A Novel Approach for Non-GM Molecular Breeding

Abstract:

The CRISPR/Cas9 system has revolutionized genome editing in various organisms, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency. In this study (2021), we harnessed the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to edit the genome of Pleurotus ostreatus, a commercially significant edible mushroom. By optimizing the CRISPR/Cas9 components and leveraging homology-directed repair (HDR), we achieved efficient and targeted genome editing in P. ostreatus. Our results demonstrate the successful introduction of desired mutations at specific loci, without introducing exogenous DNA, thereby circumventing GM regulations. The CRISPR/Cas9-assisted genome editing approach developed here enables the generation of non-GM P. ostreatus strains with improved traits, such as enhanced nutritional content or increased disease resistance. This technology has significant implications for molecular breeding programs, allowing for the creation of novel, high-quality cultivars that meet consumer demands for non-GM products. Our findings pave the way for the application of precision genome editing in fungal biotechnology, with potential benefits for the agricultural and food industries.
