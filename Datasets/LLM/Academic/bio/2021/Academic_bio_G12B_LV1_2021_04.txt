**Impact of Assessment and Policy Frameworks on Attendance Rates in Psychiatry Clinical Rotations for Medical Students: A Central Indian Perspective**

**Abstract**

Maintaining adequate attendance in clinical rotations is crucial for optimal medical student learning and competency development, yet consistent challenges exist across various specialties. This study investigates the determinants of attendance rates among medical students undertaking psychiatry clinical postings in a tertiary care teaching hospital located in central India during the 2021 academic year. A retrospective analysis of attendance records for MBBS students rotating through the Psychiatry Department was conducted, alongside a qualitative survey exploring student perceptions regarding the clinical training experience. Findings revealed a significantly low average attendance rate (p < 0.05) compared to benchmarks established for other clinical departments within the institution.  Correlation analysis indicated a strong inverse relationship between the absence of formal summative assessments specifically focused on psychiatry clinical performance and student attendance (r = -0.68, p < 0.01). Furthermore, qualitative data highlighted a perceived lack of accountability due to the absence of clearly defined and consistently enforced attendance policies, contributing to a sense of diminished obligation to attend all scheduled sessions.  Students expressed a desire for more structured feedback and assessment, believing this would enhance engagement and motivation. These findings suggest that the absence of robust assessment strategies and the laxity of attendance enforcement mechanisms directly impact student engagement and participation in psychiatry clinical training. The study underscores the need for incorporating regular, clinically-focused evaluations and implementing stringent, transparent attendance policies to improve learning outcomes and ensure students receive the requisite psychiatric exposure during their medical education.  Further research is warranted to explore the efficacy of various intervention strategies, including blended learning approaches and peer-supported accountability models.

**Suggested Keywords:** Psychiatric Training, Medical Education, Attendance, Clinical Rotations, Assessment, Policy, MBBS Students, India, Medical Student Engagement, Curriculum Evaluation.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Language:** I used precise language (e.g., "inverse relationship," "summative assessments," "stringent," "requisite") to maintain an academic tone.
*   **Structured Argument:** The abstract follows a logical flow: Introduction/Background, Methods, Results, Discussion/Conclusion.
*   **Specifics:**  I included a hypothetical p-value and correlation coefficient (r) to lend credibility. You would replace these with actual data if you have it.
*   **Context:**  Mentioning the location (central India) and year (2021) anchors the study.
*   **Limitations/Future Directions:** I briefly alluded to the need for further research, a common element of strong abstracts.
*   **Bio/Medical Focus:** The language and concepts are consistent with expectations in biomedical/medical research.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for a word count around 268, as requested.  It's always a good idea to check the specific word limit for the target journal.
