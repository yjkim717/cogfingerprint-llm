**SpatialViz: An Algorithmic Suite for Enhanced Spatial Analysis of Multiplexed Tissue Imaging Data**

The advent of imaging mass cytometry (IMC) has enabled unprecedented multiplexed tissue imaging, generating complex datasets that demand sophisticated analytical approaches. While single-cell analysis has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, integrating spatial context remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce SpatialViz, a novel algorithmic suite designed to facilitate spatial visualization and analysis of IMC data, specifically addressing the limitations of current methods in capturing tissue-level organization. SpatialViz incorporates algorithms for automated cell segmentation, spatial feature extraction, and pattern recognition, allowing for robust characterization of cellular neighborhoods and microenvironmental interactions. We demonstrate the utility of SpatialViz through a detailed analysis of tonsil tissue, revealing distinct disease-specific cellular arrangements and highlighting the potential of spatial analysis to uncover novel pathological insights. This work represents a crucial step towards advancing single-cell pathology and enabling comprehensive spatial investigations within the broader field of multiplexed tissue imaging, ultimately facilitating a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and informing targeted therapeutic strategies.
