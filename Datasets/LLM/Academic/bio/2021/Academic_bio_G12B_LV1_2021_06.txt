**Abstract: Rationally Designed Carboxylate-Functionalized Layered Double Hydroxide Mimics for Biomimetic Oxygen Evolution Catalysis**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a critical bottleneck in numerous bioelectrochemical processes and renewable energy technologies. Natureâ€™s efficient OER catalysts, such as photosystem II, rely on precisely coordinated metal centers and intricate ligand environments. Inspired by these biological systems, we report the design and characterization of a novel artificial metalloenzyme mimic based on a carboxylate-functionalized layered double hydroxide (LDH) scaffold incorporating cobalt(II) ions.  Computational density functional theory (DFT) calculations, coupled with electrochemical analyses, demonstrate that the strategically positioned carboxylate ligands significantly enhance OER activity.  Our findings reveal that these ligands induce a favorable electron redistribution within the cobalt center, resulting in a downward shift of the d-band center, thereby lowering the activation energy for OER. Furthermore, the carboxylate groups facilitate accelerated proton transfer processes during the catalytic cycle, mitigating kinetic limitations often observed in analogous systems. The structural rigidity and tunable nature of the LDH framework provides excellent stability, while the carboxylate functionalities provide the necessary electronic and proton-shuttling properties. This biomimetic approach offers a promising avenue for developing robust and efficient OER catalysts, potentially impacting areas ranging from artificial photosynthesis to bio-inspired fuel cells, and provides valuable insights into the design principles of natural OER enzymes.
