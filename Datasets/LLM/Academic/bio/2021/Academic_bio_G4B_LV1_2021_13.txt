**Spatial Transcriptomic Profiling of Chronic Tonsillitis Reveals Tissue-Resolved Cellular Heterogeneity**

Chronic tonsillitis represents a complex inflammatory condition with significant inter-individual variability. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we employed imaging mass cytometry (IMC) coupled with SpatialViz analysis to generate multiplexed protein profiles within tonsillar tissue. Utilizing this approach, we investigated spatially resolved protein expression patterns in both healthy and inflamed tonsil samples collected in 2020. Our findings demonstrate distinct correlations between identified cell populations and their respective marker expression signatures. Notably, we observed a significant enrichment of activated macrophages and neutrophils within the affected tissue, exhibiting heightened expression of inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, spatial visualization facilitated the identification of microenvironments characterized by aberrant cellular organization, suggesting a disrupted tissue architecture. These results underscore the potential of IMC and spatial analysis techniques to provide unprecedented insights into single-cell pathology and advance our understanding of disease progression in chronic tonsillitis.
