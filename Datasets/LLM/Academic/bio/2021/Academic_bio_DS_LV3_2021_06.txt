**Abstract**

The strategic design of bio-inspired catalysts for sustainable energy conversion represents a frontier in green chemistry. In this study, we investigate the role of engineered carboxylate ligands within synthetic metalloenzyme frameworks, which mimic the active sites of oxygen-evolving complexes in biological systems, for enhancing the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). We demonstrate that these carboxylate moieties function as critical modulators of electrocatalytic activity by inducing a precise electron redistribution at the metal catalytic center. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses confirm that this ligand-induced effect optimizes the d-band center of the transition metal ion, thereby favorably lowering the kinetic overpotential for water oxidation. Furthermore, we propose a mechanistic pathway wherein the carboxylate groups act as intrinsic Lewis bases, facilitating proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) steps analogous to those observed in Photosystem II. This dual functionality—electronic structure modulation and proton transfer mediation—synergistically enhances both the activity and stability of the bio-hybrid catalyst. Our findings, reported in 2021, establish a fundamental structure-activity relationship and provide a novel blueprint for engineering next-generation electrocatalysts that bridge synthetic efficiency with biological precision.
