**Abstract**

Longitudinal proteomic analysis of plasma samples represents a promising avenue for elucidating therapeutic responses in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study leveraged deep proteomics profiling conducted across two Phase II clinical trials evaluating the novel compound GRF6019. Results demonstrated significant, time-dependent alterations in circulating protein signatures in patients receiving GRF6019 compared to controls. Specifically, we identified targeted dysregulation within pathways associated with neuroinflammation and amyloid processing. These findings suggest that GRF6019 induces a quantifiable proteomic response, potentially reflecting downstream neuroprotective effects.  Further investigation into these identified biomarkers could facilitate patient stratification and enhance the predictive power of clinical trials, ultimately informing personalized treatment strategies for AD.  The observed changes underscore the value of integrating multi-omic data with clinical trial outcomes.
