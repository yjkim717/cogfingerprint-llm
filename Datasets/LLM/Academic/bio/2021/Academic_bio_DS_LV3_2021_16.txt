Of particular significance in the field of fungal biotechnology is the development of precise genome editing tools for basidiomycetes. This study establishes a robust CRISPR/Cas9 system for the edible mushroom *Pleurotus ostreatus*, addressing a critical methodological gap. We demonstrate highly efficient, ribonucleoprotein (RNP)-complex-mediated delivery for targeted mutagenesis, achieving precise gene knockouts via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Furthermore, we successfully implemented homology-directed repair (HDR) by co-delivering donor DNA templates, enabling precise allele replacement and gene insertions. A pivotal finding is the validation of a marker-free editing strategy, wherein the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery can be transiently expressed and subsequently removed. This methodology is foundational for generating strains devoid of foreign DNA, thereby circumventing regulatory classifications as genetically modified (GM) organisms. The application of this system facilitates the targeted genetic improvement of *P. ostreatus* for enhanced lignocellulosic substrate utilization and stress tolerance. Consequently, this research provides a transformative platform for the development of non-GM, commercially viable fungal strains, accelerating the sustainable bioproduction of enzymes and biomaterials within a circular bioeconomy framework.
