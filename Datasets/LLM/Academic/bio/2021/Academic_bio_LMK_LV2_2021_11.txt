Title: Unveiling Biological Pathways Modulated by GRF6019 Infusions in Alzheimer's Disease: A Deep Proteomics Profiling Analysis

Abstract:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by multifactorial pathology. Recent clinical trials have investigated the therapeutic potential of GRF6019 infusions in AD patients. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying GRF6019's effects, we conducted a deep proteomics profiling analysis of plasma proteins in response to GRF6019 treatment. Using high-throughput mass spectrometry, we quantified changes in the plasma proteome of AD patients receiving GRF6019 infusions. Our results reveal significant alterations in biological pathways implicated in AD pathogenesis, including inflammation, immune response, and cellular stress. Notably, GRF6019 treatment modulated key proteins involved in these pathways, suggesting a potential therapeutic mechanism. Our findings provide novel insights into the molecular effects of GRF6019 and shed light on its potential as a treatment for AD. This study demonstrates the power of proteomics profiling in understanding disease biology and identifying therapeutic targets. (2021)
