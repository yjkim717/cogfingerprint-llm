**Abstract**

The Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling axis is a critical regulator of cellular proliferation and survival, with its dysregulation being a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). A key metabolic consequence of aberrant IGF-1 signaling is the reprogramming of glucose metabolism towards aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect, which provides biosynthetic precursors to support rapid tumor growth. This review synthesizes recent evidence elucidating the mechanistic link between the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and this metabolic shift. We detail how IGF-1R activation robustly stimulates the PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling cascade, a central pathway driving glycolytic flux. This occurs through Akt-mediated enhancement of glucose transporter (GLUT1) membrane localization, increased hexokinase II expression, and the transcriptional upregulation of key glycolytic enzymes. Furthermore, we explore the crosstalk between oncogenic drivers common in CRC, such as mutant KRAS, and the IGF-1/PI3K axis in potentiating the Warburg phenotype. Given the limitations of conventional therapies, we critically evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting this metabolic vulnerability. These include monoclonal antibodies against IGF-1R, small-molecule inhibitors of downstream kinases, and novel compounds that disrupt glycolytic metabolism directly. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of the IGF-1-driven metabolic network in CRC is paramount for developing effective, metabolism-targeted anti-cancer regimens.
