**Abstract**

The year 2021 witnessed a significant and geographically widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically the H5N8 and H5N1 subtypes, impacting both domestic poultry populations and a notable number of wild bird species across continental Europe. This emergent epidemiological event necessitated immediate and coordinated biosecurity interventions and the implementation of targeted preventative strategies by national veterinary authorities. Utilizing a combination of real-time surveillance data and genomic analyses, this study investigates the rapid dissemination and evolutionary dynamics of the HPAI virus during this period. 

Initial investigations revealed a complex interplay between poultry farming practices and the introduction of the virus via migratory wild bird populations, primarily waterfowl and scavenging raptors. Phylogenetic analysis of viral isolates – encompassing both poultry and wild bird samples – indicated a clear lineage tracing back to migratory routes, suggesting long-distance spread facilitated by avian vectors. Notably, a degree of genetic heterogeneity was observed within circulating strains, indicative of adaptive mutations potentially influencing transmissibility and host range. 

Furthermore, examination of viral genome sequencing highlighted specific genetic markers associated with increased virulence and pathogenic potential, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and adaptation of vaccination protocols. The findings underscore the critical importance of integrated surveillance programs encompassing both farmed and wild bird populations to mitigate the risk of future HPAI outbreaks and to understand the ecological factors driving viral spread.
