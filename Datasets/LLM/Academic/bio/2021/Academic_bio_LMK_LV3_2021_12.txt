Title: Quantifying Transcriptional Noise: A Theoretical Framework for Interpreting Single-Molecule Data

Abstract:
Transcriptional noise, a ubiquitous feature of gene expression, has been implicated in various cellular processes. However, the underlying mechanisms driving this variability remain poorly understood. By developing tractable models of transcriptional noise, we provide a theoretical framework for interpreting single-molecule quantification data. Our stochastic modeling approach enables the estimation of transcription rate variation, distinguishing between competing hypotheses regarding the sources of this variability. Theory-guided data collection informs the design of experiments, optimizing the detection of biophysical phenomena that underlie transcriptional noise. Applying this framework to single-molecule data, we demonstrate its utility in elucidating the complex interplay between transcriptional regulation and noise. Published in 2021, this study advances our understanding of transcriptional noise, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms governing gene expression and its variability. Our results have significant implications for the study of cellular heterogeneity and its role in development and disease.
