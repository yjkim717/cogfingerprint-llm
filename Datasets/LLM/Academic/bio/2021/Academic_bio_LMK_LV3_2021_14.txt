"Characterizing Endosomal Dynamics through Anomalous Diffusion Modeling"

Abstract:
Employing single-particle tracking, we investigate the heterogeneous motion of endosomes within eukaryotic cells. Our analysis reveals distinct subdiffusive and superdiffusive behaviors, accurately captured by a heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion model. The results demonstrate that endosome trajectories exhibit non-Gaussian distributions and anomalous diffusion patterns. By quantifying the heterogeneity in endosomal transport, this study provides new insights into the complex intracellular dynamics governing cellular processes. Our findings have implications for understanding cellular regulation and dysfunction, as reported in recent studies (2021).
