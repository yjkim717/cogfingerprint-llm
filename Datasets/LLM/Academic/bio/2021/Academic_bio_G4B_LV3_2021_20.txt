**Abstract**

Understanding forest microclimate is increasingly critical for predicting species distribution and ecosystem responses to climate change. This study investigates the spatial variability of subcanopy temperatures within European forests, leveraging machine learning techniques to refine microclimatic assessments. Utilizing a dataset incorporating both macroclimatic and high-resolution sensor measurements, we developed predictive models capable of quantifying ‘temperature offset’ – the discrepancy between ambient and subcanopy conditions.  The resultant high-resolution maps demonstrate substantial seasonal and geographically-defined temperature gradients, highlighting the influence of forest structure on localized thermal regimes.  Specifically, dense canopy cover resulted in consistently lower subcanopy temperatures compared to surrounding areas. These findings underscore the importance of considering microclimatic heterogeneity when modeling forest dynamics and inform conservation strategies aimed at mitigating climate change impacts. Further research will explore the interactive effects of these temperature variations on plant physiological processes.
