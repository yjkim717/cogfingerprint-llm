**Abstract**

European forests exhibit considerable spatial heterogeneity in microclimatic conditions, yet quantifying these variations remains a significant challenge. This study investigated the potential of machine learning techniques to predict subcanopy temperature offsets relative to freely available air temperatures, offering a scalable approach to characterizing forest microclimates. Utilizing data collected across a selection of European forest sites, we employed a suite of algorithms – specifically, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting – to model the relationship between macroclimate and localized subcanopy thermal regimes.  Our analysis demonstrated a strong predictive capacity of these models, accurately forecasting temperature differences of up to [Insert specific temperature range if known from the original text, e.g., 2-4°C] based on meteorological variables such as ambient temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed. 

These findings highlight the importance of considering subcanopy microclimates in forest ecology and management. The identified microclimatic variations, driven by factors including canopy structure and understory vegetation, suggest a more nuanced understanding of physiological processes within European forests than previously afforded by solely relying on macroclimate data. Future research should focus on validating these models across diverse forest types and examining the functional implications of these temperature offsets on species distribution and ecosystem dynamics.
