Title: Proteomic Subtypes Associated with Alzheimer's Disease Risk in Cognitively Intact Individuals: Insights from CSF Proteomics Analysis

Abstract:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by complex pathophysiological processes that precede clinical manifestation by several years. Recent advances in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics have enabled the identification of novel biomarkers and potential pathological mechanisms underlying AD. Here, we investigated whether AD-associated proteomic subtypes can be detected in cognitively intact individuals lacking AD pathology, defined as amyloid-negative status. Using a cohort of cognitively intact individuals with CSF proteomics data, we identified distinct proteomic subtypes that have been previously associated with AD. Notably, these subtypes were present in individuals without evidence of amyloid aggregation, suggesting that they may represent early molecular alterations that predispose to AD. Our findings indicate that AD-associated proteomic subtypes can be identified in cognitively intact individuals, independent of amyloid status. The presence of these subtypes in amyloid-negative individuals implies that they may be involved in the earliest stages of AD pathogenesis, potentially preceding amyloid aggregation. These results have significant implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying AD and highlight the potential for early intervention strategies targeting these pathways. By elucidating the proteomic landscape of preclinical AD, our study contributes to the ongoing efforts to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop more effective diagnostic tools for AD. Overall, this study provides new insights into the complex biology of AD and underscores the importance of continued research into the early stages of this devastating disease.
