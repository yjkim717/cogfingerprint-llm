**Abstract**

Emerging evidence increasingly suggests that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis may initiate prior to the definitive presence of amyloid pathology. This study employed a comprehensive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic analysis to investigate the heterogeneity of early AD risk factors in a cohort of individuals classified as cognitively intact and amyloid-negative. Utilizing targeted mass spectrometry, we identified three distinct CSF proteomic subtypes, exhibiting significantly divergent biomarker profiles. Notably, subtype 1 demonstrated elevated levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), indicative of neuroinflammation, while subtype 2 exhibited a reduction in synaptic markers such as synaptotagmin-1. Subtype 3 presented a more moderate profile. These findings strongly suggest that CSF proteomics can delineate pre-clinical AD risk, potentially revealing individuals at heightened vulnerability.  Further longitudinal investigation is warranted to determine the predictive value of these subtypes for future cognitive decline and to explore their mechanistic links to the early stages of amyloid deposition.
