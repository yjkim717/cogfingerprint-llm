**Engagement with Psychiatric Training Among Undergraduate Medical Students in Central India: A Preliminary Investigation**

This study investigates the prevalence of engagement with psychiatric training within the undergraduate medical curriculum at institutions in central India during 2021. Recognizing the escalating mental health crisis and the critical need for adequately trained physicians, we aimed to quantify the extent to which MBBS students were actively participating in dedicated psychiatric education. Data were collected through retrospective analysis of student attendance records across multiple medical colleges within the region. Our findings reveal a substantial proportion of students exhibited limited engagement with formally structured psychiatric training components. 

Specifically, [Insert specific percentage – e.g., ‘approximately 38%’] of surveyed students reported infrequent or absent attendance at scheduled psychiatric lectures, workshops, and clinical rotations.  Contributing factors identified through preliminary analysis include inadequate faculty resources, insufficient time allocation within the existing curriculum, and a perceived lack of relevance to core medical competencies. These barriers highlight a critical gap in preparedness amongst future physicians to address the complex mental health needs of patients within the region.  Further research is warranted to explore the multifaceted determinants of engagement and to develop targeted interventions to enhance the integration of psychiatric education into the MBBS course, ultimately fostering a more robust and responsive healthcare system.
