**Abstract**

Understanding thermal heterogeneity within forest ecosystems is increasingly critical for predicting species responses to climate change. This study investigated the influence of microclimatic conditions within European forests, specifically examining the distinction between subcanopy and macroclimate temperatures, utilizing machine learning techniques. Leveraging a spatially extensive dataset of forest temperature measurements, we employed a Random Forest model to identify key predictors of temperature variation. Results demonstrated statistically significant differences in forest temperature profiles between the subcanopy layer and the broader, macroclimate environment.  

The analysis revealed that subcanopy temperatures exhibited substantially lower values, correlated with increased humidity and reduced solar radiation penetration.  Furthermore, we quantified the spatial resolution of these microclimatic gradients, demonstrating considerable variability across European landscapes.  These findings highlight the importance of considering localized thermal regimes when assessing forest biodiversity and vulnerability.  Future research should focus on integrating these microclimate data with mechanistic ecological models to refine predictions of species distribution and phenology.
