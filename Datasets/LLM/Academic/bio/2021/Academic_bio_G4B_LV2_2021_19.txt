**Abstract**

The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a critical bottleneck in sustainable energy technologies, necessitating innovative electrocatalytic materials. This research investigates the influence of carboxylate ligand modification on the OER activity of bi/trimetallic layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and electrochemical characterization in 2021, we demonstrate that strategically incorporated carboxylate ligands significantly enhance OER performance. Specifically, these ligands promote a redistribution of electron density within the layered structure, fostering a lower overpotential for OER. 

Furthermore, computational modeling reveals that carboxylate coordination facilitates enhanced proton transfer kinetics, crucial for accelerating the reaction pathway.  The observed synergistic effect, combining electronic modification and improved ionic conductivity, is particularly pronounced in bi/trimetallic systems. These findings suggest a viable strategy for tailoring the catalytic properties of LDHs and MOFs via ligand design.  Future work will focus on correlating these mechanistic insights with experimental validation of these modified materials in relevant OER systems.
