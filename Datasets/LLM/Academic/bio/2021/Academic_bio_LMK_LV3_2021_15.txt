Title: IGF-1 Signaling Modulates Glucose Metabolism in Colorectal Cancer via the Warburg Effect

Abstract:
The Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating glucose metabolism in colorectal cancer (CRC) development. As of 2021, research indicates that IGF-1 signaling influences the Warburg effect, a metabolic phenomenon characterized by enhanced glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen. This metabolic shift is crucial for CRC progression, as it provides cancer cells with the necessary energy and biosynthetic precursors for rapid proliferation. The IGF-1 signaling cascade modulates key downstream targets, including PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, thereby promoting glucose uptake and glycolytic flux in CRC cells. Understanding the intricate relationships between IGF-1 signaling, glucose metabolism, and the Warburg effect may provide novel therapeutic targets for CRC treatment. This review aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF-1 signaling in CRC, with a focus on its impact on glucose metabolism and potential implications for targeted therapies.
