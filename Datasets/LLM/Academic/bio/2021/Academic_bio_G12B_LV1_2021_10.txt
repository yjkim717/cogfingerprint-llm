**A Proteome-Wide Selectivity Assessment of Alkyne Probes for Targeted Amino Acid Modification**

The development of covalent inhibitors and bioorthogonal chemical probes has revolutionized target identification and proteomics research. While significant progress has been made in designing molecules that react with specific protein targets, a comprehensive understanding of the proteome-wide selectivity of these reagents remains a critical challenge. Here, we report a novel, unbiased workflow for systematically evaluating the selectivity profiles of 54 alkyne-containing probes, each designed to react with one of nine amino acids (Cys, His, Lys, Trp, Tyr, Arg, Gln, Asn, and Met). Utilizing click chemistry with immobilized affinity resins, we quantified the extent of probe modification across the human proteome. This approach allows for the direct comparison of reactivity between probes targeting seemingly similar residues, revealing nuanced differences in their selectivity and off-target interactions. Our analysis identified unexpected cross-reactivities and highlighted factors influencing probe selectivity beyond predicted reactivity based on amino acid side-chain structure. The resulting dataset provides a valuable resource for the rational design of more selective covalent inhibitors and bioorthogonal probes, advancing both targeted protein modification strategies and the broader field of proteomics in 2021. We anticipate this methodology will aid in improving the specificity and utility of these powerful chemical tools for biological investigation.
