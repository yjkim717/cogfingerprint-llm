**Abstract**

Intracellular endosome trafficking is a fundamental process implicated in diverse cellular functions, yet its dynamics remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the heterogeneous movement of endosomes within living mammalian cells, employing advanced fluorescence microscopy and trajectory analysis. We observed a distinct segregation of endosome populations into subpopulations exhibiting significantly differential velocities.  Quantitative analysis revealed a clear dichotomy: a cohort of slow-moving endosomes and a faster-moving group. To formally characterize this heterogeneity, we applied a fractional Brownian motion (fBm) model to describe the stochastic dynamics of each subpopulation.  Results demonstrate that fBm provides a superior mathematical framework compared to traditional Brownian motion for capturing the observed velocity variability.  These findings highlight the importance of local analysis in elucidating the complex, non-random behavior of endosomal transport and suggest that fBm may offer a valuable tool for future investigations into organelle motility and its regulation.
