**Abstract**

The pursuit of effective therapeutics for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) necessitates a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying treatment response. This study leverages deep plasma proteomics profiling to investigate the systemic effects of GRF6019, a novel therapeutic agent, in two independent AD clinical trials. Utilizing data-dependent acquisition mass spectrometry, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis on plasma samples collected from participants receiving GRF6019 to identify treatment-associated protein expression changes and resultant alterations in biological pathways. Our findings reveal a distinct proteomic signature modulated by GRF6019 treatment, characterized by significant shifts in proteins involved in neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Pathway enrichment analysis highlights the modulation of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade and the MAPK pathways, suggesting potential mechanisms through which GRF6019 may exert its therapeutic effects. These data provide valuable insights into the biological impact of GRF6019 in AD, potentially informing future clinical trial design and biomarker development. Furthermore, this study demonstrates the utility of proteomics profiling as a tool for elucidating drug mechanisms and identifying predictive biomarkers in AD clinical research.
