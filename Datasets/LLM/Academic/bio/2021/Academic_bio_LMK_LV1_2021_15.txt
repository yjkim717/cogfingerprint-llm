Title: IGF-1 Signaling and Glucose Metabolism in Colorectal Cancer: Unraveling the Warburg Effect

Abstract:

The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway has been increasingly implicated in the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). A hallmark of cancer cells, including those of CRC, is their altered glucose metabolism, characterized by enhanced glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Recent studies have elucidated the intricate relationship between IGF-1 signaling and glucose metabolism, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying CRC tumorigenesis. IGF-1 signaling activates key downstream effectors, including PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, which in turn modulate glucose metabolism by regulating the expression and activity of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes. The resulting increase in glycolytic flux fuels the high energy demands of rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Moreover, the IGF-1 signaling pathway has been shown to promote the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a transcription factor that orchestrates the adaptive metabolic response to hypoxia, further enhancing the Warburg effect. The interplay between IGF-1 signaling and glucose metabolism has significant implications for CRC development and progression. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of CRC. This review aims to summarize the current understanding of the role of IGF-1 signaling in modulating glucose metabolism and its contribution to the Warburg effect in CRC, highlighting potential avenues for future research and therapeutic intervention.
