**Attendance and Engagement in Psychiatric Training Among Medical Students: A Cross-Sectional Study in Central India**

**Background:** Adequate exposure to psychiatric principles and clinical practice is crucial for developing competent general practitioners; however, engagement in psychiatric training rotations amongst medical students remains a persistent challenge globally. This cross-sectional study investigated attendance patterns and potential contributing factors affecting medical student engagement during psychiatry postings within a medical college in central India.

**Methods:** Data were collected from medical students (MBBS) undertaking mandatory psychiatry rotations during the academic year 2020-2021. Attendance records were reviewed, and a brief, anonymous survey explored student perceptions regarding the relevance of psychiatric training and potential barriers to engagement. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize attendance rates. Qualitative analysis of open-ended survey responses was conducted to identify recurring themes.

**Results:** A significantly low average attendance rate of [Insert specific attendance rate, e.g., 65%] was observed amongst medical students during the psychiatry rotation.  Analysis revealed a strong correlation between the absence of dedicated psychiatric examinations directly contributing to course grade and decreased attendance. Furthermore, the lack of specific attendance policies for psychiatry postings, when compared to other clinical rotations, was identified as a significant barrier. Students expressed a perception that psychiatry was less valued relative to other specialties, contributing to reduced motivation.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights a concerning trend of suboptimal attendance in psychiatric training among medical students in central India. The absence of formal assessment and clearly defined attendance policies appear to be key drivers of this disengagement. Addressing these systemic issues through the implementation of psychiatry-specific examinations and the establishment of consistent attendance monitoring protocols is recommended to enhance student engagement and ultimately improve the quality of psychiatric education. Future research should explore the impact of incorporating active learning strategies and early exposure to mental health concepts on student attendance and attitudes towards psychiatry.
