Title: Evaluating the Impact of Curriculum Integration on Psychiatric Training Attendance Among Undergraduate Medical Students

Abstract:

The integration of psychiatry into the broader curriculum of the MBBS course has been a subject of debate among medical educators. A cross-sectional study conducted in 2021 among 100 undergraduate medical students in central India aimed to investigate the factors influencing attendance in psychiatric training. The study revealed a concerning trend of low attendance in psychiatric training sessions, with a significant proportion of students attributing this to the lack of a separate examination for psychiatry and the flexibility to adjust attendance in this subject with other major subjects.

The findings suggest that the current curriculum structure, which does not emphasize psychiatry as a standalone subject in the assessment framework, may inadvertently contribute to its relative neglect among undergraduate medical students. This observation underscores the need for a more integrated approach to curriculum design, where the importance of psychiatric training is duly reflected in the evaluation metrics.

The study's results have implications for medical education policy, highlighting the potential benefits of revising the assessment framework to include a separate examination for psychiatry. By doing so, medical educators can emphasize the significance of psychiatric training in the overall MBBS curriculum, potentially leading to improved attendance and a more comprehensive understanding of psychiatric principles among future medical professionals. The study's insights contribute to the ongoing discourse on optimizing medical education, with a focus on enhancing the preparedness of undergraduate medical students for the complexities of clinical practice.
