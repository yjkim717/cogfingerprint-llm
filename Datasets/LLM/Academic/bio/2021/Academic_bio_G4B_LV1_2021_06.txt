**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a critical bottleneck in sustainable energy technologies, necessitating the development of efficient electrocatalytic materials. Recent investigations have highlighted the potential of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as promising OER candidates. This study proposes a mechanistic framework integrating density functional theory (DFT) calculations with experimental observations to elucidate the role of carboxylate ligands in modulating OER activity within bi- and trimetallic LDHs/MOFs. Computational modelling demonstrated that strategically incorporated carboxylate ligands promote enhanced electron redistribution and accelerated proton transfer pathways at the active OER sites.  Specifically, the ligand field effects induced by carboxylate coordination significantly alter the electronic structure of the metal centers, lowering the activation energy for oxygen release.  These findings suggest that rational design of carboxylate-functionalized LDHs/MOFs represents a viable strategy for optimizing OER performance, offering a pathway towards improved electrochemical efficiency and durability.
