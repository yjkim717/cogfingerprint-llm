**Abstract**

The intricate spatial organization of cells within tissues is a critical determinant of physiological function and pathological progression. While single-cell technologies have advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity, a comprehensive analysis of protein expression within its native tissue architecture at single-cell resolution has remained a significant challenge. Here, we apply Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) to achieve highly multiplexed tissue imaging, enabling the simultaneous quantification of over 40 protein markers in human tonsil specimens with single-cell granularity. To systematically deconvolute this complex spatial data, we developed SpatialViz, a novel computational framework comprising a suite of algorithms designed to quantify and visualize cellular neighborhoods and intercellular interactions. Applying this pipeline to a cohort of healthy and chronically inflamed tonsils, we identified distinct topological ecosystems. Our analysis reveals a profound disruption in the spatial relationships between immune cell populations in chronic tonsillitis, characterized by the breakdown of organized lymphoid structures and the emergence of atypical cellular adjacencies. These findings provide unprecedented insight into the spatial immunopathology of this common disease, demonstrating that disease state is defined not only by cellular composition but also by fundamental alterations in tissue microarchitecture. The SpatialViz platform thus represents a powerful tool for the discovery of spatially resolved biomarkers and the mechanistic investigation of tissue biology in health and disease.
