In this 2021 study, we investigate the complex intracellular transport dynamics of endosomes through advanced trajectory analysis. While conventional diffusion models inadequately capture the heterogeneous nature of endosomal motion, our research demonstrates that heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion (hFBM) provides a robust mathematical framework for characterizing both slow subdiffusive and fast superdiffusive movements observed in live-cell imaging. Through sophisticated local analysis of individual trajectories, we quantify distinct distributions of local anomalous exponents (α) and generalized diffusion coefficients (D) that define these dual transport regimes. Our findings reveal that subdiffusive phases (α < 0.5) correlate with confined movements in cortical regions, while superdiffusive trajectories (α > 0.5) associate with directed transport along microtubule networks. This bimodal behavior, accurately modeled by hFBM parameters, reflects the underlying biological mechanisms governing intracellular cargo transport. The methodology establishes a powerful analytical paradigm for deciphering complex vesicular dynamics in cellular physiology, with implications for understanding membrane trafficking disorders and developing targeted therapeutic interventions.
