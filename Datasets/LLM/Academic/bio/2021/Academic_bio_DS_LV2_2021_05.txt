**Abstract**

The latter half of 2021 marked a significant and concerning epidemiological chapter in the persistent circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically the H5N1 subtype, across the European continent. This abstract synthesizes findings from enhanced surveillance programs conducted between September and December 2021, which documented an unprecedented surge in outbreaks within both wild avifauna and domestic poultry populations. Our analysis confirms that the primary epizootic driver was the sustained and widespread viral transmission within wild bird reservoirs, particularly among migratory waterfowl and raptorial species, which served as efficient vectors for rapid transboundary spread. The intensity of viral circulation in wild populations led to frequent spillover events into commercial and backyard poultry holdings, underscoring critical deficiencies in on-farm biosecurity protocols. These breaches, often involving inadequate containment of feed and water sources from wild birds and insufficient disinfection procedures, were identified as pivotal factors enabling the initial incursion and subsequent amplification of the virus within na√Øve flocks.

A paramount finding from this surveillance period was the genetic evidence of ongoing and rapid virus evolution. Genomic sequencing revealed significant virus reassortment events, indicating co-circulation of multiple HPAI H5N1 clades and their interaction with low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses. This genetic shuffling has yielded novel viral genotypes with enhanced environmental stability and, critically, mutations associated with increased mammalian adaption. Documented infections in wild carnivores, such as red foxes (*Vulpes vulpes*) and Eurasian otters (*Lutra lutra*), provide tangible evidence of a broadening host tropism beyond avian species. These observations necessitate a paradigm shift in risk assessment, highlighting the potential for HPAI H5N1 to overcome species barriers more efficiently. We conclude that the 2021 epizootic underscores the indispensability of a dual-pronged approach: robust, real-time wild bird surveillance to monitor viral evolution and movement, coupled with the stringent implementation and auditing of compartmentalized biosecurity measures in the poultry sector to mitigate future spillover risks and potential zoonotic emergence.
