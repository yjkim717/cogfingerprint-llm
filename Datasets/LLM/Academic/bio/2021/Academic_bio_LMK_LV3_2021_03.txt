Title: Advancing Non-GM Molecular Breeding in Pleurotus ostreatus through CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing

Abstract:
The application of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing has revolutionized the field of molecular breeding, enabling precise modifications to the genomes of various organisms. In 2021, a significant breakthrough was achieved in the edible fungus Pleurotus ostreatus, where CRISPR/Cas9 was employed to efficiently edit the genome, facilitating the development of non-GM cultivated strains with enhanced desirable traits. This study demonstrates the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9 in P. ostreatus, providing a robust tool for molecular breeding that circumvents the regulatory complexities associated with genetically modified (GM) organisms. By leveraging this technology, breeders can introduce valuable characteristics, such as improved yield, disease resistance, or nutritional content, into P. ostreatus without GM classification. The successful implementation of CRISPR/Cas9 in P. ostreatus paves the way for its broader application in fungal molecular breeding, offering a promising avenue for the development of novel, non-GM cultivars with significant commercial potential.
