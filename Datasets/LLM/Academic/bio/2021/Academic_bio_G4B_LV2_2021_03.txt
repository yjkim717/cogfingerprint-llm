**Abstract**

Recent advances in genome editing technologies have expanded the potential for crop and fungal improvement strategies. This study reports on the successful implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene mutagenesis within *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom), achieving targeted genomic modifications without reliance on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Utilizing a non-GMO approach, we optimized CRISPR/Cas9 delivery and screening protocols to induce precise mutations within selectable loci.  Specifically, we demonstrate the feasibility of generating stable, heritable mutant strains exhibiting altered phenotypes.  The potential for manipulating key metabolic pathways within *P. ostreatus* through this methodology is significant, offering avenues for enhancing traits such as growth rate, substrate utilization, and secondary metabolite production.  This research establishes a robust framework for directed evolution of fungal strains, providing a valuable tool for sustainable biotechnological applications. Further investigation will focus on characterizing the phenotypic consequences of these targeted mutations and exploring their broader implications for fungal cultivation and industrial utilization.
