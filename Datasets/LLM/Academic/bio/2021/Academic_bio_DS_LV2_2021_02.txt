**Abstract**

The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling axis is a critical regulator of cellular proliferation and survival, with its dysregulation being implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). A hallmark of this malignancy is metabolic reprogramming, most notably the Warburg effect, wherein cancer cells preferentially utilize glycolysis for energy production even under normoxic conditions. This review synthesizes current evidence elucidating the mechanistic role of IGF-1 in orchestrating this metabolic shift in CRC. We detail how IGF-1, through activation of the canonical PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, promotes glycolytic flux by enhancing glucose transporter expression and modulating key enzymes such as hexokinase 2. This signaling cascade fosters anabolic growth and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, thereby sustaining the biosynthetic demands of rapidly dividing tumor cells. Furthermore, we explore the crosstalk between IGF-1-driven signaling and other oncogenic pathways that converge on metabolic control. Given the central role of this axis, we critically evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting IGF-1 signaling and its downstream effectors to disrupt this metabolic vulnerability. The integration of these agents with conventional chemotherapy and other targeted therapies presents a promising avenue for overcoming treatment resistance and improving clinical outcomes for patients with advanced colorectal cancer.
