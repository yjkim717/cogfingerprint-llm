## Abstract: Quantifying Microclimatic Variation in European Forests Using Machine Learning

Understanding the influence of forest microclimate on biodiversity is crucial for predicting ecosystem responses to global change. While macroclimatic conditions are well-documented, the nuanced thermal environment within forest understories remains comparatively less understood, particularly across broad spatial scales. This study investigates the relationship between macroclimate and sub-canopy temperature—a key indicator of forest microclimate—across a diverse range of European forest types. We employed a novel machine learning approach, utilizing a comprehensive dataset combining spatially explicit macroclimatic variables (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation) with observations of understory temperatures collected from various monitoring sites throughout Europe. Specifically, we developed and evaluated several regression models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, to predict temperature differences between free-air and sub-canopy environments. Results demonstrate a significant and spatially variable microclimatic effect, highlighting the substantial modification of regional climate by forest structure and composition. Model performance indicates that topographic variables and forest characteristics (e.g., canopy cover, stand age) significantly improve predictive accuracy beyond macroclimatic factors alone. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning techniques to efficiently model complex microclimatic processes across large geographic areas and provide valuable insights for understanding the spatial distribution of biodiversity and its vulnerability to climate change. Further research should focus on integrating physiological responses of key species to refine projections of ecosystem-level change.
