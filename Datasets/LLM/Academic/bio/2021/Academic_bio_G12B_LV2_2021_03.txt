**CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing in *Pleurotus ostreatus*: A Pathway to Non-GMO Cultivar Improvement**

The accelerating demand for sustainable and efficient food production necessitates advancements in crop improvement strategies. While genetic modification (GM) approaches have proven valuable, consumer apprehension regarding GM products has spurred interest in non-GM alternatives. Fungi, particularly the commercially important oyster mushroom, *Pleurotus ostreatus*, represent an underutilized platform for such improvement. Here, we report the successful application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for targeted genome editing in *P. ostreatus* using fungal protoplasts. We demonstrate that delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes alongside guide RNAs (gRNAs) efficiently induces double-strand breaks at pre-selected genomic loci. Subsequent homology-directed repair (HDR) resulted in precise modifications, validated through targeted sequencing analysis. Crucially, our approach avoids the integration of foreign DNA, circumventing the regulatory hurdles and consumer concerns associated with traditional GM methodologies. This protocol establishes a robust and reliable tool for non-GMO strain development in *P. ostreatus*, opening avenues for enhancing desirable traits such as yield, nutritional content, and disease resistance. Further research will focus on optimizing HDR efficiency and exploring the potential for multiplex genome editing to accelerate the breeding of improved cultivated strains. This work represents a significant step towards sustainable and consumer-acceptable advancements in fungal biotechnology.
