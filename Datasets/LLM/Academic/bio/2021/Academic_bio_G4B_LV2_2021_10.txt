**Abstract**

The investigation of electrophile reactivity at the proteome level necessitates methodologies capable of discerning subtle residue-specific interactions. This work details the development of a novel workflow designed to comprehensively evaluate the proteome-wide selectivity of various electrophiles. Utilizing a targeted approach incorporating amino acid monitoring, we identified nine distinct amino acid residues exhibiting preferential reactivity towards selected probes.  Crucially, the study leveraged covalent inhibitor formation, capitalizing on the electrophilic nature of the probes to generate stable adducts.  These adducts were subsequently quantified, enabling a comparative analysis of electrophilic preference across the proteome.  The resultant data provides a valuable resource for understanding the structural determinants governing protein modification and highlights the potential of residue-specific proteomics in elucidating complex biochemical processes.  Further research will focus on expanding the probe library and characterizing the biological consequences of these identified interactions.
