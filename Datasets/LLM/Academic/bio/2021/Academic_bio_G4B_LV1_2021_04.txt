**Prevalence of Psychiatric Knowledge Deficits in Undergraduate Medical Students: A Cross-Sectional Study in Central India**

**Abstract**

Limited exposure to mental health topics within undergraduate medical curricula represents a significant barrier to effective patient care. This study, conducted in central India during 2021, investigated the relationship between student attendance patterns and demonstrated psychiatric knowledge among MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) students. Utilizing a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected from a representative sample of [Insert Sample Size - e.g., 350] medical students across [Insert Number – e.g., six] medical colleges within the region.  Results revealed a notable correlation between reduced attendance at dedicated psychiatric lectures and a statistically significant lower mean score on a standardized psychiatric knowledge assessment (p < 0.01). 

Furthermore, qualitative analysis of student responses indicated prevalent negative attitudes towards psychiatric training, frequently attributed to perceived lack of relevance to core clinical competencies and insufficient time allocation. These findings suggest a critical need for targeted interventions to improve student engagement in psychiatric education. Specifically, strategies focused on integrating mental health concepts into existing curricula and fostering a more positive perception of psychiatric training are warranted. Future research should explore the long-term impact of these interventions on student clinical practice and patient outcomes within this underserved population.
