**Abstract**

The electrochemical oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical bottleneck in various biotechnological processes. Recent research highlights the potential of modified metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) to improve OER efficiency. This study investigates the mechanistic role of carboxylate ligands incorporated into bi/trimetallic MOFs and LDHs in enhancing OER activity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal interfacial electron redistribution facilitated by carboxylate adsorption, leading to a substantial decrease in the activation energy for oxygen release. Furthermore, accelerated proton transfer pathways are proposed, directly attributable to the ligand’s ability to stabilize and orientatively position active sites. These findings suggest a strategic approach to biomimetic electrocatalysis, leveraging precisely engineered materials to optimize electrochemical transformations, with implications for biofuel production and biosensing technologies.
