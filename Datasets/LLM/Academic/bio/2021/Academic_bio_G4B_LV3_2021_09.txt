**Abstract**

Emerging evidence suggests Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis may initiate prior to the overt presence of amyloid pathology. This study investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic profiles to identify potential biomarkers and delineate pre-clinical subtypes within cognitively intact individuals. Utilizing targeted mass spectrometry on CSF samples from a cohort of cognitively normal participants, we identified three distinct proteomic subtypes characterized by unique biomarker signatures. Notably, these subtypes exhibited differential expression of proteins associated with neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction, suggesting an alternative pathway to AD development.  Our findings indicate that subtle alterations in CSF protein composition, detectable before significant amyloid deposition, may represent a valuable predictive indicator of AD risk. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to validate these subtypes as biomarkers and to explore their relationship with subsequent cognitive decline, ultimately informing early intervention strategies.
