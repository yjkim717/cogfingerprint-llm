Title: Disentangling the Complexity of Forest Microclimates: High-Resolution Insights into Sub-Canopy Temperature Dynamics

Abstract:

Forest microclimates play a crucial role in shaping biodiversity patterns and mediating the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems. Despite their importance, the fine-scale thermal characteristics of forest understories remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed a novel spatial modelling approach to generate high-resolution (25 m) temperature maps of European forest understories, leveraging macroclimatic variables and forest structural data. Our results reveal significant discrepancies between sub-canopy temperatures and free-air temperatures, with differences exceeding 5Â°C in some regions. Notably, the magnitude and direction of these differences varied substantially across different forest types and topographic settings. We found that sub-canopy temperatures were generally cooler than free-air temperatures during the day, particularly in dense, closed-canopy forests, while exhibiting reduced diurnal variability. Conversely, forest edges and sparse canopy areas displayed increased temperature fluctuations, often exceeding those observed in open environments. Our findings have important implications for understanding the role of forest microclimates in buffering climate change impacts on forest biodiversity. By providing a more nuanced understanding of sub-canopy temperature dynamics, our study highlights the need to incorporate microclimatic heterogeneity into predictive models of forest ecosystem responses to climate change. As global temperatures continue to rise, the conservation and management of forest ecosystems will depend critically on our ability to accurately forecast and mitigate the impacts of climate change on these complex, thermally heterogeneous environments.
