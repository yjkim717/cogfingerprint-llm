**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cancer genomics necessitates sophisticated approaches to integrate and interpret increasingly complex datasets. This study highlights the utility of UCSC Xena, a web-based platform designed to address this challenge. Xena’s core functionality centers on the visualization and interactive analysis of multi-omics data – encompassing genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiles – alongside associated clinical annotations.  Critically, the tool facilitates the seamless incorporation of both publicly available datasets from repositories like NCBI and curated private collections.  We argue that Xena’s interactive exploration capabilities are paramount for researchers seeking to identify genomic biomarkers and understand tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, the platform’s integration with resources like the UCSC Genome Browser and Xena’s ability to represent data on the Xena Portal contribute to improved data accessibility and collaborative research efforts.  In 2021, Xena demonstrated significant potential as a foundational resource for advancing cancer genomic research and informing precision medicine strategies.
