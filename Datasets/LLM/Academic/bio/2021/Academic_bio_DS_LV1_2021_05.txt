**Abstract**

The autumn of 2021 marked an unprecedented epizootic of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) across Europe, characterized by the widespread dissemination of the A(H5N1) virus of clade 2.3.4.4b. This viral lineage, distinguished by its heightened virulence and efficient transmission within wild avifauna, precipitated a surge in outbreaks within both commercial poultry operations and wild bird populations from September through December. The epidemiological pattern observed during this period signified a critical shift from previous HPAI incursions, moving beyond sporadic, localized spillover events to a sustained, pan-continental circulation primarily driven by migratory waterfowl. This paradigm shift underscored the virus's successful adaptation to a broad reservoir host range, facilitating its rapid geographic dispersal along major migratory flyways. Consequently, the frequency of viral incursion into poultry farms escalated dramatically, exposing critical vulnerabilities in existing biosecurity protocols. The pervasive environmental contamination of wetlands and resting sites by infected wild birds created a persistent external challenge, overwhelming standard perimeter defenses. This review synthesizes the 2021 epidemiological data to argue that conventional, farm-centric biosecurity measures, while necessary, are insufficient as a standalone defense against this newly established ecological threat. We posit that effective mitigation requires an integrated "One Health" approach, combining enhanced, risk-based on-farm biosecurity—such as mandatory indoor housing orders in high-risk zones and stricter controls on personnel and fomites—with robust, coordinated wildlife surveillance programs. The latter is essential for early warning and tracing the evolution and spread of novel genotypes. The 2021 HPAI crisis thus serves as a pivotal case study, compelling a fundamental re-evaluation of avian influenza prevention strategies to address the emergent reality of endemic HPAI virus circulation in wild bird populations.
