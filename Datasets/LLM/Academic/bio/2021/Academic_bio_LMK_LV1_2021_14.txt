Title: Quantifying Anomalous Diffusion of Endosomes in Eukaryotic Cells: A Single-Particle Tracking Analysis

Abstract:

Intracellular transport is a complex process governed by the dynamics of various organelles, including endosomes. We employed single-particle tracking to investigate the motion of endosomes in eukaryotic cells, focusing on the characteristics of their trajectories. Our analysis revealed two distinct subpopulations of endosomes: slow and fast moving. The slow-moving endosomes exhibited subdiffusive behavior, consistent with fractional Brownian motion, indicating a strong interaction with the surrounding cytoskeleton. In contrast, the fast-moving endosomes displayed superdiffusive characteristics, suggesting active transport along microtubules. By quantifying the anomalous diffusion exponents and analyzing the distribution of step sizes, we identified distinct signatures for each subpopulation. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms governing endosome transport and highlight the importance of considering heterogeneity in intracellular dynamics. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of cellular trafficking and its regulation in eukaryotic cells. (2021)
