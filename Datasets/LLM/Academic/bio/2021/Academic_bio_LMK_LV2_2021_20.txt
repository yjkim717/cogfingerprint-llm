Title: Unveiling the Thermal Dynamics of European Forest Understories: A High-Resolution Mapping Approach

Abstract:

Forest microclimates play a crucial role in shaping biodiversity patterns and mediating climate change impacts on ecosystems. Despite their significance, the thermal dynamics of forest understories remain poorly understood due to the complexity of sub-canopy temperature regulation and the scarcity of high-resolution data. To address this knowledge gap, we employed a machine learning framework to generate high-resolution temperature maps for European forest understories. By integrating in situ temperature measurements with macroclimatic variables and geospatial data, our models captured the intricate relationships between forest structure, topography, and sub-canopy temperature. The resulting maps revealed significant spatial variability in forest understory temperatures, highlighting the importance of microclimatic heterogeneity in shaping forest ecosystems. Our analysis demonstrated that macroclimatic variables, such as temperature and precipitation, exert a significant influence on sub-canopy temperature, but are modulated by forest characteristics, including canopy density and tree species composition. The high-resolution temperature maps generated in this study provide a valuable resource for understanding the impacts of climate change on forest biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. By elucidating the thermal dynamics of European forest understories, our research contributes to the development of more accurate predictions of climate change impacts on forest ecosystems and informs strategies for mitigating its effects on forest biodiversity. This study underscores the importance of considering microclimatic variability in forest ecosystems and highlights the potential of machine learning approaches for advancing our understanding of complex ecological systems.
