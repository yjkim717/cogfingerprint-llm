**Title:** Systemic Curricular Deficiencies as a Determinant of Low Psychiatry Attendance Among Medical Undergraduates: A Bio-Pedagogical Analysis

**Abstract:**

The integration of psychiatric training within the core medical curriculum is critical for developing a holistic, biopsychosocial model of patient care. However, significant disparities in student engagement with this discipline persist. This study investigates the behavioral and systemic factors contributing to low attendance in psychiatry rotations among undergraduate medical students in India, contextualized within the unique pressures of the 2021 academic landscape. We hypothesize that attendance is not merely a function of student interest but is governed by a neurobiological cost-benefit calculus, heavily influenced by institutional reinforcement structures. A cross-sectional analysis of student engagement metrics and institutional policies was conducted. Findings indicate that the primary determinants of low attendance are the absence of discipline-specific summative assessments and lenient enforcement policies. From a bioscientific perspective, these systemic gaps fail to activate the neural pathways associated with incentive salience and threat avoidance that are effectively engaged by high-stakes examinations in other specialties. Consequently, the perceived cognitive load of attending psychiatry rotations outweighs the perceived reward, leading to strategic resource allocation towards more heavily examined subjects. We conclude that the observed attendance patterns are a rational, albeit detrimental, neurobehavioral adaptation to a flawed curricular design. We recommend a structural intervention: the implementation of mandatory, graded examinations and stricter attendance protocols. This realigns the curriculum with established principles of learning reinforcement, thereby ensuring the robust neurological encoding of psychiatric competencies essential for future clinical practice.
