**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits a profound metabolic reprogramming, frequently characterized by the Warburg effect â€“ a preferential reliance on glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation despite adequate oxygen availability. This metabolic shift contributes significantly to tumor proliferation, survival, and therapeutic resistance.  Emerging evidence highlights the Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway as a critical modulator of these metabolic alterations within the CRC microenvironment. This review synthesizes current understanding of the intricate relationship between IGF-1 signaling and glucose metabolism in CRC, focusing on the mechanisms driving the Warburg effect. We examine how IGF-1, through activation of downstream targets like PI3K/Akt and mTOR, directly influences glycolytic enzyme expression, glucose transporter (GLUT1) upregulation, and hexokinase activity, thereby promoting glucose uptake and utilization. Furthermore, we discuss the role of IGF-1 in modulating mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation, contributing to the metabolic plasticity observed in CRC cells.  Dysregulation of the insulin/IGF system, frequently observed in CRC patients, creates a metabolic milieu conducive to tumor progression.  Finally, we explore potential therapeutic strategies targeting the IGF-1 pathway and its metabolic consequences, including IGF-1 receptor inhibitors, mTOR inhibitors, and agents modulating glucose metabolism. Future research should focus on delineating the specific metabolic dependencies conferred by distinct IGF-1 signaling subtypes within CRC and investigating combinatorial approaches that integrate metabolic targeting with conventional therapies to improve treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. Understanding the nuances of this interplay represents a crucial step towards developing more effective and personalized CRC treatments.
