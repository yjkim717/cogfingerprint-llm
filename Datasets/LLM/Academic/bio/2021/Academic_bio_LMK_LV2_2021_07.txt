Title: Unveiling the Thermal Landscape of European Forest Understories: High-Resolution Temperature Maps for Climate-Informed Biodiversity Assessments

Abstract:

Forest microclimates play a crucial role in shaping biodiversity patterns and ecosystem functioning, particularly in understory environments where temperature regimes can deviate significantly from ambient macroclimatic conditions. As climate change continues to alter global temperature patterns, understanding the thermal landscape of forest understories is essential for predicting and mitigating its impacts on forest-floor biodiversity. In this context, we present high-resolution temperature maps of European forest understories, generated using a comprehensive dataset of sub-canopy temperature measurements and macroclimatic variables. By integrating these data with advanced geospatial modeling techniques, we created detailed thermal maps that capture the complex spatial variability of forest understory temperatures across Europe. Our results show that sub-canopy temperatures exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity, influenced by factors such as forest structure, topography, and regional climate. The high-resolution temperature maps generated in this study provide a valuable tool for assessing climate-related impacts on forest-floor biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, enabling researchers and conservationists to identify areas most vulnerable to climate change. By improving our understanding of forest microclimates, this research contributes to the development of more effective strategies for managing and conserving forest ecosystems under a changing climate. As such, our findings have important implications for climate-informed biodiversity assessments and conservation planning in European forests.
