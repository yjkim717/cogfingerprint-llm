>## Targeted Genome Editing in *Pleurotus ostreatus* via CRISPR-Cas9 Mediated Homology-Directed Repair: A Route to Non-GMO Strain Improvement

**Abstract**

The growing demand for sustainable and enhanced fungal biomass production necessitates innovative approaches to strain improvement. While traditional breeding methods are often time-consuming and limited by genetic diversity, genome editing technologies offer a precise and accelerated route. This study investigates the application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for targeted genome modification in the commercially important oyster mushroom, *Pleurotus ostreatus*. We demonstrate the successful implementation of CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) for inducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific genomic loci, coupled with homology-directed repair (HDR) as the predominant repair pathway. Using a targeted gene disruption strategy, we achieved efficient knockout of a candidate gene associated with polysaccharide production. Crucially, the absence of transgene integration observed in our edited lines confirms the generation of non-genetically modified (non-GM) strains, adhering to increasingly stringent regulatory frameworks.  Analysis of edited progeny confirmed heritability of the targeted modifications. Our findings showcase the feasibility and efficiency of CRISPR-Cas9-mediated HDR in *P. ostreatus*, circumventing the complexities of traditional transformation methods. This technology represents a significant advancement in fungal biotechnology, providing a powerful tool for rapid and precise strain improvement – specifically, influencing traits like yield, nutritional profile, and stress tolerance – while maintaining non-GM status. Future work will focus on expanding the repertoire of targeted modifications and exploring multi-gene editing strategies to further enhance mushroom production and functionality.
