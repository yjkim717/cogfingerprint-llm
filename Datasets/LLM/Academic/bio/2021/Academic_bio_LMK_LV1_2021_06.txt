Title: Unveiling the Role of Carboxylate Ligands in Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Metal-Organic Frameworks/Layered Double Hydroxides Hybrids

Abstract:
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for sustainable energy conversion. In 2021, research focused on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) hybrids due to their tunable structures and enhanced electrocatalytic activity. This study investigates the role of carboxylate ligands in modulating the OER performance of MOFs/LDHs hybrids. Using a combination of spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that carboxylate ligands facilitate the formation of high-valent metal-oxo species, thereby enhancing the electrocatalytic activity. The results demonstrate a positive correlation between the carboxylate ligand's denticity and the OER activity, with tricarboxylate ligands exhibiting the highest performance. Our findings provide insight into the molecular-level design principles for optimizing MOFs/LDHs hybrids as efficient OER electrocatalysts, paving the way for the development of sustainable energy conversion technologies.
