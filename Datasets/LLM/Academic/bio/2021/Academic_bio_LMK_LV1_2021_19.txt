Title: Unveiling the Role of Carboxylate Ligands in Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity of Metal-Organic Frameworks/Layered Double Hydroxides Hybrids

Abstract:
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is crucial for sustainable energy conversion. In this study, we investigate the role of carboxylate ligands in modulating the OER electrocatalytic activity of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) hybrids. Using a combination of spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the structural and electronic factors governing the enhanced electrocatalytic performance. Our results show that the incorporation of carboxylate ligands into MOFs/LDHs hybrids significantly enhances their OER activity, attributed to the optimized coordination environment and charge transfer properties. The DFT calculations reveal that the carboxylate ligands facilitate the formation of high-valent metal-oxo species, which are crucial for OER. This work provides valuable insights into the design of efficient MOFs/LDHs-based electrocatalysts for sustainable energy applications, highlighting the importance of ligand engineering in OER electrocatalysis (2021).
