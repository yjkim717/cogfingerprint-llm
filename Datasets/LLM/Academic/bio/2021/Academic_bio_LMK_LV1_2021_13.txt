Title: SpatialViz: Unveiling Spatial Relationships in Multiplexed Tissue Images for Single-Cell Analysis

Abstract:
The advent of imaging mass cytometry has revolutionized the field of biomedicine by enabling the simultaneous detection of multiple proteins in tissues at single-cell granularity. However, the complexity of multiplexed tissue images poses significant challenges in deciphering spatial relationships between cells and their protein profiles. To address this, we present SpatialViz, a novel suite of algorithms designed to visualize and quantify the spatial interactions within multiplexed tissue images. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques, SpatialViz extracts meaningful patterns and correlations from high-dimensional protein data, facilitating the analysis of cellular heterogeneity in health and disease. Our framework enables researchers to investigate the spatial distribution of protein profiles, identify cell-cell interactions, and elucidate the underlying tissue architecture. As demonstrated through its application to various tissue types, SpatialViz provides a robust tool for uncovering novel insights into the intricate spatial relationships governing cellular behavior.
