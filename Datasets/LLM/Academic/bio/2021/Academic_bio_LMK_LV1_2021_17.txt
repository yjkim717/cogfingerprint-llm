Title: Evaluating the Impact of Assessment Structure on Undergraduate Medical Students' Attendance in Psychiatry Clinical Postings

Abstract:

The clinical posting in psychiatry is a crucial component of undergraduate medical education, providing students with hands-on experience in diagnosing and managing mental health disorders. However, studies have consistently shown that undergraduate medical students often exhibit poor attendance in psychiatry clinical postings. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing attendance among MBBS students in a psychiatry clinical posting. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 150 MBBS students who attended a psychiatry clinical posting at a tertiary care hospital in 2021. The results showed that the majority of students (70%) had poor attendance (<75%) in the psychiatry clinical posting. Multivariate analysis revealed that the lack of a separate examination in psychiatry was a significant predictor of poor attendance (OR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.2-5.1, p=0.01). Additionally, students who reported adjusting their attendance in psychiatry to accommodate other subjects with more stringent attendance requirements were more likely to have poor attendance in psychiatry (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.5-6.7, p=0.002). The findings of this study highlight the need for a more integrated assessment structure that recognizes the importance of psychiatry in the undergraduate medical curriculum. Incorporating a separate examination in psychiatry and implementing a more balanced attendance policy across subjects may help improve attendance and engagement among undergraduate medical students in psychiatry clinical postings.
