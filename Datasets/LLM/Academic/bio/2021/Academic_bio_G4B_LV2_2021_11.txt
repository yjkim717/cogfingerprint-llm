**Abstract**

Emerging evidence implicates alterations in systemic protein signatures as early indicators of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) progression. This study leverages longitudinal proteomic profiling of blood samples collected during two Phase II clinical trials evaluating the novel therapeutic agent, GRF6019, to investigate potential biological responses. Utilizing mass spectrometry-based proteomics, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of differentially expressed proteins across treatment arms and timepoints. Results demonstrated significant modulation of key pathways associated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in individuals receiving GRF6019 compared to controls. Specifically, we identified enriched clusters of proteins indicative of adaptive immune responses and mitochondrial dysfunction. These findings suggest that GRF6019 exerts its effects, at least partially, by influencing systemic proteomic landscapes relevant to AD pathogenesis. Further investigation of these identified biomarkers holds promise for improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies within the AD clinical trial landscape.
