Title: Leveraging UCSC Xena for Integrative Analysis of Multi-Omic Cancer Genomics Data


#### Abstract
The rapid proliferation of high-throughput sequencing technologies has led to an unprecedented accumulation of multi-omic cancer genomics data, underscoring the need for sophisticated visualization tools to facilitate integrative analysis. In response, the UCSC Xena platform has emerged as a pivotal resource, enabling researchers to explore and analyze complex genomics datasets in conjunction with clinical annotations. This study highlights the utility of UCSC Xena in harmonizing diverse data types, including genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic profiles, to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of cancer. By leveraging Xena's robust data integration framework, we demonstrate the capacity to perform cross-platform, cross-cohort analyses, thereby enhancing the statistical power to detect driver mutations and elucidate their downstream effects. Furthermore, Xena's intuitive visualization interface allows for the simultaneous exploration of multi-dimensional data, facilitating the identification of patterns and correlations that inform cancer biology. To validate the efficacy of Xena, we conducted a case study on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer dataset, comprising over 10,000 tumor samples across 33 cancer types. Our analysis revealed novel associations between genomic alterations and gene expression changes, underscoring the value of Xena in generating testable hypotheses. Additionally, we illustrate how Xena's clinical annotation framework enables the integration of phenotypic data, permitting the investigation of relationships between molecular features and clinical outcomes. The findings presented herein underscore the critical role of UCSC Xena in accelerating cancer genomics research by providing a scalable, web-based platform for the visualization and analysis of multi-omic data. As the cancer genomics landscape continues to evolve, Xena is poised to remain a vital tool for researchers seeking to uncover the complexities of tumor biology and inform precision oncology initiatives. By fostering a deeper understanding of the genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic alterations driving tumorigenesis, Xena will continue to facilitate the translation of basic research findings into clinical applications, ultimately enhancing our capacity to combat cancer.
