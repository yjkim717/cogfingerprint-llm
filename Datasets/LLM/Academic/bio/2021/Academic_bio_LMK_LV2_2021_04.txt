Title: Evaluating the Impact of Examination Structure on Attendance in Psychiatric Training among Undergraduate Medical Students

Abstract:

The integration of psychiatric training into undergraduate medical curricula is crucial for fostering competent medical professionals. However, the efficacy of such training is contingent upon various factors, including attendance and assessment methodologies. A cross-sectional study conducted in 2021 among 100 MBBS students in central India revealed a concerning trend of low attendance during psychiatric clinical postings. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the factors contributing to suboptimal attendance in psychiatric training.

The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis techniques. The results indicated a significant correlation between the absence of a separate examination for psychiatry and low attendance during psychiatric clinical postings. Furthermore, the analysis revealed that students often adjusted their attendance in psychiatry with that of other subjects, suggesting a lack of perceived importance attributed to psychiatric training.

The findings of this study underscore the need for a reevaluation of the current assessment structure in undergraduate medical education. The introduction of a separate examination for psychiatry could potentially enhance attendance and engagement among students. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of emphasizing the significance of psychiatric training in the medical curriculum. The results of this study have implications for medical education policymakers and curriculum designers, particularly in the context of optimizing psychiatric training for undergraduate medical students. The study's conclusions contribute to the ongoing discourse on refining medical education to produce well-rounded and competent medical professionals.
