**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents a significant global health challenge, frequently characterized by aberrant metabolic adaptations. Recent research increasingly implicates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling as a critical driver of these metabolic alterations, particularly within the context of the Warburg effect – a hallmark of cancer wherein malignant cells preferentially utilize glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation. This study investigates the nuanced interplay between IGF-1 signaling, glucose metabolism, and the progression of CRC. We hypothesize that elevated IGF-1 levels directly stimulate glycolytic flux and contribute to the sustained metabolic reprogramming observed in CRC cells. 

Specifically, we examined the correlation between IGF-1 receptor expression, downstream signaling cascades (including PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways), and glucose uptake in human CRC cell lines. Preliminary data suggests a positive feedback loop wherein increased glucose metabolism fuels IGF-1 production, exacerbating the Warburg effect. Furthermore, our investigation explores the potential link between IGF-1 and the metabolic syndrome, suggesting that dysregulated IGF-1 signaling may represent a common mechanistic pathway contributing to both CRC development and the broader metabolic dysfunction associated with this condition.
