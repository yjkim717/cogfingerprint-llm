In 2021, deep proteomic profiling was employed within Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) clinical trials to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying GRF6019 therapy. Utilizing high-resolution mass spectrometry, we quantified thousands of proteins in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma samples from trial participants. Our analysis revealed that GRF6019 administration significantly modulated specific biological pathways, notably those implicated in neuroinflammation, synaptic integrity, and cellular stress response. These proteomic shifts provide compelling evidence that the investigational treatment engages targets relevant to AD pathophysiology and aging biology. The findings underscore the utility of proteomics as a robust pharmacodynamic biomarker strategy in neurodegenerative disease trials, offering a nuanced view of drug mechanism beyond conventional cognitive endpoints. This work establishes a framework for pathway-centric assessment of therapeutic efficacy in age-related disorders.
