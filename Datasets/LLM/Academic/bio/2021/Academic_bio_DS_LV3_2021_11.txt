In this 2021 study, we employed deep longitudinal proteomics to evaluate GRF6019, an investigational therapy for Alzheimer's disease, across two randomized clinical trials. Through high-resolution mass spectrometry, we quantified approximately 3,000 plasma proteins at multiple timepoints in participants with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's. Our analysis revealed that GRF6019 administration significantly modulated proteins within the complement cascade, synaptic plasticity, and innate immune response pathways, distinct from placebo-treated cohorts. These proteomic shifts correlated with stabilized cognitive scores on the ADAS-Cog, suggesting a biological mechanism underpinning the observed clinical effects. Our findings demonstrate that comprehensive proteomic profiling serves as a powerful tool for identifying pharmacodynamic biomarkers and elucidating therapeutic mechanisms in neurodegenerative drug development. This approach provides a critical framework for monitoring target engagement and refining patient stratification strategies in future Alzheimer's clinical trials.
