Title: IGF-1 Orchestrates Glucose Metabolism in Colorectal Cancer via Modulation of the Warburg Effect

Abstract:

The insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway has been implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolism in various cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). The Warburg effect, a hallmark of cancer metabolism, is characterized by enhanced glycolysis and lactate production, even in the presence of adequate oxygen. Recent studies have elucidated the role of IGF-1 in modulating the Warburg effect, thereby promoting CRC progression. Here, we discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF-1-mediated regulation of glucose metabolism in CRC. IGF-1 signaling activates key glycolytic enzymes, including hexokinase 2 (HK2) and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, resulting in enhanced glycolytic flux and lactate production. Furthermore, IGF-1-induced expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) facilitates glucose uptake, thereby fueling the Warburg effect. The resulting metabolic reprogramming supports the proliferation and survival of CRC cells. Notably, targeting the IGF-1 signaling pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for CRC treatment. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) inhibitors can suppress CRC growth and induce apoptosis by disrupting glucose metabolism. Our analysis highlights the critical role of IGF-1 in regulating glucose metabolism in CRC and underscores the potential of targeting IGF-1 signaling for the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF-1-mediated modulation of the Warburg effect may provide valuable insights into the development of effective treatments for CRC.
