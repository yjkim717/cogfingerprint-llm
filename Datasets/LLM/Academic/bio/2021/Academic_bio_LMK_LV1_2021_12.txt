Title: Dissecting Transcriptional Noise through Stochastic Modeling and Single-Molecule Quantification: A Framework for Investigating Biophysical Phenomena

Abstract:

Transcriptional noise, arising from the inherent stochasticity of gene expression, plays a crucial role in shaping cellular behavior and response to environmental cues. Recent advances in single-molecule quantification have enabled researchers to probe the intricacies of transcriptional regulation with unprecedented precision. However, interpreting the resulting data requires robust theoretical frameworks that can distinguish between competing hypotheses regarding the sources and consequences of transcriptional noise. In this study, we present a class of continuous-discrete models that integrate stochastic transcription rates with single-molecule quantification to elucidate the biophysical phenomena underlying transcriptional variability. By capturing the interplay between transcriptional bursting, promoter dynamics, and mRNA degradation, our models provide a nuanced understanding of the complex interactions governing gene expression. We demonstrate that the stochastic transcription rate can be inferred from single-molecule data using a maximum likelihood estimation framework, allowing for the identification of key biophysical parameters that govern transcriptional noise. Our results show that the proposed models can effectively distinguish between different hypotheses regarding transcription rate variation, providing a powerful tool for investigating the mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation. By bridging the gap between theoretical modeling and experimental data, this work paves the way for a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between transcriptional noise, gene regulation, and cellular behavior, with implications for our understanding of cellular decision-making and response to environmental stimuli in diverse biological contexts.
