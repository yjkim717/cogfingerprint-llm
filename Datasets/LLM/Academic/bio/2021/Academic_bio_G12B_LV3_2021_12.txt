**Abstract**

Cell-to-cell variability in transcriptional output is a fundamental characteristic of biological systems, often attributed to inherent ‘transcriptional noise.’ While acknowledged, the mechanistic origins of this noise remain a significant challenge for quantitative biological inquiry. This study presents a novel framework employing interpretable and tractable stochastic models to dissect transcriptional dynamics and rigorously evaluate competing hypotheses regarding noise generation. We leverage single-molecule data to parameterize these models, enabling precise quantification of cell-to-cell variations in transcriptional rates and providing a robust platform for hypothesis discrimination. Our approach moves beyond descriptive analyses of variance by offering a predictive capacity to differentiate between models incorporating factors such as promoter stochasticity, RNA polymerase pausing, and feedback loops. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these models can be used to design targeted experiments, optimizing for maximum information gain in distinguishing between distinct mechanistic explanations for observed transcriptional heterogeneity. The methodology introduced herein promises to advance our understanding of gene regulation and facilitate the development of more accurate and nuanced models of cellular behavior.
