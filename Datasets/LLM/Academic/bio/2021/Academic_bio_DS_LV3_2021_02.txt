Of particular significance in colorectal carcinogenesis is the dysregulation of cellular metabolism, most notably the Warburg effect, wherein neoplastic cells preferentially utilize glycolysis for energy production despite adequate oxygen availability. This 2021 review synthesizes contemporary evidence elucidating the pivotal role of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling as a master regulator of this metabolic reprogramming. We delineate the molecular mechanisms through which IGF-1, upon binding its receptor, activates the canonical PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling axis. This activation orchestrates a profound shift in glucose metabolism, enhancing glycolytic flux, increasing glucose uptake, and promoting lactate production, thereby furnishing the biosynthetic precursors essential for rapid tumor proliferation. Furthermore, we explore the crosstalk between this pathway and oncogenic drivers specific to colorectal cancer, establishing a feed-forward loop that sustains both proliferative and metabolic signaling. The review critically evaluates the therapeutic implications of targeting this nexus, arguing that pharmacological inhibition of the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway represents a promising strategy to disrupt the metabolic vulnerabilities of colorectal cancer cells. By integrating findings from in vitro models, animal studies, and emerging clinical data, this analysis provides a comprehensive framework for understanding how intercepting growth factor-driven metabolic adaptations could improve therapeutic outcomes and overcome chemoresistance in this malignancy.
