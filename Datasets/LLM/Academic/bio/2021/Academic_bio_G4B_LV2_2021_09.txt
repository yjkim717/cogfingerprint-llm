**Abstract**

The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasingly understood to be a protracted, multi-stage process, potentially initiating long before the clinical manifestation of cognitive impairment.  This study investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomics to delineate early biomarkers and predict disease subtypes in individuals with cognitively intact profiles. Utilizing mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of CSF samples from a cohort of cognitively normal subjects, we identified three distinct proteomic subtypes characterized by divergent biomarker signatures. 

Notably, these subtypes exhibited significant differences in the abundance of specific proteins, suggesting a heterogeneity in the underlying biological processes preceding symptomatic AD.  Our findings indicate that alterations in CSF protein profiles can be detected prior to the detectable accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides, a hallmark of established AD pathology.  This early detection capability offers a potential advantage for preventative therapeutic interventions. 

Furthermore, subtype classification demonstrated a degree of predictive accuracy for future conversion to mild cognitive impairment, highlighting the utility of CSF proteomics as a tool for identifying individuals at heightened risk.  These results contribute to a refined understanding of AD progression and support the exploration of targeted diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies. Future research will focus on validating these subtypes in larger cohorts and correlating them with genetic risk factors.
