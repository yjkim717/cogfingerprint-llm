Title: Unveiling the Role of Carboxylate Ligands in Enhancing Oxygen Evolution Reaction Electrocatalytic Activity in Metal-Organic Frameworks and Layered Double Hydroxides

Abstract:
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial process in various energy conversion and storage technologies. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have emerged as promising electrocatalysts for OER. However, the underlying mechanisms governing their electrocatalytic activity remain unclear. This study investigates the role of carboxylate ligands in enhancing OER electrocatalytic activity in MOFs and LDHs using a combination of spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results reveal that carboxylate ligands play a pivotal role in modulating the electronic structure and surface properties of MOFs and LDHs, thereby enhancing their OER electrocatalytic activity. The findings provide valuable insights into the design and development of efficient MOF- and LDH-based electrocatalysts for OER, contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies in 2021.
