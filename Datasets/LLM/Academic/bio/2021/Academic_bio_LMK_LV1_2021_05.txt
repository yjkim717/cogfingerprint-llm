**Title:** Epidemiological Analysis of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Outbreaks in EU/EEA Countries and the UK during the 2021 Autumn Season

**Abstract:**

The autumn season of 2021 witnessed a significant surge in avian influenza outbreaks across the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries and the United Kingdom (UK), posing substantial threats to the poultry industry and public health. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the epidemiology of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) outbreaks reported between September and December 2021. The data presented herein are based on surveillance reports and outbreak investigations conducted by national veterinary authorities and compiled by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

During the specified period, a total of [X] HPAIV outbreaks were reported in poultry holdings across [X] EU/EEA countries and the UK. The majority of these outbreaks were attributed to HPAIV subtype H5N1, which has been identified as the predominant strain circulating in the region. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a close genetic relationship between the viruses isolated from poultry holdings and those detected in wild birds, suggesting a likely role of wild birds in the introduction and dissemination of HPAIV.

The poultry industry faced significant challenges due to these outbreaks, with substantial losses incurred as a result of mortality, culling, and movement restrictions. To mitigate the impact of HPAIV, stringent biosecurity measures were implemented across affected farms, including enhanced surveillance, improved farm hygiene, and controlled movement of poultry and poultry products. The effectiveness of these measures was evident in the gradual decline in the number of reported outbreaks towards the end of December 2021.

This report underscores the importance of maintaining robust surveillance systems and implementing proactive biosecurity measures to prevent and control HPAIV outbreaks. The findings highlight the need for continued collaboration between veterinary authorities, farmers, and other stakeholders to protect the poultry industry and mitigate the risk of avian influenza transmission to humans. The data and insights presented in this report will inform risk assessments and support the development of evidence-based policies to enhance HPAIV preparedness and response in the EU/EEA and the UK.
