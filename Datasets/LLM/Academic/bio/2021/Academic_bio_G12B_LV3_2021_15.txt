**Abstract**

The metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells, notably the Warburg effect – preferential glucose utilization for aerobic glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation – is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent investigations highlight a critical, yet complex, interplay between Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling and this metabolic shift. This review synthesizes current understanding of how aberrant IGF-1 pathway activation, frequently observed in patients with metabolic syndrome, contributes to dysregulated glucose metabolism within CRC. Specifically, we explore the mechanisms by which IGF-1 promotes increased glucose uptake, enhanced glycolysis, and reduced mitochondrial respiration in CRC cells, thereby fueling tumor growth and proliferation. Furthermore, we examine the downstream effects of IGF-1 signaling on key glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters, highlighting the molecular basis for the Warburg effect in this malignancy. The increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome as a risk factor for CRC underscores the clinical relevance of targeting the IGF-1 axis. Finally, we discuss emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at disrupting IGF-1 signaling and modulating glucose metabolism as potential avenues for improved CRC treatment and prevention, including dual-action agents that simultaneously inhibit IGF-1 receptor tyrosine kinase activity and impact glycolytic flux. Future research should focus on personalized approaches considering the heterogeneity of IGF-1 signaling in CRC subtypes.
