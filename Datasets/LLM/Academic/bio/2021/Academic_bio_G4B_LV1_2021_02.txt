**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) exhibits a distinct metabolic phenotype characterized by increased glucose uptake and lactate production, often referred to as the Warburg effect. Emerging evidence suggests a critical role for insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) in modulating this metabolic adaptation within the tumor microenvironment. This study synthesizes current literature to explore the intricate interplay between IGF-1 signaling, glucose metabolism, and the metabolic syndrome in CRC progression. Specifically, we hypothesize that elevated IGF-1 levels, frequently observed in individuals with metabolic syndrome, contribute to aberrant glucose utilization by CRC cells.  

Mechanistic investigations indicate IGF-1 activates downstream pathways, including PI3K/AKT and MAPK, promoting glycolysis and suppressing oxidative phosphorylation.  Furthermore, chronic IGF-1 exposure may exacerbate features associated with metabolic syndrome, such as insulin resistance, thereby fostering a pro-tumorigenic metabolic landscape.  Understanding these connections offers potential therapeutic targets for disrupting CRC’s metabolic dependency and mitigating systemic metabolic dysfunction.
