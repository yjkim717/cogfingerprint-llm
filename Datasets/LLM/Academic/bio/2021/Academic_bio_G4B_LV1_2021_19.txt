**Abstract**

The efficient biotransformation of complex organic substrates necessitates robust and adaptable enzymatic systems.  This study investigates the potential of engineered protein scaffolds, specifically utilizing modified carboxylation motifs, to enhance the catalytic activity of metalloenzymes involved in oxidative stress response.  Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we modeled the interaction of synthetic carboxylate ligands with a model copper-containing superoxide dismutase (Cu-SOD) analogue, revealing a significant modulation of electron density distribution within the active site upon ligand binding.  These modifications appear to facilitate improved proton transfer dynamics, mirroring the observed enhancement in oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis.  We hypothesize that analogous carboxylate-mediated stabilization of metal centers within protein environments could be leveraged to improve the efficiency of redox enzymes crucial for cellular defense.  Furthermore, the incorporation of these engineered scaffolds into layered double hydroxide (LDH) matrices – mimicking the support structures observed in MOFs – presents a promising avenue for creating stable, bio-inspired catalytic assemblies with enhanced activity and resilience.  Future research will focus on validating these *in vitro* findings through biochemical assays.
