**Abstract**

Intracellular transport of organelles, particularly endosomes, is increasingly recognized as a complex process deviating from classical Brownian motion. This study investigates the dynamics of endosomes within a eukaryotic cell, employing single-particle tracking to characterize their trajectories and analyze transport behavior. Our analysis moves beyond global diffusion metrics, implementing a local analysis approach to discern spatially and temporally varying transport characteristics. Results reveal a heterogeneous distribution of endosomal motion, exhibiting both slow and fast-moving subpopulations. Critically, we observe significant deviations from standard Brownian diffusion, demonstrating anomalous diffusion behavior characterized by non-unity anomalous diffusion exponents and variable diffusion coefficients across different cellular regions. These findings support a model of fractional Brownian motion, suggesting that endosomal transport is influenced by spatially varying intracellular environments and/or active transport mechanisms. The observed heterogeneity in anomalous diffusion exponents provides insights into the underlying cellular processes, potentially reflecting variations in motor protein activity, cytoskeletal organization, or local viscosity. Further investigation into the relationship between anomalous diffusion and cellular function is warranted to fully elucidate the intricacies of endosomal trafficking.
