Title: Profiling Electrophile Selectivity in the Proteome: A Comparative Analysis of Covalent Inhibitors using Alkyne Probes

Abstract:
Covalent inhibitors have emerged as a promising class of therapeutics, with their efficacy hinging on selective targeting of proteins. To elucidate the proteome-wide selectivity of electrophilic covalent inhibitors, we developed a competitive proteomics workflow utilizing alkyne probes. Fifty-four alkyne probes, each containing a distinct reactive group, were employed to interrogate the human proteome. Our approach enabled the quantitative comparison of probe labeling across diverse cellular proteins, providing a comprehensive map of electrophile selectivity. By analyzing the proteome-wide reactivity profiles, we identified patterns of probe specificity and promiscuity, shedding light on the molecular determinants governing covalent inhibitor selectivity. This study demonstrates the utility of alkyne probes in profiling electrophile reactivity and informs the design of covalent inhibitors with enhanced target specificity. Our findings have significant implications for the development of effective covalent therapeutics.
