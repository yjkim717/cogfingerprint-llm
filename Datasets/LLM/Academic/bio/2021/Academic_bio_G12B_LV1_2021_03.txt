**CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing in *Pleurotus ostreatus*: A Route to Non-Genetically Modified Strain Improvement**

**Abstract**

The escalating demand for sustainable and high-yielding fungal biomass necessitates innovative strategies for strain improvement in industrially relevant species. Traditional breeding methods in *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom) are often slow and unpredictable. Here, we report the successful application of CRISPR/Cas9 technology for targeted genome editing in *P. ostreatus*, offering a rapid and precise alternative to conventional approaches, while avoiding the complexities associated with transgenic methodologies. Utilizing a codon-optimized *Streptococcus pyogenes* Cas9 and guide RNAs targeting specific genomic loci, we demonstrate efficient double-strand break induction and subsequent homology-directed repair (HDR) in fungal mycelia.  A preliminary analysis reveals successful modification at the targeted site, evidenced by sequencing data, and initial phenotypic observations suggest the potential for trait modification. This study establishes a robust and reliable CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing platform for *P. ostreatus*, circumventing the need for genetic modification (GM) labeling and facilitating the development of non-GM strains with enhanced productivity, improved nutritional profiles, or increased resistance to environmental stressors.  Further research will focus on optimizing HDR efficiency, expanding the range of targetable genes, and comprehensively characterizing the phenotypic consequences of targeted genome modifications to fully realize the potential of this technology for sustainable mushroom cultivation and bioprocessing applications. The development of this non-GM editing tool represents a significant advancement in fungal biotechnology.

**Key Considerations in Crafting this Abstract:**

*   **Formal Tone:** Avoided colloquialisms and used precise scientific language.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** Presented the problem (need for strain improvement), the solution (CRISPR/Cas9), the method, the initial results, and the future directions.
*   **Precise Terminology:** Employed terms like "double-strand break induction," "homology-directed repair (HDR)," and "non-GM" accurately.
*   **Year Context (2021):** The language reflects the state of CRISPR/Cas9 research as of that time (relatively established, but still ongoing optimization).
*   **Focus on Non-GM:**  Emphasized the benefit of avoiding GM labeling as a key advantage.
