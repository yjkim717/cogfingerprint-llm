**Abstract**

Understanding spatial variation in environmental conditions is increasingly critical for predicting species distributions and assessing the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems. This study investigates the influence of microclimatic heterogeneity within European forest canopies, specifically focusing on subcanopy temperatures, utilizing machine learning techniques. We hypothesized that significant temperature offsets would exist between macroclimatic conditions and the microclimate experienced beneath the forest canopy, driven by topographical variables and influenced by climate change trends. Employing a geographically extensive dataset incorporating meteorological observations and detailed terrain data, we trained and validated a suite of machine learning algorithms – including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting – to predict subcanopy temperature deviations. 

Results demonstrate a robust capacity of these models to accurately forecast temperature differences, highlighting substantial spatial variability within European forests. Topographical features, such as slope and aspect, emerged as key predictors, substantially modulating microclimatic conditions. Furthermore, analysis revealed a discernible relationship between predicted temperature offsets and projected climate change scenarios, suggesting an amplification of existing microclimatic gradients. These findings underscore the importance of considering subcanopy microclimates in ecological modeling and conservation strategies, particularly as climate change continues to reshape European forest landscapes.
