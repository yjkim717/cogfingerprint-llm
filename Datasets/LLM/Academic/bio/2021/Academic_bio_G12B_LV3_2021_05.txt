**Abstract:**

The autumn and winter of 2021 witnessed a concerning surge in highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) detections across Europe, representing a significant escalation in avian influenza epidemiology. This report synthesizes surveillance data from September to December 2021, demonstrating widespread circulation of HPAI viruses impacting both domestic poultry and wild bird populations. The observed prevalence in wild birds, particularly migratory waterfowl, underscores their role as critical reservoirs and vectors for viral dissemination, facilitating the introduction and spread of HPAI across geographical boundaries.  Poultry farms experienced substantial outbreaks, leading to culling measures and highlighting vulnerabilities in existing biosecurity protocols.  Genomic analyses of circulating viruses revealed the emergence and proliferation of novel reassortant HPAI strains, characterized by unique combinations of gene segments from previously identified lineages.  Notably, preliminary phylogenetic investigations suggest potential adaptive mutations conferring increased transmissibility and, crucially, raising concerns regarding enhanced susceptibility and potential adaptation to mammalian hosts. This shift warrants intensified monitoring of mammalian populations, particularly mustelids and swine, which are known to be susceptible to avian influenza viruses. The rapid evolution and geographical spread of these reassortant viruses in 2021 necessitate a reevaluation of existing biosecurity strategies within the poultry industry and a strengthened, coordinated, pan-European surveillance network to mitigate the risk of zoonotic spillover and safeguard both animal and human health. Further research is urgently required to characterize the potential for mammalian adaptation and to develop effective countermeasures.
