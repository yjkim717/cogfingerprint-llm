**Abstract**

Endosomal trafficking represents a fundamental yet incompletely understood aspect of cellular organization.  Recent advances in live-cell imaging have revealed significant heterogeneity in endosome dynamics, prompting investigation into underlying transport mechanisms. This study employs a local analysis approach to characterize the movement of endosomes within mammalian cells, identifying distinct subpopulations exhibiting markedly different motility patterns.  Quantitative tracking data demonstrates a clear separation between slow-moving and fast-moving endosomes, suggesting a compartmentalized transport system.  We propose a novel mathematical framework utilizing fractional Brownian motion to model the anomalous diffusion observed in the slower-moving endosome population.  Specifically, the Hurst exponent, derived from the temporal correlation function of the observed trajectories, reveals a deviation from classical Brownian motion.  These findings highlight the importance of considering non-Gaussian transport processes when studying endosomal dynamics and provide a refined biophysical model for understanding cellular cargo delivery.
