During the autumn migration period of 2021, intensified surveillance systems across Europe documented an unprecedented geographical expansion of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, primarily involving H5Nx subtypes of the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/1996 (Gs/GD) lineage. This epidemiological investigation, conducted between September and December 2021, reveals a paradigm shift in HPAI ecology, characterized by persistent and widespread circulation within wild aquatic bird reservoirs, which subsequently functioned as a continuous source for incursions into domestic poultry populations. The scale of viral transmission underscored significant deficiencies in on-farm biosecurity protocols, with critical breakdowns in perimeter controls, hygiene practices, and segregation of wild and domestic avifauna facilitating frequent cross-species transmission events.

Genomic sequencing and phylodynamic analysis identified the emergence of novel reassortant viruses, possessing complex gene constellations derived from multiple low and high pathogenic precursors co-circulating in wild birds. These reassortants exhibited enhanced viral fitness in both wild and domestic species, complicating epidemiological tracking and control efforts. Crucially, specific reassortant genotypes were found to carry molecular markers associated with increased mammalian adaptation and potential for airborne transmission in experimental models. This genetic evolution directly amplified the zoonotic risk profile of the epizootic, posing a non-trivial threat of sporadic human infection, particularly among occupationally exposed individuals, and necessitating a re-evaluation of pandemic preparedness frameworks. The 2021 epizootic therefore represents a critical juncture in HPAI management, demonstrating the virus's endemic establishment in European wild birds and highlighting the urgent need for integrated One Health strategies that synchronize enhanced wild bird surveillance, robust and auditable biosecurity imperatives in the poultry sector, and proactive genomic risk assessment to mitigate the escalating threat of a zoonotic spillover event.
