**Abstract**

The accelerating accumulation of cancer genomics data, encompassing diverse omics layers (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics) and associated clinical metadata, presents a significant challenge for effective biological discovery. Addressing this challenge requires robust tools enabling integrative data visualization and analysis. This work highlights the utility of the UCSC Xena platform as a critical resource for the cancer research community. Xena, a publicly accessible web portal, facilitates the visual exploration and correlation analysis of large-scale genomic datasets derived from programs such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC).  By providing a user-friendly interface for integrating multi-omic data alongside clinical annotations, Xena empowers researchers to identify potential biomarkers, explore genotype-phenotype relationships, and generate novel hypotheses regarding cancer etiology and therapeutic response.  In 2021, Xena’s continued development and expanded data repositories have solidified its role as a cornerstone for translational cancer research, enabling researchers to move beyond single-omic analyses and leverage the power of integrated genomic data to drive advancements in precision oncology. Further, the platform’s accessibility promotes collaborative research and accelerates the pace of discovery within the field.
