In this study, we investigate the intracellular transport dynamics of endosomes, distinguishing between slow and fast-moving populations through quantitative trajectory analysis. Employing mean squared displacement (MSD) metrics, we demonstrate that both transport modes are characterized by heterogeneous anomalous diffusion, accurately modeled by fractional Brownian motion (fBM). Notably, we identify distinct local anomalous exponents governing each population: slow endosomes exhibit stronger anti-persistent motion, while fast endosomes display more persistent, directional movement. These findings challenge conventional classifications of intracellular transport mechanisms and suggest that fBM provides a unifying framework for describing endosomal motility heterogeneity. Our results, obtained in 2021, offer crucial insights into the physical principles underlying intracellular trafficking and its regulation, with implications for understanding cargo delivery and organelle dynamics in living cells.
