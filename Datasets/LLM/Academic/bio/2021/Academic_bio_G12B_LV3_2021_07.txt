**Abstract**

Understanding the nuanced relationship between microclimates and biodiversity within forested ecosystems is critical for predicting ecological responses to ongoing climate change. Lembrechts (2021) addressed this challenge by leveraging machine learning techniques to generate high-resolution maps of sub-canopy temperatures across European forests. This innovative approach demonstrated substantial divergence between microclimatic conditions, experienced at the forest floor, and broader macroclimatic patterns. These findings highlight the potential of spatially explicit temperature data to refine ecological models, improve predictions of species distributions, and ultimately enhance our ability to assess and mitigate the impacts of climate change on forest biodiversity. The study underscores the value of integrating advanced computational methods into ecological research.
