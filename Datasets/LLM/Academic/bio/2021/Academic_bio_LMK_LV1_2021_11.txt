Title: Unraveling the Molecular Response to GRF6019 in Alzheimer's Disease: A Deep Proteomics Analysis

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by multifaceted biological pathways. The plasma fraction has emerged as a promising source of biomarkers for AD diagnosis and monitoring treatment response. In this study, we employed deep proteomics to investigate the molecular effects of GRF6019, a therapeutic intervention, in the context of AD clinical trials (2021 cohort). Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we analyzed the plasma proteome of AD patients treated with GRF6019, identifying 1,500+ proteins with high confidence. Bioinformatics analysis revealed significant alterations in proteins associated with inflammation, lipid metabolism, and cellular stress response. Our findings provide novel insights into the biological pathways modulated by GRF6019, shedding light on its potential therapeutic mechanisms. This deep proteomics analysis demonstrates the power of comprehensive proteomic profiling in elucidating the complex molecular responses underlying AD pathology and treatment. The results have implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies and biomarker-driven clinical trials.
