**Abstract**

The latter half of 2021 marked a significant epidemiological shift in the panzootic of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), primarily driven by viruses of the A(H5N1) subtype. This period, spanning from September to December 2021, was characterized by an unprecedented and widespread surge in detections across Europe, signaling a transition from sporadic incursions to entrenched viral circulation within wild bird populations. The dominant viral lineage identified was clade 2.3.4.4b, whose enhanced fitness in a broad range of wild avian reservoirs, particularly waterfowl, facilitated a pervasive and continuous environmental viral load. This created a persistent epizootic pressure that fundamentally challenged existing biosecurity paradigms for the poultry sector.

The consequences of this sustained wild bird reservoir were acutely realized in the agricultural domain. Despite the implementation of standard biosecurity measures, numerous poultry farms experienced severe outbreaks, leading to substantial economic losses and necessitating large-scale culling operations. The high viral burden in the environment, combined with indirect transmission pathways such as contaminated water sources, fomites, and airborne dust, revealed critical vulnerabilities in conventional farm-level biosecurity protocols. This period underscored that measures sufficient for containing sporadic introductions were inadequate against the backdrop of constant, high-intensity viral pressure.

Concurrently, the dynamic evolution of the clade 2.3.4.4b viruses raised profound zoonotic concerns. Genomic surveillance identified the emergence of novel reassortant strains, which had acquired gene segments from other low-pathogenicity avian influenza viruses circulating in wild birds. These reassortment events have the potential to alter viral phenotypes, including receptor binding affinity, thermal stability, and pathogenicity in mammalian models. While sustained human-to-human transmission remained unobserved, the detection of these novel genotypes in a widely disseminated viral backbone heightened the assessment of zoonotic risk. The 2021 epidemiological situation in Europe, therefore, represented a critical juncture, highlighting the necessity for integrated One Health strategies that enhance surveillance in wild birds, reinforce adaptive biosecurity in poultry production, and rigorously assess the pandemic potential of emerging reassortants.
