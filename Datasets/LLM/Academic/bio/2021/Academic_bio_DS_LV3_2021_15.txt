**Abstract**

The metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells, a hallmark of carcinogenesis, is critically governed by oncogenic signaling pathways. In colorectal cancer (CRC), the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis has emerged as a pivotal regulator of tumorigenic metabolism, particularly through its induction of the Warburg effect—a shift towards aerobic glycolysis even in the presence of ample oxygen. This 2021 review synthesizes current evidence elucidating the mechanistic role of IGF-1 signaling in orchestrating this metabolic shift. We detail how IGF-1, upon binding its receptor (IGF-1R), robustly activates the canonical PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, a central driver of glycolytic metabolism. This activation promotes the increased expression and membrane localization of glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT1), enhances the activity of key glycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase 2, and stimulates *de novo* lipogenesis, thereby furnishing the biosynthetic precursors essential for rapid tumor proliferation. Furthermore, we explore the crosstalk between IGF-1 signaling and other oncogenic pathways, such as HIF-1α stabilization, which synergistically reinforces the glycolytic phenotype. The resultant metabolic dysregulation not only supports energy and biomass generation but also contributes to a tumor microenvironment conducive to invasion and metastasis. Given the prevalence of IGF-1 pathway hyperactivity in CRC, this review concludes by critically evaluating emerging therapeutic strategies that target this axis, including IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors of downstream effectors like mTOR. These approaches represent a promising frontier for disrupting the metabolic vulnerabilities of CRC cells and overcoming resistance to conventional therapies.
