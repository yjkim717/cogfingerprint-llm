Title: Assessing the Zoonotic Risk of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses in EU/EEA Countries and the UK: Implications for Biosecurity Measures

Abstract:

The ongoing circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in EU/EEA countries and the UK poses a significant threat to both the poultry industry and individuals occupationally exposed to these pathogens. As of 2021, the persistent presence of HPAI viruses in domestic and wild bird populations continues to drive the risk of zoonotic transmission, underscoring the need for stringent biosecurity measures to mitigate this threat. The epidemiology of HPAI is complex, with multiple factors influencing virus circulation, including animal husbandry practices, environmental factors, and the dynamics of wild bird populations. This study examines the current landscape of HPAI virus circulation in EU/EEA countries and the UK, with a particular focus on the zoonotic risk posed to individuals in close contact with infected poultry. We discuss the efficacy of current biosecurity measures in preventing virus transmission and highlight areas for improvement. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of a multi-faceted approach to HPAI control, incorporating enhanced surveillance, improved biosecurity protocols, and targeted public health interventions to minimize the risk of zoonotic transmission. By elucidating the complex interplay between HPAI virus circulation and zoonotic risk, this research informs evidence-based policy and practice for mitigating the impact of HPAI on both animal and human health.
