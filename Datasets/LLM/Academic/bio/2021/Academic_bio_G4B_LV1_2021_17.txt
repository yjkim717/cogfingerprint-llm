**Barriers to Psychiatric Engagement in Undergraduate Medical Students: A Preliminary Investigation in Central India (2021)**

The integration of robust psychiatric training into undergraduate medical curricula remains a persistent challenge globally. This study, conducted in central India during 2021, investigated the prevalence and nature of engagement with formal psychiatric education among undergraduate medical students (MBBS) within a predominantly rural setting. Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey assessing student attitudes, perceived barriers, and reported participation in dedicated psychiatric modules. Findings revealed a significantly disproportionate lack of engagement, with a majority of surveyed students (78%) reporting minimal or no formal psychiatric training. 

Key identified barriers encompassed limited faculty expertise, insufficient time allocation within the core curriculum, and a prevailing stigma associated with mental health issues within the student cohort and broader community. Furthermore, logistical constraints – including geographical distance and limited access to specialized resources – were reported as significant impediments. These results highlight a critical gap in preparedness amongst future physicians, potentially impacting the delivery of comprehensive patient care.  Further research is warranted to explore targeted interventions and curriculum modifications designed to foster greater student interest and competency in addressing the growing burden of mental illness within the region and informing broader educational policy.
