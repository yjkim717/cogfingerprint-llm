**Genome Editing of *Pleurotus ostreatus* via CRISPR-Cas9 System for Enhanced Resilience**

Precise genome modification represents a burgeoning strategy for enhancing the traits of commercially significant fungi. This study reports the successful implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene mutagenesis within *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom) to generate novel, non-genetically modified (non-GM) strains exhibiting enhanced resilience. Utilizing a targeted approach, we engineered specific loci within the *P. ostreatus* genome, demonstrating efficient homology-directed repair and subsequent gene disruption. Preliminary analyses revealed significant phenotypic alterations correlated with targeted gene modifications, including improved resistance to common fungal pathogens and altered substrate utilization profiles. These findings highlight the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 technology to facilitate rapid, targeted improvements in *P. ostreatus* cultivation without reliance on traditional genetic engineering techniques. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms underlying these observed changes is warranted to fully elucidate the impact of these non-GM modifications on mushroom yield and quality.
