**Abstract**

The year 2021 witnessed a concerning escalation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), specifically the HPAI variant, across continental Europe and the United Kingdom, impacting both domestic poultry populations and increasingly, wild bird reservoirs. This widespread emergence underscored critical vulnerabilities within existing biosecurity protocols and necessitated immediate adaptive strategies. Surveillance data revealed significant interspecies transmission, with wild bird populations acting as notable vectors for viral propagation.  Consequently, implementing enhanced biosecurity measures – including stringent farm sanitation and movement controls – became paramount. Furthermore, a reduction in poultry density was strategically employed to limit viral spread and facilitate more effective disease containment.  Preliminary investigations also explored the feasibility of targeted vaccination programs, acknowledging the evolving nature of circulating viral lineages and the need for proactive mitigation.  Future research must prioritize genomic surveillance to characterize emerging HPAI variants and inform the development of durable, preventative control measures, safeguarding both the poultry industry and wider biodiversity.
