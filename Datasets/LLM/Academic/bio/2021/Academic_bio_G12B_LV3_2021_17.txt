**Abstract**

This study, conducted in a central Indian medical institution in 2021, investigated attendance patterns amongst undergraduate medical students undertaking psychiatric training within the MBBS curriculum. Findings revealed a concerningly low average attendance rate, significantly impacting the efficacy of psychiatric education. A qualitative analysis suggests that the absence of dedicated summative assessments specifically evaluating psychiatric knowledge and skills, coupled with the lack of integrated attendance monitoring across the broader MBBS program, contribute substantially to this issue. The current curricular structure appears to de-prioritize consistent engagement with psychiatric content. These observations highlight a critical need for pedagogical reform. Specifically, the implementation of targeted psychiatric examinations and the incorporation of a holistic attendance policy across all clinical rotations are recommended to improve student engagement and ensure adequate competency development in this vital medical specialty. Further research should explore the impact of faculty attitudes and resource availability on student attendance.
