**Abstract**

The reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a recognized hallmark of cancer, with the Warburg effect—a propensity for glycolysis even under aerobic conditions—being particularly prevalent in colorectal cancer (CRC). A key driver of this metabolic shift is the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling axis. This review synthesizes contemporary evidence to delineate the mechanistic role of IGF-1 in promoting glycolytic metabolism and tumor progression in CRC. We posit that upon binding to its receptor (IGF-1R), IGF-1 activates the canonical PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism. This activation orchestrates the Warburg effect through multiple mechanisms: by enhancing the cell surface expression of glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT1), upregulating key glycolytic enzymes (e.g., HK2, LDHA), and inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation. The resultant metabolic reprogramming provides ample macromolecular precursors and energy to support rapid proliferation, survival, and metastasis of CRC cells. Furthermore, we explore the therapeutic implications of this axis. We discuss emerging preclinical and clinical strategies from the 2020-2021 period aimed at targeting IGF-1 signaling, either directly with monoclonal antibodies or indirectly through downstream mTOR inhibitors, to disrupt this critical metabolic vulnerability. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of the IGF-1-Warburg effect nexus is crucial for developing novel, metabolism-focused therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes for patients with colorectal cancer.
