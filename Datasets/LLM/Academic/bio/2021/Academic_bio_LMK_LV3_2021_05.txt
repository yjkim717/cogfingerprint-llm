Title: Assessing the Zoonotic Risk of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus Circulation in Europe during the 2021 Autumn Season

Abstract:

The ongoing circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses in European poultry populations poses a significant threat to both the poultry industry and individuals with occupational exposure. Between September and December 2021, Europe experienced a notable persistence of HPAI viruses, underscoring the need for enhanced biosecurity measures to mitigate the risk of virus transmission. This study examines the epidemiological dynamics of HPAI virus circulation during the 2021 autumn season in Europe, with a particular focus on the zoonotic risk associated with the virus.

Our analysis reveals that the sustained circulation of HPAI viruses in European poultry populations during the autumn of 2021 was characterized by a complex interplay of factors, including the introduction of new virus strains, the persistence of existing strains, and the role of wild birds in virus transmission. The phylogenetic analysis of HPAI virus isolates from poultry outbreaks and wild bird surveillance during this period indicates a high degree of genetic diversity, suggesting multiple introductions of the virus into poultry populations.

The enhanced biosecurity measures implemented in European poultry farms during the 2021 autumn season, including improved farm hygiene, restricted farm access, and enhanced surveillance, were critical in reducing the number of HPAI virus outbreaks. However, the persistence of the virus in wild bird populations and the continued risk of transmission to poultry highlight the need for sustained vigilance and the development of more effective biosecurity strategies.

Occupationally exposed individuals, including poultry farm workers and veterinarians, remain at heightened risk of HPAI virus infection due to their close contact with infected birds. The risk of zoonotic transmission is further exacerbated by the high viral loads associated with HPAI virus infection in poultry. As such, it is essential to maintain rigorous personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols and provide regular training on HPAI virus infection control measures to minimize the risk of transmission.

In conclusion, the circulation of HPAI viruses in Europe during the 2021 autumn season highlights the need for continued vigilance and enhanced biosecurity measures to mitigate the risk of virus transmission to both poultry and humans. Our findings underscore the importance of a multi-faceted approach to HPAI virus control, including improved farm biosecurity, enhanced surveillance, and targeted public health interventions to minimize the zoonotic risk associated with HPAI virus infection.
