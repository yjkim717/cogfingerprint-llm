**Abstract**

The Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling axis is a critical regulator of cellular proliferation and survival, and its dysregulation is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC). A key metabolic adaptation in CRC oncogenesis is the Warburg effect, wherein cancer cells preferentially undergo aerobic glycolysis, even in oxygen-rich conditions, to fuel biosynthetic pathways. This review synthesizes contemporary evidence elucidating the mechanistic role of IGF-1 in orchestrating this metabolic reprogramming. We posit that upon ligand binding, the IGF-1 receptor initiates a canonical signaling cascade, predominantly through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway. This activation promotes the Warburg effect through multiple convergent mechanisms: Akt directly enhances membrane translocation of glucose transporters (e.g., GLUT1), augments the activity of rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes such as hexokinase 2, and stimulates HIF-1Î±-mediated transcription of glycolytic genes. The resultant metabolic shift provides ample glycolytic intermediates for anabolic processes, thereby supporting rapid tumor growth and conferring a survival advantage. Furthermore, we explore the therapeutic implications of this nexus. The persistent challenges in directly targeting IGF-1R have shifted focus toward downstream effectors, with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and specific Akt antagonists emerging as promising strategies to disrupt this oncogenic metabolic network. This review underscores that targeting the IGF-1-PI3K/Akt/mTOR-glucose metabolism axis represents a viable avenue for overcoming metabolic plasticity and therapeutic resistance in advanced colorectal carcinomas.
