Of particular interest in cellular biology is the intricate regulation of intracellular transport, a process essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. While endosomal trafficking is known to exhibit anomalous diffusion, a comprehensive characterization of its heterogeneous nature has remained elusive. In this study, we quantitatively analyze the trajectories of endosomes within living cells to elucidate their underlying motility mechanisms. Employing a local analysis framework, we demonstrate that both slow and fast-moving endosome subpopulations are accurately modeled by heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion. Crucially, these distinct populations are characterized by unique local anomalous diffusion exponents and diffusion coefficients, revealing a previously unappreciated complexity in their dynamical behavior. This finding suggests that different molecular regulators or physical constraints govern the motion within each subpopulation. Our results, obtained in 2021, provide a refined physical model for intracellular transport phenomena and establish a foundation for investigating how perturbations to specific trafficking pathways manifest in these distinct motile states.
