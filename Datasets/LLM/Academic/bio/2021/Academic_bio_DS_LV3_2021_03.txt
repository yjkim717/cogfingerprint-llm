The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized genetic manipulation in higher eukaryotes, yet its application in basidiomycete fungi, particularly edible mushrooms, has remained limited. This study establishes a robust and highly efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system for targeted genome editing in the industrially significant edible fungus *Pleurotus ostreatus* (oyster mushroom). We demonstrate successful Cas9-gRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex delivery via protoplast transformation, achieving precise targeted mutagenesis through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) at the *fah* gene locus, confirmed by deep sequencing. Furthermore, we report the first successful application of homology-directed repair (HDR) in this species, facilitating precise allele replacement. This dual-capacity for both mutagenesis and precise editing overcomes a major bottleneck in *Pleurotus* functional genomics. Critically, the transient nature of RNP delivery enables the generation of edited strains devoid of foreign DNA, aligning with regulatory frameworks for non-genetically modified (non-GM) organism classification. These findings, published in 2021, provide a transformative genetic toolkit that accelerates both fundamental research and the development of novel, commercially viable non-GM *Pleurotus* strains with enhanced agronomic traits.
