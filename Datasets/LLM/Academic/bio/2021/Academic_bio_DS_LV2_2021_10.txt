**Abstract**

The development of covalent inhibitors necessitates robust methods to assess their proteome-wide selectivity, a critical determinant of therapeutic efficacy and off-target toxicity. Current profiling strategies often lack the systematic comparison required to delineate the inherent reactivity of diverse electrophilic chemotypes. To address this, we established an unbiased, competitive proteomics workflow for the direct, parallel evaluation of 54 electrophilic probes. This platform enabled comprehensive profiling of ligandable residues, targeting nine distinct amino acid side chains and protein N-termini across the human proteome. Our findings systematically map the intrinsic reactivity and selectivity landscapes of these electrophiles, revealing nuanced preferences for specific nucleophilic residues. This large-scale comparative analysis provides an indispensable resource for rational covalent inhibitor design, offering a strategic framework to prioritize electrophilic warheads with enhanced selectivity, thereby accelerating the development of targeted covalent chemical probes and therapeutics.
