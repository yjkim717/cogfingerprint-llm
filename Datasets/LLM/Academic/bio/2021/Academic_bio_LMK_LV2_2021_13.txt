Title: SpatialViz: Unveiling Spatial Relationships in Multiplexed Tissue Images at Single-Cell Resolution

Abstract:
The advent of imaging mass cytometry has enabled the generation of multiplexed tissue images with single-cell granularity, facilitating the analysis of protein profiles in complex tissues. However, deciphering the spatial relationships between cells remains a significant challenge. In response, we introduce SpatialViz, a comprehensive suite of algorithms designed to elucidate the spatial organization of cells in multiplexed tissue images. Applied to healthy and diseased tonsil tissue samples, SpatialViz enables the quantification of cellular interactions and spatial patterns at the single-cell level. By analyzing protein profiles and spatial distributions, SpatialViz reveals novel insights into the tissue microenvironment. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of SpatialViz in uncovering previously unappreciated spatial relationships, providing a powerful tool for understanding tissue biology and disease pathology. As a cutting-edge analytical framework, SpatialViz has far-reaching implications for the field of bioimaging and tissue research, as evidenced by its application to 2021 datasets.
