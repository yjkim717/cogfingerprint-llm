In this 2021 study, we investigate the complex anomalous diffusion patterns of intracellular endosome transport through advanced single-particle tracking and local analysis techniques. By systematically categorizing endosome trajectories into distinct subpopulations—slow subdiffusive and fast superdiffusive motions—we demonstrate that heterogeneous fractional Brownian motion provides the optimal theoretical framework for characterizing these dynamics. Our analysis reveals that local anomalous exponents follow exponential distributions, while generalized diffusion coefficients exhibit power law scaling, indicating multifractal behavior within living cells. These findings fundamentally advance our understanding of intracellular transport mechanisms by establishing that endosome movement operates through a continuum of diffusional states rather than discrete modes. The identification of these statistical signatures provides crucial insights into cytoplasmic organization and the energetic constraints governing vesicular transport, with significant implications for modeling intracellular trafficking in both normal physiological and pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and intracellular pathogen dissemination.
