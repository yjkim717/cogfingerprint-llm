**Title:** Disentangling Sources of Transcriptional Noise through Single-Molecule Quantification and Continuous-Discrete Stochastic Modeling

**Abstract:**

Transcriptional noise, a primary driver of non-genetic cellular heterogeneity, arises from the inherent stochasticity of gene expression. A central, unresolved question is the extent to which this noise originates from discrete, promoter-intrinsic bursting events versus continuous, system-wide fluctuations in the transcription rate. To address this, we developed a class of interpretable, continuous-discrete hybrid models that explicitly partition noise sources. These models integrate a continuous, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to represent the stochastic variation in the effective transcription rate—capturing influences from factors like chromatin remodeling and resource availability—with a discrete Poisson counting process for mRNA production. We derived exact analytical solutions for the steady-state RNA copy number distributions predicted by these models, enabling direct comparison with single-molecule fluorescence *in situ* hybridization (smFISH) data. Our analysis reveals that higher-order moments of the empirical distribution, particularly the skewness and kurtosis, are powerful discriminants between competing hypotheses. We demonstrate that conventional metrics like the Fano factor are often insufficient, as distinct mechanistic models can produce identical variance-to-mean relationships. By applying our framework to published single-cell transcriptomic datasets, we show that a model incorporating a slowly fluctuating continuous rate outperforms pure bursty models for a subset of housekeeping genes. This work provides a rigorous, model-based foundation for designing and interpreting single-molecule quantification experiments, moving beyond descriptive noise characterization towards the identification of specific underlying biophysical mechanisms.
