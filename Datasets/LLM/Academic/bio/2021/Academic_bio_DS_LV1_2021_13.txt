**Abstract**

The advent of multiplexed tissue imaging technologies, such as Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC), has enabled the high-dimensional quantification of protein expression at single-cell resolution while preserving crucial spatial context. However, a significant bottleneck remains the computational visualization and intuitive interpretation of this complex, spatially resolved protein data. Here, we present SpatialViz, a novel analytical framework designed to address this challenge. Using IMC data derived from human tonsil tissue—spanning both healthy architectures and disease-perturbed microenvironments—we demonstrate that SpatialViz facilitates the direct visualization of cellular neighborhoods and signaling gradients. Our tool integrates single-cell segmentation data with spatial coordinate information, enabling researchers to move beyond traditional scatter plots and interrogate tissue organization in its native morphological layout. We validate SpatialViz by recapitulating known tonsil microanatomy, such as distinct B-cell and T-cell zones, and further uncover novel spatial relationships in diseased states. By bridging the gap between high-parameter single-cell data and its spatial embedding, SpatialViz provides an indispensable platform for hypothesis generation in immunology and oncology, offering profound insights into cellular interactions within the tissue milieu.
