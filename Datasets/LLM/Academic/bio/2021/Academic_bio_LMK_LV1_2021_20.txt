Title: Disentangling the Complexities of Forest Microclimates: High-Resolution Insights into Sub-Canopy Temperature Dynamics

Abstract:

Forests harbour a disproportionate amount of global biodiversity, and their microclimates play a crucial role in maintaining the delicate balance of ecosystems. As climate change intensifies, understanding the nuances of forest microclimates is essential for predicting and mitigating its impacts on forest biodiversity. Recent studies have highlighted the disconnect between macroclimatic variables and sub-canopy temperatures, underscoring the need for high-resolution temperature data. In this study, we generated high-resolution (25 m × 25 m) temperature maps for European forest understories using a combination of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms. Our results reveal significant differences between sub-canopy and free-air temperatures, with temperature offsets ranging from -5°C to +3°C. We found that forest structural attributes, such as canopy density and tree height, exerted a strong influence on sub-canopy temperature dynamics. Furthermore, our analysis showed that macroclimatic variables, such as temperature and precipitation, were poor predictors of sub-canopy temperatures, highlighting the importance of local-scale factors in shaping forest microclimates. Our study provides novel insights into the complexities of forest microclimates and has significant implications for understanding the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems. By elucidating the drivers of sub-canopy temperature dynamics, our research can inform strategies for conserving and managing forest biodiversity in a rapidly changing climate. As such, this study contributes to the growing body of research emphasizing the importance of microclimate research in the context of global change.
