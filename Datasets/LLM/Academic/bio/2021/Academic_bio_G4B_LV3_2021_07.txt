**Abstract**

Understanding forest microclimates is increasingly crucial in the context of accelerating climate change and its impacts on European ecosystems. This research investigates the spatial variability of subcanopy temperatures within European forests, employing machine learning techniques to generate detailed, high-resolution maps. Traditional macroclimatic data frequently fails to capture the nuanced thermal heterogeneity experienced by forest understories. Our analysis demonstrates a marked divergence between predicted and observed subcanopy temperatures, indicating significant microclimatic variation driven by factors such as canopy structure, topography, and species composition. These findings underscore the need for incorporating finer-scale thermal data into predictive models of forest response to climate change.  Specifically, the application of machine learning offers a powerful tool for quantifying and mapping these critical forest microclimates, informing targeted conservation and management strategies.
