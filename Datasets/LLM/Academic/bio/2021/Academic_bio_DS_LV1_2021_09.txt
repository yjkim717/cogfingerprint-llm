**Title:** Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteomic Subtypes Precede Amyloid Pathology and Predict Divergent Trajectories in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease

**Abstract**

The prevailing amyloid cascade hypothesis posits amyloid-beta (Aβ) accumulation as the initiating event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a significant proportion of cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals exhibit AD-like neurodegeneration in the absence of amyloid pathology, suggesting alternative pathogenic initiators. Utilizing high-resolution mass spectrometry, we profiled the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome of 450 CU individuals from a longitudinal cohort, all of whom were amyloid-negative by PET imaging at baseline. Unsupervised clustering of proteomic signatures revealed three distinct subtypes, challenging the notion of a monolithic preclinical phase. Subtype 1 was characterized by a profile of neuronal hyperplasticity and synaptogenesis, marked by elevated levels of neurogranin and GAP-43. Subtype 2 exhibited pronounced blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, indicated by altered ratios of platelet-derived growth factor receptor β to albumin. Subtype 3 displayed a robust innate immune activation signature, with elevated complement factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Longitudinal follow-up revealed that each subtype was associated with a significantly increased risk of progressing to amyloid-positive status and subsequent cognitive decline compared to a proteomically normal group, yet via divergent trajectories. These findings, established prior to detectable amyloidosis, provide compelling evidence that heterogeneous biological processes—including dysregulated plasticity, BBB impairment, and neuroinflammation—constitute primary vulnerabilities that may predispose specific individuals to AD. This re-conceptualization of preclinical AD has profound implications for the development of personalized, subtype-specific preventive therapies.
