**Abstract**

Transcriptional noise, characterized by stochastic fluctuations in mRNA production, represents a fundamental limitation in understanding gene regulation. Traditional approaches to quantifying transcriptional activity often mask these inherent variations, hindering accurate assessment of regulatory mechanisms. This study introduces a framework for developing interpretable stochastic differential equation (SDE) models to explicitly characterize transcriptional noise at the single-molecule level. Leveraging recent advances in single-molecule quantification techniques, we demonstrate the utility of these models in dissecting regulatory fluctuations impacting RNA splicing. 

A core challenge lies in distinguishing between intrinsic noise and spurious signals arising from experimental artifacts. Our approach incorporates Bayesian inference to simultaneously evaluate competing hypotheses regarding the source of observed variability.  Specifically, we detail a methodology for modeling the interplay between stochastic transcription dynamics and potential regulatory biases.  The resultant SDEs offer a robust means to design targeted experiments, optimizing sensitivity to capture nuanced regulatory events and ultimately improving our comprehension of gene expression control.  Further validation through simulated and potentially experimental data is warranted.
