**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of inflammatory conditions within the oral microbiome necessitates advanced methods for characterizing disease heterogeneity and spatial organization at the cellular level. This study presents SpatialViz, a novel algorithmic framework designed to facilitate the visualization and quantitative analysis of single-cell pathology within multiplexed tissue imaging data, specifically applied to the investigation of tonsillitis. Utilizing imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data acquired from healthy and diseased tonsillar tissue, SpatialViz leverages a multi-stage process encompassing spectral unmixing, spatial registration, and dimensionality reduction to generate spatially resolved cell-type profiles. 

Our approach overcomes limitations inherent in traditional, planar analysis by preserving the critical three-dimensional context of cell interactions within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate SpatialViz’s efficacy in identifying distinct cellular populations – including lymphocytes, macrophages, and epithelial cells – and mapping their spatial distribution relative to pathological lesions.  Preliminary findings reveal significant alterations in cellular composition and organization in tonsils exhibiting signs of tonsillitis, suggesting a disruption of immune homeostasis. 

The algorithm’s output provides a powerful tool for single-cell pathology, offering unprecedented spatial visualization capabilities for understanding disease mechanisms and potentially guiding targeted therapeutic interventions. Further research will focus on validating SpatialViz across diverse tissue types and disease models.
