**Abstract**

Recent investigations into intracellular trafficking have revealed significant heterogeneity in endosomal dynamics within eukaryotic cells. This study, published in 2021, employs single-particle tracking techniques to characterize these diverse movement patterns, differentiating between endosomes exhibiting subdiffusive behavior and those displaying superdiffusive transport.  Analysis utilizing local fluctuation methods demonstrates that a substantial proportion of endosomes operate according to a model of fractional Brownian motion, suggesting a departure from purely diffusive trajectories.  Specifically, we propose a refined model incorporating ‘fractional’ characteristics to better explain the observed deviations from standard Brownian motion.  These findings challenge conventional understandings of vesicular transport and underscore the importance of considering heterogeneous dynamics at the nanoscale. Further research will explore the biophysical mechanisms driving this fractional Brownian motion and its implications for endosomal sorting and cellular function.
