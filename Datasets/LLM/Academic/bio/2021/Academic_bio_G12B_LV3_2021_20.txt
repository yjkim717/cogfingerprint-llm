**Abstract**

Understanding microclimatic variation within forest ecosystems is crucial for predicting species responses to ongoing climate change. Lembrechts (2021) introduced a novel approach leveraging machine learning to generate high-resolution maps of forest understory temperatures across Europe. This methodology focused on predicting the ‘temperature offset,’ the difference between sub-canopy and ambient air temperatures, revealing substantial spatial heterogeneity previously uncharacterized at such fine scales. The resulting maps offer a significant advancement for biological modeling, enabling improved simulations of physiological processes and more accurate projections of species distributions under altered climatic conditions. This work highlights the potential of data-driven approaches to enhance our understanding of forest microclimates and their role in maintaining biodiversity.
