Understanding the influence of microclimatic conditions on ecological processes is crucial for predicting species distributions and assessing biodiversity vulnerability, particularly within the context of ongoing climate change. While macroclimatic data provides a broad overview of regional temperature regimes, the thermal environment experienced by understory organisms within forest ecosystems can deviate substantially. This study investigates the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest sub-canopy temperatures across Europe, leveraging a novel machine learning approach to generate high-resolution predictive maps. We utilized a comprehensive dataset incorporating macroclimatic variables (temperature, precipitation, solar radiation), topographical features, and forest structural characteristics (canopy height, leaf area index) to train a suite of gradient boosting algorithms.  Model performance, evaluated using cross-validation techniques, demonstrated a significant ability to accurately predict sub-canopy temperatures, revealing substantial discrepancies compared to interpolated macroclimate data.  Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating fine-scale thermal heterogeneity into biodiversity models, demonstrating that reliance solely on macroclimatic variables can lead to inaccurate predictions of species habitat suitability and potential range shifts. Specifically, we observed a consistent underestimation of sub-canopy cooling effects by macroclimate-only models, particularly in dense, structurally complex forests.  These results underscore the necessity for integrating microclimatic proxies into ecological forecasting and provide a framework for improving biodiversity conservation strategies in a rapidly changing climate.  The developed machine learning methodology offers a scalable solution for mapping forest microclimates across large geographic areas, facilitating more precise assessments of ecological vulnerability.
