**Abstract**

**Prevalence and Potential Etiology of Suboptimal Attendance in Psychiatric Training Amongst Medical Students in Central India: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study**

**Background:** Adequate exposure to psychiatric principles and clinical practice is crucial for developing competent medical professionals. However, consistent engagement in psychiatric training rotations frequently proves challenging, particularly in resource-constrained settings. This study aimed to quantify attendance rates within psychiatric training modules of the MBBS curriculum in central India and to explore potential contributing factors, specifically focusing on the interplay between assessment structures and attendance policies.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional observational study was conducted amongst medical students (n=XXX – *replace with actual sample size*) undertaking psychiatric rotations within a cluster of medical colleges located in central India during the 2020-2021 academic year. Attendance data were collected retrospectively for mandatory clinical postings and didactic sessions. Student attendance records were analyzed to determine overall attendance rates and identify patterns of absenteeism.  Qualitative data, gathered via brief, anonymous surveys exploring perceptions of the value of assessments and the rigidity of attendance policies, were utilized to triangulate quantitative findings.

**Results:**  Analysis revealed a significant proportion of students (XX% - *replace with actual percentage*) exhibiting attendance rates below the institutionally mandated threshold of 80%.  A notable correlation was observed between the absence of high-stakes, summative examinations directly evaluating psychiatric content and lower attendance figures. Students’ survey responses indicated a perception that attendance was often prioritized over active learning and that the lack of direct assessment incentivized minimal engagement.

**Conclusion:**  The observed suboptimal attendance in psychiatric training within the studied MBBS course suggests a potential deficiency in the integration of assessment strategies. The flexible attendance policies, when coupled with a limited assessment focus, may inadvertently contribute to reduced student engagement. Targeted interventions, including incorporating formative assessments and revising attendance policies to promote active participation, are warranted to optimize psychiatric education and ensure future physicians possess adequate competence in mental health care. Further research is recommended to explore longitudinal impacts of these interventions.
