**Abstract**

Intracellular transport is a fundamental process governed by complex, heterogeneous interactions between cargo vesicles and the dynamic cytoskeletal network. While the anomalous nature of endosomal motion is established, a comprehensive characterization of its heterogeneous dynamics remains a challenge. In this study, we employ single-particle tracking with high spatiotemporal resolution to analyze the trajectories of early and late endosomes in living cells. Our analysis reveals that both populations exhibit fractional Brownian motion (FBM), yet with profound heterogeneity. We identify distinct subpopulations characterized by their local anomalous diffusion exponent (Î±) and effective diffusion coefficient (D). Crucially, we demonstrate that these parameters are not static but fluctuate along individual trajectories, indicating transient changes in the underlying biophysical state. This local heterogeneity is further corroborated by calculating the time-dependent velocity auto-correlation function, which reveals persistent anti-correlated motion for some vesicles and uncorrelated or positively correlated motion for others. Our findings suggest that the transport of endosomes is not a single stochastic process but a superposition of multiple, transient mechanical interactions with the cytoskeleton, providing a more nuanced framework for modeling intracellular trafficking.
