In 2021, B. Tijms and colleagues conducted a pivotal investigation into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteomic architecture of cognitively unimpaired, amyloid-negative individuals, revealing distinct molecular subtypes with significant implications for Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) predisposition. This research identified three reproducible CSF proteomic profiles that are predictive of AD pathology, despite the absence of detectable amyloid burden in these asymptomatic subjects. The presence of these subtypes suggests that specific proteomic dysregulations may precede and potentially contribute to the development of AD, challenging the conventional amyloid-centric model of disease initiation.

Utilizing high-throughput mass spectrometry, the study delineated subtypes characterized by distinct protein abundance patterns, implicating disparate biological processes including synaptic dysfunction, innate immune activation, and protein homeostasis disruption. These proteomic signatures serve as potential pre-amyloid biomarkers, offering a novel framework for understanding the earliest molecular events in AD pathogenesis. The findings underscore the heterogeneity of AD predisposition and highlight the utility of CSF proteomics in stratifying individuals at risk beyond amyloid status alone.

This work fundamentally advances the conceptualization of AD onset, proposing that divergent molecular pathways may converge clinically. It establishes a critical foundation for developing targeted, subtype-specific preventive strategies and underscores the necessity of incorporating proteomic subtyping into future AD biomarker research and clinical trial design for asymptomatic populations.
