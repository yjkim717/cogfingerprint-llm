**Abstract**

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is frequently associated with aberrant glucose metabolism, a phenomenon often termed the Warburg effect. Recent investigations suggest that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling plays a pivotal, yet complex, role in both the development and progression of CRC. This review synthesizes emerging evidence demonstrating a direct link between elevated IGF-1 levels, disrupted glucose homeostasis, and the intensified Warburg effect observed in CRC cells. Specifically, we examine how IGF-1 signaling promotes glycolysis and lactate production, contributing to tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, we explore the potential of targeting IGF-1 pathways as a therapeutic intervention to restore normal glucose metabolism and mitigate the oncogenic effects within CRC. Future research should prioritize elucidating the specific molecular mechanisms driving this interaction to inform the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies.
