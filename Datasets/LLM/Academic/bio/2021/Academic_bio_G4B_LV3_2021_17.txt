**Abstract**

This study examines attendance patterns within undergraduate medical students pursuing psychiatry training in Central India during 2021. Analysis of data from government-aided and private medical schools revealed concerning levels of non-attendance, with 27% of students in government institutions and 33% in private institutions failing to participate in designated psychiatry training sessions.  The primary cited barriers to engagement included the absence of dedicated assessment mechanisms for psychiatric skills and a perceived misalignment of attendance expectations with the demands of core medical curricula.  These findings suggest a critical gap in the provision of specialized training within the MBBS program. Addressing this deficiency through targeted curriculum revisions – incorporating dedicated evaluation methods and integrating psychiatry attendance requirements more effectively – is essential to cultivate a competent and adequately trained physician workforce capable of meeting the growing mental health needs within the region.
