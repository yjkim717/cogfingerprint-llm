**Abstract**

Transcriptional noise – the stochasticity in gene expression arising from inherent randomness in the transcription process – poses a significant challenge to our understanding of cellular regulation and phenotypic diversity. While substantial progress has been made in characterizing this noise, disentangling the underlying mechanisms driving it remains a key goal. This study addresses this challenge by presenting a suite of interpretable and computationally tractable mathematical models designed to facilitate the experimental design and interpretation of single-molecule transcriptional measurements. We focus on explicitly modeling stochasticity in transcriptional rates, recognizing that variations in polymerase activity contribute significantly to overall mRNA copy number fluctuations.

Our framework incorporates both continuous and discrete representations of the transcription process, allowing for a flexible exploration of different hypotheses concerning the nature of transcriptional rate variability. Specifically, we examine scenarios ranging from constant, yet stochastic, rates to rates modulated by regulatory elements. Through simulations and analytical considerations, we demonstrate how specific experimental designs – including measurements of mRNA burst kinetics and inter-burst times – can be used to distinguish between these models. The presented models offer a valuable tool for researchers seeking to rigorously test competing hypotheses about transcription rate dynamics, ultimately advancing our ability to predict and control gene expression in biological systems. The methodology is particularly relevant to the increasing availability of high-resolution single-molecule quantification techniques.
