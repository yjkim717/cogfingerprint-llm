**Abstract:**

Transcriptional noise, the stochasticity inherent in gene expression despite identical genetic and environmental conditions, poses a significant challenge to understanding cellular regulation and phenotypic diversity. While numerous models have attempted to capture this phenomenon, many lack interpretability or computational tractability, hindering their utility in experimental design and hypothesis testing. Here, we present a novel framework for modeling transcriptional noise, focusing on the distinction between continuous and discrete representations of stochastic transcription rates. Our approach integrates mathematical analysis with single-molecule quantification principles to facilitate the rigorous comparison of competing hypotheses regarding the origin of transcriptional variability.

We develop a series of continuous-time and discrete-time models incorporating varying degrees of transcriptional burstiness and promoter activation dynamics. Crucially, we derive analytical expressions for key output statistics, including mean expression levels and the temporal autocorrelation of mRNA transcripts, allowing for direct prediction of experimental outcomes. This contrasts with purely simulation-based approaches, enabling efficient parameter estimation and model validation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these models can be used to design informative single-cell experiments, specifically targeting the quantification of mRNA molecule numbers over time. Through a comparative analysis of model predictions, we identify experimental strategies capable of discriminating between scenarios where transcription rate fluctuations are driven by intrinsic promoter stochasticity versus extrinsic regulatory influences. This work provides a powerful tool for researchers seeking to dissect the complex origins of transcriptional noise and ultimately, to engineer more predictable and robust biological systems.
