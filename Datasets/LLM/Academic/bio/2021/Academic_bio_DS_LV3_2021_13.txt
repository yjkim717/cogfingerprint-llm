Abstract

The integration of multiplexed tissue imaging with single-cell resolution has revolutionized pathological assessment, yet computational tools for quantifying complex cellular ecosystems remain limited. Here, we present SpatialViz, an analytical suite designed for spatially resolved, single-cell data from platforms such as Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). By applying SpatialViz to human tonsil tissue—spanning healthy and diseased states—we demonstrate its capacity to decode intricate protein expression landscapes and neighborhood interactions. Our methodology enables the precise quantification of cellular colocalization, spatial clustering, and ligand-receptor proximity, thereby uncovering microenvironmental determinants of immune organization and dysregulation. In diseased tonsils, SpatialViz revealed altered spatial relationships among T cell subsets and stromal cells, implicating disrupted communication networks in pathogenesis. This tool provides a robust framework for single-cell pathology, transforming multidimensional imaging data into actionable biological insights. As of 2021, SpatialViz stands as a critical resource for advancing spatial systems biology, with broad applicability to inflammatory diseases and cancer immunotherapy research.
