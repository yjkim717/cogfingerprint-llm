**Abstract: Spatiotemporal Variability in Subcanopy Temperature Offsets within European Forest Ecosystems – A Machine Learning Approach**

Understanding microclimatic conditions is crucial for predicting forest dynamics and assessing vulnerability to climate change. This study investigates the spatial heterogeneity of subcanopy temperature offsets within European forests, employing machine learning techniques to generate predictive maps and quantify observed variability. Utilizing data collected in 2021 across a range of forest types, we hypothesized that subcanopy temperatures deviate significantly from established macroclimatic averages due to complex interactions within the forest canopy. 

We implemented a Random Forest model, trained on a dataset incorporating environmental variables including canopy height, aspect, and solar radiation, to predict temperature offsets – the difference between subcanopy and ambient air temperatures.  Results demonstrate substantial spatial variation in these offsets, with localized ‘hotspots’ exhibiting significantly elevated temperatures.  Specifically, we identified a strong correlation between temperature offset and canopy openness, suggesting that increased light penetration contributes to higher subcanopy temperatures. 

The generated maps reveal a complex mosaic of microclimatic conditions, highlighting the need to move beyond coarse macroclimatic assessments. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating detailed microclimate data into forest ecological models and inform targeted conservation strategies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change on European forest ecosystems. Further research will investigate the influence of forest structure and species composition on these observed temperature patterns.
