**Abstract**

This study investigated the proteomic landscape of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) progression and therapeutic response within the context of two clinical trials evaluating GRF6019. Utilizing deep plasma proteomics, we identified dynamic protein and pathway alterations associated with GRF6019 treatment, providing novel insights into the biological mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and aging. Observed trajectories suggest modulation of pathways implicated in neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction. These findings highlight the potential of proteomics-based biomarker discovery and pathway analysis to inform therapeutic development and refine patient stratification strategies in AD clinical trials, contributing to a more targeted and effective approach to disease intervention.
