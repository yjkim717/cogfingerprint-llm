**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a critical bottleneck in numerous electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies, demanding the development of efficient and robust electrocatalysts. This study investigates the synergistic impact of surface-bound carboxylate ligands on the OER performance of hybrid metal-organic framework (MOF)/layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalysts. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the presence of carboxylate functionalities significantly alters the electronic structure and interfacial properties of these composite materials, leading to enhanced OER activity. Our findings reveal that carboxylate ligands facilitate electron redistribution within the MOF/LDH framework, optimizing the adsorption energies of key OER intermediates, specifically hydroxyl species. Furthermore, computational analysis indicates that these ligands promote proton transfer pathways, lowering the activation energy barrier for OER. Specifically, we observe a stabilization of the transition state involving proton coupling, attributable to the carboxylate’s ability to act as a Brønsted acid site. The optimized electronic environment induced by the carboxylate ligands also contributes to improved catalyst stability under OER conditions. These results provide valuable insights into the rational design of OER electrocatalysts, highlighting the importance of surface functionalization strategies to enhance catalytic efficiency. The demonstrated mechanism, grounded in DFT modeling, offers a transferable framework for optimizing other heterogeneous catalysts with tailored surface functionalities for OER and related electrochemical processes. Ultimately, this work contributes to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies by providing a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing OER catalysis.
