**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies. This study investigated the impact of GRF6019, a novel compound hypothesized to modulate age-related pathology, utilizing a comprehensive longitudinal proteomics approach. Employing deep proteomics profiling across two Phase II clinical trials evaluating GRF6019, we aimed to delineate targeted biological pathways exhibiting significant alterations in response to treatment. Data analysis revealed robust shifts in protein expression signatures indicative of disrupted cellular homeostasis and neuroinflammation. Specifically, we identified altered levels of proteins associated with oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity, and amyloid precursor protein processing. These findings suggest that GRF6019 induces a distinct proteomic response, potentially reflecting a novel mechanism of action beyond conventional AD targets. Further investigation of these identified pathways may facilitate the development of more effective biomarkers and therapeutic interventions for this debilitating disease.
