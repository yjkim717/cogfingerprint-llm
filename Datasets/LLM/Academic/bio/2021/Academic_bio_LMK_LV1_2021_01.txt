"Quantifying Endosomal Dynamics in Eukaryotic Cells via Anomalous Diffusion Analysis"

Abstract:

The intracellular transport of endosomes plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed the trajectories of individual endosomes in live eukaryotic cells using single-particle tracking. By applying a local analysis framework, we categorized endosomes into slow and fast moving populations based on their instantaneous velocities. Our results reveal that both populations exhibit anomalous diffusion characteristics, with mean squared displacements best described by fractional Brownian motion. Notably, the slow moving endosomes displayed a higher degree of subdiffusion, indicative of stronger cytoskeletal interactions. In contrast, fast moving endosomes exhibited a more ballistic motion, suggestive of active transport along microtubules. Our findings provide new insights into the complex dynamics of endosomal transport and highlight the importance of anomalous diffusion analysis in understanding intracellular trafficking processes. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts to characterize the heterogeneous nature of intracellular transport in 2021.
