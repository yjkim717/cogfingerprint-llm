Title: IGF-1 Signaling in Colorectal Cancer: Implications for Glucose Metabolism and Tumor Progression

Abstract:
The Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in regulating glucose metabolism, which is intricately linked to the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). As a key component of the insulin/IGF-1 signaling axis, IGF-1 modulates cellular energy metabolism, promoting the Warburg effect, a hallmark of cancer cells characterized by enhanced aerobic glycolysis. Elevated IGF-1 levels have been associated with increased CRC risk and poor prognosis. This review synthesizes current evidence on the molecular mechanisms underlying IGF-1-mediated glucose metabolism in CRC, highlighting the intricate interplay between IGF-1 signaling, glycolytic flux, and tumor progression. Understanding the IGF-1 signaling pathway's role in CRC may provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of this malignancy, underscoring the need for further research into the complex relationships between IGF-1, glucose metabolism, and CRC.
