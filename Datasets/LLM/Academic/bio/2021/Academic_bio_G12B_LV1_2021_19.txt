Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a 2021 publication, aiming for ~258 words. I've leaned towards a materials science/electrochemistry perspective, consistent with the keywords, but framed it within a biological relevance (specifically, mimicking biological oxygen evolution).

**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical bottleneck in numerous electrochemical energy conversion processes, including water splitting and COâ‚‚ reduction, and plays a vital role in natural photosynthesis. Mimicking the efficiency of biological oxygen-evolving complexes (OECs) remains a significant challenge in the development of sustainable energy technologies. This work investigates the influence of surface-bound carboxylate ligands on the OER activity of layered double hydroxide (LDH) and metal-organic framework (MOF) electrocatalysts. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the presence of carboxylate functionalities at the catalyst surface significantly alters the electronic structure and reactivity landscape. Specifically, we observe that carboxylate ligands facilitate enhanced electron redistribution within the metal oxide framework, leading to a reduction in the activation energy for OER. Furthermore, our simulations reveal that these ligands act as efficient proton relays, lowering the barriers for key proton transfer steps during the OER mechanism. A detailed analysis of the transition states indicates that carboxylate coordination promotes the formation of a more favorable reaction intermediate, accelerating the overall reaction kinetics. The findings highlight the crucial role of surface ligand engineering in tuning the OER performance of these materials and offer a rational design strategy for developing highly active and efficient electrocatalysts inspired by the principles of natural OECs. This approach provides a pathway towards creating bio-inspired materials for clean energy applications, addressing the global demand for sustainable energy sources.
