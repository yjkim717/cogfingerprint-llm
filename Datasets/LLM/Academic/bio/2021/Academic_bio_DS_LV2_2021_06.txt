**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical, kinetically sluggish process in biological energy conversion and its biomimetic systems. Inspired by metalloenzyme active sites, which often utilize precisely tuned metal centers and proton-relaying amino acid residues, we investigate the role of carboxylate ligands in enhancing electrocatalytic OER within bio-inspired metal-organic framework/layered double hydroxide (MOF/LDH) composites. We posit that carboxylate groups, analogous to glutamate or aspartate sidechains in enzymes, function as more than simple structural linkers. Through a combination of electrochemical analysis and spectroscopic characterization, we demonstrate that these ligands induce significant electron redistribution within the metal-oxo clusters, thereby optimizing the adsorption energetics of oxygenated intermediates. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the carboxylate moieties facilitate concerted proton-electron transfer pathways, effectively lowering the kinetic overpotential. This dual functionality—electronic modulation and proton-transfer mediation—mimics the sophisticated operational principles of natural photosynthetic systems. Our findings, reported in 2021, establish a fundamental design principle for engineering highly active and stable bio-inspired electrocatalysts, bridging synthetic materials and biological energy science.
