## Spatial Analysis of Multiplexed Protein Profiles in Chronic Tonsillitis using Imaging Mass Cytometry and SpatialViz

**Abstract**

The advent of imaging mass cytometry (IMC) has revolutionized tissue analysis, enabling the simultaneous quantification of dozens of protein markers within a single tissue section. However, effectively extracting meaningful spatial information from these high-dimensional datasets remains a significant challenge. This study addresses this challenge by introducing SpatialViz, a novel algorithm suite designed for the visualization and quantitative analysis of spatial relationships within multiplexed tissue images generated via IMC. We demonstrate the utility of SpatialViz through an investigation of chronic tonsillitis, a prevalent inflammatory condition of the tonsils.  Using IMC data acquired on human tonsil tissue, we applied SpatialViz to delineate cellular neighborhoods, quantify co-localization patterns of key immune markers (e.g., CD4, CD8, FoxP3, TNF-α), and characterize spatial gradients of protein expression.  SpatialViz allows for the generation of interactive visualizations that facilitate intuitive exploration of complex tissue architectures and provides robust statistical tools for quantifying spatial proximity and segregation of cell populations. Our results reveal distinct spatial organizations of immune cells within the tonsillar microenvironment in chronic tonsillitis, demonstrating increased TNF-α expression in proximity to CD8+ T cells and a compartmentalization of regulatory T cells (FoxP3+) within lymphoid aggregates. This work highlights the potential of SpatialViz to advance single-cell pathology by integrating spatial context into the analysis of multiplexed protein profiles, offering a powerful new approach for understanding disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic targets.  The SpatialViz algorithm suite is publicly available for broader application in spatial biology research.
