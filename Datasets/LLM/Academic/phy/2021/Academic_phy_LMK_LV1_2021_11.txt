Title: Bounding Chaotic Dynamics in High-Energy Hamiltonian Systems

Abstract:
In the realm of Hamiltonian mechanics, the Lyapunov exponent serves as a crucial indicator of chaotic behavior. Recent studies have explored the connection between this exponent and out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), revealing a deep-seated relationship between chaotic dynamics and the underlying energy of the system. Building upon these findings, we propose a novel chaos energy bound conjecture, positing that the Lyapunov exponent exhibits a linear growth with total energy in the high-energy limit. Leveraging the framework of Hamiltonian mechanics, we derive a theoretical bound on the Lyapunov exponent, demonstrating its energy dependence. Our analysis indicates that the chaos bound is saturated in systems exhibiting maximal chaos, thereby establishing a fundamental limit on the growth of chaotic dynamics with energy. This result has significant implications for understanding the interplay between chaos and energy in complex systems.
