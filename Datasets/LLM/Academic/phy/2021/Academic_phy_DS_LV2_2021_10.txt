**Abstract**

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a cornerstone of sustainable energy technologies. While pristine basal planes are often inert, defective sites, particularly vacancies, are recognized as critical active centers; however, a precise, potential-dependent mechanistic understanding at these sites remains elusive. Herein, we employ grand canonical potential kinetics (GCP-K) to elucidate the HER mechanism at vacant sites on metastable 1T'-WSe₂ and 1T'-WTe₂. Our first-principles calculations reveal that the reaction pathway is intrinsically potential-dependent, shifting between Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel mechanisms as a function of the applied bias. We identify that the transition state and reaction barrier for the Heyrovsky step are highly sensitive to the local electronic structure of the vacancy, which differs markedly between the selenide and telluride. This atomic-scale insight provides a rigorous framework for activity optimization, suggesting that strategic defect engineering, rather than mere defect density, is paramount. Our work establishes GCP-K as a vital tool for moving beyond traditional catalytic descriptors, offering a dynamic view of electrocatalysis essential for designing next-generation TMD-based catalysts.
