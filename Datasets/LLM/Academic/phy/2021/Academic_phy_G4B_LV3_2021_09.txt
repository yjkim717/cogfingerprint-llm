**Abstract**

The forthcoming Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) promises a transformative impact on astrophysical research, particularly in the identification and characterization of supernovae. This work investigates the critical role of LSST’s observing strategy – specifically cadence and seasonal variations – on the photometric classification accuracy of these transient events. Utilizing simulated light curves representative of various supernova types, we model the effects of differing observation schedules on signal-to-noise ratios and the resultant ability to distinguish between spectral classes. Preliminary results demonstrate a strong correlation between shorter observing cadences and improved classification performance, while excessively long seasonal gaps introduce significant ambiguity.  These findings highlight the necessity for robust data processing pipelines within LSST to mitigate potential biases introduced by the survey’s design, ultimately maximizing the scientific return from this unprecedented dataset of supernovae.
