**Abstract**

The exploration of electroweak symmetry breaking and the search for physics beyond the Standard Model necessitate novel experimental approaches. This work advocates for the utilization of a muon collider, leveraging the unique properties of muons – specifically their mass and decay characteristics – to generate copious amounts of electroweak radiation.  Employing a sufficiently high center-of-mass energy, this collider configuration offers a distinct advantage in probing mediator resonances and sensitive electroweak phase transitions.  We propose a strategy employing simplified model analyses, focusing on parameter space constrained by radiative corrections emanating from the collider.  Such an approach minimizes background contamination and facilitates the identification of subtle deviations from Standard Model predictions.  The inherent radiation environment provides a powerful tool for precision measurements and the discovery of new, weakly interacting particles, offering a compelling alternative to traditional hadron collider strategies for accessing low-mass new physics in 2021 and beyond.
