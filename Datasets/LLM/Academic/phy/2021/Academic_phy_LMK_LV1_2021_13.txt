Title: Autonomous Maxwell Demon in a Tunable Dissipative Quantum System: An NV Center Implementation

Abstract:
In 2021, the pursuit of understanding quantum thermodynamics has led to significant advancements in the experimental realization of Maxwell demons, entities that seemingly defy the second law of thermodynamics by sorting particles based on their energy. We present an experimental implementation of an autonomous Maxwell demon utilizing a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, a versatile quantum system that can be manipulated as a qutrit. By harnessing the tunable dissipative dynamics inherent to the NV center's interaction with its environment, our setup enables precise control over the demon's operation. We demonstrate the demon's ability to sort spin states, effectively creating a non-equilibrium situation from a thermalized state. This work not only contributes to the understanding of quantum thermodynamics but also showcases the potential of NV centers in quantum sensing applications, paving the way for innovative quantum technologies.
