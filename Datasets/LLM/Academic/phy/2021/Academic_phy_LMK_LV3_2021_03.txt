In 2021, theoretical investigations into the black hole/string transition continued to unravel the intricacies of quantum gravity. This study examines the transition between small black holes and highly excited fundamental strings within the framework of string theory. Notably, distinct behaviors emerge for heterotic and type II strings, underscoring the nuanced differences between these theoretical frameworks. By elucidating the transition dynamics, this research sheds light on the fundamental principles governing the interplay between black holes and strings, offering insights into the underlying structure of string theory.
