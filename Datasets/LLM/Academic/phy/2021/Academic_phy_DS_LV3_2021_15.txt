In the pursuit of high-performance anode materials for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, perovskite oxides have garnered significant attention due to their structural versatility and ionic conductivity. This study investigates the A-site deficient perovskite Li0.1La0.3NbO3 as a promising candidate for advanced Li+ storage applications. Through comprehensive electrochemical analysis and structural characterization, we demonstrate that this tailored composition facilitates exceptional lithium-ion storage capacity, exceeding conventional intercalation anodes. The material exhibits remarkably low strain during cycling, attributed to its stable perovskite framework, which mitigates mechanical degradation and enhances cyclability. Furthermore, we elucidate the unique ion transport pathways enabled by the A-site deficiency, which provide optimized diffusion kinetics for Li+ ions. These findings, substantiated by in situ X-ray diffraction and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements, underscore the pivotal role of strategic A-site engineering in perovskite anodes. The results presented herein, as of 2021, establish a new paradigm for developing strain-resilient, high-capacity electrode materials, accelerating progress toward sustainable energy storage systems.
