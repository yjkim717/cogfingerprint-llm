**Abstract**

This study presents a dielectric metasurface architecture engineered for precise temporal polarization control of near-infrared femtosecond pulses. Utilizing a novel design incorporating spatially-varying dielectric layers, the metasurface enables selective manipulation of the pulse’s leading-edge and trailing-edge temporal profiles.  Characterization via complex electrical-field transient measurements reveals the ability to induce significant alterations in the pulse’s temporal polarization state.  Furthermore, preliminary wavefront shaping capabilities are demonstrated, suggesting potential applications in advanced optical communications and ultrafast spectroscopy.  The achieved control leverages the metasurface’s capacity to generate complex, tailored field distributions (2021).
