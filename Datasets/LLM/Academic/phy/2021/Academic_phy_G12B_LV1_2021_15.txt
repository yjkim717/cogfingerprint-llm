**Abstract: A-Site Deficient Lithium Lanthanum Niobate (LLNO) as a High-Performance Anode Material for Lithium-Ion Batteries**

The ongoing demand for high-energy-density and rapidly rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates the exploration of novel anode materials beyond conventional graphite. This work investigates Li<sub>0.1</sub>La<sub>0.3</sub>NbO<sub>3</sub> (LLNO), a lithium-containing perovskite oxide exhibiting intentional A-site deficiency, as a promising alternative anode candidate. Perovskite structures, renowned for their structural flexibility and compositional tunability, offer unique opportunities for optimizing ionic conductivity and electrochemical performance.  Specifically, the introduction of A-site vacancies in LLNO is hypothesized to enhance lithium-ion (Li<sup>+</sup>) transport kinetics within the material.

We report the synthesis and electrochemical characterization of LLNO utilizing a modified sol-gel method. X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the perovskite structure, while scanning electron microscopy reveals a porous morphology facilitating electrolyte infiltration. Cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling demonstrate reversible lithium insertion/extraction with high coulombic efficiency and exceptional rate capability up to 5C. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicates a significantly reduced charge transfer resistance compared to undoped perovskite materials, supporting the hypothesis that A-site deficiency promotes enhanced Li<sup>+</sup> transport. Post-mortem analysis using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) reveals stable surface chemistry throughout cycling, contributing to the observed long-term cycling stability. These findings suggest that A-site deficient perovskites, exemplified by LLNO, represent a viable pathway towards developing advanced anode materials for next-generation LIBs, potentially overcoming limitations associated with current anode technologies.

*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows this logic:
    1.  **Context/Problem:** The need for better LIB anodes.
    2.  **Proposed Solution:** Introducing LLNO, an A-site deficient perovskite.
    3.  **Rationale:**  A-site deficiency should improve Li<sup>+</sup> transport.
