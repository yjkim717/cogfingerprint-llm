**Abstract**

Efficient computational methods remain paramount for accurate electronic structure predictions, particularly within the realm of *ab initio* quantum chemistry. This work presents a significantly optimized implementation of the QUICK program, a widely utilized density functional theory (DFT) code, leveraging multi-GPU acceleration to address the computational demands of large-scale calculations.  The core of the optimization involves a novel partitioning strategy for the Hartree-Fock and subsequent DFT iterations, maximizing GPU utilization across diverse hardware architectures.  Specifically, the implementation incorporates a quantum interaction kernel optimized for parallel evaluation.  Benchmarking across multiple GPU platforms demonstrates substantial performance gains, achieving unprecedented parallel efficiency compared to single-GPU configurations.  These results highlight the critical role of GPU-accelerated computing in overcoming the scaling limitations of traditional DFT methods, enabling the investigation of increasingly complex molecular systems and accelerating the discovery process in fields ranging from materials science to chemical dynamics.  Further development focuses on extending this framework to incorporate advanced exchange-correlation functionals.
