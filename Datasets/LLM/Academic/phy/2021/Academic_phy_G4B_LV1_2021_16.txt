**Abstract**

We present a novel investigation into asymptotically flat spacetimes within the theoretical framework of five spacetime dimensions. Employing Hamiltonian methods, specifically utilizing canonical quantization techniques, we explore the dynamics of these geometries, seeking to identify emergent symmetries. Our analysis reveals the existence of a previously undocumented nonlinear symmetry algebra, arising from the interplay of asymptotic flatness and the increased dimensionality. This symmetry, characterized by a non-Abelian structure, suggests a deeper underlying invariance governing the spacetime’s behavior at large distances.  The identification of this algebraic structure is achieved through a systematic examination of conserved quantities and their transformations under asymptotic coordinate changes.  Further research will focus on elucidating the physical manifestations of this new symmetry and its potential implications for black hole thermodynamics and the holographic principle in higher-dimensional models.
