In this study, we investigate the critical dependence of photometric supernova classification efficacy on the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) observing strategy parameters, with particular focus on the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's operational timeline. Through sophisticated simulations incorporating realistic noise models and population distributions from the Dark Energy Survey, we systematically evaluate how seasonal observing length, cadence patterns, and inter-seasonal gap handling propagate to classification uncertainties. Our methodology employs Gaussian process interpolation to reconstruct complete light curves from sparse observations, enabling robust feature extraction in multiple photometric bands. We demonstrate that suboptimal cadence strategies can degrade classification accuracy for Type Ia supernovae by up to 40% compared to optimized designs, primarily through inadequate sampling of characteristic rise and fall phases. Furthermore, we establish that wavelet-based classifiers exhibit particular sensitivity to seasonal gaps exceeding 45 days, significantly compromising redshift-dependent type discrimination. These findings, validated against empirical data from precursor surveys, highlight the necessity of incorporating classification metrics as fundamental constraints in LSST observing strategy optimization. The results provide quantitative guidance for maximizing cosmological constraints from photometric supernovae while addressing systematic uncertainties in time-domain astronomy, with implications for dark energy measurements and transient astrophysics in the LSST era.
