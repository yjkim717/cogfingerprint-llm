**Abstract**

The computational expense of quantum mechanical methods, such as Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory, remains a primary bottleneck for simulating large molecular systems like proteins. This work presents a novel, highly optimized multi-GPU implementation within the QUICK software package, specifically designed to accelerate the quantum interaction computational kernel. By restructuring the algorithm for fine-grained parallelism and efficient memory management across multiple GPUs, we overcome traditional scaling limitations. Benchmark calculations on complex organic and protein systems demonstrate a near-linear parallel efficiency, significantly reducing time-to-solution while maintaining high numerical accuracy. This advancement provides a scalable computational framework that enables high-fidelity electronic structure calculations for biologically relevant systems previously considered intractable, marking a substantial step forward in computational physics and theoretical chemistry.
