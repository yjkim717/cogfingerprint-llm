**Abstract**

The classification of infrared (IR) phases in 4-dimensional SU(N) chiral gauge theories remains a central challenge in modern theoretical physics. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of these phases, leveraging the interplay between anomaly cancellation and topological quantum field theory (TQFT) constraints. We demonstrate a systematic classification framework incorporating both traditional gauge anomaly conditions and newly identified mixed 0-form/1-form 't Hooft anomalies, previously overlooked in standard anomaly analyses. These mixed anomalies fundamentally alter the allowed IR physics, introducing novel constraints on the global symmetries and potential topological order.  Our investigation reveals that the requirement of anomaly consistency imposes stringent restrictions on the possible chiral symmetry structures and their associated fermion content. Furthermore, we explore the connection between these anomalies and the emergence of topological field theories, revealing that certain IR phases are inherently characterized by TQFT descriptions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of confinement mechanisms and the realization of non-trivial topological phases within the context of chiral gauge theories, aligning with ongoing efforts to explore emergent phenomena in strongly coupled systems.



I aimed to incorporate the keywords naturally and expand on the core ideas with slightly more detail, using language appropriate for a physics abstract.
