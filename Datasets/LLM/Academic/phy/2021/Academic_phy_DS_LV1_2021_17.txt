**Abstract**

The burgeoning demand for high-dimensional optical information processing necessitates advanced techniques for the parallel characterization of photonic angular momentum states. While spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) offer orthogonal degrees of freedom for multiplexing in communications and quantum protocols, their simultaneous, single-shot discrimination remains a significant challenge. Conventional methods often require cascaded elements or sequential measurements, limiting system throughput and integration. Here, we propose and numerically validate a dielectric metasurface platform that performs a deterministic photonic momentum transformation to overcome this limitation. The metasurface’s meta-atoms are engineered to impart distinct, spatially varying geometric phases, effectively decoupling the spin and orbital contributions of an incident beam’s wavefront. This design facilitates the transformation of a superposition of SAM and OAM states into a complex far-field intensity pattern, where the topological charge and helicity are encoded into separable and directly resolvable features. Our results demonstrate robust vortex recognition across a range of OAM modes, validated through full-wave simulations. This spin-decoupled momentum transformation metasurface presents a compact, efficient pathway for real-time spatial mode demultiplexing, with direct implications for enhancing the capacity and security of optical networks and quantum information systems.
