**Abstract**

The persistent tension in Hubble constant (H₀) measurements between early- and late-universe probes represents a pivotal challenge in contemporary cosmology, potentially indicating new physics beyond the standard ΛCDM model. This study presents a refined calibration of the cosmic distance ladder utilizing the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, a critical pathway for anchoring the absolute distance scale. Our analysis leverages high-precision photometry from the *Hubble Space Telescope* for a sample of Milky Way dwarf satellites and nearby Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia) host galaxies, employing a novel, spatially-resolved treatment of the stellar metallicity dependence on the TRGB luminosity in the I-band. We derive a robust, geometric calibration of the TRGB zero-point, which is subsequently propagated through the distance ladder to the Hubble flow SNe Ia. The resultant Hubble constant is determined to be H₀ = 69.8 ± 0.6 (statistical) ± 1.6 (systematic) km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹. This value demonstrates a high degree of consistency with the H₀ value inferred from the *Planck* satellite's cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations under the ΛCDM framework (H₀ = 67.4 ± 0.5 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹), while remaining in significant tension with certain late-universe measurements, such as those from the SH0ES collaboration. A comprehensive analysis of systematic uncertainties underscores that residual uncertainties in stellar population modeling and interstellar extinction constitute the dominant contributions to our total error budget. Our findings strengthen the case for a Hubble constant value in the upper-60s to low-70s range, thereby intensifying the "Hubble tension" with other local distance ladder calibrations. We conclude that resolving this discrepancy necessitates future observational programs with the *James Webb Space Telescope* and next-generation wide-field surveys to further mitigate systematics and provide an unambiguous cosmological resolution.
