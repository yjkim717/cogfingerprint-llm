**Abstract**

The precise manipulation of ultrashort laser pulses remains a crucial challenge in diverse fields, including microscopy, spectroscopy, and materials processing. Here, we present a novel approach utilizing a dielectric metasurface architecture to achieve integrated polarization control and wavefront shaping on a femtosecond timescale. Our design enables independent control over both the amplitude and phase of the electric field components within a pulse, facilitating complex polarization states and arbitrary wavefront profiles. Experimental validation demonstrates efficient reshaping of 100 fs pulses, showcasing the potential of dielectric metasurfaces for advanced pulse engineering. This work advances the state-of-the-art in ultrafast optics by providing a compact, broadband platform for generating tailored light fields.
