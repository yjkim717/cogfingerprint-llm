In this investigation, we elucidate the non-perturbative dynamics governing the transition between small black holes and self-gravitating fundamental strings within the framework of string theory. A comparative analysis of heterotic and type II superstring models reveals a fundamental dichotomy: the heterotic case exhibits a continuous, smooth interpolation between the black hole and string regimes, whereas the type II scenario demonstrates a marked discontinuity. We propose a resolution for the heterotic transition through a detailed construction of a linear sigma model, which provides a unified geometric description capturing the full phase diagram. This model successfully interpolates between the black hole geometry at large coupling and the highly excited string state in the vanishing coupling limit, thereby identifying the black hole as a condensate of strings. Our findings, situated within the 2021 landscape of quantum gravity research, substantiate the fuzzball paradigm and offer a robust mechanism for resolving spacelike singularities, bridging a critical gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics.
