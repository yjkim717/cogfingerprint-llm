In this 2021 theoretical physics investigation, we establish rigorous connections between Hamiltonian mechanics and quantum chaos through the thermodynamic consistency of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). Our analysis demonstrates that the chaos energy bound conjecture imposes fundamental constraints on the growth rate of Lyapunov exponents across both classical and quantum regimes. We prove that in high-energy limits, the Lyapunov exponent λ_L scales at most linearly with total system energy E, satisfying λ_L ≤ cE/ℏ where c is a system-dependent constant. This universal bound emerges from the consistent thermodynamic formulation of OTOCs, which bridge microscopic dynamics with macroscopic thermal properties. Through analytical and numerical methods, we verify this scaling behavior in both integrable and non-integrable Hamiltonian systems, revealing how energy partitioning between regular and chaotic degrees of freedom governs thermalization processes. Our findings provide a unified framework for understanding chaos bounds across energy scales, with implications for quantum gravity, condensed matter systems, and the fundamental limits of information scrambling in closed quantum systems.
