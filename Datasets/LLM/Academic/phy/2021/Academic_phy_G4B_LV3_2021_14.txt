**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in black hole thermodynamics have increasingly recognized the limitations of conventional analytic techniques. This work introduces a novel topological framework to characterize critical points within the black hole phase space, moving beyond standard Wald’s metric formalism. We identify and classify two distinct categories of critical points – conventional and ‘novel’ – distinguished by their associated topological charges. These topological charges, calculated via persistent homology, reveal intrinsic geometric properties of black hole configurations and offer a robust method for differentiating between solutions. The analysis demonstrates that subtle variations in black hole topology, quantified through these charges, correspond to significant alterations in thermodynamic behavior.  This approach provides a foundational step toward a more complete understanding of black hole dynamics and represents a crucial development in the study of black hole thermodynamics in 2021.
