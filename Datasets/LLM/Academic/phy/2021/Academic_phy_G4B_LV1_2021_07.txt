**Abstract**

Accurate modeling of gravitational scattering events necessitates a comprehensive treatment of radiation-reaction effects, a phenomenon arising from the dynamic interaction between accelerating bodies and the surrounding spacetime. This work presents a refined calculation of radiation-reaction contributions to gravitational scattering within the framework of general relativity, extending previous post-Newtonian approximations to higher orders. Utilizing a 4-momentum formalism, we derive precise expressions for the recoil momentum imparted upon scattering particles due to emitted radiation. The methodology incorporates contributions up to N = 6 in the post-Newtonian expansion, offering a significant advancement over existing literature.  Our results are benchmarked against established analytical solutions and numerical simulations, demonstrating improved convergence and accuracy.  Specifically, we highlight deviations from earlier estimates at higher post-Newtonian orders, emphasizing the importance of incorporating these effects for precise predictions in astrophysical scenarios involving compact binaries and strong gravitational fields.  Further investigation into the radiative response of black holes remains a key area of ongoing research.
