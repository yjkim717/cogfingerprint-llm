**Abstract**

Recent advancements in string theory have presented compelling alternatives to the classical black hole paradigm, challenging the prevailing notion of singularities within these gravitational extremes. This work investigates the Horowitz-Polchinski solution, a prominent framework within string theory, examining its applicability and modifications across both heterotic and type II string backgrounds. Specifically, we analyze the solution’s inherent self-gravitating nature, arguing that it represents a localized string state – a “fuzzball” – rather than a singular spacetime. 

The study posits that the Horowitz-Polchinski solution’s behavior deviates significantly in heterotic and type II scenarios, exhibiting a transition characterized by enhanced string tension and altered geometry. This transition, termed a “string transition,” suggests a potential mechanism for resolving the singularity problem.  We propose that this transition represents a fundamental shift in the solution's dynamics, ultimately preventing the formation of a true singularity.  Further investigation is warranted to fully characterize the parameters governing this transition and its implications for black hole thermodynamics and information theory within the context of string theory.
