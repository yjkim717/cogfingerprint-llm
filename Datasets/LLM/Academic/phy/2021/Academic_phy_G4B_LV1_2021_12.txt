**Abstract: Enhanced Parallelism in Ab Initio Electronic Structure Calculations via Multi-GPU Acceleration**

The computational demands of *ab initio* electronic structure methods, particularly those relying on the Hartree-Fock or density functional theory (DFT) formalism, frequently present a significant bottleneck for large-scale molecular systems.  This work details the development and implementation of a substantially accelerated QUICK program, leveraging a multi-GPU architecture to overcome these limitations.  Specifically, we present a novel parallelization strategy centered around the quantum interaction kernel, minimizing communication overhead and maximizing computational throughput.  The resulting implementation demonstrates significant gains in parallel efficiency, achieved through dynamic task distribution and optimized memory access patterns across multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).  Benchmarking on a cluster environment reveals a demonstrable reduction in computational time compared to single-GPU execution, facilitating the study of larger and more complex molecular systems.  The achieved performance metrics, presented alongside a detailed analysis of the parallelization strategy, provide a valuable contribution to the advancement of efficient *ab initio* calculations in 2021 and beyond, opening new avenues for investigating intricate quantum phenomena.
