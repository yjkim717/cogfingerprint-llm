Title: Reconciling Time Perception: A Neuroscientific and Theoretical Physics Perspective

Abstract:

The dichotomy between neuroscientific and theoretical physics perspectives on time perception has sparked intense debate. Neuroscientists traditionally view time as a subjective, future-oriented construct, governed by cognitive processes and neurological mechanisms. Conversely, theoretical physicists, grounded in the framework of relativity, conceptualize time as an integral component of spacetime, where its passage is relative and dependent on observer motion. As of 2021, advancements in both fields have underscored the need for a unified understanding. Recent findings in neuroscience have elucidated the neural correlates of time perception, while developments in theoretical physics have further refined our comprehension of spacetime geometry. This paper seeks to reconcile these disparate views, exploring the intersections between neuroscientific and theoretical physics perspectives on time. By examining the confluence of cognitive and relativistic frameworks, we aim to foster a more nuanced understanding of time perception, ultimately contributing to a more cohesive and comprehensive understanding of this complex phenomenon.
