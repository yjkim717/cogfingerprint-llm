Title: Optimizing LSST Observing Strategy for Enhanced Supernovae Classification

Abstract:
The forthcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Rubin Observatory is poised to revolutionize our understanding of supernovae (SNe) populations. However, the efficacy of SNe classification via LSST's photometric observations hinges on the survey's observing strategy. Utilizing simulated multiband light curves generated through the PLAsTICC (Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-series Classification Challenge) framework, we quantitatively assess the impact of LSST's observing strategy on SNe classification. Our analysis reveals that season length and cadence are pivotal factors influencing the accuracy of photometric classification. By optimizing these parameters, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in SNe classification performance. Our findings underscore the importance of careful observing strategy design for LSST, providing a framework for optimizing the survey's configuration to maximize its scientific return on SNe research. This study informs the development of LSST's observing strategy, ensuring the survey's full potential for advancing SNe astrophysics is realized.
