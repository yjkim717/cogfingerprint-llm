This study examines the theoretical framework of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), a prominent approach to reconciling General Relativity and Quantum Physics. By emphasizing the quantum nature of spacetime geometry, LQG provides a novel understanding of the fundamental structure of the universe. As of 2021, ongoing research in LQG continues to advance our comprehension of the intricate relationships between spacetime, gravity, and quantum mechanics, offering a promising avenue for unification in modern physics.
