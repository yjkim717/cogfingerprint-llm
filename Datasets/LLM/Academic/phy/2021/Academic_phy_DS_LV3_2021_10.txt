In this study, we employ grand canonical potential kinetics to systematically investigate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) mechanisms on 1T' phase transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically WSe₂ and WTe₂. Our theoretical framework explicitly incorporates the electrochemical potential as an independent variable, enabling precise characterization of potential-dependent reaction pathways that conventional methods often overlook. Through first-principles calculations combined with microkinetic modeling, we identify distinct Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel pathways dominating the HER process under varying applied potentials. The analysis reveals that 1T'-WTe₂ exhibits a lower onset potential of -0.17 V versus RHE compared to -0.24 V for 1T'-WSe₂, attributed to more favorable hydrogen adsorption free energies near the conduction band edge. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applied potential modulation significantly alters the rate-determining steps: while the Volmer reaction controls the kinetics at low overpotentials, the Heyrovsky step becomes dominant as the potential increases negatively. These potential-induced transitions in the dominant reaction mechanism provide crucial insights for designing enhanced TMD-based electrocatalysts. Our findings establish grand canonical potential kinetics as a powerful approach for elucidating potential-dependent electrochemical processes and offer strategic guidance for optimizing HER catalysts through electronic structure engineering and operational potential selection. This work advances fundamental understanding of electrocatalytic mechanisms in two-dimensional materials while providing concrete strategies for improving renewable energy technologies.
