"In a pioneering experiment conducted in 2021, we successfully implemented an autonomous Maxwell demon utilizing a diamond spin qutrit, thereby harnessing the principles of quantum thermodynamics. By leveraging the dissipative dynamics of the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center, our study demonstrates the demon's efficacy in quantum sensing applications. The results showcase the potential of this innovative device for advancing thermodynamic technologies. This breakthrough paves the way for the development of novel quantum sensing protocols and thermodynamic devices, underscoring the significance of quantum coherence in energy manipulation and information processing."
