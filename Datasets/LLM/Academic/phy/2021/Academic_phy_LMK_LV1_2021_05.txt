Title: Reconciling the Hubble Constant: A TRGB Method Analysis using Gaia Early Data Release 3

Abstract:

The Hubble constant (H0) has been a subject of intense debate in recent years, with measurements from various cosmological probes yielding disparate values. The Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, a robust distance indicator, has emerged as a promising tool for resolving this tension. In this study, we leverage the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) to calibrate the TRGB method and subsequently determine H0 using Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as standard candles. Our analysis yields a Hubble constant value of H0 = 67.4 ± 1.2 km s−1 Mpc−1, which is consistent within 1σ with the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation under the standard ΛCDM cosmological model. This result is in contrast to some previous measurements using other methods, which have reported a significant discrepancy between the directly measured H0 and the CMB-inferred value. Our findings suggest that the TRGB method, when calibrated with high-precision Gaia EDR3 data, provides a reliable and robust measurement of H0, thereby supporting the ΛCDM model. Furthermore, our analysis underscores the importance of precise calibration and robust statistical analysis in resolving the Hubble tension. The consistency between our TRGB-based H0 measurement and the CMB-inferred value highlights the potential for a converging understanding of the universe's expansion history.
