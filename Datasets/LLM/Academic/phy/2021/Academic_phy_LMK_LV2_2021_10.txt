Title: Unveiling the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Mechanism on Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides via Grand Canonical Potential Kinetics

Abstract:

The pursuit of efficient electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) has garnered significant attention in the realm of renewable energy. In this study, we employ a grand canonical potential kinetics formulation to elucidate the HER mechanism on WSe2 and WTe2, two prominent members of the transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) family, in their 1T' phase. By investigating the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of the reaction, we uncover a multistep reaction pathway involving the adsorption of hydrogen atoms and the subsequent formation of molecular hydrogen. Our simulations reveal that the 1T' phase of WSe2 and WTe2 exhibits a higher catalytic performance compared to their 2H counterparts, owing to the enhanced metallicity and modified electronic structure. Furthermore, we identify the key factors influencing the HER activity, including the Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption and the electrochemical potential. By modulating these parameters, we propose a strategy to optimize the catalytic performance of TMDs, paving the way for the development of more efficient HER electrocatalysts. Our findings not only provide a deeper understanding of the HER mechanism on TMDs but also offer valuable insights for the design of high-performance catalysts, ultimately contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies. The results of this study underscore the potential of 1T' WSe2 and WTe2 as promising candidates for HER electrocatalysis, warranting further experimental investigation.
