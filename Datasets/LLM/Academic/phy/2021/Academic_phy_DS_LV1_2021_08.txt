**Abstract**

The reconciliation of neuroscientific and physical descriptions of temporal experience remains a foundational challenge. While neuroscience posits a unidirectional "arrow of perception" rooted in cognitive processes and neural entropic increases, fundamental physics, particularly within the block universe model of general relativity, treats time as a geometric dimension without a privileged present. This paper proposes a formal framework to bridge this explanatory gap by analyzing time perception through the lens of thermodynamic gradients within neural systems. We argue that the psychological arrow of time is not an emergent illusion but a physically-grounded, local phenomenon. It arises from the brain's function as a non-equilibrium thermodynamic system, wherein information processing is necessarily coupled to irreversible entropy production. This continuous, high-rate entropic increase defines a robust local arrow, even as the global spacetime manifold remains temporally symmetric. Consequently, subjective "time travel" is precluded not by chronological protection conjectures but by the thermodynamic impossibility of sustaining conscious observation during a reversal of these internal entropic gradients. This synthesis reframes the hard problem of temporal consciousness as a problem of interface between geometric and thermodynamic descriptions of physical reality.
