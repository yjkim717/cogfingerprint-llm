**Abstract**  
The burgeoning field of structured light, particularly beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM), has unlocked transformative applications in quantum information processing, optical communications, and high-dimensional data encoding. However, conventional methods for characterizing optical vortices often rely on sequential or cascaded measurements of spin angular momentum (SAM) and OAM, introducing system complexity, alignment sensitivity, and reduced throughput. In this work, we introduce a spin-decoupled dielectric metasurface architecture that leverages photonic momentum transformation to enable simultaneous, single-shot identification of both SAM and OAM states. By engineering geometric-phase and propagation-phase profiles within a subwavelength-thick silicon metasurface, we achieve spatially distinct optical responses for orthogonal circular polarizations and distinct topological charges. This design facilitates direct vortex recognition by projecting different OAM modes into separated focal spots or intensity patterns in the far field, without the need for interferometry or multiple optical components. Experimental validation at near-infrared wavelengths confirms robust performance across a range of topological charges with minimal crosstalk. Our approach not only simplifies optical vortex detection systems but also paves the way for ultra-compact, multifunctional metadevices for integrated photonic circuits, quantum state tomography, and real-time optical sorting applications, marking a significant step toward scalable on-chip optical information processing.
