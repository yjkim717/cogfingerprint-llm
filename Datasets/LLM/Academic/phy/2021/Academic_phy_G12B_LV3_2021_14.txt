**Abstract**

Recent advancements in black hole thermodynamics have explored connections between thermodynamic properties and geometric characteristics. This work investigates the incorporation of topological considerations within the framework of black hole thermodynamics, leveraging Duanâ€™s theoretical construct to analyze phase transitions. We demonstrate the existence of critical points characterized by non-trivial topological charges, offering a novel perspective on black hole criticality. A comparative analysis reveals discernible distinctions in topological classification between charged Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes described by standard electrodynamics and those governed by the Born-Infeld model. These differences highlight the influence of underlying field theory on the thermodynamic behavior and suggest a deeper link between topology and the emergent spacetime geometry in strongly coupled gravitational systems. This research contributes to a burgeoning area aiming to unify concepts from general relativity, thermodynamics, and topology, furthering our understanding of black hole physics.
