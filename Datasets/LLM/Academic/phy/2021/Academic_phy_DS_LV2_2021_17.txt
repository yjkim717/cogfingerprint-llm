**Abstract**

The burgeoning demand for high-capacity optical communication systems necessitates advanced multiplexing techniques leveraging the photonic angular momentum degree of freedom. While spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) offer orthogonal information channels, their simultaneous and single-shot discrimination remains a significant challenge, often requiring complex, cascaded optical elements. Here, we propose and experimentally validate a spin-decoupled dielectric metasurface that performs a photonic momentum transformation to concurrently resolve both SAM and OAM states. The metasurfaceâ€™s subwavelength meta-atoms are engineered to impart distinct, spin-dependent geometric phases, effectively decoupling the incident beam's polarization helicity from its orbital topological charge. This transformation maps the incident vortex beam's OAM spectrum onto a spatially distinct intensity profile in the far-field, while the SAM state is simultaneously segregated. Our results demonstrate robust, single-shot recognition of multiple superimposed OAM modes across different polarization bases. This integrated metasurface platform provides a compact, efficient solution for dense spatial-division multiplexing, paving the way for next-generation optical information processing and quantum communication protocols.
