**Abstract**

We present a derivation of the radiative corrections to gravitational scattering of non-relativistic point masses, employing a variation-of-constants approach within the framework of general relativity. Gravitational scattering, a fundamental process in binary astrophysical systems, necessitates accurate theoretical modeling to interpret observations of gravitational waves and test general relativity in the strong-field regime. Existing calculations often face challenges in achieving both high accuracy and computational efficiency. This work addresses this limitation by systematically expanding the metric perturbation in terms of post-Newtonian (PN) parameters.

Our method allows for the calculation of the complete 2.5-PN order radiative contributions to the scattering angle, representing a significant advancement in precision compared to previous analyses.  Specifically, we focus on the derivation of the radiation-reaction force and the associated energy loss, crucial for understanding the inspiral phase of compact binary coalescences. The variation-of-constants technique allows a clear separation of the conservative and radiative effects, facilitating a robust calculation of the emitted gravitational wave flux.  The resulting formulae are expressed in terms of 4-momentum invariants, ensuring consistency with Lorentz invariance and simplifying subsequent analytical or numerical investigations. This approach provides a foundation for improved waveform models used in gravitational wave data analysis and tests of general relativity.
