Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal academic style suitable for a physics publication, and reflecting a 2021 context.  I've aimed for precision and a logical flow.  Following the abstract, I'll include some notes on the choices I made.

**Topological Classification and Critical Phenomena in Anti-de Sitter Black Hole Thermodynamics**

The thermodynamic properties of black holes, particularly within the Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime framework, continue to offer profound insights into the intersection of general relativity and statistical mechanics. This work explores a novel approach to black hole thermodynamics by incorporating topological invariants as fundamental descriptors. We propose a classification scheme for critical points in the phase space of AdS black holes based on associated topological charges, arguing that these charges reflect underlying geometric features of the event horizon. Specifically, we demonstrate that seemingly disparate black hole solutions, differing in their asymptotic behavior or internal structure (e.g., Schwarzschild-AdS, Reissner-Nordström-AdS), exhibit distinct topological signatures at their respective critical points.  These signatures manifest as integer-valued topological charges that are conserved under certain thermodynamic transformations.  Our analysis reveals a direct correspondence between the topological charge and the nature of the phase transition observed, suggesting a deeper connection between geometry, topology, and thermodynamics than previously recognized.  This framework provides a potentially unifying perspective on diverse black hole systems and may offer new avenues for exploring quantum gravity effects near critical phenomena. Further investigation into the implications for holographic duality is warranted.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Tone & Language:** I used phrases like "This work explores," "We propose," "demonstrate," "associated topological charges," and "manifests as" to maintain a formal, scientific tone.
*   **Precise Terminology:** The abstract uses established terms like “Anti-de Sitter (AdS),” “phase space,” “event horizon,” "topological invariants," and "holographic duality."
*   **Structured Reasoning:**
    *   **Introduction/Context:** The first sentence establishes the ongoing relevance of black hole thermodynamics.
    *   **Novelty/Approach:** The second sentence introduces the key new idea – incorporating topology.
    *   **Method/Findings:** The third and fourth sentences describe the classification scheme, the demonstration of distinct topological charges, and their connection to different black hole solutions.
    *   **Interpretation/Significance:** The fifth sentence explains the meaning of the results – a deeper connection between geometry, topology, and thermodynamics.
    *   **Future Directions:** The final sentence suggests further research avenues (implications for holographic duality).
*   **2021 Context:** The focus on AdS black holes reflects ongoing research in this area, and the suggestion of quantum gravity effects aligns with current trends in theoretical physics.  The mention of holographic duality is a common and important element in this field.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for around 188 words, as requested.
*   **Implicit Assumptions:** I assumed a reader familiar with the basics of black hole thermodynamics and AdS spacetimes.
