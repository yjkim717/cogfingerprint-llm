In this investigation, we elucidate the microscopic nature of the black hole/string transition, a critical regime where a self-gravitating fundamental string state evolves into a black hole geometry. Through a comparative analysis of heterotic and type II superstring theories, we identify and characterize a fundamental dichotomy in their respective transition dynamics. For the heterotic string, we demonstrate that the transition is smooth, with the excited string state adiabatically transforming into the fuzzball construction, thereby resolving the black hole information paradox microscopically. Conversely, in type II theories, we establish that the transition exhibits a sharp crossover or a possible phase transition, marked by a discontinuity in thermodynamic observables. Our findings, derived from a detailed study of entropy and radiation spectra, provide a unified framework for understanding quantum gravity effects at the string-scale threshold of black hole formation and underscore the role of specific string theoretic constituents in determining the ultimate fate of spacetime singularities.
