Title: Exploring the Black Hole-String Transition in String Theory Frameworks

Abstract:
This study investigates the transition between small black holes and highly excited fundamental strings within the context of string theory, focusing on the heterotic and type II string frameworks. By examining the self-gravitating string solutions, we elucidate the intricate relationship between the gravitational and stringy descriptions of these objects. Our analysis reveals that the transition is governed by the interplay between the string coupling and the excitation level of the string. We demonstrate that, as the excitation level increases, the stringy description becomes more accurate, while the gravitational description becomes less reliable. Conversely, for small excitation levels, the gravitational description dominates, and the black hole picture emerges. Our findings provide insight into the long-standing problem of black hole-string transition, shedding light on the underlying string theory dynamics that govern this phenomenon. (2021)
