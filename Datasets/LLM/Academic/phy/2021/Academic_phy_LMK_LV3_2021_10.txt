Title: Unveiling the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Mechanism on Single-Layer Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides via Grand Canonical Potential Kinetics

Abstract:
The pressing need for sustainable energy solutions has sparked intense research into the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). In 2021, we applied grand canonical potential kinetics to elucidate the HER mechanism on single-layer 1T' WSe2, a representative TMD. Our simulations revealed a complex, multistep reaction pathway, underscoring the importance of considering electrochemical potential and solvation effects. The results demonstrate that the catalytic performance of 1T' WSe2 can be optimized by tuning the electrochemical potential, thereby enhancing its HER activity. Comparative analysis with WTe2 highlights the distinct catalytic properties of these isostructural materials, providing valuable insights into the design of high-performance TMD-based electrocatalysts. This study advances our understanding of the HER on single-layer TMDs and paves the way for the development of efficient, sustainable energy conversion technologies.
