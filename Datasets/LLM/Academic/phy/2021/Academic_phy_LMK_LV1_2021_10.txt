Title: Unveiling the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Mechanism on Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides via Grand Canonical Potential Kinetics

Abstract:
Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising catalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). In this study, we employ grand canonical potential kinetics to elucidate the HER mechanism on WSe2 and WTe2, focusing on the 1T' phase with vacant sites. Our simulations reveal a complex, multistep reaction pathway involving Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel mechanisms. The results indicate that the HER activity is strongly influenced by the electronic structure and the presence of vacant sites, which modulate the adsorption free energy of hydrogen. By identifying the optimal vacant site configurations, we propose a strategy to enhance the catalytic performance of TMDs. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the HER mechanism on WSe2 and WTe2, shedding light on the design of efficient TMD-based catalysts for electrochemical hydrogen production. This work contributes to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies.
