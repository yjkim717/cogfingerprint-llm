**Abstract**

The development of high-performance anode materials is critical for advancing lithium-ion battery technology, particularly in addressing challenges related to capacity degradation and structural instability during cycling. This study investigates the electrochemical properties of an A-site deficient perovskite, Li₀.₁La₀.₃NbO₃, as a novel anode for lithium-ion batteries. Through a combination of synchrotron X-ray diffraction and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we elucidate the material's unique Li⁺ storage mechanism, which involves facile ion migration through optimized crystallographic pathways. The A-site deficiency is shown to create a stable framework that accommodates lithium intercalation with minimal lattice strain, as confirmed by in situ strain analysis. This structural resilience contributes to exceptional cycling stability, with a retained capacity of 92% after 500 cycles at 1C. Furthermore, the material exhibits a high reversible capacity of 320 mAh g⁻¹, outperforming many conventional anodes. These findings underscore the potential of defect-engineered perovskites as low-strain, high-capacity electrodes, offering a promising direction for next-generation energy storage systems.
