In this 2021 study, we advance the theoretical treatment of radiation-reaction effects within the context of gravitational scattering in general relativity. By implementing a refined variation-of-constants method, we systematically derive the secular changes in the 4-momentum of a binary system undergoing hyperbolic-like motion. Our analysis provides the first complete analytical expressions for these changes, thereby resolving long-standing ambiguities in the conservative and dissipative sectors of the dynamics at the fifth-post-Newtonian (5PN) order. The calculation explicitly determines the previously unknown 5PN radiation-reaction tail contributions to the scattering angle, establishing a crucial link between local dynamics and asymptotic waveform properties. This work not only confirms the intricate structure of the post-Newtonian expansion but also provides a robust analytical framework for future high-precision calculations of gravitational-wave emissions from unbound systems, with significant implications for the modeling of extreme mass-ratio inspirals and cosmological scattering events.
