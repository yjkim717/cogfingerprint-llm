To enhance computational efficiency in quantum chemistry simulations, we present a novel multi-GPU acceleration framework integrated into the QUICK program, leveraging ab initio Hartree-Fock and density functional theory methodologies. Implemented in 2021, this advancement achieves substantial parallel efficiency through optimized load balancing across multiple GPUs. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in computational time for electronic structure calculations, thereby accelerating research in quantum chemistry. This development underscores the potential of heterogeneous computing architectures in advancing the field of quantum chemistry and materials science.
