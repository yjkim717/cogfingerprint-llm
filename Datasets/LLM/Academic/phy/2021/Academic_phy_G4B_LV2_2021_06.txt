**Abstract**

Loop quantum gravity (LQG) represents a significant avenue within theoretical physics dedicated to reconciling general relativity with the principles of quantum mechanics. This review synthesizes current developments within LQG, a background-independent quantization of gravity predicated on the granular structure of spacetime geometry. Central to the theory is the hypothesis that spacetime itself is quantized, exhibiting discrete, rather than continuous, properties at the Planck scale. Consequently, classical notions of spacetime curvature break down, necessitating a reformulation utilizing spin networks and spin foams to describe quantum gravitational effects.  We explore the implications of LQG for cosmological models, specifically addressing its potential to provide a framework for understanding the initial singularity of the Big Bang and offering an alternative to inflationary scenarios.  Further investigation into observable signatures of LQG, such as modifications to the propagation of light, remains a crucial area of ongoing research within the field (2021).
