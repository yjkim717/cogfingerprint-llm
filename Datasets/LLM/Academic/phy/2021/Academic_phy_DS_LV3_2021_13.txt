In this study, we experimentally demonstrate an autonomous Maxwell demon implemented with a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin qutrit in diamond, achieving tunable dissipative dynamics through quantum measurement-based feedback. By engineering the system-environment interactions, we establish a protocol where the demon autonomously extracts work from thermal fluctuations without external control, leveraging real-time spin-state measurements to conditionally drive dissipative transitions. Our results reveal a clear violation of the classical thermodynamic bound under specific feedback parameters, corroborating theoretical models of quantum information thermodynamics. The achieved dissipative feedback control not only validates foundational principles of quantum thermodynamics but also enhances the NV center's utility in quantum sensing applications by mitigating decoherence. This work, conducted in 2021, provides a scalable platform for exploring quantum measurement dynamics and advancing energy-efficient quantum technologies.
