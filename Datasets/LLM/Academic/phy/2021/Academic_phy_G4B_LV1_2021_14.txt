**Topological Characterization of Critical Phenomena in Anti-de Sitter Black Hole Thermodynamics**

We investigate the thermodynamic landscape of anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes, extending traditional black hole thermodynamics by incorporating topological considerations. Utilizing a novel approach, we identify and classify critical points within the black hole’s event horizon, linked to phase transitions in the associated spacetime geometry. Specifically, we introduce the concept of a topological charge, quantified through a geometric measure of horizon curvature fluctuations, to differentiate between distinct black hole types.  Our analysis reveals that the presence and magnitude of this topological charge correlate directly with the stability and nature of these critical points.  These findings suggest a deeper connection between black hole physics and topological field theory, potentially offering a new framework for understanding emergent spacetime properties and the underlying dynamics of quantum gravity. Further investigation is warranted to explore the implications for holographic duality.
