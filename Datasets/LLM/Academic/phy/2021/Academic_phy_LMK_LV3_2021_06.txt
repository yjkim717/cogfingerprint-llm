"Abstract: This study examines the implications of loop quantum gravity on our understanding of spacetime geometry and black hole physics. By reconciling general relativity with quantum physics, loop quantum gravity provides a novel framework for describing the quantum nature of spacetime. As of 2021, recent advances in this field have significantly refined our understanding of black hole singularity resolution, underscoring the theory's potential to unify gravitational and quantum phenomena."
