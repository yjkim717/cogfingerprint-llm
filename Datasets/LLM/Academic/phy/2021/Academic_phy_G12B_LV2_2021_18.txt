**Abstract**

We present a novel dielectric metasurface platform for dynamic control of femtosecond pulse polarization and wavefront shaping. Utilizing the broadband transparency and strong Kerr nonlinearity of high-index dielectric resonators, our device enables precise manipulation of temporal polarization states within ultrashort pulses. This approach allows for the generation of complex spatiotemporal wavefronts, extending beyond traditional spatial shaping capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate robust polarization control and complex wavefront reconstruction, highlighting the potential of dielectric metasurfaces for advanced applications in nonlinear optics, quantum control, and high-resolution imaging. This work advances the field by offering a compact and efficient solution for pulse shaping.
