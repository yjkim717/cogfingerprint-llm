**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in integrated photonics have spurred interest in deterministic multi-photon state manipulation for quantum information processing. This work presents a novel segmented coupled waveguide array architecture facilitating efficient on-chip tomography of multi-photon split states. The key innovation lies in the arrayâ€™s design, which obviates the need for dynamic reconfiguration, a significant limitation of previous approaches. Utilizing this system, we demonstrate the capability to perform tomography with high fidelity, crucial for characterizing complex quantum circuits fabricated on-chip. The segmented structure promotes controlled photon splitting and minimizes detrimental crosstalk, representing a substantial step toward scalable quantum photonic devices and their integration within optical quantum circuits.
