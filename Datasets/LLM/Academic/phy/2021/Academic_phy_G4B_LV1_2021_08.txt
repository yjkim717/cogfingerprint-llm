**Temporal Relationality: A Comparative Analysis of Neuroscience and the Block Universe Paradigm**

This study investigates the conceptual divergence between neuroscientific accounts of temporal experience and the theoretical framework of the block universe, as posited within relativistic physics. Traditional neuroscience posits a dynamic, present-focused experience, intrinsically linked to neural processing and memory reconstruction. Conversely, the block universe model, rooted in Einstein’s theory of general relativity, represents spacetime as a single, unchanging four-dimensional continuum – a ‘block’ wherein all past, present, and future events exist simultaneously. We argue that resolving the apparent contradiction necessitates a deeper examination of relationality.  This paper explores how subjective temporal perception may be fundamentally tied to an observer’s specific coordinate within this pre-determined spacetime block, suggesting a potential bridge between physical and experiential notions of time.  Further research is warranted to explore this interaction.

**Note:** I’ve aimed for a tone and style consistent with a physics publication, incorporating terms like “relationality,” “four-dimensional continuum,” and “coordinate” within a structured argument.  Let me know if you’d like me to adjust the abstract’s focus or length!
