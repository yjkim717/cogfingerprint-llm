**Abstract:**

The manipulation and independent detection of angular momentum states in light represent a cornerstone for advanced optical technologies, including optical communications, microscopy, and quantum information processing. While orbital angular momentum (OAM) has received considerable attention, the simultaneous and decoupled measurement of OAM and spin angular momentum (SAM) remains a significant challenge. This work introduces a novel metasurface-based platform enabling the independent detection and sorting of both OAM and SAM degrees of freedom within a single device. Our design exploits photonic momentum transformation principles to spatially separate incident beams based on their combined angular momentum characteristics. Specifically, the metasurface is engineered to induce a momentum shift dependent on the SAM state, effectively decoupling it from the OAM-dependent phase profile. This decoupling enables the independent measurement of each angular momentum component through spatially resolved detection.  We present a theoretical framework detailing the momentum transformation mechanisms and validate the design through rigorous electromagnetic simulations. The results demonstrate high-fidelity separation of OAM and SAM states across a range of input wavelengths and incident angles. This approach offers a significant advancement over existing techniques, providing a compact and efficient route to simultaneous angular momentum sorting. The demonstrated capabilities pave the way for advanced optical sensing, high-capacity data encoding, and novel quantum optics applications requiring precise control and characterization of both spin and orbital angular momenta.
