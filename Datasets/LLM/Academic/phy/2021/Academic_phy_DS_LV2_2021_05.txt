**Abstract**

The persistent discrepancy between early- and late-universe determinations of the Hubble constant (H₀), a key parameter of cosmological models, presents a potential challenge to the standard ΛCDM paradigm. While measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) from the *Planck* satellite anchor the early-universe value, local distance-ladder methods, particularly those calibrated with Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), have consistently yielded higher values, suggesting a possible requirement for new physics. This study addresses this tension by presenting a refined calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, a crucial first rung in the cosmological distance ladder that is independent of Cepheid variables. We report a new, precise TRGB calibration derived from geometric distance measurements, which we subsequently apply to a sample of SNe Ia hosts. Our analysis yields a local measurement of H₀ = 69.8 ± 0.6 (stat.) ± 1.6 (sys.) km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹. This result demonstrates a high degree of consistency with the *Planck* CMB inference of H₀ within the ΛCDM framework. The precision of our measurement, achieved through a rigorous quantification of systematic uncertainties, significantly reduces the statistical significance of the reported H₀ tension. We conclude that, when employing the TRGB as a primary calibrator, the data are concordant with the standard cosmological model, obviating the need for exotic physics to resolve the Hubble tension at the present level of observational precision.
