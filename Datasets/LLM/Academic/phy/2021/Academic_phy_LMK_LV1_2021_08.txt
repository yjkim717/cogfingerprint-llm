Title: Reconciling Temporal Perspectives: A Theoretical Framework for Integrating Neuroscientific and Relativistic Conceptions of Time

Abstract:
The disparate conceptualizations of time in neuroscience and theoretical physics have significant implications for our understanding of complex cognitive processes and the fabric of spacetime. In neuroscience, time is often viewed as a subjective, relative, and context-dependent construct, intricately linked to memory formation and retrieval. Conversely, theoretical physics, particularly relativity, describes time as an objective, dimension-like entity, inextricably woven into the spacetime continuum. This dichotomy raises fundamental questions regarding causality, the arrow of time, and the feasibility of time travel. By employing a multidisciplinary approach, this paper seeks to reconcile these divergent perspectives, leveraging insights from both fields to develop a more comprehensive understanding of time. Through a critical examination of the neural correlates of time perception and the relativistic notion of spacetime, we propose a novel theoretical framework that integrates the subjective and objective aspects of time, providing a more nuanced understanding of this multifaceted concept.
