Title: Accelerating Ab Initio Calculations with Multi-GPU Implementation of Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory

Abstract:
We present a novel multi-GPU accelerated implementation of the Hartree-Fock and density functional theory methods within the QUICK program, leveraging a load balancing algorithm to optimize the distribution of computational tasks across multiple graphics processing units (GPUs). By harnessing the massively parallel architecture of modern GPUs, our implementation achieves significant speedup in the computation of quantum interaction energies. The quantum interaction computational kernel is optimized for efficient execution on multiple GPUs, enabling the simulation of large molecular systems. Benchmarks demonstrate high parallel efficiency, with near-linear scaling observed for systems comprising hundreds of atoms. Our results underscore the potential of multi-GPU acceleration to revolutionize ab initio calculations, enabling the simulation of complex molecular phenomena with unprecedented accuracy and speed.
