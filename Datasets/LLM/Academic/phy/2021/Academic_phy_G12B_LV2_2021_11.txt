## Abstract: A Linear Chaos Energy Bound and its Implications for Hamiltonian Dynamics

Recent investigations into quantum chaos have revealed a tight connection between out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) and the Lyapunov exponent, a key indicator of classical chaos. This work proposes a novel `chaos energy bound`, postulating that the Lyapunov exponent's growth rate scales linearly with the system's energy, offering a generalized constraint applicable to both classical and quantum systems governed by Hamiltonian mechanics. We argue that this bound, analogous to the Maldacena SSS bound within the context of holographic duality, represents a fundamental limit on the scrambling of information within a physical system. 

Our analysis utilizes established theoretical frameworks connecting OTOC behavior to classical Lyapunov spectra, demonstrating the consistency of the proposed bound. Furthermore, we explore the implications of this linear scaling for the thermalization process and the emergence of quantum chaos. This bound offers a valuable tool for characterizing the chaoticity of diverse systems, from isolated quantum many-body systems to classical Hamiltonian dynamics, and provides a new perspective on the interplay between energy, information scrambling, and the onset of chaos in physical systems.  Future work will focus on testing this bound across various experimental platforms and exploring its connection to other bounds on quantum information growth.
