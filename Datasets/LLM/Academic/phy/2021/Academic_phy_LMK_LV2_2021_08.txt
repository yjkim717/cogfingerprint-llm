Title: Convergent Perspectives on Time: Integrating Neuroscience and Theoretical Physics

Abstract:

The concept of time remains a contentious issue across disciplines, with neuroscientists and theoretical physicists offering distinct interpretations. Recent advances in our understanding of time perception and the spacetime continuum have underscored the need for an interdisciplinary approach. This paper examines the divergent understandings of time in neuroscience and theoretical physics, with particular emphasis on the implications for concepts such as time travel and the block universe theory. By synthesizing insights from relativity and the neural basis of time perception, we argue that a more nuanced understanding of time can be achieved. We propose a framework that reconciles the subjective experience of time with the objective features of spacetime, providing a more comprehensive understanding of this fundamental concept. Our analysis has significant implications for our understanding of the nature of time and its role in the universe, as of 2021.
