Title: Topological Insights into Black Hole Thermodynamics: A Classification of Critical Points

Abstract:
The application of topological concepts to black hole thermodynamics has led to a deeper understanding of the phase transitions occurring in these systems. By introducing Duan's topological current, we reveal that critical points can be classified into two distinct categories, corresponding to different topological charges. Our analysis, grounded in the framework of black hole thermodynamics, demonstrates that various black hole solutions can be grouped into distinct topological classes. Specifically, we show that the topological charge associated with a critical point is intimately linked to the thermodynamic properties of the black hole. This classification provides a novel perspective on the phase transitions exhibited by black holes, shedding light on the underlying topological structure. Our findings, presented in the context of recent advances in black hole thermodynamics (as of 2021), underscore the significance of topological considerations in understanding these complex systems.
