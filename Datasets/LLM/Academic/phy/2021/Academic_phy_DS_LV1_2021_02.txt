**Abstract**

The proposed multi-TeV muon collider represents a transformative facility for probing the electroweak sector and discovering new physics. Its high-energy, high-luminosity environment offers a uniquely clean experimental signature compared to hadron colliders, enabling precision studies of electroweak symmetry breaking and the properties of the Higgs boson. Crucially, the production of electroweak gauge bosons through vector boson fusion and bremsstrahlung provides a sensitive laboratory for investigating anomalous triple and quartic gauge couplings. Furthermore, the collider's energy reach is ideally suited for direct searches for dark matter candidates and other weakly-coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. In the context of 2021, with the LHC program advancing, this work underscores the muon collider as an essential successor for addressing fundamental questions in particle physics at the energy frontier.
