**Abstract**

This paper critically examines the ontological status of temporal passage within the framework of modern theoretical physics, contrasting it with neuroscientific models of a perceived "flow" of time. While our fundamental physical theories—from general relativity to quantum field theory—describe a four-dimensional "block universe" where all events exist eternally in a static spacetime manifold, human consciousness consistently reports a unidirectional progression from a fixed past to an open future. We argue that this dichotomy necessitates a rigorous philosophical distinction between the objective, tenseless time of physics and the subjective, tensed time of conscious experience. By analyzing the implications of the block model for concepts such as causality, determinism, and the possibility of time travel, we conclude that the "flow" of time is not a feature of the physical world but an emergent, psychological construct. This analysis reinforces the block universe as the most coherent description of temporal reality, compelling a re-evaluation of time's arrow as a product of thermodynamic and cognitive processes rather than a fundamental property of spacetime itself.
