In 2021, Shao-Wen Wei's seminal work established a topological framework for black hole thermodynamics by applying Duan's Ï•-mapping theory to the thermodynamic phase space of anti-de Sitter black holes. This approach assigns a topological charge to critical points, classifying them into conventional and novel categories based on their global properties. Conventional critical points exhibit a topological charge of +1 and are associated with standard van der Waals-type phase transitions. In contrast, novel critical points possess a charge of -1, revealing previously unclassified phase transition behaviors that challenge traditional thermodynamic classifications. The study demonstrates that this topological classification provides a more fundamental understanding of phase structure, transcending local analysis. By treating critical points as topological defects in the thermodynamic parameter space, this formalism offers a unified method to predict and characterize black hole phase transitions, thereby enriching our comprehension of gravitational systems and their analogies with conventional condensed matter physics.
