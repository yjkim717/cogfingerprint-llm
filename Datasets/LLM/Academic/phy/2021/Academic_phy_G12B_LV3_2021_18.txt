"We present a novel approach to femtosecond pulse manipulation utilizing a dielectric metasurface platform. This design facilitates precise control over temporal polarization states within the near-infrared regime, enabling advanced pulse shaping capabilities. Our multifunctional metasurface architecture allows for the simultaneous engineering of complex wavefronts alongside manipulation of temporal polarization, offering a degree of freedom previously challenging to achieve. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to tailor pulse characteristics with high fidelity, paving the way for applications in nonlinear microscopy, quantum optics, and high-resolution imaging. This work advances the field of nanophotonics by integrating spatial and temporal control within a compact, all-dielectric device."
