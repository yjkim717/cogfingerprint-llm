**Abstract**

The impending Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory promises to discover millions of supernovae (SNe), vastly exceeding the capacity for spectroscopic follow-up. Consequently, the reliance on photometric classification using light curves alone will be paramount for cosmological and astrophysical studies. This investigation rigorously quantifies the impact of the LSST's observing strategy on the performance of photometric supernova classification. We generate a comprehensive suite of simulated multi-band light curves for Type Ia, Ibc, and II SNe, incorporating realistic noise models and the cadence variations inherent in the baseline LSST observing strategy. To address the challenge of irregularly sampled data, we employ Gaussian Process (GP) regression to interpolate and smooth the photometric observations, constructing continuous light curve models. A classification pipeline, leveraging features extracted from these GP-interpolated models, is then implemented and evaluated. Our results demonstrate a significant dependency of classification accuracy on the specific cadence and season length dictated by the observing strategy. We identify that strategies with more frequent sampling in the rest-frame near-peak epochs yield a marked improvement in the discrimination between Type Ia and core-collapse SNe, with purity and completeness increasing by up to 15-20% for certain sub-classes. Conversely, gaps in coverage during critical photometric phases are shown to be a primary source of misclassification. These findings provide critical, quantitative feedback for the ongoing optimization of the LSST observing strategy, underscoring that strategic scheduling is not merely a logistical concern but a fundamental determinant of the scientific yield in the era of time-domain astronomy.
