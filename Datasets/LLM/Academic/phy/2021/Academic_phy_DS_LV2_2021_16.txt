We investigate the asymptotic symmetry structure of five-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes using Hamiltonian methods. Our analysis reveals a significant departure from the four-dimensional case: the asymptotic symmetry algebra undergoes a nonlinear deformation, which cannot be represented as a standard central extension of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs algebra. This deformation is characterized by the emergence of nontrivial, field-dependent central charges in the Poisson bracket algebra of the canonical generators. These charges arise from the specific fall-off conditions on the gravitational field at null infinity and are intrinsically linked to the nonlinear nature of the five-dimensional Einstein equations. This result, established in 2021, demonstrates a fundamental structural difference in the infrared structure of gravity between four and five dimensions, with potential implications for the memory effect and soft theorems in higher-dimensional spacetimes.
