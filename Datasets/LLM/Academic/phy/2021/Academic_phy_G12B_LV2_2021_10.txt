**Abstract**

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is a crucial electrochemical process for sustainable hydrogen production, and the exploration of earth-abundant transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as electrocatalysts remains a vibrant area of research. This study leverages grand canonical potential kinetics (GCPK) to provide a detailed mechanistic understanding of HER on tungsten diselenide (WSe₂) and tungsten ditelluride (WTe₂) – two prominent TMD materials exhibiting the 1T’ phase.  Unlike traditional density functional theory (DFT) based approaches, GCPK allows for a more accurate description of the reaction landscape by directly incorporating the effects of finite carrier densities and fluctuating surface conditions, particularly the presence of vacant sites.  Our simulations reveal distinct reaction pathways for WSe₂ and WTe₂, highlighting the critical role of surface defect chemistry in catalytic performance. Specifically, we observe that vacant sites significantly lower the activation barriers for key proton transfer steps, influencing the overall reaction kinetics. Furthermore, GCPK facilitates the prediction of optimal doping strategies and surface reconstructions that can enhance HER activity.  These findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing HER on TMDs, offering a rational design framework for the development of high-performance, cost-effective electrocatalysts. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge utilizing non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to accelerate materials discovery for energy applications.
