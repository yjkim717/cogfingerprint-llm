**Abstract**

This work examines the landscape of 4-dimensional SU(N) chiral gauge theories, employing a novel classification scheme to delineate their distinct infrared phases. Utilizing techniques rooted in su(n) gauge theory, we investigate the emergence of novel ‘t Hooft anomalies within these models, specifically examining their influence on condensate formation.  A central focus is the intricate relationship between confinement dynamics, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the associated topological quantum field theories (TQFTs).  Our analysis demonstrates that TQFT constraints significantly limit the spectrum of viable infrared condensates, dictating the stability of the resulting phase structure.  Furthermore, we propose that these anomalies provide a crucial diagnostic tool for identifying and characterizing the subtle interplay between gauge symmetry, topology, and confinement in these complex theoretical frameworks.  The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the fundamental building blocks of strongly coupled gauge theories.
