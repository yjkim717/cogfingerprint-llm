**Abstract**

Recent advancements in energy storage necessitate innovative anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. This research details the synthesis and characterization of a novel A-site deficient lithium lanthanum niobate (LLNO) perovskite, demonstrating exceptional lithium-ion storage potential. Specifically, the material’s structural deficiency, resulting in reduced lattice strain, facilitates enhanced ion transport pathways, leading to improved rate performance during electrochemical cycling. Impedance spectroscopy reveals a lower charge transfer resistance compared to conventional anode materials.  Analysis of cycling data indicates remarkable long-term stability, retaining over 90% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 mA/cm². These findings suggest that strategically engineered A-site deficiencies within perovskite structures represent a promising avenue for developing high-performance anodes, contributing to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies.
