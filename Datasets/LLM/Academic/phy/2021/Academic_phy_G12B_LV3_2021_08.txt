**Abstract**

The conceptualization of time presents a persistent dichotomy across disciplines. While neuroscience predominantly frames time perception as a sequential, directed flow – an emergent property of neural processing – theoretical physics, particularly within the framework of relativity, posits time as a dimension intricately interwoven with space within a four-dimensional spacetime continuum. This divergence raises fundamental questions regarding the nature of temporal reality and its relationship to observation. This paper examines the implications of the block universe model, wherein all moments in time exist simultaneously, and contrasts it with the neuroscientific experience of temporal passage. We explore potential avenues for reconciliation, considering how observer-dependent effects in physics might inform our understanding of subjective time perception, acknowledging the ongoing debate surrounding the arrow of time and its physical basis.
