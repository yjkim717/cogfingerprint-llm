In this review, we examine recent advances in loop quantum gravity (LQG) as a non-perturbative quantization of spacetime geometry, addressing the long-standing tension between general relativity and quantum physics. By recasting Einstein’s equations in terms of holonomies and fluxes, LQG yields a discrete quantum structure of space. We focus on cosmological applications, particularly the resolution of the big bang singularity, replaced in LQG by a quantum bounce. Recent numerical and analytical results from effective dynamics are discussed, highlighting observational signatures and potential links to cosmic microwave background anomalies. This synthesis underscores LQG’s capacity to describe Planck-scale physics while offering testable predictions for the early universe.
