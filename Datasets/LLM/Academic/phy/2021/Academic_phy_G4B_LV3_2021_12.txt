**Abstract**

The efficient computation of electronic structure remains a critical bottleneck in many areas of condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry. This work presents a novel, multi-GPU accelerated implementation of the QUantum Interaction Computational Kernel (QUICK) program, designed to overcome these limitations. Utilizing an *ab initio* approach based on the Hartree-Fock method, our optimized code demonstrates substantial improvements in computational throughput for medium to large molecular systems. Specifically, the parallelization strategy leverages the architecture of modern GPU clusters, facilitating a ‘quick’ and scalable solution for complex electronic structure problems.  Benchmarking results indicate a significant reduction in computational time compared to traditional serial implementations, enabling researchers to tackle systems previously intractable within reasonable timescales.  Further investigation reveals that the multi-GPU architecture allows for a more accurate representation of electron correlation, albeit with increased memory demands.  This advancement contributes to the broader field of electronic structure theory, providing a valuable tool for exploring novel materials and chemical phenomena.
