**Abstract**

The computational demands of *ab initio* quantum chemical calculations, particularly those employing Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) methodologies, present a significant bottleneck in modern materials science and computational chemistry. To address this, we report a novel implementation of multi-GPU acceleration within the QUICK program, designed to enhance performance for medium to large molecular systems. This work details the parallelization strategy, focusing on achieving optimal load balancing across heterogeneous NVIDIA GPU architectures. Performance analysis reveals substantial speedups compared to single-GPU execution and demonstrates high parallel efficiency, scaling favorably with increasing GPU core counts. The implementation leverages optimized communication protocols and data management techniques to minimize inter-GPU overhead. Results obtained on a range of molecular systems demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in reducing computational time for both HF and DFT calculations, facilitating more extensive explorations of chemical space and enabling the study of complex systems previously intractable with traditional computational resources. This advancement contributes to the broader effort of accelerating quantum chemical simulations, a critical area for advancing scientific discovery.
