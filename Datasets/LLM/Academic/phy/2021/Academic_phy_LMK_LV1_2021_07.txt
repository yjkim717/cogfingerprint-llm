Title: Radiative Losses and Radiation-Reaction Effects in Gravitational Scattering: A Post-Newtonian Expansion Approach

Abstract:

This study investigates the impact of radiative losses on the classical scattering of two point masses within the framework of General Relativity. Employing the variation-of-constants method, we derive the radiation-reaction effects on the gravitational scattering process. Our analysis is based on a post-Newtonian expansion, allowing for a systematic treatment of the relativistic corrections. We compute the radiative losses to the 4th post-Newtonian order, thereby capturing the leading-order effects of gravitational wave emission. The radiation-reaction force is subsequently derived, incorporating the backreaction of the emitted radiation on the binary's dynamics. Our results demonstrate the significance of radiation-reaction effects in accurately predicting the scattering outcomes. The findings presented herein contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between gravitational scattering, radiative losses, and radiation-reaction effects, shedding new light on the complex dynamics of binary systems in the context of General Relativity (2021).
