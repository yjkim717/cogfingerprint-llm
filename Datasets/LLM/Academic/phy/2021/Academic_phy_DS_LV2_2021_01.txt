In this work, we present a rigorous mathematical framework demonstrating that any quantum system can be systematically approximated by classical deterministic models with local hidden variables. Our approach employs novel phase-space representations that preserve quantum correlations while maintaining strict locality conditions. Through extensive numerical simulations of entangled states, we show that the statistical predictions of quantum mechanics can be reproduced within experimental error margins without violating relativistic causality. This challenges the conventional interpretation of Bell's theorem by revealing that the theorem's inequalities can be satisfied through carefully constructed deterministic dynamics. Our results suggest that quantum phenomena may emerge from underlying classical processes, providing new pathways for unifying quantum mechanics with classical physics and opening alternative approaches to quantum computation simulation.
