## A Muon Collider: Precision Electroweak Measurements and the Prospect of New Physics Discovery

**Abstract**

The pursuit of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) necessitates exploration of higher energy scales and improved precision in electroweak (EW) measurements. This work examines the compelling physics case for a high-energy muon collider as a powerful tool for addressing these needs. Unlike hadron colliders, muon colliders offer exceptionally clean experimental environments, largely free from the complexities of underlying events and parton showering, enabling unparalleled precision in the determination of EW parameters. Critically, the dominant background to BSM searches is electroweak radiation (EWRL), which, while posing a significant challenge for detector design and luminosity, can be precisely modeled and mitigated. We detail the potential for probing a wide range of BSM scenarios, including leptoquarks, Z' bosons, and weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), through simplified models.  Specifically, we explore sensitivity to scales beyond reach at the LHC, particularly at center-of-mass energies in the TeV range.  This study underscores that a muon collider, with its unique combination of luminosity, energy reach, and clean experimental conditions, represents a crucial next step in the quest for new physics, offering a complementary and potentially decisive path to discoveries beyond the Standard Model.  The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of such a facility remain key considerations for the future of particle physics.
