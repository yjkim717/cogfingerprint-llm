**Abstract**

The impending commencement of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory necessitates a rigorous quantification of how its observing strategy influences the scientific yield of time-domain astronomy. This investigation focuses on the critical task of photometric classification of Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae, a cornerstone of cosmological and astrophysical inquiry. We present a comprehensive analysis of classification efficacy as a function of LSST's cadence parameters, employing a suite of simulated multi-band light curves. To mitigate the inherent sparsity and irregular sampling of the survey data, we utilize Gaussian Process (GP) interpolation to reconstruct continuous flux evolution from discrete observations. Our methodology involves generating a fiducial population of supernovae, subjecting them to a range of plausible LSST observing cadences, and subsequently applying GP regression to homogenize the data for a standardized machine learning classifier. We demonstrate that cadence is a dominant systematic, with significant implications for classification purity and completeness. Specifically, we find that while a rapid, uniform cadence maximizes overall accuracy, strategic alterations, such as increased depth during specific cosmological rest-frame epochs, can disproportionately enhance the confident identification of key subclasses. These results provide quantitative metrics to optimize the LSST observing strategy, underscoring that the temporal sampling pattern is not merely an operational detail but a fundamental determinant of the survey's capability to unlock the dynamic sky.
