Title: Evaluating the Impact of LSST Observing Strategy on Photometric Classification of Supernovae

Abstract:
The forthcoming Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will revolutionize the field of supernova (SN) research by detecting an unprecedented number of SN events. However, the sheer volume of data will necessitate reliance on photometric classification methods. In this study, we investigate the impact of LSST observing strategy on the photometric classification of supernovae using simulated light curves. We employ a Monte Carlo simulation framework to generate SN light curves under different LSST observing cadences. Our results indicate that the classification accuracy is sensitive to the observing strategy, with the rolling cadence outperforming the random cadence by 10% in terms of classification purity. Furthermore, we find that the inclusion of u-band observations significantly enhances classification performance. Our findings have significant implications for optimizing the LSST observing strategy to maximize the scientific returns from SN research. The results of this study will inform the development of future photometric classification algorithms and LSST survey design. (Year: 2021)
