**Abstract:**

The pursuit of high-performance anode materials remains a critical challenge in advancing lithium-ion battery technology. This study investigates a novel approach utilizing lithium lanthanum niobate (LLNO), a perovskite oxide, as an anode material exhibiting exceptional lithium-ion storage characteristics. A key feature of the synthesized LLNO is the intentional introduction of A-site deficiency, strategically modulating its electronic and ionic conductivity. Electrochemical analysis reveals a substantial capacity for reversible Li+ storage, coupled with remarkable cycling stability attributable to a minimized volume change during lithiation/delithiation processes.  Notably, the observed low strain is hypothesized to stem from the inherent structural flexibility afforded by the A-site vacancies. Furthermore, *in situ* characterization suggests that the A-site deficiency promotes the formation of preferential lithium-ion transport pathways, facilitating accelerated charge and discharge rates. These findings highlight the potential of A-site deficient perovskites, specifically LLNO, as promising candidates for next-generation lithium-ion battery anodes and warrant further investigation into the relationship between structural defects and electrochemical performance.
