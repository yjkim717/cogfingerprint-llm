In this work, we present a systematic investigation of four-dimensional SU(N) chiral gauge theories, uncovering previously unidentified mixed 't Hooft anomalies that impose stringent constraints on their infrared dynamics. Through the framework of topological quantum field theory, we demonstrate how these anomalies—arising from intricate interplay between global symmetries and gauge structure—create fundamental obstructions to symmetric gapped phases. Our analysis reveals that conventional confinement scenarios must either be accompanied by spontaneous symmetry breaking or give way to exotic infrared phases such as composite fermion dynamics or topological order. The revealed anomaly matching conditions provide powerful diagnostics for distinguishing between competing infrared scenarios, particularly illuminating the phase structure of theories with fermions in complex representations. These findings, established through cobordism classification and anomaly inflow mechanisms, resolve longstanding questions regarding the consistency of chiral confinement while opening new avenues for exploring strongly-coupled phenomena beyond QCD. This work establishes 't Hooft anomalies as definitive probes into the non-perturbative dynamics of chiral gauge theories.
