**Abstract**

The manipulation and characterization of angular momentum in photons represent a burgeoning area of research with significant implications for advanced optical technologies. This study details the development of a novel spin-decoupled metasurface architecture designed for simultaneous detection of both spin and orbital angular momentum. Utilizing a precisely engineered periodic structure, the metasurface facilitates photonic momentum transformation, effectively decoupling the intrinsic spin degree of freedom from the propagating wavefront.  Experimental results demonstrate the ability to precisely control and resolve the vectorial nature of light, enabling sensitive measurements of both angular momentum components. Furthermore, we introduce a novel vortex recognition algorithm predicated on analyzing the metasurfaceâ€™s response, offering a robust method for identifying and classifying complex beam geometries.  These findings contribute to a fundamental advancement in optical momentum sensing and pave the way for applications in quantum optics and secure communication protocols.
