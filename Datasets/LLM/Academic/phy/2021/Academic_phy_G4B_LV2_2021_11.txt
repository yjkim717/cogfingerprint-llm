**Abstract**

The characterization of chaotic dynamics within quantum systems remains a central challenge in theoretical physics. This work introduces a novel ‘chaos energy bound,’ predicated on the observation that the Lyapunov exponent, a key indicator of chaotic itineracy, exhibits a linear growth relationship with system energy in the high-energy regime. This proposition is rigorously grounded in thermodynamic consistency, aligning with established principles of energy dissipation and entropy production. Utilizing a classical Hamiltonian model, we demonstrate that the proposed bound emerges as a natural consequence of the system’s evolving energy landscape. Specifically, the Lyapunov exponent’s scaling with energy is linked to the temporal evolution of energy fluxes, reflecting a transition towards increasingly complex and sensitive dynamics.  Further investigation employing out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) will delineate the precise mechanisms driving this energy-dependent chaos. This framework offers a new perspective on quantifying and understanding chaotic behavior in quantum systems, potentially impacting our comprehension of transport phenomena and quantum thermalization.
