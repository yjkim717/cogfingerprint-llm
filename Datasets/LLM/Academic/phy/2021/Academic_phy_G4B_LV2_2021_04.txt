**Abstract**

Recent developments in string theory have increasingly emphasized the role of the Swampland – a landscape of constraints designed to exclude non-physical solutions – in determining the viability of effective field theories. This work investigates Swampland effects on 8d supergravity, employing a novel worldvolume theory approach to constrain its internal geometry. Specifically, we utilize 3-brane probes to systematically probe the spacetime topology, leveraging the cobordism conjecture to identify permissible internal structures. Our analysis reveals that the presence of these probes induces significant restrictions on the allowed gauge algebras within the 8d supergravity framework.  These constraints emerge as a direct consequence of demanding consistency with Swampland conditions, effectively eliminating configurations incompatible with a consistent gauge theory. The resulting geometric restrictions offer a concrete illustration of how Swampland principles can dictate the fundamental properties of spacetime, providing valuable insights into the landscape of possible 8d supergravity solutions and their gauge symmetries.  This research was completed in 2021.
