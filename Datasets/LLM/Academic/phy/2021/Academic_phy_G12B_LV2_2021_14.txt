Here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a physics publication, based on the provided summary and contextualized for 2021:

**Abstract**

The thermodynamic behavior of black holes, particularly in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, continues to offer profound insights into the intersection of gravity, thermodynamics, and quantum field theory. This work explores a novel connection between black hole thermodynamics and topological invariants, demonstrating that critical points in the phase diagrams of AdS black holes possess non-trivial topological charges. Specifically, we establish a framework for characterizing these critical points using topological charge as a classification parameter, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying phase transitions. Our analysis reveals a hitherto unexplored relationship between the geometry of spacetime and the thermodynamic properties exhibited near criticality. This topological perspective provides a new lens through which to examine the emergence of scale invariance and fluctuations near critical phenomena in strongly coupled gravitational systems, potentially offering avenues for exploring holographic dualities and connections to condensed matter physics. The implications for understanding the fundamental nature of black hole criticality are discussed.
