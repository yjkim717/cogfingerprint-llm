Title: Bounding Chaos: A Lyapunov Exponent Constraint in High-Energy Hamiltonian Systems

Abstract:
In the realm of Hamiltonian mechanics, the relationship between energy and chaos has garnered significant attention. This study posits a novel constraint on the Lyapunov exponent, a quantifier of chaotic dynamics, in high-energy regimes. We conjecture a chaos energy bound, asserting that the Lyapunov exponent grows at most linearly with the total energy. This proposition is substantiated by examining the behavior of out-of-time-order correlators, which serve as a diagnostic for chaotic dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that this bound is consistent with thermodynamic principles, thereby ensuring its physical viability. The conjectured chaos energy bound has far-reaching implications for understanding the interplay between energy and chaos in complex systems. By establishing a fundamental limit on the Lyapunov exponent, this work contributes to the ongoing exploration of chaos in Hamiltonian systems.
