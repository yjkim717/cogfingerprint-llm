**Abstract**

The pursuit of novel physics beyond the Standard Model necessitates increasingly sophisticated experimental strategies. This work posits that a next-generation muon collider represents a compelling and comparatively accessible avenue for exploring fundamental symmetries and potential dark matter candidates. Leveraging the unique properties of muon beams – high mass and intrinsic polarization – the collider offers a distinct advantage in probing electroweak symmetry breaking (ESB) and searching for subtle deviations from predicted behavior.  Specifically, we argue that a high-luminosity muon collider could provide crucial data to constrain simplified dark matter models, particularly those invoking mediator particles mediating interactions with Standard Model fermions.  Complementary to ongoing investigations at the Large Hadron Collider, a muon collider’s sensitivity to suppressed decay modes and narrow width resonances offers a complementary approach.  Furthermore, the facility’s potential for precision measurements of Z boson properties strengthens its role within the broader framework of high-energy physics research, solidifying its value as a pivotal tool in 2021 and beyond.
