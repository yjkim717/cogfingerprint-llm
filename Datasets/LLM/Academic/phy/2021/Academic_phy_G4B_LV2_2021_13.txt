**Abstract**

This work presents a novel experimental demonstration of dissipative dynamics within a quantum thermodynamic system, specifically utilizing a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center as a controllable spin qutrit. Leveraging a feedback mechanism analogous to a Maxwell demon, we achieve autonomous control over the NV centerâ€™s quantum state evolution. The core innovation lies in the implementation of a dissipative feedback loop engineered to selectively manipulate the coherence of the qutrit, effectively extracting information and altering its thermodynamic trajectory.  Our experimental setup, utilizing precisely calibrated microwave pulses and NV center spin state detection, allows for a detailed investigation into the interplay between quantum coherence, dissipation, and active control.  The observed behavior validates theoretical frameworks connecting quantum thermodynamics and Maxwell demon concepts, offering a tangible platform for exploring fundamental questions surrounding information processing and entropy generation at the nanoscale.  Preliminary results, reported in 2021, suggest significant potential for utilizing NV centers as building blocks for future quantum information devices.
