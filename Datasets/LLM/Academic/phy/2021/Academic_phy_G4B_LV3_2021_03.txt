**Abstract**

Recent theoretical investigations leveraging string theory offer compelling avenues for revising conventional black hole paradigms. This study examines the Horowitz-Polchinski self-gravitating string solution, a cornerstone of stringy black hole physics, revealing nuanced distinctions in its behavior across heterotic and type II string configurations. Utilizing a linear sigma model analysis, we demonstrate a continuous, albeit complex, transition in the solution’s properties within the heterotic sector. Critically, our results suggest a potential fuzzball-like construction emerges for charged black hole configurations, challenging the prevailing singularity hypothesis. These findings imply that black holes, rather than representing points of infinite density, may instead embody highly complex, extended geometries – “fuzzballs” – consistent with string theory’s holographic principle. Further research is warranted to fully characterize these emergent structures and their implications for thermodynamics and information theory, particularly within the context of black hole entropy.
