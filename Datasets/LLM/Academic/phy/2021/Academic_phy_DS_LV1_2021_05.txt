**Abstract**

The persistent discrepancy between late-universe and early-universe measurements of the Hubble constant (H₀), a key parameter of cosmological models, presents a potential challenge to the standard ΛCDM paradigm. While the Planck collaboration's analysis of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anchors the early-universe value, local distance-ladder calibrations, predominantly reliant on Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), have consistently yielded higher values, suggesting a possible crisis in cosmology. This work addresses this tension by refining the calibration of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, a robust standard candle that provides an independent pathway to H₀. We present an updated geometric calibration of the TRGB luminosity in the Large Magellanic Cloud, leveraging recent parallax measurements from the Gaia mission, which significantly reduces systematic uncertainties associated with the distance scale. Applying this refined calibration to a sample of SNe Ia hosts, we derive a local value of H₀ = 69.8 ± 1.7 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹. This result demonstrates no statistically significant tension with the CMB-inferred value from Planck. Our findings indicate that the previously reported H₀ discrepancy may be attributable to unaccounted-for systematics in other distance-ladder anchors rather than new physics, thereby providing strong support for the enduring validity of the standard ΛCDM model.
