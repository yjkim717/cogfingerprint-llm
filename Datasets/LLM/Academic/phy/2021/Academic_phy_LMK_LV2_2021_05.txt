Title: A Consistent Hubble Constant Measurement via the TRGB Method using Gaia Data Release 3 and Type Ia Supernovae Calibrators

Abstract:

The Hubble constant (H0), a fundamental parameter in cosmology, has been a subject of intense debate due to the persistent discrepancy between its direct measurements and the value inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation within the standard ΛCDM cosmological model. In this study, we present a new determination of H0 using the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, leveraging the recent Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3) and a sample of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as calibrators. By applying the TRGB method to nearby galaxies hosting SNe Ia, we establish a robust distance ladder to anchor the SN Ia magnitude-redshift relation. Our analysis yields a Hubble constant of H0 = 67.4 ± 1.2 km s−1 Mpc−1, consistent with the CMB-inferred value of 67.4 ± 0.5 km s−1 Mpc−1 from the Planck satellite. The achieved precision of ∼1.8% is competitive with other state-of-the-art measurements and provides a significant constraint on the Hubble tension. Our result supports the validity of the standard cosmological model and highlights the importance of precise distance measurements in resolving the ongoing debate surrounding H0. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the power of combining GDR3 parallaxes with the TRGB method, paving the way for future improvements in the determination of H0 and other cosmological parameters. The consistency between our TRGB-based H0 measurement and the CMB-inferred value underscores the need for continued investigation into potential systematic effects in other measurement approaches.
