**Abstract**

The pursuit of high-performance anode materials for lithium-ion batteries necessitates innovative approaches to address inherent volume expansion during electrochemical cycling. This work reports the synthesis and characterization of a novel A-site deficient lithium lanthanum nickel oxide (LLNO) perovskite, demonstrating enhanced lithium ion storage capacity. Utilizing a controlled deficiency of the A-site cation, we observed a significant reduction in lattice strain within the material’s crystal structure.  X-ray diffraction and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed a facilitated Li+ diffusion pathway, correlating with improved rate capability.  Notably, the reduced strain mitigates the deleterious volume changes typically associated with perovskite anodes, leading to prolonged cycling stability. Preliminary results indicate a capacity retention of >85% after 50 cycles at a current density of 1 mA/cm². These findings suggest that strategically engineered A-site deficiencies offer a promising route toward developing robust and durable lithium-ion battery anodes.
