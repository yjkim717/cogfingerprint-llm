**Abstract**

The forthcoming Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) promises a transformative impact on transient astronomy, particularly in the automated classification of supernovae. This work explores the potential of LSST’s photometric capabilities to refine supernova identification through the application of advanced signal processing techniques. Utilizing simulated light curves representative of various supernova types, we evaluated the efficacy of a wavelet-feature-based classifier, designed to leverage the high cadence and photometric precision anticipated from the LSST survey. Preliminary results demonstrate that wavelet features, extracted from the light curves, provide a robust and discriminative set of indicators for distinguishing between supernovae classes. 

Specifically, we assessed the classifier’s performance against established photometric criteria employed by the Rubin Observatory’s Transient Object Pipeline (TOP). While initial investigations suggest a significant improvement in classification accuracy compared to traditional methods, further optimization and validation, incorporating real LSST data, are crucial. This research highlights the potential of LSST to substantially enhance the efficiency and reliability of supernova surveys, facilitating deeper studies of stellar evolution and cosmological parameters.  Future work will focus on integrating these techniques within the LSST workflow and assessing their impact on the overall supernova catalog.
