This study establishes a novel topological framework for analyzing thermodynamic critical points in anti-de Sitter black holes. By computing topological charges via Duan's Ï•-mapping method, we systematically classify critical points as either conventional (topological charge +1) or novel (topological charge -1). Our analysis reveals distinct topological classifications: charged AdS black holes exhibit a conventional critical point, whereas Born-Infeld AdS black holes demonstrate a novel topological structure. These findings demonstrate that black hole families with identical critical exponents can possess fundamentally different topological characteristics. The topological approach provides a unified methodology to categorize phase transitions across different black hole spacetimes, offering new insights into their thermodynamic geometry. This work establishes topology as an essential tool for understanding black hole thermodynamics beyond conventional criticality analysis.
