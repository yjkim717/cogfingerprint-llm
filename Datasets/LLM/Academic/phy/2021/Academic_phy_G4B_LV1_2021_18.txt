Here’s an academic abstract informed by the provided summary, suitable for a physics publication in 2021:

“We present a novel dielectric metasurface architecture engineered for temporal polarization control of near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses. Utilizing a precisely fabricated metasurface, we achieve wavefront shaping through dynamic modulation of the complex electrical-field transients experienced by the impinging pulse. Experimental results demonstrate the ability to manipulate the temporal polarization state, evidenced by spectral phase shifts correlated with the metasurface’s configuration. This technique offers a compact and versatile method for generating tailored pulse shapes, with potential applications in advanced optical communications and nonlinear optics research.”
