**Impact of Rubin Observatory Simulation Strategy on Photometric Supernova Classification Utilizing Wavelet Feature Analysis**

The forthcoming Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) presents a unique challenge and opportunity for astrophysical research, particularly concerning the automated classification of transient events such as supernovae. This work investigates the anticipated effects of LSST’s observing cadence and data reduction pipeline on the accuracy of photometric classification techniques. We present a simulation-based approach to optimize light curve analysis, leveraging a synthetic supernova dataset representative of LSST’s anticipated volume and spectral diversity. Employing wavelet feature extraction – a technique sensitive to subtle temporal variations – we quantify the impact of observing strategy variations on feature space dimensionality and subsequent classification performance. Gaussian process regression is then utilized to model the relationship between observing parameters and classification accuracy. Preliminary results suggest that optimized exposure times and data stacking strategies significantly reduce classification uncertainty, highlighting the critical role of pre-simulation optimization in maximizing the scientific return of LSST’s supernova survey.
