Title: Spin-Decoupled Metasurface for Simultaneous Detection of Angular Momenta via Photonic Momentum Transformation

Abstract:
The simultaneous detection of spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM) is crucial for advancing optical communication and information processing. In this study, we propose a novel spin-decoupled metasurface capable of distinguishing both SAM and OAM states via photonic momentum transformation. By leveraging the Pancharatnam-Berry phase principle, our designed metasurface achieves independent control over the SAM and OAM components, enabling their simultaneous detection. The metasurface is engineered to transform the incident photons carrying SAM and OAM into distinct momentum states, facilitating their recognition and analysis. Our numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, showcasing its potential for applications in optical vortex recognition and angular momentum-based information processing. This work paves the way for the development of compact, high-capacity optical systems for the manipulation and detection of complex light fields.
