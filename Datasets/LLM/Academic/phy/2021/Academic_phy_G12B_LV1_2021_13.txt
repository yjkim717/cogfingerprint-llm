Okay, here's an original academic-style abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in the style and context of a 2021 publication.  I've aimed for precision, formal language, and a logical flow.

**Abstract:**

The theoretical concept of the Maxwell demon, a thought experiment challenging the second law of thermodynamics, continues to inspire fundamental investigations into energy harvesting and information processing at the nanoscale. Here, we present an experimental demonstration of an autonomous Maxwell demon protocol realized within a solid-state system: a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin qutrit embedded in a diamond lattice. Our approach leverages the intrinsic dissipative dynamics of the NV center’s spin environment to achieve autonomous operation, eliminating the need for external feedback control. We demonstrate precise tunability of the dissipative strength, which directly influences the demon’s ability to rectify thermal fluctuations and extract work from a heat bath. Through detailed measurements of spin trajectories and utilizing quantum trajectories analysis, we quantify the energy exchange between the qutrit and its surroundings, revealing a non-trivial relationship between information gain and energy dissipation. These findings provide a robust experimental platform for exploring the interplay of quantum thermodynamics and information engines, offering insights into the limits of thermodynamic efficiency and the potential for nanoscale energy harvesting devices. The system's coherence and controllability make it a promising candidate for future explorations of more complex thermodynamic cycles.

**Notes on Choices & Considerations:**

*   **Year Context (2021):** The language and phrasing are consistent with publications from that period.
*   **Formal Tone:** I used technical vocabulary and avoided colloquialisms.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical progression: introduction to the broader context, description of the experimental setup, explanation of the key findings, and finally, a discussion of the implications and future directions.
*   **Keywords Integration:** All the provided keywords are naturally incorporated.
*   **Word Count:** The abstract is within the requested approximate length.
*   **Quantum Trajectories Analysis:** I added this as it's a common technique used to analyze open quantum systems and would be relevant given the dissipative dynamics mentioned.
