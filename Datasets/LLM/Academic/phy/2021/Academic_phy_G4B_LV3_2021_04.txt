**Abstract:**

This work explores the constraints imposed by the Swampland on 8d supergravity, employing a novel worldvolume theory approach coupled with the cobordism conjecture. We demonstrate how probing the internal geometry of 8d spacetime via 3-brane configurations allows for the rigorous identification of Swampland-safe solutions. Specifically, our analysis reveals that the presence of a non-standard gauge symmetry, parameterized by *g*², induces significant destabilization within the 8d supergravity landscape.  Applying the cobordism conjecture, we effectively reconstruct the internal topology, revealing that theories exhibiting *g*² gauge symmetry are demonstrably constrained by Swampland effects. These findings suggest a robust mechanism for eliminating such models and contribute to a deeper understanding of the landscape of viable 8d supergravity theories, as reported in 2021.
