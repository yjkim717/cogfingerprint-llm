**Abstract**

The identification of chaotic dynamics within complex Hamiltonian systems remains a central challenge in nonlinear dynamics. This work introduces a novel energy-dependent Lyapunov exponent bound, positing a linear relationship between the system’s Lyapunov exponent and its total energy in the asymptotic high-energy regime. Utilizing out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) to quantify system sensitivity to initial conditions, we demonstrate that this bound provides a stringent constraint on the rate of divergence predicted by Lyapunov exponents. Specifically, we argue that the energy scale fundamentally governs the onset and magnitude of chaos, offering a potentially testable prediction for systems exhibiting energy-persistent behavior.  Further, the proposed bound connects the qualitative features of chaotic attractors with the system’s underlying energy landscape, suggesting a deeper understanding of the interplay between Hamiltonian structure and dynamical complexity. This framework offers a new perspective on characterizing and classifying chaotic systems.
