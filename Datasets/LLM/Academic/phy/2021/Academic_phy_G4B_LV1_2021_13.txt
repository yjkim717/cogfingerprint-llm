**Abstract**

We present a novel approach to realizing an autonomous Maxwell demon utilizing the decoherence dynamics of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Leveraging the inherent sensitivity of NV centers to environmental perturbations, we demonstrate a system capable of selectively transporting energy within a closed quantum system.  Crucially, dissipation is actively managed through stochastic measurements performed on the NV center’s spin qutrit state, effectively modulating the system’s dissipative strength.  Theoretical modeling coupled with numerical simulation reveals a quantifiable reduction in energy fluctuations within the target region, indicative of the demon’s operational efficacy. This work bridges the gap between quantum thermodynamics and dissipative dynamics, offering a pathway towards engineering controllable energy flows at the nanoscale.  The demonstrated autonomous operation, reliant solely on environmental interactions, represents a significant advance in the field of quantum information processing and opens avenues for exploring fundamental questions concerning the limits of thermodynamic control in open quantum systems.
