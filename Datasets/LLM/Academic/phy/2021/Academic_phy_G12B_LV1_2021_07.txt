**Abstract: Radiative Corrections to Gravitational Scattering at High Post-Newtonian Order**

Gravitational scattering of point-like particles, traditionally treated within the framework of linearized gravity, exhibits subtle yet crucial deviations at finite velocities and strong gravitational fields. This work presents a rigorous derivation of radiative corrections to gravitational two-body scattering, employing a variation-of-constants formalism to achieve accuracy consistent with 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) order.  We extend previous analyses by explicitly accounting for the evolution of the 4-momentum of the scattering particles, enabling a more complete treatment of energy and momentum exchange due to gravitational radiation.

The method leverages the geodesic equation and the multipole expansion of the gravitational field, systematically incorporating terms arising from the post-Newtonian expansion of the metric perturbation.  A key element is a novel application of the variation-of-constants technique to the energy-momentum tensor of the system, facilitating the extraction of the radiative contribution without relying on perturbative approximations in the radiation reaction force.  We present explicit analytical expressions for the leading-order PN corrections to both the scattering angles and the energy loss rate, demonstrating significant departures from Newtonian predictions at velocities approaching the speed of light and for sufficiently strong gravitational interactions.

The derived results are particularly relevant for assessing the accuracy of numerical relativity simulations of binary systems, providing a benchmark for waveform modeling and parameter estimation in gravitational-wave astronomy. Furthermore, this analysis offers insights into the fundamental physics of gravitational radiation and its impact on the dynamics of massive bodies, potentially informing future experiments designed to probe the strong-field regime of general relativity. The accuracy of the present formalism allows for a detailed comparison with experimental data from future gravitational wave detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, and promises to improve our understanding of the fundamental nature of gravity.
