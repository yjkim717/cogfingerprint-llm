**Abstract**

The efficient generation and comprehensive characterization of multi-photon entangled states are crucial for advancing quantum technologies. This work presents a novel integrated waveguide architecture enabling high-fidelity, on-chip generation of multi-photon split states, circumventing the limitations of traditional approaches requiring complex reconfiguration. Our segmented waveguide array facilitates deterministic splitting of photons into multiple spatial modes, enabling complete quantum state tomography. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for optical quantum information processing, offering a compact and scalable platform for generating and validating complex entangled states. This integrated photonic system represents a significant step towards practical quantum devices relying on robust and readily accessible multi-photon entanglement.
