Title: Investigating A-Site Deficient Perovskite Li0.1La0.3NbO3 as a High-Performance Anode Material for Lithium-Ion Batteries

Abstract:
The development of high-capacity and stable anode materials is crucial for advancing lithium-ion battery technology. In this study, we investigate the potential of A-site deficient perovskite Li0.1La0.3NbO3 as a promising anode material. The crystal structure and electrochemical properties of Li0.1La0.3NbO3 were systematically characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements. Our results demonstrate that Li0.1La0.3NbO3 exhibits a high reversible capacity of 250 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C, with excellent cycling stability over 100 cycles. The A-site deficiency in Li0.1La0.3NbO3 is found to enhance Li+ ion diffusion and storage, leading to improved electrochemical performance. The findings suggest that Li0.1La0.3NbO3 is a viable anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, offering a promising alternative to traditional graphite-based anodes. This work provides valuable insights into the design of perovskite-based anode materials for advanced energy storage applications. (2021)
