 Here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a physics publication, based on the provided summary and reflecting a 2021 context:

**Abstract**

We investigate the consistency of 8-dimensional supergravity theories within the framework of string phenomenology. A central challenge in constructing such theories lies in ensuring their quantum viability, particularly in light of Swampland conjectures which posit constraints on effective field theories arising from string compactifications. This work employs a novel approach, utilizing the insertion of 3-brane probes into internal spaces to probe geometric structures and their impact on the resulting gauge algebra.  Crucially, we leverage the cobordism conjecture to impose non-trivial topological restrictions on these internal manifolds, effectively limiting the possible geometries that can support consistent 8d supergravity. Our analysis reveals a refined landscape of permissible gauge structures and internal geometries, demonstrating how topological considerations, guided by the cobordism conjecture, significantly narrow the space of consistent 8d supergravity models. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between geometry, gauge symmetry, and quantum consistency in higher-dimensional string theories.
