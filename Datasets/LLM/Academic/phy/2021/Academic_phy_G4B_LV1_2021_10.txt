**Investigating Hydrogen Evolution Reaction Kinetics on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides via Grand Canonical Potential Kinetics**

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) represents a critical challenge in sustainable energy technologies. This work presents a comprehensive investigation into the HER kinetics on tungsten diselenide (WSe2) and tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) utilizing a Grand Canonical Potential Kinetics (GCP-K) approach. Employing density functional theory, we systematically analyzed the transition-state structures and vacant site configurations governing the reaction pathway.  Our calculations reveal a significant influence of surface defects, specifically vacant sites, on the activation energy associated with HER.  Detailed analysis of the transition-state structures demonstrates a correlation between the density of vacant sites and the observed reaction rates. Furthermore, we propose mechanistic insights suggesting that specific defect arrangements facilitate hydrogen adsorption and dissociation. These findings, obtained through GCP-K, offer a valuable framework for rational catalyst design and the development of strategies to enhance the performance of WSe2 and WTe2 in HER applications.
