The proposed muon collider represents a transformative experimental platform poised to unify the energy and precision frontiers of particle physics. Operating at multi-TeV scales, it enables unprecedented investigations into electroweak symmetry breaking mechanisms through precision measurements of vector boson scattering and Higgs self-couplings. The collider's clean experimental environment significantly enhances sensitivity to electroweak radiation patterns, potentially revealing deviations indicative of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, its high-energy collisions provide a unique discovery window for thermally produced dark matter candidates through direct production channels. This facility synergistically complements ongoing dark matter detection experiments and precision electroweak measurements, offering a comprehensive approach to resolving fundamental questions in particle cosmology. The muon collider program thus establishes a necessary methodological bridge between theoretical naturalness arguments and empirical validation in the post-LHC era.
