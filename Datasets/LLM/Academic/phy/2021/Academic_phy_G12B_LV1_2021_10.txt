**Abstract: Grand Canonical Potential Kinetics for Mechanistic Understanding and Optimization of Hydrogen Evolution on Transition Metal Dichalcogenides**

The burgeoning demand for sustainable energy solutions has intensified research into electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysis. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), particularly tungsten diselenide (WSe₂) and tungsten ditelluride (WTe₂), have emerged as promising candidates due to their layered structure and tunable electronic properties. However, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying reaction mechanisms and the influence of structural defects on catalytic activity remains a significant challenge. This study leverages grand canonical potential kinetics (GCPK) to provide a rigorous, atomistic-level description of HER on WSe₂ and WTe₂ in a simulated electrochemical environment.  We employ density functional theory (DFT) calculations to construct the GCPK framework, enabling the prediction of reaction pathways, rate-limiting steps, and overall catalytic efficiency. Our results identify distinct HER mechanisms on WSe₂ and WTe₂, with WTe₂ exhibiting a more complex pathway involving multiple adsorbed intermediates. Crucially, the presence of vacant sites, frequently observed in experimental TMD materials, significantly alters the electronic structure and catalytic performance. We demonstrate that vacancy formation can either enhance or diminish HER activity depending on the specific TMD and the vacancy location. These findings provide valuable insights for the rational design of highly efficient HER electrocatalysts, suggesting strategies involving controlled vacancy engineering and compositional tuning to optimize catalytic performance and surpass current limitations. The application of GCPK offers a robust framework for predicting and optimizing HER catalysis across a wide range of TMD materials.
