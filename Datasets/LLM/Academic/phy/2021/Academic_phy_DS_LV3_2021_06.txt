In 2021, loop quantum gravity (LQG) represents a leading non-perturbative approach to the long-standing problem of unifying general relativity with the principles of quantum physics. By quantizing the very geometry of spacetime itself, LQG reformulates gravitational dynamics in terms of spin networks and their evolution. This framework yields a discrete, granular picture of space at the Planck scale, providing a fundamentally different paradigm from classical continuum descriptions. A pivotal consequence is the resolution of the big bang singularity, which is replaced by a quantum bounce, thereby offering a robust theoretical model for the universe's primordial phase. These developments underscore LQG's capacity to probe extreme gravitational regimes where classical physics fails.
