**Abstract**

Contemporary investigations into time perception increasingly intersect with established frameworks in theoretical physics, prompting a critical re-evaluation of temporal ontology. This paper synthesizes neuroscientific accounts of subjective time dilation with the implications of Einstein’s theory of relativity, specifically the concept of the “block universe.” While neuroscience elucidates the neural correlates of perceived duration and sequence, the block universe postulates a timeless, four-dimensional spacetime continuum—challenging conventional notions of past, present, and future.  We argue that reconciling these disparate perspectives necessitates a nuanced understanding of emergent temporal experience within a fundamentally static physical reality, potentially informing future research into the feasibility of temporal manipulation and its philosophical ramifications, published 2021.
