**Abstract**

We investigate the interplay between 't Hooft anomalies and emergent topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in the infrared (IR) dynamics of four-dimensional SU(N) chiral gauge theories. A detailed analysis of the global symmetry structure, incorporating discrete and generalized symmetries, reveals a new class of mixed 't Hooft anomalies. These anomalies, which involve the interplay of the 1-form center symmetry and certain 0-form chiral symmetries, must be matched along the renormalization group flow. We demonstrate that a trivially gapped confining phase, characterized by a unique vacuum and a mass gap with no long-range topological order, is generically incompatible with these anomaly matching conditions. Instead, the anomaly constraints necessitate that the confined IR phase is either gapless, hosting massless composite fermions, or exhibits non-trivial topological order described by a non-invertible TQFT. This emergent TQFT provides the necessary degrees of freedom to saturate the anomaly. Our results establish that the presence of such anomalies serves as a robust obstruction to "pure" confinement without chiral symmetry breaking or topological order, thereby imposing stringent new criteria for viable IR phases in strongly coupled chiral gauge theories beyond the conventional QCD-like paradigm.
