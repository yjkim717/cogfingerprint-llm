**Abstract**

We report the experimental implementation of an autonomous quantum Maxwell's demon using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin qutrit in diamond. The protocol leverages the system's intrinsic dissipative dynamics and quantum non-demolition measurements to perform feedback, rectifying thermal fluctuations to cool a target spin subsystem without external work input. This autonomous operation, a hallmark of the demon, is achieved by engineering the spin's environment to act as a memory reservoir. Our results, obtained in 2021, demonstrate a key building block for quantum thermodynamic machines and establish a novel platform for exploring quantum measurement engines. This work paves the way for applying autonomous quantum feedback in advanced quantum sensing protocols to mitigate environmental noise.
