In this 2021 investigation, we systematically explore the landscape of 8d supergravity theories through rigorous application of the cobordism conjecture and 3-brane probe consistency conditions. Our analysis reveals that specific gauge algebra configurations, particularly those exhibiting g2 symmetry, yield internal geometries incompatible with ultraviolet completion. By implementing an enhanced formulation of the cobordism conjecture, we demonstrate that such theories reside firmly within the Swampland, thereby extending the classification of inconsistent effective field theories. These findings provide compelling evidence for the string lamppost principle, confirming that only particular gauge symmetries and geometric configurations admit consistent embeddings within a quantum gravity framework. The results establish new criteria for distinguishing viable supergravity constructions from those doomed to inhabit the Swampland.
