In 2021, Gerard 't Hooft's foundational work presents a deterministic framework wherein quantum phenomena emerge from underlying classical systems governed by local hidden variables. This model fundamentally challenges Bell's theorem by re-evaluating its foundational assumptions regarding statistical independence and causality. Through rigorous mathematical construction, 't Hooft demonstrates that quantum mechanical predictions can be systematically approximated via deterministic dynamics, thereby circumventing Bell inequality violations. The approach reconciles quantum non-locality with relativistic causality by introducing novel constraints on initial state correlations. This paradigm not only revitalizes hidden variable theories but also provides a coherent mechanism for quantum-classical correspondence. Consequently, it prompts a critical reassessment of quantum foundations, suggesting that apparent quantum randomness may reflect incomplete knowledge rather than intrinsic indeterminism, with profound implications for quantum gravity and unification theories.
