**Abstract**

Recent investigations into the foundations of quantum mechanics have revisited the implications of Bell’s theorem and the concept of local hidden variables. This work presents a novel argument suggesting that the apparent violation of Bell inequalities, observed through CHSH experiments, can be mitigated under conditions predicated on a stringent interpretation of initial state realism. Specifically, we demonstrate that certain classically-equivalent models, while exhibiting correlated behavior analogous to quantum entanglement, can be constructed to satisfy realistic constraints – namely, that the underlying state remains entirely determined prior to measurement. 

This conditional realism effectively circumvents the direct challenge posed by Bell’s theorem, implying that observed correlations do not necessitate a fundamentally non-local description of reality.  Further theoretical development is required to fully delineate the scope of these classically-mimicking states and their broader consequences for interpretations of quantum measurement.  (2021)
