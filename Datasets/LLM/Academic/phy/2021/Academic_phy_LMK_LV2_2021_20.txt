Title: Classification of Infrared Phases in 4D SU(N) Chiral Gauge Theories: Anomalies and Symmetry Constraints

Abstract:
We investigate the infrared phases of 4-dimensional SU(N) chiral gauge theories, focusing on the interplay between confinement, symmetries, and 't Hooft anomalies. By analyzing the global symmetries and anomaly constraints, we classify the possible infrared behaviors of these theories. Our analysis reveals new 't Hooft anomalies that impose significant constraints on the infrared physics, shedding light on the dynamics of chiral gauge theories. The classification is performed within the framework of topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), which provide a powerful tool for understanding the low-energy properties of these systems. Our results demonstrate that certain infrared phases are inconsistent with the anomaly constraints, thereby restricting the possible infrared behaviors of 4D SU(N) chiral gauge theories. This work advances our understanding of the non-perturbative dynamics of chiral gauge theories, with implications for the study of strongly interacting systems.
