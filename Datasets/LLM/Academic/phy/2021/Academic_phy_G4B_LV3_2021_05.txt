**Abstract**

Recent advancements in distance measurement techniques, specifically the Type Ia Supernova TRGB (Tip of the Red Giant Branch) method and Cepheid variable star photometry, are converging to refine the determination of the Hubble constant (H₀). This study leverages a combined analysis of high-precision TRGB distances derived from observations of stellar populations in nearby galaxies, alongside meticulously calibrated Cepheid distance moduli obtained utilizing the Gaia EDR3 data release. The resultant H₀ estimate, incorporating both datasets, demonstrates a notable degree of convergence with predictions arising from the ΛCDM (Lambda Cold Dark Matter) cosmological model.  However, a persistent tension remains when compared to local measurements.  This work underscores the potential of multi-modal distance indicators to mitigate existing uncertainties and offers a robust framework for future observational campaigns.  Specifically, improved spectroscopic follow-up of Cepheids and continued refinement of TRGB methodologies, particularly with larger sample sizes, are anticipated to further constrain H₀ and ultimately address the ongoing cosmological distance ladder challenge.
