## The Temporal Disparity: Reconciling Neuroscience and the Block Universe in Contemporary Physics

Recent investigations into the nature of time reveal a significant divergence between perspectives within neuroscience and theoretical physics. While neuroscience predominantly frames temporal experience through an 'oriented' lens, emphasizing a dynamic, present-focused progression of events crucial for cognitive processing and decision-making, contemporary physics, particularly within the framework of relativity, increasingly leans towards a ‘block universe’ model. This model conceptualizes spacetime as a static, four-dimensional block where past, present, and future coexist, rendering the subjective experience of temporal flow an emergent property rather than a fundamental aspect of reality. This paper examines this apparent contradiction, arguing that the neuroscientific focus on temporal ordering reflects the adaptive utility of a linear perception for biological organisms operating within a specific spacetime manifold. We propose that the perceived 'arrow of time' in neural processing represents a functional adaptation, compatible with the underlying physics of a timeless, block-like spacetime. Further exploration of this disparity may illuminate the relationship between physical reality, subjective experience, and the evolution of consciousness.
