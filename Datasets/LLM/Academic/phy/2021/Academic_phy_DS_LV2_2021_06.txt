This review examines recent developments in loop quantum gravity (LQG) as a non-perturbative background-independent approach to quantum gravity. By applying quantization techniques directly to the geometric degrees of freedom described by general relativity, LQG circumvents the mathematical inconsistencies that plague perturbative methods. The framework yields a discrete quantum geometry at the Planck scale, fundamentally modifying our understanding of spacetime. A significant consequence is the resolution of the big bang singularity, replaced by a quantum bounce connecting our universe to a previous cosmological phase. We analyze the theoretical foundations of LQG, its predictions for spacetime discreteness, and its implications for early universe cosmology, highlighting both achievements and outstanding challenges in the field as of 2021.
