**Abstract**

The ongoing tension between locally-measured Hubble constant (H₀) values and those inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) within the ΛCDM cosmological model represents a significant challenge to contemporary astrophysics. This paper, building upon Freedman’s 2021 work, investigates the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method as an independent distance ladder technique for calibrating H₀. We present a refined calibration of the TRGB method, incorporating updated observational data and improved photometric techniques. The resulting H₀ value, derived from TRGB observations in nearby galaxies, demonstrates remarkable consistency with CMB-inferred values obtained from Planck satellite data, and aligns well with existing H₀ calibrations based on Cepheid variable stars. This finding suggests that the observed discrepancy between local measurements and the CMB-derived value may not necessitate the introduction of novel physics beyond the standard cosmological framework. While systematic uncertainties remain in all distance ladder techniques, the convergence of H₀ estimates from TRGB, Cepheids, and CMB observations strengthens the robustness of the ΛCDM model and warrants continued investigation into potential sources of systematic error within each method. Further research should focus on reducing these uncertainties to enable more precise tests of cosmological parameters.
