**Abstract**

We explore the landscape of 8-dimensional supergravity, employing a novel approach predicated on Swampland criteria and the cobordism conjecture to delineate viable internal geometries. Utilizing worldvolume theory, we introduce 3-brane probes as diagnostic tools to probe the consistency of potential solutions. Specifically, we investigate how these probes, strategically positioned within the 8d spacetime, reveal constraints on the underlying gauge symmetries and topological structure.  The application of Swampland bounds, derived from considerations of quantum gravity, systematically eliminates configurations incompatible with these constraints.  Crucially, our methodology leverages the cobordism conjecture, asserting that the topology of the 8d spacetime is uniquely determined by its boundaries. This provides a rigorous framework for identifying and restricting the space of admissible solutions, offering a significant step toward a more refined understanding of 8d supergravity’s phenomenology and its relation to string theory compactifications.
