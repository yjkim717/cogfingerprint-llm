**Abstract: The Muon Collider as a Precision Probe of Electroweak Physics and Beyond**

The pursuit of new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) remains a central goal of particle physics. This contribution articulates a compelling physics case for a high-energy muon collider as a uniquely versatile instrument for exploring a broad spectrum of BSM phenomena.  Muon colliders offer a distinct advantage over hadron colliders in mitigating electroweak synchrotron radiation (EWSR), allowing for significantly higher center-of-mass energies and luminosities at a given energy frontier.  We examine the collider’s sensitivity to a range of potential discoveries, including precision measurements of the W boson properties to probe for deviations from the Standard Model predictions, searches for electroweak singly and doubly resonant states, and investigations into vector boson fusion processes. Furthermore, we discuss the collider’s prospects for directly producing and studying weakly interacting particles, including those arising within simplified dark matter models and other BSM scenarios characterized by relatively light mediators.  The combination of high luminosity, clean signatures, and precise energy control positions the muon collider as a crucial tool for advancing our understanding of fundamental interactions and addressing open questions in particle physics, particularly regarding the nature of dark matter and the hierarchy problem.
