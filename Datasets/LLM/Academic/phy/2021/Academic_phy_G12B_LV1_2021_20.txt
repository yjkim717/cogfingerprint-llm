**Abstract: Classification of Infrared Phases in SU(N) Chiral Gauge Theories via Anomalous Global Symmetries and Topological Constraints**

The exploration of strongly coupled gauge theories remains a central challenge in theoretical physics, particularly concerning the emergence of infrared (IR) phenomena and the classification of resulting phases. This work presents a systematic classification of IR phases accessible within the framework of SU(N) chiral gauge theories, focusing on the interplay between global symmetries, 't Hooft anomalies, and topological quantum field theory (TQFT) constraints.  We leverage recent advances in anomaly matching techniques, extending them to incorporate fermionic and bosonic chiral matter content. A key feature of our analysis is the detailed investigation of how anomalous global symmetries, specifically those arising from flavor symmetries of the fermion fields, fundamentally restrict the allowed IR physics.  We demonstrate that the presence of such anomalies can lead to a variety of distinct IR phases, including those characterized by topological order and emergent gauge structures. Furthermore, we explicitly identify TQFT obstructions that arise when attempting to realize certain global symmetry structures in the UV, highlighting the profound constraints imposed by topological considerations on the viability of specific chiral gauge theory models.  Our classification framework provides a novel perspective on the landscape of strongly coupled phenomena, offering insights into the emergence of confinement, chiral symmetry breaking, and potentially, novel quantum phases of matter.  Future work will explore the implications of these findings for applications in condensed matter physics, particularly in the context of topological insulators and unconventional superconductors.
