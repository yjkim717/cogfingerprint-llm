Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a physics publication, based on the provided keywords and summary, and framed within a 2021 context. I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and a tone appropriate for the field.  I've also included a few sentences expanding on the implications and relevance, as would be typical in a good abstract.

**Autonomous Maxwell Demon Realization via Dissipative Dynamics of a Diamond Spin Qutrit**

The theoretical concept of the Maxwell demon, a thought experiment challenging the second law of thermodynamics, continues to inspire research at the intersection of information theory and physics. Here, we report an experimental realization of an autonomous Maxwell demon leveraging the dissipative dynamics of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin qutrit embedded within a diamond lattice. Our approach circumvents traditional thermodynamic engines by employing random projective measurements performed on the qutrit’s state to induce a non-equilibrium energy current between a thermal reservoir and a mechanical oscillator. The demon’s functionality arises from the inherent dissipative evolution of the NV center, creating a self-rectifying process that effectively extracts work from the environment without an external driver. We demonstrate that this system exhibits a persistent violation of the thermodynamic equilibrium condition, manifesting as a measurable temperature difference between the reservoir and oscillator. These findings provide a novel platform for exploring quantum thermodynamics and offer insights into the fundamental limits of energy extraction in nanoscale systems, with potential implications for the development of energy-efficient quantum technologies.

**Notes on choices made:**

*   **Specificity:** I've included "nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center" to be more specific about the type of diamond defect used.
*   **Expanded Reasoning:** The abstract isn’t just stating *what* was done, but *how* it relates to the Maxwell demon and the underlying physics (self-rectifying process, violation of equilibrium).
*   **Contextualization:** I mentioned the relevance to energy-efficient quantum technologies to highlight the broader impact.
*   **Formal Language:** I used formal phrasing ("report," "demonstrate," "manifesting as") throughout.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for a length appropriate for most physics abstracts (around 186 words).
