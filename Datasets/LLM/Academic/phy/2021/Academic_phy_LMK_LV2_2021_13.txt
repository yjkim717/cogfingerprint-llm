"Experimental Realization of an Autonomous Maxwell Demon using a Dissipative NV Center Qutrit. 
In 2021, a seminal experiment demonstrated the feasibility of an autonomous Maxwell demon utilizing an NV center's open spin qutrit dynamics. By harnessing tunable dissipative strength, the researchers successfully implemented a quantum thermodynamic system, where the qutrit's dissipative dynamics facilitated the demon's operation. Leveraging precise quantum measurements, the study showcased the intricate interplay between quantum thermodynamics and dissipative dynamics, illuminating the boundaries between information and thermodynamics in quantum systems."
