**Abstract**

Precise determination of the Hubble constant (H<sub>0</sub>) remains a significant challenge in modern cosmology, with ongoing discrepancies between local measurements and those derived from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This work presents a novel approach to H<sub>0</sub> estimation, integrating Type Ia supernovae observations with recently refined Turn-Off Redshift (TRGB) methodology, leveraging data from the Gaia astrometry mission. Specifically, we employ a statistically robust analysis of TRGB luminosity indicators in galaxies at varying distances, calibrated against the well-established supernova Ia luminosity scatter.  Simultaneous fitting of supernova and TRGB data, combined with Gaia parallax distances, yields a constrained H<sub>0</sub> value.  Results demonstrate a compelling convergence between this local measurement and previously reported CMB-derived values, suggesting a degree of agreement with current cosmological parameter calibrations.  Furthermore, the combined analysis provides an improved assessment of systematic uncertainties inherent in both individual datasets, contributing to a more reliable estimate of the Hubble constant and solidifying the consistency of the ΛCDM model.
