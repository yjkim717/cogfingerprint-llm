Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a physics publication, based on the provided summary and targeting a 2021 context. I've aimed for precision and a structured argument, keeping the word count around the requested ~221 words.  Following the abstract, I've included notes on the choices I made and potential areas for expansion if more information were available.

**Abstract**

The infrared behavior of SU(N) chiral gauge theories remains a central challenge in non-perturbative quantum field theory. This work presents a comprehensive classification of potential infrared (IR) phases accessible to these systems, incorporating a rigorous analysis of constraints imposed by 't Hooft anomalies and topological quantum field theory (TQFT) obstructions. We systematically investigate the interplay between chiral symmetry breaking, confinement, and the emergence of topological order, focusing on the role of global symmetries and their anomalies in determining the allowed IR fixed points.  Our classification framework leverages recent advances in anomaly matching techniques and the understanding of TQFTs associated with gauged topological defects. Specifically, we demonstrate how the presence of specific 't Hooft anomalies can fundamentally restrict the possible IR physics, precluding certain phases and dictating the structure of others. The analysis reveals a rich landscape of possibilities, including scenarios where confinement is accompanied by non-trivial TQFT descriptions. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these findings for the classification of distinct IR phases characterized by varying degrees of chiral symmetry realization and topological order, providing a novel perspective on the relationship between microscopic degrees of freedom and macroscopic observables in strongly coupled gauge theories. This work lays the groundwork for future investigations into the phenomenological relevance of these phases within the context of particle physics model building.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Expansion:**

*   **Emphasis on “Challenge” and “Central”:** I wanted to immediately signal the importance and difficulty of the topic.
*   **"Comprehensive Classification":**  This suggests a thoroughness of approach.
*   **Anomaly Matching and TQFTs:** Including these specific terms highlights the technical methodology.
*   **Interplay of Concepts:** The phrase "interplay between" indicates a nuanced, interconnected analysis.
*   **"Restrict the possible IR physics":** This highlights a key conclusion - anomalies aren't just interesting; they *limit* possibilities.
*   **"Rich Landscape":** A common, but useful, phrase to describe complex theoretical spaces.
*   **Phenomenological Relevance:** Adding a sentence at the end explicitly connects the theoretical work to potential practical applications (model building) is standard in physics abstracts.
*   **Year Context (2021):**  I implicitly referenced the "recent advances" in anomaly matching – assuming this field saw significant progress around that time.
*   **Further Expansion (if more information were available):**
    *   Specific types of anomalies studied (e.g., global, mixed).
    *   Range of N values considered (e.g., large N, finite N).
    *   Specific TQFTs that emerge in particular phases.
    *   Connections to other theoretical frameworks (e.g., AdS/CFT).
