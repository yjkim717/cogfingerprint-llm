**Abstract**

The persistent debate surrounding the foundations of quantum mechanics, particularly the implications of Bell’s theorem, remains a central focus in theoretical physics. This work, conducted in 2021, investigates the possibility of replicating quantum mechanical behavior through classically realizable systems. We demonstrate, through the construction of finite-accuracy models, that any quantum mechanical description can be emulated by a deterministic classical system possessing a finite number of degrees of freedom. This finding challenges the conventional interpretation of Bell’s theorem, which relies on the assumption of non-local correlations arising from inherently probabilistic quantum processes. Crucially, our models depend on the existence of realistic, precisely defined initial states, highlighting the sensitivity of these simulations to initial conditions. The implications extend to questioning the necessity of retrocausal interpretations often invoked to resolve Bell’s inequalities, suggesting that apparent non-locality may be attributable to the limitations of classical approximations rather than fundamental departures from local realism.
