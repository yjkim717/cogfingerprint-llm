By scrutinizing 3-brane probe consistency conditions, we refine Swampland constraints on 8d supergravity theories, thereby reconstructing the internal geometry. Leveraging the string lamppost principle and cobordism conjecture, we systematically analyze gauge symmetry enhancements. Our findings sharpen the theoretical landscape, yielding novel insights into the consistency conditions governing 8d supergravity theories, as presented in our 2021 study.
