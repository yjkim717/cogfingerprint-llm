In this work, we present a systematic derivation of radiation-reaction effects in the gravitational two-body scattering problem within the framework of general relativity. Employing the method of variation of constants, we compute the secular changes in the systemâ€™s 4-momentum induced by gravitational-wave emission. Our analysis extends the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion to the fifth order, capturing previously uncalculated high-order contributions to the radiation-reaction force and energy-momentum loss. The results are expressed in terms of gauge-invariant quantities, providing closed-form expressions for the scattering angle and net 4-momentum changes as functions of the orbital parameters and relative velocity. We validate our formulation through comparison with existing lower-order PN calculations and numerical relativity simulations in the appropriate limits. This work establishes a foundation for precision modeling of unbound gravitational interactions, with direct implications for gravitational-wave astronomy and the dynamics of hyperbolic encounters in dense stellar environments.
