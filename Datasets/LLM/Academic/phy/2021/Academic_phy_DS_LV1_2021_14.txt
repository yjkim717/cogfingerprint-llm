**Abstract**

We advance the thermodynamic characterization of black holes by introducing a topological framework for classifying critical points in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes. By interpreting the free energy landscape as a topological manifold, we define a topological charge for each critical point, computed via the winding number of a constructed vector field in the thermodynamic parameter space. Our analysis reveals that critical points fall into distinct topological classes, characterized by their quantized charge. Applying this formalism to a range of charged and rotating AdS black holes, we demonstrate that different black hole families exhibit fundamentally different topological configurations. Specifically, we identify systems with a single, trivial critical point and others possessing non-trivial topological structures. This classification provides a unified topological criterion for the existence and nature of black hole phase transitions, suggesting that the global thermodynamic behavior is intrinsically linked to the underlying topological class. Our work establishes topology as a fundamental tool for deciphering the phase structure of gravitational systems.
