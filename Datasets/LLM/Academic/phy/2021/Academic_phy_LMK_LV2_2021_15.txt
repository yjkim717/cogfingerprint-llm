Title: Enhanced Lithium-Ion Storage in A-Site Deficient Perovskite Anodes: A Novel Approach for High-Performance Lithium-Ion Batteries

Abstract:
The development of high-capacity anode materials is crucial for advancing lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology. In this study, we investigate the potential of A-site deficient perovskite Li0.1La0.3NbO3 as a novel anode material for LIBs. Our results demonstrate that the A-site deficiency in the perovskite structure significantly enhances Li+ storage and ion transport, leading to improved electrochemical performance. The Li0.1La0.3NbO3 anode exhibits a high reversible capacity and long cycling life, making it a promising candidate for next-generation LIBs. The enhanced Li+ storage is attributed to the optimized crystal structure and the resulting improved ionic conductivity. Our findings provide new insights into the design of perovskite-based anode materials for high-performance LIBs, highlighting the potential of A-site deficient perovskites for energy storage applications.
