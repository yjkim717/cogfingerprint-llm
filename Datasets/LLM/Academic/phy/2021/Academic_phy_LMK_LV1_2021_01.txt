Title: Revisiting the Limits of Classical Simulation in Quantum Mechanics: A 2021 Perspective

Abstract:
In the context of ongoing debates surrounding the foundations of quantum theory, we reexamine the notion that any quantum model can be approximated by a classical system to arbitrary finite accuracy. Leveraging recent advances in our understanding of Bell's theorem and its implications for local hidden variable theories, we demonstrate that, under specific conditions, classical systems can indeed replicate the predictions of quantum mechanics to a high degree of precision. Our analysis sheds new light on the intricate relationship between causality, quantum theory, and classical simulation, offering fresh insights into the longstanding dichotomy between quantum and classical descriptions of reality.
