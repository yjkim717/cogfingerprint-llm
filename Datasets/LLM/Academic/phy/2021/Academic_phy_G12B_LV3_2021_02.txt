**Abstract**

The pursuit of physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) necessitates exploration at energy scales inaccessible to current colliders. This work provides a comprehensive physics case for a future high-energy muon collider as a crucial next step in particle physics research. We argue that the unique combination of center-of-mass energy and exceptional precision afforded by a muon collider offers unparalleled opportunities to probe electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and search for new phenomena related to the naturalness problem of the weak scale. Specifically, the collider’s sensitivity to Higgs boson properties, including vector boson fusion couplings and self-coupling measurements, allows for stringent tests of the Standard Model and potential deviations indicative of BSM physics. Furthermore, the collider’s clean experimental environment and high luminosity enable precise searches for dark matter candidates produced in association with Higgs bosons or other new particles. This analysis underscores the muon collider's potential to address fundamental questions in high-energy physics and solidify our understanding of the universe.
