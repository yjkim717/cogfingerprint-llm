Of particular interest in the study of dynamical systems is the conjectured universal bound on chaos, which posits a fundamental limit on the rate of information scrambling. This work investigates a specific corollary: the linear growth of the Lyapunov exponent, λ_L, with total energy, E, in the high-energy limit. We rigorously analyze this relationship within the frameworks of both classical Hamiltonian mechanics and quantum many-body systems, employing out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) as a principal diagnostic tool in the latter. Our theoretical analysis confirms the thermodynamic consistency of this linear scaling, demonstrating that it does not violate established thermodynamic limits or lead to unphysical divergences in entropy production. The bound, λ_L ∝ E, emerges as a robust feature across these disparate regimes, suggesting a deep connection between microscopic chaos, energy scales, and macroscopic irreversibility. This result provides a unifying principle for chaos in high-energy states, with significant implications for the study of thermalization and transport in complex systems.
