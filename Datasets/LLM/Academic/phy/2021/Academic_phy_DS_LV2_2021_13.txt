In this experimental study, we report the autonomous implementation of Maxwell's demon in a quantum thermodynamic framework using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center spin qutrit. By engineering dissipative feedback dynamics through quantum measurement operations, we demonstrate the controlled extraction of work from thermal fluctuations at the nanoscale. Our protocol enables real-time entropy reduction in the system, effectively violating the classical thermodynamic bound through information gain. The tunable dissipative channels, governed by projective measurements, provide a versatile platform for investigating quantum measurement thermodynamics. These results establish solid-state spin systems as viable testbeds for exploring fundamental limits of quantum heat engines and the role of information in quantum thermodynamic processes.
