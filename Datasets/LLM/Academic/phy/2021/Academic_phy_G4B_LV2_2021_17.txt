**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of nanoscale optics necessitates novel techniques for manipulating and characterizing light’s fundamental properties. This research presents a significant advancement in vectorial light control through the development of a spin-decoupled metasurface, demonstrated in 2021. Utilizing a carefully engineered plasmonic architecture, the metasurface facilitates simultaneous detection of both spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM) via a mechanism of photonic momentum transformation. Critically, the design incorporates a decoupling strategy, mitigating the detrimental cross-talk traditionally observed in multi-polarization metasurfaces. 

Experimental results detail the metasurface’s efficacy in generating and detecting OAM vortices, subsequently enabling precise vortex recognition and sorting capabilities.  The achieved separation of spin and OAM degrees of freedom represents a crucial step towards advanced photonic sensing and information encoding. This work highlights the potential of spin-decoupled metasurfaces as a versatile platform for manipulating light’s vectorial properties, paving the way for applications in quantum optics, imaging, and secure communication systems. Further investigations will focus on scaling and integrating this technology for practical implementations.
