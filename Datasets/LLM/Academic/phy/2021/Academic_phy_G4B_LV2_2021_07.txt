**Abstract**

The interaction between gravitational fields and electromagnetic radiation remains a complex and actively researched area of theoretical physics. This work presents a refined investigation into radiation-reaction effects during gravitational scattering, employing a variation-of-constants formalism to achieve enhanced accuracy and rigorous comparison with established literature. Utilizing a post-Newtonian expansion, we systematically account for the relativistic dynamics of the scattering system, explicitly tracking the evolution of the 4-momentum of both the projectile and the emitted radiation.  The variation-of-constants method provides a robust framework for isolating and quantifying the perturbative corrections arising from the coupling between gravity and radiation.  Specifically, we demonstrate a precise determination of the radiation reaction force, offering a significant improvement over previously reported calculations, particularly at higher scattering energies.  Our results are validated against benchmark solutions and existing theoretical predictions, confirming the efficacy of the chosen approach.  This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamics governing strong gravitational fields and their intricate interplay with electromagnetic phenomena, furthering the development of accurate models for astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. Further investigation into the implications for black hole accretion and gravitational wave emission is warranted.
