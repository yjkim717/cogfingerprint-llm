“This work presents a refined investigation into the influence of radiation-reaction on classical gravitational scattering phenomena, achieved through a rigorous post-Newtonian expansion. Utilizing a quantum approach, we derive precise calculations extending to the fifth post-Newtonian order, offering a significant advancement over previous estimations. The study specifically addresses the subtle yet crucial effects arising from the interaction between gravitational fields and emitted radiation.  These calculations are systematically validated against established theoretical frameworks and existing experimental data, confirming the robustness of our methodology.  Furthermore, we highlight discrepancies between current models and demonstrate the necessity for incorporating radiation-reaction effects in accurately predicting the trajectories of massive objects undergoing gravitational scattering.  The findings contribute to a more complete understanding of relativistic dynamics and have implications for astrophysical simulations and precision tests of general relativity.”
