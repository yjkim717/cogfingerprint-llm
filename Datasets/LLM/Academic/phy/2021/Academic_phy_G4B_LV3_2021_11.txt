**Abstract**

This work introduces a novel chaos energy bound predicated on thermodynamic consistency, offering a refined understanding of chaotic dynamics in quantum systems. Utilizing out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) and Lyapunov exponents, we demonstrate a linear relationship between the system’s Lyapunov exponent and its total energy within a high-energy regime. This bound, rigorously derived from classical Hamiltonian systems, extends established chaos bounds to the quantum realm.  Specifically, the proposed energy bound provides a tighter constraint on the growth rate of Lyapunov exponents, offering a more precise quantification of chaotic behavior.  The implications of this finding are significant for analyzing complex quantum systems exhibiting emergent chaos, potentially informing the development of novel measurement techniques and furthering our theoretical understanding of energy dissipation and system sensitivity.
