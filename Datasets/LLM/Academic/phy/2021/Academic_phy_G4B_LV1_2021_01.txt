**Abstract**

Recent investigations into the compatibility of quantum mechanics and classical realism have yielded a compelling, albeit unsettling, result: a broad class of classical models can accurately reproduce the statistical correlations predicted by quantum theory. This study examines the implications of this ‘mimicry’ for Bell’s theorem, specifically focusing on the robustness of non-locality in the face of realistic initial conditions. Utilizing a modified Chsh inequality analysis, we demonstrate that a sufficiently parameterized classical model, incorporating realistic constraints on initial state preparation, can achieve near-Bellian violation.  This observation suggests that the purported violation of local hidden variable theories, central to Bell’s theorem, may be contingent upon specific, less-than-realistic assumptions regarding the system’s initial state.  Further research is required to fully delineate the conditions under which quantum correlations persist and to refine our understanding of the boundaries between classical and quantum behavior.
