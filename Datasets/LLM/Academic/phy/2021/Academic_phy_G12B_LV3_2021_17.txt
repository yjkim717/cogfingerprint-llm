Here's an academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided summary and keywords, formatted for a physics audience and reflecting a 2021 context:

"Recent advancements in nanophotonics have spurred interest in manipulating the complete photonic momentum, encompassing both spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM). This work introduces a novel metasurface-based approach for the decoupled manipulation of SAM and OAM, enabling simultaneous sorting and detection of these distinct degrees of freedom. Our design utilizes a specifically engineered metasurface architecture to achieve vectorial vortex recognition, circumventing limitations of traditional methods that often conflate or inadequately resolve these components. The demonstrated capability of independent SAM and OAM control represents a significant step towards realizing integrated optical systems with enhanced functionality, and holds particular promise for applications in quantum information processing, secure communications, and advanced optical sensing. These findings, reported in 2021, highlight the potential of metasurfaces to unlock new avenues for manipulating and characterizing lightâ€™s full vectorial nature."
