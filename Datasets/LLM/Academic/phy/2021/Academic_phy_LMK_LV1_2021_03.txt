Title: Exploring the Black Hole-String Transition in Heterotic and Type II String Theories

Abstract:
We investigate the intricate relationship between small black holes and highly excited fundamental strings within the frameworks of heterotic and type II string theories. Focusing on the self-gravitating string solutions, our analysis reveals a nuanced connection between these two seemingly disparate objects. By examining the thermodynamic properties of black holes and the corresponding string states, we elucidate the transition between these regimes. Our results indicate that the black hole-string transition is facilitated by the self-gravitating string solutions, which serve as a bridge between the gravitational and stringy descriptions. We derive explicit expressions for the transition amplitude in both heterotic and type II cases, demonstrating a striking similarity between the two. Our findings shed new light on the long-standing problem of black hole-string correspondence, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying physics in the context of string theory. (2021)
