**Abstract**

Lithium-ion batteries reliant on conventional anode materials frequently exhibit limited energy density and cycling performance due to substantial volume changes during electrochemical cycling. This research presents a novel approach utilizing a low-strain Li₀.₁La₀.₃NbO₃ perovskite as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Characterization revealed a significant degree of a-site deficiency within the perovskite structure, which, surprisingly, facilitated enhanced lithium ion (Li⁺) transport pathways.  Electrochemical testing demonstrated a marked improvement in Li⁺ storage capacity compared to conventional anode materials, achieving a specific capacity of [Insert Specific Capacity Value Here – Placeholder]. Crucially, the material exhibited exceptional cycling stability, retaining [Insert Percentage Retention Here – Placeholder]% of its initial capacity after [Insert Number Here – Placeholder] cycles.  The observed low strain behavior mitigates electrode degradation, contributing to the enhanced performance. These findings suggest that a-site deficient perovskite anodes represent a promising avenue for advancing lithium-ion battery technology, particularly concerning volume expansion and ion transport limitations.
