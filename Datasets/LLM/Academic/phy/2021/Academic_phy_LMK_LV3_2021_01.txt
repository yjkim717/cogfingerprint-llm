Title: Reevaluating the Foundations of Quantum Mechanics: A Local Hidden Variable Framework

Abstract (2021): 
This study presents a novel construction of local hidden variables that approximates any quantum theory to a specified degree of accuracy, thereby reexamining the implications of Bell's theorem on the foundations of quantum mechanics. By employing a rigorous mathematical framework, we demonstrate that local causality can be reconciled with quantum theory, challenging prevailing interpretations. Our results suggest a nuanced understanding of the interplay between quantum mechanics and local hidden variables, offering a fresh perspective on the longstanding debate surrounding Bell's theorem and its consequences for causality in quantum systems.
