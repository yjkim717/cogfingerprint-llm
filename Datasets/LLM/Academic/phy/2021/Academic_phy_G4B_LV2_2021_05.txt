**Abstract**

The determination of the Hubble constant (H₀) remains a significant challenge in modern cosmology, currently plagued by persistent tension between local measurements and those inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This work details a refined measurement of H₀ utilizing the Type Ia supernova technique, specifically employing the Turn-Off Redshift (TRGB) method, and incorporating newly available data from the Gaia astrometry mission.  The TRGB method, leveraging the empirically defined relationship between luminosity and color in evolved stellar populations, provides a robust and relatively precise distance indicator.  Our analysis, conducted in 2021, demonstrates strong agreement with H₀ values derived from CMB observations, aligning with established cosmological calibrations.  Crucially, the obtained value exhibits a degree of consistency with prior Type Ia supernova measurements.  However, the observed discrepancy persists, highlighting the ongoing “H₀ tension.” We discuss the implications of these findings within the broader context of cosmological parameter estimation and outline potential avenues for future research, including improved Gaia data analysis and the incorporation of independent distance probes like Cepheid variables, to ultimately narrow this fundamental uncertainty in our understanding of the universe’s expansion history.
