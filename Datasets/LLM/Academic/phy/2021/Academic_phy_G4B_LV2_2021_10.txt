**Abstract**

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) remains a critical bottleneck in sustainable energy technologies, necessitating a deeper understanding of catalytic mechanisms. This study employs Grand Canonical Potential Kinetics (GCP-K) to dissect the HER process on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), specifically 1T’ WSe2 and WTe2, within the context of 2021 research. Utilizing density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigated the energetics and kinetics associated with key intermediates, revealing a nuanced reaction pathway distinct from conventional HER models. Our analysis highlights the significant role of intrinsic vacancy sites within the W-terminated surfaces of these materials as preferential sites for hydrogen adsorption and dissociative steps. 

Furthermore, the calculated grand canonical potential provides a robust framework for quantifying the thermodynamic barriers associated with each elementary step. These findings suggest that manipulating vacancy density – potentially through controlled defect engineering – could represent a viable strategy for enhancing HER performance. This research contributes to a more refined mechanistic understanding of HER on TMDs, informing the design of novel, high-performance electrocatalysts.
