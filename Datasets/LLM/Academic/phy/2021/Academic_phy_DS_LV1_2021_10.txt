**Abstract**

The hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) represents a cornerstone of sustainable energy technologies, with two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) emerging as promising non-precious metal catalysts. While the metallic 1T' phase is particularly attractive, a comprehensive, potential-dependent mechanistic understanding of its active sites remains a critical challenge. In this work, we employ grand canonical potential kinetics (GCP-K) simulations to elucidate the HER mechanism on 1T'-WSe2 and 1T'-WTe2, explicitly accounting for the role of chalcogen vacant sites. Our first-principles analysis reveals a dynamic, potential-dependent competition between the Volmer-Heyrovsky and Volmer-Tafel pathways. We demonstrate that the presence of vacancies significantly modulates the adsorption free energy of hydrogen intermediates (ΔG_H*), thereby dictating the dominant reaction channel. For 1T'-WSe2, the optimal ΔG_H* near vacant sites facilitates a low-onset potential, whereas the inherent electronic structure of 1T'-WTe2 promotes superior kinetics. These findings establish a rigorous electrochemical framework that directly links atomic-scale defect engineering to macroscopic catalytic performance, providing a strategic blueprint for the rational design of next-generation TMD-based electrocatalysts.
