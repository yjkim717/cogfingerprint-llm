**Abstract**

Black hole thermodynamics has traditionally focused on classical considerations of entropy and temperature. This work introduces a novel topological perspective to elucidate the intricate phase transitions occurring within black hole systems, specifically examining the anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole spacetime. Utilizing topological charge calculations, we identify and classify distinct critical points associated with alterations in black hole geometry and thermodynamic properties. Our analysis reveals that the topological invariants provide a sensitive probe of the black holeâ€™s internal structure, differentiating between various black hole types and offering a framework for understanding emergent thermodynamic behavior.  The identification of these topological charges represents a significant advancement, suggesting a deeper connection between gravity, topology, and phase transitions.  Further investigation into this framework promises to refine our understanding of black hole horizons and their role in fundamental physics, particularly in the context of holographic duality and quantum gravity, as highlighted in recent developments of 2021.
