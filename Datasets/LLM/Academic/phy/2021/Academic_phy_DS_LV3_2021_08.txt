A 2021 theoretical physics inquiry examines the ontological tension between neuroscientific and physical conceptions of temporal experience. While neuroscience posits a unidirectional flow of time anchored in a privileged present, modern physics—particularly within relativistic and thermodynamic frameworks—challenges this intuitive model. This paper critically evaluates Carlo Rovelli’s proposition that the “block universe” of general relativity, wherein past, present, and future coexist, is fundamentally incompatible with the neuroscientific present. We argue that this perceived incompatibility stems from a category error: conflating the epistemological structures of subjective experience with the ontological status of time itself. By integrating insights from quantum gravity and the thermodynamics of irreversible processes, we propose a compatibilist framework. This model reconciles the brain’s causal-sequential processing with a physical reality where temporal distinctions are not absolute but relationally defined. Consequently, the subjective “arrow of time” emerges not as an illusion, but as a thermodynamically-grounded feature of complex systems within a fundamentally atemporal cosmos, offering a coherent foundation for evaluating the physical plausibility of time travel scenarios.
