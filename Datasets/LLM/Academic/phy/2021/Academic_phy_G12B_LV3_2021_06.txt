**Abstract**

The persistent incompatibility between general relativity and quantum physics represents a fundamental challenge in modern theoretical physics. Loop quantum gravity (LQG) emerges as a prominent candidate for a quantum theory of gravity, directly addressing this discord by proposing a quantization of spacetime geometry itself. This approach moves beyond the perturbative strategies employed in other quantum gravity research programs, offering a non-perturbative framework predicated on the discretization of spacetime at the Planck scale.  Recent developments in LQG, particularly concerning spin foam models and their connection to covariant approaches, demonstrate progress in establishing a background-independent formulation.  Furthermore, investigations into black hole thermodynamics within the LQG framework provide intriguing insights into the nature of quantum spacetime and potential resolutions to the information paradox.  This work reviews the core tenets of LQG, highlighting its conceptual foundations and examining ongoing efforts to connect its predictions to observable phenomena, ultimately aiming to reconcile the macroscopic world governed by general relativity with the microscopic realm of quantum physics.
