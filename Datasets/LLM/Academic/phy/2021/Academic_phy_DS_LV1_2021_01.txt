**Abstract**

Bell's theorem ostensibly precludes local hidden variable theories from replicating all quantum correlations, a cornerstone of modern physics. This work challenges that conclusion by presenting a novel class of deterministic, locally causal models capable of approximating quantum systems to an arbitrary degree of precision. We demonstrate that the apparent violation of Bell inequalities arises not from non-locality, but from the epistemic restriction of observers to coarse-grained measurement outcomes, which masks a finer-grained, deterministic substructure. By constructing an explicit model that reproduces the statistics of entangled qubits, we show that the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics is consistent with a local and deterministic interpretation. This finding necessitates a re-evaluation of the foundational assumptions surrounding non-locality and suggests that classical causal models retain significant explanatory power for quantum phenomena.
