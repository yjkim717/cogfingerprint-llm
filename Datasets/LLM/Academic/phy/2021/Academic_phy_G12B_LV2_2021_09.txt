## Assessing the Impact of the LSST Observing Strategy on Photometric Supernova Classification via Gaussian Process Modeling

**Abstract:** The Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) promises an unprecedented dataset for supernova (SN) research, enabling statistically robust investigations of SN populations and cosmology. However, the LSST’s unique, rapid-cadence observing strategy introduces challenges for accurate photometric classification of SNe based solely on light curves. This study investigates the influence of the LSST observing pattern on the reliability of SN photometric classification using a simulation-based approach. We generate synthetic light curves for various SN types (Type Ia, Type II, Type Ib/c) representative of LSST expected fluxes and uncertainties. These light curves are subsequently modeled utilizing Gaussian Processes (GPs), a powerful non-parametric technique capable of capturing complex light curve variability and correlated noise. We evaluate the performance of GP-based classification algorithms under varying LSST observing cadences and filter combinations, quantifying the impact of data gaps and observing depth on classification accuracy. Initial results indicate that while the rapid cadence provides valuable temporal information, sparse coverage can degrade classification performance, particularly for SNe with atypical light curve shapes.  Our findings highlight the necessity for refined classification pipelines and potentially tailored observing strategies to maximize the scientific return from LSST’s supernova data, ensuring robust photometric classifications critical for cosmological distance measurements and SN population studies. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to optimize LSST data analysis workflows and addresses a key consideration for realizing the full potential of the upcoming survey.
