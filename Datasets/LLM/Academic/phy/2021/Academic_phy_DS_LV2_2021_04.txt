We refine Swampland constraints in eight-dimensional supergravity theories by employing a dual approach combining 3-brane probes and the cobordism conjecture. The probe brane dynamics facilitates a reconstruction of the internal geometric structure, imposing stringent consistency conditions on the effective field theory. Concurrently, the global anomaly cancellation requirement from the cobordism conjecture further restricts the possible gauge algebras realizable in the low-energy limit. Our analysis demonstrates that these combined topological and dynamical criteria exclude a significant class of anomaly-free models previously thought to be consistent, thereby sharpening the distinction between the landscape of effective theories and the swampland. This work, conducted in 2021, establishes a more robust framework for classifying supergravity vacua.
