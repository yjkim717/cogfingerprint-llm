We refine the Swampland constraints on 8-dimensional supergravity theories by leveraging the constraints imposed by 3-brane probes and the cobordism conjecture. Utilizing the string lamppost principle, we analyze the gauge algebra and its implications on the consistency of these theories. By sharpening the existing constraints, we provide new insights into the Swampland, constraining the allowed theories and shedding light on the intricate web of supergravity theories. Our findings, contextualized within the 2021 advancements, demonstrate the power of combining multiple consistency conditions to restrict the Swampland landscape.
