Abstract (2021): 
The forthcoming muon collider offers a paradigmatic shift in high-energy physics, poised to elucidate the intricacies of electroweak symmetry breaking and probe the nature of dark matter. By leveraging the unique characteristics of muon collisions, this facility will enable unprecedented precision in exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model. We present a compelling case for the muon collider, highlighting its potential to uncover novel phenomena and drive innovation in theoretical and experimental particle physics, thereby advancing our understanding of the universe.
