**Abstract**

The development of anode materials that mitigate large volume changes during lithiation is a persistent challenge in advancing high-performance lithium-ion batteries. This work investigates the electrochemical properties of the A-site deficient perovskite Li0.1La0.3NbO3 as a promising anode candidate. Rietveld refinement of synchrotron X-ray diffraction data confirms the stabilized perovskite framework with engineered cationic vacancies. Galvanostatic cycling reveals a high reversible capacity of 210 mAh gâˆ’1 at 0.1C with exceptional capacity retention of 95% after 500 cycles, attributed to its low strain characteristic. *In situ* X-ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations elucidate the mechanism, identifying a unique interstitial and vacancy-mediated Li+ transport pathway within the robust perovskite lattice. This mechanism minimizes crystallographic distortion, accounting for the outstanding structural integrity observed. These findings underscore the strategic design of A-site deficient perovskites as a viable route to create durable, high-capacity electrodes for next-generation energy storage. (172 words)
