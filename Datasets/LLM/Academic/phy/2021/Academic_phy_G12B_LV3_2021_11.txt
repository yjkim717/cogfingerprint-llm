**Abstract:** Recent theoretical work has explored fundamental limits on chaos within physical systems. Murata (2021) introduces a novel 'chaos energy bound,' positing an upper limit on the growth rate of the Lyapunov exponent, constrained to linear scaling with system energy. This conjecture, rooted in Hamiltonian mechanics, has implications for both classical and quantum systems, suggesting a potential thermodynamic consistency underlying chaotic dynamics. Furthermore, the bound’s implications for out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) are explored, potentially offering new avenues to probe quantum chaos. If validated, this constraint could represent a significant advance in our understanding of the maximal rate of information scrambling and a fundamental property of the universe’s dynamics.
