In 2021, a comprehensive analysis of asymptotically flat spacetimes in five dimensions was conducted using Hamiltonian methods. The study revealed a nonlinear deformation of the asymptotic symmetry algebra, associated with the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group. By examining the asymptotic symmetries, the research demonstrated that the BMS algebra is deformed in a manner consistent with the nonlinear structure of gravity. This deformation has significant implications for our understanding of the asymptotic structure of spacetime, shedding light on the intricate relationships between gravity, symmetry, and conservation laws in higher-dimensional spacetimes.
