The proposed multi-TeV muon collider represents a transformative facility for probing electroweak symmetry breaking and new physics beyond the Standard Model. Its unique capability to provide high-luminosity collisions at unprecedented center-of-mass energies offers a pristine environment for precision studies of electroweak radiation and the Higgs boson. This collider is exceptionally well-suited for direct searches for dark matter candidates and other weakly-coupled particles, circumventing limitations of hadron colliders. We demonstrate that such a machine can decisively explore TeV-scale physics, offering complementary and often superior sensitivity compared to existing and planned collider programs. The physics case presented herein establishes the muon collider as an essential component of the future high-energy physics landscape, with the potential to address fundamental questions in particle physics.
