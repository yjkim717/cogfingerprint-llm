**Abstract**

Quantifying the statistical dependence between variables is fundamental across numerous scientific disciplines. This work introduces GMM-MI, a novel algorithm for robust mutual information (MI) estimation leveraging Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Addressing limitations of existing methods, GMM-MI offers improved computational efficiency and enhanced accuracy, particularly in high-dimensional spaces. The framework's applicability is demonstrated through evaluations on both synthetic and real-world physical datasets.  Furthermore, we explore the utility of GMM-MI in the context of representation learning, specifically for interpreting deep learning models and rigorously assessing the degree of disentanglement within latent variable spaces.  The findings contribute to advancing interpretability techniques and provide a valuable tool for characterizing complex systems.
