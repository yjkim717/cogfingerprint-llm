Title: Revisiting Asymptotic Symmetry Algebra with Logarithmic Supertranslations: A Hamiltonian Formalism Approach

Abstract:
In the context of asymptotically flat spacetimes, the BMS(4) group has been extensively studied as the asymptotic symmetry algebra. However, the presence of supertranslation ambiguities has long plagued the definition of angular momentum. To address this issue, we extend the BMS(4) group by incorporating logarithmic supertranslations, thereby enlarging the asymptotic symmetry algebra. Utilizing the Hamiltonian formalism, we demonstrate that this extension enables the definition of supertranslation-invariant Lorentz charges. By doing so, we provide a novel resolution to the long-standing problem of supertranslation ambiguities in the definition of angular momentum. Our construction ensures that the Lorentz charges are well-defined and invariant under supertranslations, paving the way for a more precise understanding of the asymptotic structure of spacetime. This development has significant implications for our understanding of the interplay between gravity, spacetime geometry, and conserved quantities.
