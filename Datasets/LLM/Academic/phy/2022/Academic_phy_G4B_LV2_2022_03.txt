**Abstract**

We investigate the correlation functions within the spacetime geometry of extremal supersymmetric black holes, employing an exact solution derived within the framework of supergravity.  Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for time-independent correlators, offering a novel approach to characterizing the quantum entanglement structure of these extreme black hole configurations.  The analysis centers on exploiting the supersymmetric symmetry inherent to the solution, allowing for a simplification of the correlation operator calculations.  Crucially, our results provide insight into the behavior of quantum information within the black hole horizon, potentially illuminating the holographic duality paradigm.  Furthermore, we highlight the significant large ground state degeneracy observed in these systems, suggesting a rich landscape of quantum states accessible through correlation function analysis.  This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental properties of extremal supersymmetric black holes and their implications for quantum gravity research, published in 2022.
