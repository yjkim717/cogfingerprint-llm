**Abstract**

Recent developments in asymptotic symmetries have highlighted the importance of extending the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group, particularly in the context of four-dimensional spacetimes (BMS(4)). This work investigates the incorporation of logarithmic supertranslations into the BMS(4) framework, building upon advancements in the field since 2020. We demonstrate that these logarithmic supertranslations constitute an abelian subalgebra within the larger BMS(4) group, effectively decoupling them from the Poincar√© algebra and resolving certain inconsistencies arising from their interaction. Crucially, this separation allows for a refined definition of angular momentum charges, previously plagued by ambiguities stemming from the supertranslation gauge freedom. Our analysis provides a mathematically rigorous framework for calculating conserved quantities in asymptotically flat spacetimes, offering a pathway toward a more complete understanding of scattering amplitudes and gravitational dynamics. These results have significant implications for the ongoing development of modern approaches to quantum gravity and the exploration of black hole thermodynamics, furthering the theoretical understanding of gravitational fields in the strong-field regime. The presented formalism provides a novel perspective on the structure of asymptotic symmetries and their role in defining fundamental observables.
