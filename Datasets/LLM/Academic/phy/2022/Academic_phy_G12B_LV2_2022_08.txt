## A Physical Information Postulate for Relational Quantum Mechanics and its Implications for Inter-Observer Consistency

**Abstract:** Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) posits that quantum states are exclusively defined by the relationships between systems, eschewing the notion of absolute state. While elegantly addressing foundational issues like the measurement problem, RQM faces challenges regarding the physical realization of inter-observer agreement and the operational definition of relational properties. This paper introduces a novel postulate within the RQM framework: the Physical Information Postulate (PIP). PIP asserts that information characterizing the relational state between two observers must be physically stored and accessible within the systems involved and their surrounding environment. This requirement directly addresses criticisms concerning the potential for arbitrary, non-physical relational assignments and provides a concrete basis for evaluating the consistency of observations. We analyze the implications of PIP, specifically within the context of the Frauchiger-Renner thought experiment, demonstrating that the postulateâ€™s constraints on information storage significantly impact the conditions under which consistent, mutually agreed-upon outcomes can arise. Our analysis reveals that PIP necessitates a non-trivial interplay between quantum correlations and the physical resources available to observers, potentially offering new avenues for understanding the emergence of classicality and the role of decoherence in relativistic scenarios. Ultimately, this work aims to strengthen the theoretical foundation of RQM by grounding relational properties in physical reality and providing a rigorous framework for assessing intersubjective agreement in quantum systems.
