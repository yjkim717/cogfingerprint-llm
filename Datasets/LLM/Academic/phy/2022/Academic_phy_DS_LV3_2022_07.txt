In 2022, the synergy between numerical relativity and post-Minkowskian gravity has enabled unprecedented insights into black hole scattering dynamics. This study demonstrates that mapping post-Minkowskian results—specifically the radiation-reacted 4PM scattering data—into an effective-one-body potential framework yields remarkable agreement with numerical relativity simulations for equal-mass, non-spinning binaries. The incorporation of radiation reaction effects at the fourth post-Minkowskian order is critical, as it captures non-conservative dynamics absent in lower-order approximations. Our analysis confirms that the effective-one-body radial potential, calibrated with these high-precision inputs, accurately reproduces scattering angles and momentum transfer across a wide range of relativistic velocities. This concordance validates the hierarchical integration of perturbative and non-perturbative methods, establishing a unified description of black hole interactions from weak-field encounters to the strong-gravity regime.
