In this work, we derive a novel expression for tree-level amplitudes in superstring theories, facilitating a direct proof of unitarity in spacetime dimensions $d \leq 6$. By leveraging contour integrals to compute partial wave coefficients, we demonstrate that the optical theorem is satisfied, ensuring the consistency of the theory. Our result relies on the analytic structure of the amplitude, which is shown to be manifestly unitary. This finding provides a significant simplification of previous approaches, shedding new light on the fundamental properties of superstring theories in 2022.
