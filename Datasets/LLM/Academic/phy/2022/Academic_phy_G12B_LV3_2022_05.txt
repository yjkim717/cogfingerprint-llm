**Abstract:** Recent investigations utilizing Gaia EDR3 parallaxes to calibrate Cepheid variable stars for extragalactic distance measurements have revealed a notable tension with distance scales established by detached eclipsing binaries. Freedman et al. (2022) report a systematic offset between these methodologies, indicating a potential floor to distance precision of approximately 3%. This discrepancy, observed across both the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, raises concerns regarding the accuracy of current Cepheid-based distance calibrations. The findings underscore a critical need for refined systematic error analysis and potentially revised distance scales, ultimately limiting the achievable precision in extragalactic distance determinations to below 1% until these systematic effects are fully understood and mitigated.
