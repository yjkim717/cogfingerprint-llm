**Abstract**

The geometric phase, particularly the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase, has emerged as a foundational principle for the arbitrary manipulation of electromagnetic wavefronts. This concept enables robust phase modulation by controlling the orientation of anisotropic, subwavelength scatterers, circumventing the limitations of resonant phase accumulation. This review delineates the evolution of geometric phase metasurfaces from foundational theory to sophisticated, multi-functional devices. We critically analyze recent advancements in high-efficiency dielectric and tunable active metasurfaces that mitigate the inherent efficiency-bandwidth trade-off of earlier plasmonic implementations. The discussion extends to emerging applications, including chiral quantum emission control, polarization-multiplexed holography, and intelligent, reconfigurable surfaces for next-generation wireless communications. By synthesizing progress in materials and design methodologies, this work underscores the pivotal role of geometric phase metasurfaces in consolidating classical optical functions into ultra-compact, planar platforms, thereby charting a course for future disruptive photonic technologies.
