**Abstract**

The electrochemical performance of carbon dioxide conversion devices is critically dependent upon the stability of nanoscale water pools situated at electrode-electrolyte interfaces. This study employs stochastic simulations, incorporating the REXPON force field, to quantitatively investigate the dynamic fluctuations in pH within these confined aqueous environments. Utilizing a Monte Carlo approach with ion pair generation, we model the complex interplay of proton transport and electrolyte dissociation. Our simulations reveal that localized pH excursions, driven by stochastic variations in ion concentration, significantly impact the kinetics of key CO2 reduction reactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate a strong correlation between pH variability and the observed degradation pathways within the device. These findings highlight the importance of understanding and controlling interfacial water chemistry to enhance the durability and operational lifespan of electrochemical systems. The results provide a mechanistic framework for optimizing device design and electrolyte selection, contributing to advancements in sustainable energy technologies by 2022.
