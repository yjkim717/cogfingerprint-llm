**Abstract: Logarithmic Supertranslations and a Resolution of Angular Momentum Ambiguities in Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes**

The ongoing quest to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics necessitates a deeper understanding of asymptotic symmetries in flat spacetimes.  Building upon the established framework of Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) group in four dimensions (BMS(4)), we investigate the incorporation of logarithmic supertranslations as a crucial extension of this symmetry algebra.  Traditional BMS(4) possesses inherent limitations in describing scattering amplitudes and addressing the issues of soft graviton theorems, particularly concerning the treatment of angular momentum. This work demonstrates that the inclusion of logarithmic supertranslations yields a symmetry algebra that exhibits a clear decoupling from the Poincaré algebra, providing a more mathematically rigorous and physically insightful description of asymptotic flatness.

Crucially, we explore the implications of this extended symmetry for the definition of angular momentum at null infinity.  Previous approaches have suffered from ambiguities arising from the lack of a canonical definition within the standard BMS framework. Our analysis reveals that the logarithmic supertranslation extension inherently resolves these ambiguities, providing a well-defined and finite expression for angular momentum, independent of the choice of asymptotic slicing. This resolves a long-standing challenge in the field. Furthermore, we present an asymptotic expansion of the symmetry algebra, highlighting the structure of the central extension associated with the logarithmic modes. This provides a powerful tool for calculating scattering amplitudes and exploring the connection between BMS symmetry and the emergence of conserved charges in asymptotically flat spacetimes, potentially offering new avenues for understanding quantum gravity effects.  We conclude by discussing the implications for future investigations into the holographic duality and the information paradox.
