In the context of the Swampland program in quantum gravity, recent theoretical developments have uncovered profound implications for particle physics and cosmology. A key prediction arising from the de Sitter swampland conjectures and observational data on dark energy is the existence of a mesoscopic "dark dimension"—an extra spatial dimension at the micron scale. This framework naturally accommodates towers of sterile neutrinos, whose mass scale is intrinsically linked to the cosmological constant. The mass of the lightest active neutrino is consequently predicted to be of order 10^-2 eV, a range accessible to next-generation laboratory experiments. Concurrently, the species scale—the quantum gravity cutoff in the presence of a vast number of light states—plays a dual role. It not only governs the scale of quantum gravitational effects but also provides a potential resolution to the metastability of the electroweak vacuum. The high-scale instability of the Higgs potential, a persistent issue within the Standard Model, is suppressed when the species scale lies below the instability scale, offering a novel mechanism for stabilizing the Higgs sector. Furthermore, the decay of the lightest sterile neutrino within the tower, facilitated by its mixing with active neutrinos, produces detectable particles. This process imposes stringent constraints on the model's parameter space from ultra-high-energy cosmic ray observations, creating a testable bridge between quantum gravity conjectures and astrophysical phenomena. This synthesis positions the dark dimension scenario as a falsifiable framework connecting fundamental Planck-scale physics to low-energy observables.
