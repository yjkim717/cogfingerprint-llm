In 2022, a comparative analysis was conducted between numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole scattering and post-Minkowskian gravity predictions. The study revealed a remarkable congruence between the two approaches when incorporating radiation-reacted 4PM corrections. By leveraging the effective-one-body formalism, the investigation demonstrated that the inclusion of fourth post-Minkowskian (4PM) order gravitational potential significantly enhances the accuracy of scattering predictions. These findings underscore the efficacy of synergizing numerical relativity and post-Minkowskian gravity in elucidating the dynamics of binary black hole systems.
