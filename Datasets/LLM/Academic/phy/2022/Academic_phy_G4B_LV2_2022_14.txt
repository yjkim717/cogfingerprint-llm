**Abstract**

Black holes, traditionally viewed as regions of spacetime singularity, are increasingly investigated within the framework of thermodynamic concepts, specifically as emergent defects. This work proposes a novel perspective, characterizing black hole solutions as topological defects exhibiting a fundamental connection to quantum gravity. We introduce the concept of a universal winding number, intrinsically linked to the asymptotic behavior of these spacetimes, and demonstrate its relevance in quantifying the deviation from classical black hole thermodynamics.  The analysis centers on exploiting topological defects – in this case, black holes – to probe the interplay between geometry and thermodynamics.  Specifically, we argue that the winding number represents a conserved quantity arising from the underlying quantum gravitational dynamics.  Furthermore, this topological character suggests a potential pathway to resolving singularities and provides a framework for exploring the emergence of entropy from fundamentally discrete quantum degrees of freedom.  Future research will focus on calculating this winding number for specific black hole solutions and its implications for observable phenomenology in 2022.
