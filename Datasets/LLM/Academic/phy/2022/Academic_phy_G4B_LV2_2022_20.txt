**Abstract**

The persistent puzzle of neutrino masses and mixing remains a central challenge in particle physics. This work explores a novel theoretical framework wherein generalized global symmetries, incorporating Z’ boson mediators, provide a viable pathway for generating non-zero neutrino masses via non-perturbative mechanisms. We posit that specific leptonic symmetries, coupled with spontaneous symmetry breaking, can induce a complex mixing pattern within the neutrino sector, circumventing the traditional reliance on seesaw mechanisms. 

Our investigation leverages principles of quantum gauge theory, specifically examining the dynamics arising from the interaction of these symmetries with the Z’ bosons. The model predicts a rich phenomenology, potentially observable through future neutrino oscillation experiments and searches for rare decays involving Z’ bosons. Crucially, the proposed framework offers a constrained landscape for parameter space, guided by the requirement of maintaining consistency with existing experimental constraints.  Further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate the implications of this generalized symmetry breaking approach and its potential to refine our understanding of neutrino properties and the fundamental symmetries governing the Standard Model.
