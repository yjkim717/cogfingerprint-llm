**Abstract**

We present a novel approach to simulating star formation within asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence. Utilizing a localized scalar field as a source term in a conformal field theory (CFT) embedded within the AdS bulk, we demonstrate a method for generating dynamically evolving, orbiting stellar structures. This technique bypasses traditional numerical relativity challenges by directly constructing gravitational configurations through field manipulations within the dual CFT. Specifically, we explore the response function of the scalar field, quantifying its influence on the emergent spacetime geometry and the resulting stellar distribution. The asymptotic nature of AdS allows for tractable analysis, facilitating the investigation of early-stage star formation processes.  Preliminary results suggest a viable pathway for studying complex astrophysical phenomena within a controlled theoretical framework, offering potential insights into the holographic nature of gravity and the connection between quantum field theory and general relativity.  Further investigation will focus on parameter space exploration and fidelity enhancement.
