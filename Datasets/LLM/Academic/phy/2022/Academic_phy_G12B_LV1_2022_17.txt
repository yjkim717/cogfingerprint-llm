## Geometric Phase Metasurfaces: A Review of Design Strategies and Emerging Applications

Geometric phases, particularly the Pancharatnam-Berry phase, have transitioned from a theoretical curiosity in quantum mechanics to a powerful tool for manipulating classical light. This review, conducted in late 2022, explores the burgeoning field of geometric phase metasurfaces, artificial structures exhibiting subwavelength features designed to impart tailored phase profiles upon incident electromagnetic radiation. We examine recent advancements in metasurface design strategies, moving beyond early implementations relying on discrete elements to encompass continuous gradient phase modulation techniques. These approaches leverage complex material distributions and intricate structural geometries to achieve unprecedented control over polarization, amplitude, and wavefront shaping.  The review details various implementations, including metallic, dielectric, and hybrid metasurfaces, highlighting the trade-offs in fabrication complexity, operational bandwidth, and loss mechanisms. Furthermore, we survey the expanding range of applications, encompassing beam steering, polarization conversion, advanced imaging, and novel optical functionalities such as cloaking and perfect absorbers.  Finally, we discuss current challenges and future directions, including the pursuit of dynamically tunable geometric phase metasurfaces and integration with advanced fabrication techniques for scalable and cost-effective production.
