**Abstract: Towards a Relational Quantum Mechanics Grounded in Intersubjective Agreement – A Postulatory Approach**

The persistent challenge in interpreting quantum mechanics lies in reconciling the inherent relationality of quantum states with the prevalent notion of objective, observer-independent reality. This paper introduces a novel postulate within the framework of relational quantum mechanics, specifically designed to mitigate the ongoing debate regarding information physicality and its accessible manifestation. We posit that the quantum state itself is not a fixed, pre-existing entity, but rather a dynamically evolving relational construct, fundamentally dependent on the correlated observations of interacting systems. 

Crucially, this postulate emphasizes the role of ‘intersubjective agreement’ – the convergence of measurement outcomes arising from multiple, independent observers – as a core determinant of state collapse.  By prioritizing this shared experiential grounding, we aim to move beyond purely epistemic interpretations and towards a more robust, empirically-informed understanding.  This approach seeks to establish a foundational framework amenable to addressing persistent questions regarding the observer’s influence and the ontological status of quantum information, paving the way for a more unified perspective in information physics and quantum foundations research in 2022.
