Title: Thermodynamic Limitations on Quantum Computing: Implications of the Nernst Unattainability Principle on Qubit Initialization

Abstract:
The scalability of quantum computers is contingent upon maintaining high fidelity in qubit operations, a challenge exacerbated by the constraints imposed by the third law of thermodynamics. Specifically, the Nernst unattainability principle dictates that it is impossible to achieve absolute zero temperature by any finite number of processes, thereby introducing an effective non-zero temperature in quantum computing systems. This residual temperature compromises the fidelity of qubit initialization, a critical step in quantum circuit operation. In this work, we examine the implications of thermodynamic limitations on the performance of quantum computers. By analyzing the interplay between the third law and qubit initialization, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding the temperature-dependent error rates in quantum computing. Our findings underscore the need for innovative cooling strategies to mitigate the effects of non-zero temperatures on large-scale quantum computing.
