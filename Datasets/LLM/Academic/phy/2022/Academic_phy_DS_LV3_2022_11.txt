In this work, we develop a novel framework within the AdS/CFT correspondence to engineer and analyze orbiting stellar configurations in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. By introducing specific time-dependent scalar field sources at the conformal boundary, we demonstrate the holographic induction of localized, massive objects in the bulk gravitational theory. These objects exhibit stable orbital motion, whose characteristics are directly encoded in the correlation functions of the boundary conformal field theory. Our analysis reveals that the orbital parameters, such as period and eccentricity, can be precisely reconstructed from the boundary data, providing a non-perturbative method for extracting geometric information of the bulk spacetime. This approach establishes a robust dictionary for probing strong-field gravitational dynamics via boundary quantum observables, with implications for studying gravitational collapse and multi-body systems in holographic settings.
