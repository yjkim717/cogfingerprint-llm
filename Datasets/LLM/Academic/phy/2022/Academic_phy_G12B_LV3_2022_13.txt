**Abstract**

The pursuit of scalable quantum computation faces a fundamental thermodynamic constraint. While quantum algorithms necessitate initialization in a low-temperature, pure quantum state to ensure high fidelity, the third law of thermodynamics poses a theoretical limit on achieving absolute zero. This work investigates the implications of a finite, albeit small, effective temperature on quantum computer performance, specifically concerning fidelity degradation and its impact on system scaling. We demonstrate that even minimal thermal fluctuations introduce decoherence pathways, diminishing the accuracy of quantum operations and consequently limiting the number of qubits that can be reliably controlled. This analysis highlights a critical tension between quantum information processing requirements and established thermodynamic principles, suggesting that novel cooling techniques or error mitigation strategies are essential for realizing practical, large-scale quantum computers.
