In this work, we demonstrate that generalized global symmetries, specifically noninvertible symmetries arising in extended gauge theories, provide a novel mechanism for generating naturally small neutrino masses. By embedding the Standard Model within a framework incorporating additional U(1)' gauge interactions, we show that the associated higher-form symmetries are broken by the presence of magnetic monopoles. This breaking generates nonperturbative effects that explicitly violate lepton family number, thereby inducing small Majorana mass terms for neutrinos. Crucially, this mechanism operates without introducing additional fermionic fields or relying on the conventional seesaw paradigm. The mass scale is dynamically set by the exponential suppression characteristic of instanton processes, linked to the mass of the Z' boson and the monopole density. We analyze the phenomenological constraints from collider searches and astrophysical observations, finding viable parameter space where the Z' boson could be accessible at future high-energy experiments. This work establishes a profound connection between quantum field theory topology and neutrino phenomenology, offering an ultraviolet-complete alternative to traditional model-building approaches.
