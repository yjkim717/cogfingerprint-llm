**Abstract**

The persistent challenge of reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics motivates exploration of unconventional approaches to black hole physics. This work investigates a novel perspective wherein black hole solutions are interpreted as topological thermodynamic defects within the spacetime manifold. We posit that the stability and properties of these solutions are intimately related to topological invariants, specifically winding numbers associated with the horizon geometry. Utilizing a variational framework, we demonstrate that a universal topological number, characterizing the black hole's horizon structure, emerges naturally from this defect description. This number, dependent on the winding configuration, provides a robust measure of black hole distinguishability and potentially influences gravitational dynamics. Our approach offers a new avenue for exploring quantum gravity effects by leveraging concepts from condensed matter physics, potentially providing insights into the microscopic origin of black hole entropy and resolving singularities. This framework provides a foundation for further investigation into the interplay between topology, thermodynamics, and gravity, contributing to a deeper understanding of black hole physics in the context of ongoing research in quantum gravity theories.
