**Abstract**

The manipulation of ultrafast optical pulses remains a central challenge in modern photonics, demanding increasingly sophisticated control mechanisms. This work introduces a novel approach leveraging metasurface engineering to achieve precise spatiotemporal shaping of ultrashort laser pulses. Utilizing nonlinear optics and coherent control principles, we demonstrate the fabrication and characterization of metasurfaces designed to induce tailored phase distortions within the pulse envelope. These distortions, meticulously engineered through precise geometric arrangements of the metasurface elements, allow for the generation of pulses exhibiting enhanced temporal and spatial coherence.  Experimental results, obtained through pump-probe spectroscopy, confirm the ability to synthesize pulses with significantly altered pulse shapes.  This technique offers a promising pathway toward advanced applications including high-resolution microscopy, ultrafast material processing, and improved frequency comb generation. Further research will explore scaling and integration for practical implementation in 2023.
