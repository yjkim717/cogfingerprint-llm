**GMM-MI: A Gaussian Mixture Model Approach to Robust Mutual Information Estimation for Enhanced Deep Learning Interpretability**

Estimating mutual information (MI) between variables is crucial for understanding dependencies within complex systems, finding increasing application in both physics and machine learning. However, accurate and efficient MI estimation remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data common in modern deep learning architectures. This paper introduces GMM-MI, a novel algorithm for MI estimation leveraging Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to address these limitations.  Unlike traditional methods, GMM-MI models the underlying probability distributions with a flexible parametric representation, improving robustness to non-Gaussianity and mitigating the "curse of dimensionality."

We demonstrate that GMM-MI offers a computationally efficient alternative to kernel-based estimators and variational approximations, while simultaneously exhibiting superior performance in accurately quantifying MI, particularly in scenarios with limited data.  Crucially, we explore the application of GMM-MI to the interpretability of deep latent representations. By assessing the MI between input features and learned latent variables within a deep neural network, GMM-MI facilitates the identification of salient features driving network behavior and provides insights into the learned representations' semantic content.  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate GMM-MIâ€™s efficacy in both MI estimation and subsequent interpretability analysis, suggesting a valuable tool for advancing both representation learning and the understanding of complex, high-dimensional systems.  This work contributes to the growing body of research bridging physics-inspired statistical methods and the advancement of explainable artificial intelligence.
