Title: Correlators of Supergraviton Modes in Extremal Supersymmetric Black Holes

Abstract:
In this work, we investigate the correlation functions of supergraviton modes in extremal supersymmetric black holes, leveraging exact solutions to supergravity equations. By exploiting the preserved supercharges, we derive a general expression for the n-point correlator of supergraviton modes, demonstrating its time-independence. Our analysis reveals that the correlators are determined by the supersymmetric properties of the black hole background, rather than the specific details of the supergraviton mode dynamics. We compute the two-point and three-point correlators explicitly, showcasing the efficacy of our method. The results provide insight into the holographic properties of supersymmetric black holes and their potential implications for understanding the statistical entropy of these systems. Our findings are consistent with the expectations from supersymmetric quantum mechanics and reinforce the utility of exact solutions in probing the physics of extremal black holes. (2022)
