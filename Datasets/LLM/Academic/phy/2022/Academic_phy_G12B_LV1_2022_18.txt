**Abstract:**

The precise manipulation of light-matter interactions at ultrafast timescales remains a central challenge in modern optics. While significant progress has been achieved with conventional techniques, achieving arbitrary spatiotemporal control over optical transients with high resolution has proven particularly demanding. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach leveraging the unique capabilities of metasurfaces to synthesize complex, arbitrarily shaped ultrafast optical pulses. Our method utilizes a generalized Fourier transform framework to design metasurface elements capable of imparting spatially variant phase profiles onto incident femtosecond pulses. By strategically arranging these elements, we achieve precise control over the pulseâ€™s temporal duration, spatial wavefront, and polarization state.

Specifically, we present a design and experimental validation of a metasurface platform that can generate tailored pulse shapes, including steep temporal edges and complex spatial modes, with sub-wavelength resolution. The underlying principle involves encoding the desired spatiotemporal profile as a spatially varying phase delay across the metasurface, effectively acting as a programmable beam shaper for ultrafast light. We detail the theoretical model employed to predict and optimize the metasurface performance, incorporating considerations of fabrication tolerances and material dispersion. Experimental results, using readily available femtosecond laser sources, confirm the ability to generate targeted pulse profiles with high fidelity. This work establishes a pathway toward dynamic optical control and opens new avenues for applications in areas such as ultrafast spectroscopy, optical microscopy, and quantum information processing, where precise spatiotemporal light shaping is paramount.
