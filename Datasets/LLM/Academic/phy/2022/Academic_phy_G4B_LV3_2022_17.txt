**Abstract**

Recent research has witnessed a surge in the development and application of geometric phase metasurfaces, leveraging their unique ability to generate wavefront phase shifts independent of traditional refractive index modulation. This review synthesizes advancements in 2022 concerning continuously shaped metasurfaces, incorporating dynamic reconfiguration mechanisms and exploring nonlinear optical effects.  Specifically, we examine the implementation of gradient phase modulation strategies, often rooted in the Pancharatnam-Berry phase formalism, to achieve complex optical transformations.  The utilization of metasurfaces allows for unprecedented control over light propagation, enabling applications ranging from advanced beam shaping and holographic imaging to novel optical sensors. Furthermore, investigations into dynamically tunable metasurfaces, responsive to external stimuli, demonstrate a pathway toward adaptable optical elements.  Challenges remain in achieving robust fabrication techniques and optimizing nonlinear responses, yet the continued exploration of these optical metasurfaces promises to fundamentally alter the landscape of photonics.
