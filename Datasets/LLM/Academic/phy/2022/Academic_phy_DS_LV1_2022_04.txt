**Abstract**

Recent developments in the Swampland program, particularly the Trans-Planckian Censorship and de Sitter conjectures, posit stringent constraints on consistent low-energy effective field theories coupled to quantum gravity. Concurrently, observational cosmology indicates a metastable dark energy phase, challenging the construction of durable de Sitter vacua. We propose a unified framework wherein these dual pressures—theoretical and phenomenological—naturally precipitate a "dark dimension," a mesoscopic spacelike direction with a characteristic length scale in the micron range. The compactification of this dimension generates a tower of sterile neutrinos, identified with Kaluza-Klein states, whose cumulative density saturates the species bound. This tower intrinsically defines the species scale, Λsp ∼ 1/R^1/3, which acts as the true quantum gravity cutoff, suppressing the scale of perturbative unitarity violation in the Standard Model. Crucially, we demonstrate that this lowered cutoff, Λsp ≪ MPl, provides a natural resolution to the Higgs vacuum instability by suppressing the running of the quartic coupling at high energies, thereby elevating the metastability scale above Λsp. This work establishes a direct link between quantum gravity consistency conditions, the nature of dark energy, and electroweak vacuum stability.
