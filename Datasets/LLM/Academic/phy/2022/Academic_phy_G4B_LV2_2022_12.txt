**Abstract**

Rhodopsin, the visual pigment of *Drosophila*, exhibits remarkably high quantum efficiency in initiating the visual cascade, a phenomenon long recognized but incompletely understood.  Employing a novel quantum–classical simulation framework, this study investigates the underlying mechanisms governing rhodopsin’s exceptional performance. Our simulations demonstrate that the observed high quantum efficiency is fundamentally linked to a pronounced excited-state population splitting within the chromophore. This splitting, critically, is substantially modulated by the electrostatic environment established by the surrounding protein scaffold. Specifically, variations in protein electrostatics influence the vibrational modes of the retinal chromophore, thereby altering the pathways available for energy dissipation. 

Furthermore, the simulations incorporate the effects of thermal noise, revealing its contribution to the observed stochasticity in energy transfer.  These results suggest that rhodopsin’s efficient conversion of absorbed light into a signaling event is not solely a consequence of chromophore properties, but rather a sophisticated interplay between structural protein dynamics and thermal fluctuations.  The findings provide a mechanistic basis for understanding and potentially optimizing light-harvesting systems beyond rhodopsin.
