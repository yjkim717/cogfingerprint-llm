**Abstract**

Accurate predictions of strong-field gravitational phenomena remain a significant challenge in theoretical physics. This work presents advancements in post-Minkowskian (PM) gravity, specifically addressing the discrepancy between analytical PM calculations and numerical relativity (NR) results for black hole scattering events. Utilizing a reformulated PM approach, we demonstrate enhanced convergence and improved quantitative agreement with NR data obtained in 2022. The core of this development lies in a refined treatment of the gravitational potential, incorporating corrections beyond standard PM orderings to account for higher-order effects.  We leverage the effective one-body (EOB) formalism within the PM framework, allowing for a systematic expansion of the scattering dynamics.  These modifications mitigate systematic errors inherent in earlier PM formulations, resulting in a more robust and reliable predictive capability.  The enhanced accuracy offers a valuable tool for testing and refining our understanding of gravity in extreme environments, and contributes to the ongoing effort to bridge the gap between analytical and numerical approaches to strong-field gravity.
