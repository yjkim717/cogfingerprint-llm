**Abstract**

The development of novel cathode materials is crucial for advancing lithium-ion battery technology. This study investigates the electrochemical properties of cation-deficient CeNb3O9, demonstrating its potential as a high-performance electrode material. Through detailed characterization utilizing X-ray diffraction and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we observed the formation of atomic short-range order within the CeNb3O9 lattice upon cycling. Critically, this structural rearrangement, induced by lithium-ion intercalation, correlates strongly with enhanced lithium-ion conductivity and a remarkable ability to maintain high rate capacity. Specifically, the material exhibited sustained cycling stability exceeding 200 cycles at 2C rate. These findings suggest that controlled cation deficiency strategically promotes beneficial structural modifications, ultimately contributing to improved battery performance. Further research will focus on optimizing the cation deficiency level to maximize these effects and elucidate the precise mechanisms driving enhanced ion transport.
