**Abstract**

Geometric phase metasurfaces have emerged as a powerful platform for manipulating electromagnetic waves with unprecedented control, enabling advanced functionalities in planar optics. This review synthesizes recent progress in the field, concentrating on strategies for achieving continuous and dynamically tunable gradient phase modulation using metasurface architectures. We examine the evolution of designs incorporating continuously shaped elements, offering enhanced fabrication flexibility and performance. Furthermore, we explore the implementation of composite metasurfaces, which leverage multiple materials and structural motifs to achieve complex phase profiles. A significant focus is placed on nonlinear and high-order Pancharatnam-Berry phase implementations, demonstrating their potential for realizing advanced functionalities beyond linear optics, including beam steering, polarization control, and wavefront shaping. The inherent advantages of these metasurfaces—thin profiles, ease of fabrication, and design versatility—position them as key components in next-generation photonic devices. This work highlights the current state-of-the-art and outlines future directions for geometric phase metasurfaces, particularly regarding scalability and integration with active materials for dynamic control.
