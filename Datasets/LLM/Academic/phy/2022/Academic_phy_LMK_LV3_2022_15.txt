Title: Unveiling the Potential of Cation-Deficient Perovskites for High-Performance Lithium-Ion Batteries

Abstract:
The quest for fast-charging lithium-ion batteries has led to the exploration of novel materials with enhanced ionic conductivity and structural stability. In this context, cation-deficient perovskite-type oxides have emerged as promising candidates. Specifically, CeNb3O9, with its unique atomic short-range order and cation-vacancy-enhanced 3D-conduction networks, exhibits exceptional high-rate capacity and long-term cycling stability. Our investigation (2022) reveals that the intricate interplay between cation vacancies and atomic arrangement in CeNb3O9 enables efficient lithium-ion diffusion and mitigates structural degradation. Consequently, CeNb3O9 demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance, making it an attractive material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. This study highlights the potential of cation-deficient perovskites in advancing the development of high-performance energy storage systems, with significant implications for the design of fast-charging batteries.
