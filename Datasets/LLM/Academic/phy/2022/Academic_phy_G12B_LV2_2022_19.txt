**Abstract**

We report on the efficient generation of spatially entangled photon pairs utilizing a periodically patterned lithium niobate metasurface. Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) within the metasurface structure facilitates the creation of polarization-entangled photons with enhanced generation rates compared to traditional bulk crystal approaches. The design leverages the strong field enhancement and nonlinear response characteristic of subwavelength structures to optimize the phase-matching conditions and improve conversion efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate a significant increase in the heralded entanglement rate, directly attributable to the metasurface's unique optical properties. This work represents a critical step toward miniaturizing quantum optical systems, as the integrated metasurface architecture allows for a reduction in device footprint while maintaining high performance. The demonstrated approach holds substantial promise for applications in quantum communication, quantum sensing, and integrated quantum photonics, offering a pathway to compact and scalable entangled photon sources.
