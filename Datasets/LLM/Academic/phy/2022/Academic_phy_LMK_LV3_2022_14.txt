"In a novel reinterpretation of black hole thermodynamics, we conceptualize black hole solutions as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. This innovative framework reveals a universal topological number inherent to black hole systems, providing profound insights into their thermodynamic stability and the underlying principles of quantum gravity. By elucidating the topological characteristics of black holes, our research advances the understanding of these enigmatic systems and their role in the broader context of gravitational physics, as presented in 2022."
