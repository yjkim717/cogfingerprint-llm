Title: Revisiting the Foundations of Relational Quantum Mechanics: A Novel Postulate for Reconciling Physicality of Information and Intersubjective Agreement

Abstract:
Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) posits that quantum states are relative to the observer, sparking debates on the physicality of information and the limits of intersubjective agreement. A longstanding tension within RQM arises from the inaccessibility of certain information, ostensibly contradicting the physicality of information principle. To resolve this conundrum, we propose a novel postulate: the 'Relational Accessibility Principle' (RAP). RAP stipulates that the physicality of information is contingent upon the observer's relational context, thereby constraining the scope of inaccessible information. By integrating RAP into RQM, we demonstrate that the resulting framework reconciles the physicality of information with the observed limitations on intersubjective agreement regarding quantum events. Our proposal is substantiated through a detailed analysis of the relational structure of quantum states and its implications for measurement outcomes. This development offers a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between quantum mechanics and the notion of physical information, advancing the discourse in the field since its inception in the 1990s and revitalized in 2022.
