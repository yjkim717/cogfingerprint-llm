**Abstract**

This work introduces a novel extension to the Bargmann–Metzner–Sachs (BMS(4)) group, incorporating logarithmic supertranslations to fundamentally alter its symmetry structure.  The standard BMS(4) group, a cornerstone of asymptotic symmetries in relativistic spacetimes, exhibits a non-decoupled algebra.  We demonstrate that the inclusion of logarithmic supertranslations yields a manifestly decoupled symmetry algebra, characterized by a precisely defined angular momentum component.  This transformation effectively decouples translational and rotational degrees of freedom, a crucial advancement for addressing challenges in canonical quantization and the description of quantum field theories in curved spacetime. 

The resulting algebra possesses a central extension, reflecting the logarithmic nature of the supertranslations and providing a key ingredient for ensuring unitarity.  We argue that this extended formalism offers a more amenable framework for investigating asymptotic symmetries, particularly in scenarios involving black hole spacetimes and the holographic principle.  Furthermore, the supertranslation invariance of the modified algebra holds significant implications for the construction of effective field theories, potentially simplifying calculations and providing deeper insights into the underlying physics.  This research, presented in 2022, contributes to a more nuanced understanding of BMS symmetry and its applications within modern theoretical physics.
