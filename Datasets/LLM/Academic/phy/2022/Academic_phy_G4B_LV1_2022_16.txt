**Logarithmic Supertranslations and Asymptotic Symmetry in BMS(4) Space**

The classical Brown-York–Suzuki (BMS) group provides a foundational framework for describing asymptotically flat spacetime.  This work investigates an extension of the BMS(4) group, incorporating logarithmic supertranslations alongside traditional translations and Lorentz transformations. We demonstrate that the introduction of these logarithmic supertranslations fundamentally alters the symmetry algebra, yielding a decoupled structure wherein the Poincaré and diffeomorphism algebras no longer commute.  Crucially, this decoupling is intimately linked to the emergence of an asymptotic symmetry, specifically concerning angular momentum.  

Detailed analysis reveals that the resulting theory exhibits a supertranslation invariance with respect to the logarithmic supertranslations, manifesting as a conserved angular momentum component.  This invariance is not merely a consequence of the extended symmetry algebra, but a direct result of the logarithmic terms’ influence on the spacetime metric.  These findings suggest a novel approach to understanding the structure of asymptotically flat spacetime and potentially offer insights into the holographic principle and the nature of quantum gravity. Further investigation into the implications of this extended BMS group is warranted.

**Notes on Choices Made:**

*   **Formal Tone:** Used phrases like “This work investigates,” “Detailed analysis reveals,” and “Further investigation is warranted.”
*   **Precise Terminology:** Incorporated terms like “asymptotically flat spacetime,” “decoupled structure,” “supertranslation invariance,” and “diffeomorphism algebra.”
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: introduces the BMS group, explains the extension, describes the consequences (decoupling and angular momentum), and suggests future directions.
*   **Year Context:** The language and referencing style are appropriate for a 2022 publication.
