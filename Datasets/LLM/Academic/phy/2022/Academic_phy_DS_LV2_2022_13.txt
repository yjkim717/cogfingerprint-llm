Of particular concern in the scaling of quantum circuits is the fundamental thermodynamic constraint on qubit initialization. This work analyzes the implications of the Nernst unattainability principle—a formulation of the third law of thermodynamics—for achieving the near-zero entropy states required for high-fidelity quantum computation. We demonstrate that the asymptotic cost of cooling a qubit to its ground state diverges as the target temperature approaches absolute zero. This inaccessibility of perfect purity imposes a fundamental, non-negotiable lower bound on the initial entropy of any physical qubit, directly impacting the fidelity of initial states and the resultant computational outcomes. Consequently, the third law presents a thermodynamic bottleneck that must be rigorously incorporated into quantum error correction and fault-tolerance thresholds, ultimately governing the maximum scale of reliable quantum processors. Our findings necessitate a revision of idealized scaling models to account for these immutable thermodynamic costs.
