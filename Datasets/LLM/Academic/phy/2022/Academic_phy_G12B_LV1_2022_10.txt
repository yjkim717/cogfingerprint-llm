**Abstract: pH Modulation and Stochastic Fluctuations in Confined Aqueous Environments: Implications for Electrolyte Stability in Nanostructured CO₂ Conversion Devices**

The performance and longevity of emerging nanostructured devices for carbon dioxide conversion are critically dependent on the stability of electrolyte interfaces at the nanoscale.  While macroscopic electrochemical studies provide valuable insights, the behavior of aqueous electrolytes within confined geometries, particularly the influence of pH and stochastic fluctuations, remains poorly understood. This work presents a computational investigation into the pH landscape and associated dynamic behavior within nanoscale water pools, specifically focusing on their relevance to the stability of ion pairs within the context of electrochemical CO₂ reduction. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations employing the reactive exponential (rexpon) force field, we modeled water pools ranging from 2 to 10 nanometers in diameter, systematically varying the initial pH conditions.  Our simulations reveal a significant deviation from bulk pH behavior within these confined spaces, characterized by a non-uniform pH distribution and the emergence of localized acidic and basic microenvironments.

The rexpon force field allowed for the explicit observation of proton transfer events and the formation/dissociation of hydronium ions (H₃O⁺), providing a direct mechanistic understanding of pH regulation.  Analysis of the simulation data reveals that the degree of pH deviation from bulk values is inversely proportional to pool size, suggesting enhanced stabilization of the bulk pH condition at larger pool sizes. Furthermore, we observed pronounced stochastic fluctuations in pH, exhibiting Lévy statistics rather than the Gaussian behavior typically associated with Brownian motion. This non-Gaussian behavior is attributed to the infrequent, but impactful, proton transfer events driven by the rexpon potential. We then incorporated monovalent cation-anion pairs (e.g., Li⁺Cl⁻) into the water pools and assessed their stability as a function of pH and pool size.  Results indicate that the lifetime of ion pairs is significantly reduced under conditions of high pH fluctuation and within smaller pools, suggesting a potential degradation pathway for electrolytes in nanostructured CO₂ conversion devices. These findings highlight the importance of considering nanoscale pH inhomogeneities and stochastic dynamics in the design and optimization of robust electrochemical systems.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Improvements:**

*   **Rexpon Force Field:** I included this because it's specified and suggests a focus on reactive chemical processes.
*   **Lévy Statistics:** This is a more sophisticated statistical description of stochasticity than simple Gaussian fluctuations and adds a layer of scientific rigor.
*   **Ion Pair Degradation Pathway:** I've attempted to connect the simulation results to a practical problem (electrolyte stability) to show the relevance of the research.
*   **Specificity:** I added specific examples (Li⁺Cl⁻) to enhance clarity.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for a target, but word counts in abstracts can vary.  Adjust as necessary for the specific journal.
