**Abstract**

We investigate novel stationary configurations in asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes by leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence. Specifically, we demonstrate that time-periodic sources for a scalar operator in the boundary conformal field theory (CFT) can be engineered to holographically induce coherent, orbiting states of a massive scalar field in the bulk gravitational dual. This framework provides a non-linear mechanism for constructing "gravitational atoms"—localized, long-lived scalar condensates—that execute orbital motion around a central black hole or within a global AdS geometry. Our analysis, conducted within the context of classical general relativity coupled to a scalar field, reveals a rich phase space of such solutions, characterized by their orbital frequency and amplitude. These results, pertinent to developments in 2022, establish a direct link between driven quantum field theories and complex dynamical gravitational phenomena, offering a controlled theoretical laboratory for studying energy transfer and stability in strongly coupled systems.
