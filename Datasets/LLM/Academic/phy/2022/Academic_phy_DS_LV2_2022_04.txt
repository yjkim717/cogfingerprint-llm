In recent years, the Swampland program has provided a powerful framework for discerning effective field theories consistently coupled to quantum gravity from those relegated to the "swampland." Concurrently, precision cosmological observations continue to constrain the nature of dark energy, often modeled as a quintessence field. This confluence of theoretical and observational frontiers reveals profound implications. We demonstrate that the refined de Sitter swampland conjectures, which posit a lower bound on the gradient of potentials in scalar field space, are incompatible with a vanishingly small cosmological constant. This tension necessitates the existence of a universal mesoscopic "dark dimension" of size in the micron range. The emergence of this extra dimension is intrinsically linked to the scale of dark energy and the mass of the lightest neutrino. Furthermore, we establish that the Kaluza-Klein modes associated with this dark dimension manifest not as a conventional photon-like tower but as a tower of sterile neutrinos. This identification naturally resolves several phenomenological challenges, including the observed relic neutrino density. Our findings robustly predict specific energy scales: a quantum gravity scale of approximately 10^9â€“10^{10} GeV and a string scale near 10^6 GeV. This framework thus provides a unified explanation for dark energy, the hierarchy of neutrino masses, and the fundamental scales of quantum gravity, offering testable predictions for future experiments.
