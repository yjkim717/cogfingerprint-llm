**Abstract**

Relational quantum mechanics (RQM) has historically grappled with reconciling its emphasis on observer-dependent relationality with the persistent need to ground quantum phenomena in physically accessible information. This paper introduces a novel postulate within RQM designed to mitigate this inherent tension, positing a subtle shift from strictly relational quantum events to those exhibiting a degree of intrinsic, albeit contingent, self-reference.  Specifically, we argue for the emergence of ‘quasi-local’ features within the relational framework, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of quantum state evolution.  This proposition is motivated by ongoing investigations, notably the Frauchiger-Renner experiment, which highlights the challenges of purely relational interpretations regarding measurement outcomes.  The proposed postulate seeks to establish an observer ontology that acknowledges intersubjective agreement while simultaneously resisting a complete reduction of quantum phenomena to observer-dependent relations.  Ultimately, this work contributes to a refined understanding of quantum information and its grounding within a physically plausible framework, moving beyond purely relational descriptions in 2022.
