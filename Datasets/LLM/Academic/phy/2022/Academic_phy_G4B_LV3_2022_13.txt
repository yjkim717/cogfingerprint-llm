**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum computing faces fundamental thermodynamic limitations regarding scalability. This work examines the conflict between established third law of thermodynamics principles and the practical realities of qubit initialization. Specifically, the introduction of a finite effective temperature during initialization processes introduces a deviation from the unattainability principle, directly impacting the achievable fidelity of quantum operations.  We argue that this ‘nernst unattainability’ – the constraint on reaching absolute zero in practical quantum systems – presents a critical bottleneck for maintaining robust quantum coherence.  Furthermore, we explore the implications for qubit initialization fidelity, highlighting the necessity of stringent constraints to mitigate thermal noise.  Considering the rise of quantum computing architectures, addressing this thermodynamic challenge is paramount to realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation and necessitates innovative strategies within qubit control and error correction protocols.
