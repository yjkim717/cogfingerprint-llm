**Abstract**

This research investigates a novel approach to black hole dynamics predicated on the concept of antipodal quantum state equivalence. Utilizing the Penrose diagram framework, we hypothesize that quantum states localized within region II – a temporally displaced counterpart of region I – exhibit precise quantum cloning properties. Specifically, we propose that these states are exact replicas of their counterparts in region I, offering a simplified model for describing black hole evolution beyond standard event horizon formalism.  The implications of this 'antipodal identification' extend to potentially unifying disparate black hole geometries.  Furthermore, this framework leverages the principle of unitarity, suggesting a conserved quantum information structure throughout the black hole spacetime.  Preliminary simulations, conducted in 2022, indicate this model could provide a valuable tool for exploring information paradox resolutions and generalized black hole singularity structures, warranting further investigation.
