**Abstract**

Recent developments within the Swampland program, coupled with cosmological observations concerning dark energy, motivate a novel theoretical framework exploring connections between quantum gravity constraints, neutrino physics, and electroweak vacuum stability. This work proposes the existence of a dynamically generated, mesoscopic extra dimension, intrinsically linked to the emergence of a tower of sterile neutrinos. We demonstrate that the mass spectrum of these sterile neutrinos, and consequently, the observed neutrino mass scales, are intricately tied to the ultraviolet completion of the Higgs mechanism and the robustness of the Standard Model vacuum. This scenario offers a potential resolution to the hierarchy problem while simultaneously providing a phenomenological explanation for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe, suggesting a unified picture wherein quantum gravity, neutrino physics, and dark energy are interconnected facets of a single underlying theory.
