In this 2022 investigation, we establish exact analytical expressions for time-independent multi-point correlation functions in extremal supersymmetric black hole configurations within four-dimensional supergravity. By exploiting the enhanced symmetry constraints of supersymmetry, we demonstrate how the supergraviton mode governs these correlators, yielding closed-form solutions that remain protected against quantum corrections. Our results reveal a fundamental dichotomy: while non-supersymmetric extremal black holes exhibit universal thermal fluctuations and characteristic time-dependent decay in their correlation spectra, the supersymmetric counterparts maintain static, quantization-consistent profiles. This work provides the first complete bulk theory description connecting microscopic black hole states to macroscopic observables, offering a rigorous framework for testing holographic duality beyond the semi-classical regime. The findings suggest supersymmetry imposes stringent constraints on information retention in black hole evaporation scenarios.
