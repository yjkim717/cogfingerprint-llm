**Abstract**

This paper proposes a formal extension to the framework of Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) by introducing a postulate on the physical encoding of information. While RQM posits that quantum states are relative to observers, the mechanism for achieving intersubjective agreement about quantum events across different observers remains a foundational challenge. We postulate that any information an observer possesses about a quantum system must be physically instantiated within that observer's physical record, such as a measurement device or memory. This requirement for a tangible information-theoretic residue ensures that different observers can, in principle, access and compare records of a past quantum interaction, thereby grounding intersubjective agreement in a shared physical reality. This refinement addresses a key conceptual gap in RQM, bridging its relational ontology with the objective, stable facts of experience. It strengthens the interpretation's internal consistency and provides a clearer ontological basis for information as a physical commodity in quantum theory, with implications for quantum information science and the quantum-to-classical transition.
