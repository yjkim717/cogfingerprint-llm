Title: Topological Thermodynamic Defects in Black Hole Solutions: A Universal Characterization

Abstract:
In this study, we investigate black hole solutions as thermodynamic defects in the thermodynamic parameter space, revealing a profound connection between gravitational and thermodynamic properties. By introducing a topological framework, we demonstrate that diverse black hole systems can be universally characterized by a winding number, a topological invariant that classifies the thermodynamic defects. This topological number provides a novel perspective on the thermodynamic behavior of black holes, enabling a unified understanding of various black hole solutions. Our findings suggest that the topological properties of black hole thermodynamics are robust against different gravitational theories, hinting at a deeper structure underlying the interplay between gravity and thermodynamics. The implications of this work may extend to the realm of quantum gravity, where a deeper understanding of black hole thermodynamics is crucial.
