**Abstract**

This work explores the behavior of correlation functions within the context of extremal supersymmetric black holes, employing techniques applicable to strongly coupled systems. Utilizing a supergravity framework, we derive analytical expressions for these correlation functions, revealing a remarkable duality. In supersymmetric configurations, the correlation functions exhibit time-independent constant values parameterized by bulk theory quantities. Conversely, we demonstrate a universal, albeit distinct, temporal dependence arising in non-supersymmetric scenarios. These findings offer insights into the interplay between supersymmetry, strong coupling, and the dynamics of spacetime, potentially impacting our understanding of holographic duality and black hole thermodynamics.
