**Abstract**

The unitarity of superstring scattering amplitudes, while established indirectly via worldsheet methods, demands a more direct demonstration in the physical spacetime. This work provides a novel, first-principles proof of unitarity for tree-level amplitudes in Type II superstring theories compactified to dimensions D < 10. We derive explicit contour integral representations for the associated partial wave coefficients, which are shown to be meromorphic functions with poles corresponding exclusively to physical string states. By deforming the integration contours and applying the calculus of residues, we rigorously demonstrate that these coefficients satisfy the positivity constraints mandated by the optical theorem in the physical region. This contour-based methodology circumvents the need for indirect arguments, offering a powerful and geometrically transparent framework for analyzing the unitarity of string theories in diverse spacetime dimensions and elucidating the interplay between worldsheet conformal symmetry and spacetime quantum mechanics.
