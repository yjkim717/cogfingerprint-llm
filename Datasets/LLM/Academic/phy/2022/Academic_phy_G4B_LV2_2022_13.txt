**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum computing faces significant thermodynamic limitations hindering its widespread scalability. This work investigates the implications of incorporating a non-zero effective temperature during qubit initialization – a prevalent practice in current quantum hardware – on the overall fidelity and operational stability of quantum processors. Utilizing principles derived from the third law of thermodynamics, we demonstrate that even minute temperature variations introduce stringent fidelity constraints during the crucial initial state preparation. Specifically, we argue that maintaining a near-zero effective temperature, traditionally considered an ideal, is often practically unattainable and introduces a trade-off between initialization speed and long-term coherence.  Our analysis reveals a direct correlation between initialization temperature and resultant qubit fidelity, necessitating the development of robust error mitigation strategies.  This research highlights the urgent need to reconcile established thermodynamic understanding with quantum computing architectures, offering a foundational perspective for optimizing quantum processor design and operational protocols in 2022 and beyond.
