Title: Topological Characterization of Black Hole Solutions as Thermodynamic Defects in the Parameter Space

Abstract:
In the context of quantum gravity, we investigate the topological properties of black hole solutions as thermodynamic defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. By introducing a universal topological invariant, namely the winding number, we categorize black hole solutions based on their thermodynamic stability. Our analysis reveals that the winding number is directly related to the thermodynamic properties of black hole solutions, providing a novel classification scheme. Specifically, we demonstrate that stable black hole solutions correspond to defects with a winding number of +1, while unstable solutions are associated with defects having a winding number of -1. This topological characterization offers a new perspective on the thermodynamic behavior of black hole solutions, shedding light on the intricate relationship between gravity, thermodynamics, and topology in 2022.
