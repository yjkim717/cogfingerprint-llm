**Abstract**

The apparent tension between unitary quantum evolution and the information-destroying properties of black holes, as epitomized by the information paradox, remains a central problem in theoretical physics. This work proposes a novel resolution by postulating the existence of long-lived quantum clones within the black hole interior, localized in the vicinity of the inner horizon. We construct a modified Penrose diagram incorporating non-perturbative quantum gravitational effects that permit the coherent existence of such clones without violating the no-cloning theorem, as they reside in causally disconnected spacetime regions. The model demonstrates that information encoded in the initial collapsing matter is not lost but is instead bifurcated: one copy propagates outward via Hawking radiation, while its clone remains sequestered. Crucially, we show that the Shapiro time delay experienced by the clone, amplified by the extreme curvature, ensures its causal separation from the exterior until the black hole's late-stage evolution. This mechanism provides a robust, unitary description of black hole evaporation, reconciling the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy with the principles of quantum mechanics.
