Title: Reassessing Cepheid Distance Calibrations with Gaia EDR3: Implications for Cosmological Measurements

Abstract:
The Cepheid period-luminosity relation remains a cornerstone for measuring extragalactic distances. Recent Gaia EDR3 parallax measurements have enabled refined calibrations of Cepheid luminosities in the Magellanic Clouds. However, our analysis reveals significant discrepancies between Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and existing Cepheid distance scales, resulting in a systematic error floor of ~3%. We investigate the impact of metallicity on Cepheid period-luminosity relations and find that the effect is non-negligible, particularly for metal-poor Cepheids. By re-calibrating the Cepheid distance ladder using Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, we derive revised distance moduli for the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Our results have important implications for cosmological measurements relying on Cepheid distances, highlighting the need for continued refinement of the Cepheid distance scale to achieve percent-level accuracy in Hubble constant determinations. This study underscores the importance of precise parallax measurements in resolving the Cepheid distance calibration crisis.
