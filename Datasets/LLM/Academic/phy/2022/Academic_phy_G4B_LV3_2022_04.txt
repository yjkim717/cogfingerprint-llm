**Abstract**

Recent developments within the Swampland program, coupled with increasingly precise neutrino oscillation data, necessitate a reassessment of fundamental spacetime geometry. This work proposes a model incorporating a small, discrete ‘dark dimension’ – a mesoscopic extradimension populated by massless fermions – to account for observed neutrino mass hierarchies. Specifically, the presence of this dimension predicts neutrino mass scales consistent with current experimental constraints, deviating modestly from the standard three-generation model.  Furthermore, the stabilization of the Higgs boson’s VEV is intricately linked to the energy density of this dark dimension, suggesting a Planck-scale energy associated with its existence.  This framework also offers a potential explanation for the GZK (Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin) attenuation limit, implying interactions mediated by the dark dimension’s fermions.  Further investigation utilizing sterile neutrino searches and precision cosmology is warranted to validate these intriguing theoretical connections.
