**Abstract**

The origin of neutrino masses remains a significant open question in particle physics, motivating exploration of extensions to the Standard Model (SM). This work investigates a novel framework for neutrino mass generation leveraging generalized global symmetries in conjunction with gauged non-Abelian horizontal symmetries. We propose a mechanism wherein these symmetries, acting on lepton flavor space, induce a hierarchical structure in the neutrino mass matrix. A key prediction of this model is the existence of lepton family Z' bosons, arising from the breaking of the horizontal symmetry group. These Z' bosons, possessing distinct couplings to charged leptons, offer a potentially observable signature at future collider experiments. Furthermore, the imposed symmetry structure naturally accounts for observed lepton flavor differences, providing a compelling avenue to connect theoretical frameworks with experimental data. We discuss the model's implications for neutrino mixing parameters and explore the phenomenological constraints imposed by current experimental limits, highlighting the prospects for experimental verification within the ongoing and planned high-energy physics programs.
