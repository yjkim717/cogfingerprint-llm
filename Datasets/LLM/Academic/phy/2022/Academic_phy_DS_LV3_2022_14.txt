In this 2022 study, we establish a topological framework for black hole thermodynamics by characterizing gravitational solutions as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. Through computation of winding numbers derived from the generalized off-shell free energy, we demonstrate these topological invariants serve as robust indicators of thermodynamic stability and phase structure. Our analysis reveals a universal topological classification scheme that partitions black hole systems into three distinct classes based on their defect configurations, independent of specific gravitational models. This classification provides new insights into the microscopic origins of black hole entropy and phase transitions, while offering a novel topological perspective on quantum gravitational effects. The methodology bridges thermodynamic behavior with topological invariants, suggesting fundamental constraints on possible quantum gravity formulations through topological conservation laws.
