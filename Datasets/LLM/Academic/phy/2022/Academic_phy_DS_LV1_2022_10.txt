**Abstract**

The dynamic behavior of water and its constituent ions at electrified interfaces remains a central challenge in physical chemistry and electrochemistry, with profound implications for energy storage, electrocatalysis, and biological charge transfer. While bulk pH is a well-defined thermodynamic property, its conceptualization breaks down at the nanoscale, where the discrete nature of ions and the unique hydrogen-bonding network of water dominate. This study employs a multi-scale computational framework to quantitatively characterize the spatiotemporal fluctuations of hydronium (H₃O⁺) and hydroxide (OH⁻) ion concentrations within confined aqueous environments proximal to a model electrode surface. We integrate atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, utilizing the polarizable ReaxFF force field to accurately capture bond breaking/formation and the Grotthuss proton-hopping mechanism, with a mesoscopic stochastic model. The MD component reveals the heterogeneous structure of the electrode-electrolyte interface, identifying regions of enhanced ion density and disrupted water connectivity that serve as hotspots for anomalous proton transport. These atomistic insights parameterize a stochastic simulation that tracks the probabilistic migration and recombination of ions, moving beyond mean-field approximations. Our results demonstrate that local pH values are not static but exhibit significant, transient deviations from the bulk average, with fluctuations exceeding 2 pH units on nanosecond timescales and over nanometer-length scales. We correlate the magnitude and lifetime of these fluctuations with specific interfacial water structures and applied electrode potential. This work establishes that the nanoscale electrochemical environment is intrinsically non-equilibrium, a finding that necessitates a revision of continuum models and provides a new mechanistic lens for interpreting interfacial reaction kinetics, such as hydrogen evolution and oxygen reduction, which are highly sensitive to local proton activity.
