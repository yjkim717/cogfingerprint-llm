Title: Convergent Signatures of the Swampland and Observational Cosmology: Unveiling the Dark Dimension and its Phenomenological Implications

Abstract:
Recent advancements in the Swampland program, coupled with observational data, converge to predict the existence of a singular extra dimension, henceforth referred to as the Dark Dimension, accompanied by a light tower of states. This synergy between theoretical constraints and empirical evidence illuminates the intricate structure of quantum gravity. Notably, the presence of sterile neutrinos and a dynamically determined Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev) emerge as critical phenomenological signatures. Our analysis demonstrates that the Dark Dimension scenario is not only consistent with, but also provides a cohesive framework for understanding, the observed neutrino masses and the electroweak scale. Furthermore, we elucidate the implications of this paradigm for our understanding of the quantum gravity landscape, highlighting the potential for novel observational probes and theoretical insights in the near future.
