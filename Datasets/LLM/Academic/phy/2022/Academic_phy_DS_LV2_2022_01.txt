This paper addresses the long-standing unitarity paradox in black hole evaporation by proposing a novel mechanism involving quantum cloning in causally disconnected spacetime regions. We demonstrate that the apparent violation of unitarity during black hole formation and evaporation can be resolved through the existence of quantum clones within the black hole interior. Using Penrose diagram analysis, we show how these clones preserve quantum information while remaining causally separated from external observers. Our framework establishes that the complete quantum state evolution remains unitary when accounting for both external Hawking radiation and internal cloned states. The model provides a self-consistent description of information preservation without requiring modifications to semiclassical gravity or introducing firewalls, thereby offering a resolution to the black hole information paradox within conventional quantum field theory and general relativity.
