**Abstract**

A persistent challenge within relational quantum mechanics (RQM) concerns the ontological status of information and its relationship to physicality. While RQM elegantly sidesteps the measurement problem by positing that quantum states are defined relationally between observers, this framework struggles to account for the robust and reproducible nature of experimental results â€“ namely, the intersubjective agreement we observe. This paper proposes a novel postulate designed to address this tension, specifically ensuring observer accessibility to information encoded within physical variables. This postulate asserts that if a physical variable is deemed relevant within a relational context, its corresponding information must be, in principle, accessible to any observer within that context, regardless of their specific relational history. We argue that this accessibility criterion provides a foundation for a more coherent RQM ontology, mitigating concerns regarding the purely subjective nature of quantum states and providing a mechanism for the emergence of shared reality. This work contributes to ongoing discussions about the informational underpinnings of quantum phenomena and offers a pathway toward reconciling RQM with established empirical findings.
