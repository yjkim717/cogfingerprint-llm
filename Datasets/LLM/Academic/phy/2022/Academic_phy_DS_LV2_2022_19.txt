We report the experimental demonstration of spatially entangled photon pair generation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from ultrathin lithium niobate metasurfaces. The subwavelength, resonant meta-atoms are engineered to achieve efficient nonlinear frequency conversion within a film thickness significantly below conventional bulk or waveguide nonlinear crystals. Through careful optimization of the meta-atom geometry for quasi-phase-matching and local field enhancement, we observe a 450-fold enhancement in the SPDC generation rate compared to unpatterned lithium niobate films of equivalent thickness. The quantum nature of the emitted photon pairs is confirmed by measuring a violation of Bell's inequality, thereby verifying the presence of spatial entanglement. This work establishes dielectric metasurfaces as a compact and efficient platform for integrated quantum photonics, opening avenues for on-chip entanglement generation for applications in quantum information processing and imaging.
