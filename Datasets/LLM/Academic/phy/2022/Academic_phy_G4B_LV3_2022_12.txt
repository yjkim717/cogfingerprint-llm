**Abstract**

Understanding the intricate mechanisms governing visual transduction in rhodopsin remains a central challenge in biophysics. This study employs quantum-classical molecular simulations to investigate the role of excited-state splitting in determining quantum efficiency. Our simulations, incorporating detailed protein electrostatics, demonstrate that the degeneracy inherent within the rhodopsin chromophore’s excited states is dynamically modulated by electrostatic interactions within the protein environment.  Specifically, we observed a pronounced influence of these protein forces on the population distribution across the excited states.  These findings suggest a potential evolutionary constraint: enhanced sensitivity, achieved through maximized excited-state splitting, may be coupled with an increased susceptibility to thermal noise.  The results provide a novel mechanistic framework for interpreting observed variations in rhodopsin quantum efficiency across species and environments, and highlight the crucial interplay between protein structure and photochemical processes in biological systems.
