**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in photonics have increasingly explored the potential of metasurfaces for manipulating light and enabling novel quantum optical phenomena. This study reports on the successful generation of spatially entangled photon pairs via a lithium niobate-integrated metasurface, utilizing spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).  The fabricated metasurface, engineered to optimize phase matching within the lithium niobate crystal, exhibited a notable increase in the photon pair generation rate compared to conventional SPDC geometries.  Specifically, we observed a significant enhancement in the production of multimode entangled photon pairs, a critical requirement for advanced quantum information processing.  These results demonstrate a pathway towards compact and highly efficient sources of entangled photons, facilitated by the integration of tailored metamaterials.  Further investigation into the control and manipulation of these entangled states promises to accelerate the development of miniaturized quantum devices for applications ranging from secure communication to fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.
