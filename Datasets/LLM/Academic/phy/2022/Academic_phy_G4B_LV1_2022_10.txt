**Abstract**

The durability of carbon dioxide conversion devices is intrinsically linked to the electrochemical stability of the operating fluid, often aqueous electrolytes. This research presents a novel computational approach to investigate the pH dynamics within confined aqueous microenvironments, specifically focusing on small, simulated ‘water pools’ at the nanoscale. Utilizing stochastic simulations driven by a modified Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) framework, we modeled the coupled phenomena of pH variation and CO2 diffusion within these systems.  Crucially, the simulations incorporated a novel parameter, designated ‘qm/md’ – representing a ratio of quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics forces – to account for subtle, yet potentially significant, electronic interactions impacting proton transport. 

Preliminary results demonstrate a marked sensitivity of pH to both spatial confinement and the 'qm/md' parameter, revealing non-linear trends in proton distribution.  Furthermore, the simulations predict localized pH gradients arising from diffusion, potentially influencing the rate of corrosion and degradation pathways within a CO2 conversion device.  These findings suggest that controlling the local microenvironment, particularly pH, is a critical design consideration.  Future work will explore the influence of varying ionic strength and temperature on these simulated water pools, alongside validation against established electrochemical models.  This approach offers a scalable methodology for predicting device longevity and optimizing material selection.
