**Abstract**

Recent advances in applying topological methods to black hole thermodynamics have revealed that black holes can be characterized as topological thermodynamic defects within their parameter space. This work formalizes this perspective by constructing a generalized off-shell free energy landscape for a broad class of black hole solutions. By identifying critical points as topological defects, we compute their associated winding numbers, which serve as a universal topological invariant. Our analysis demonstrates that these winding numbers provide a robust, system-independent classification of thermodynamic stability: a positive winding number consistently indicates thermodynamic stability, while a negative value signifies instability. This topological classification successfully unifies the stability behavior of diverse black hole systems—including Reissner-Nordström and Kerr-Newman families—under a single framework, offering a powerful new tool for probing phase structure and potential transitions in quantum gravity.
