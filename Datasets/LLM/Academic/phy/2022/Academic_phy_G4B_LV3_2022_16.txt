**Abstract**

This work investigates the extended BMS(4) group, incorporating logarithmic supertranslations to refine our understanding of asymptotic symmetries in relativistic spacetime.  We demonstrate that this modification results in an abelian subalgebra exhibiting a central extension, effectively decoupling pure supertranslations from the core Poincaré algebra.  This decoupling is crucial for formulating a manifestly supertranslation-free definition of angular momentum, a longstanding challenge in supersymmetric theories.  The inclusion of logarithmic supertranslations allows for a more precise treatment of conserved quantities and their associated symmetries, particularly relevant in contexts involving black hole physics and cosmology.  Our analysis highlights the importance of these subtle algebraic extensions in maintaining a consistent and physically meaningful description of spacetime symmetries.  Further investigation into the implications of this formalism for gauge theories and quantum field theory is warranted, promising new insights into the structure of quantum gravity and the nature of fundamental forces.
