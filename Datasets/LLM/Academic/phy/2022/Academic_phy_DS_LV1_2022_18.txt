**Abstract**

We present a metasurface-based Fourier synthesis technique for the deterministic generation of structured space-time wave packets with arbitrary spatiotemporal profiles. Conventional pulse shaping methods primarily manipulate the temporal or spatial degrees of freedom independently, limiting control over the light-matter interaction in four dimensions. Our approach leverages a single dielectric metasurface to perform a joint spatiotemporal Fourier transform, enabling direct modulation of an ultrafast optical pulse's spectral field in both \( k \)-space and frequency domain simultaneously. This allows for the precise imprinting of complex, user-defined phase and amplitude masks, facilitating the creation of non-diffracting, self-accelerating, and abruptly autofocusing pulse geometries. Experimental validation confirms the generation of these tailored waveforms with femtosecond durations. This platform provides a compact and versatile solution for advanced applications in ultrafast microscopy, nonlinear frequency conversion, and particle manipulation, where exquisite spatiotemporal control is paramount.
