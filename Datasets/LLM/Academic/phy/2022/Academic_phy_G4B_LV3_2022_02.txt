**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in string theory amplitude calculations necessitate rigorous unitarity verification, particularly within the context of superstring theories. This work, building upon the framework established by Arkani-Hamed (2022), presents a novel formulation of partial wave coefficients governing string amplitudes.  Specifically, the derived expression facilitates a direct, analytical proof of unitarity constraints for superstring theories in spacetime dimensions limited to D ≤ 6.  Crucially, this approach extends beyond traditional perturbative methods, offering a pathway to assess unitarity in regimes previously inaccessible. Furthermore, the methodology illuminates large mass asymptotic behavior, providing valuable constraints on theoretical models and offering potential avenues for exploring the landscape of superstring solutions.  The technique leverages contour integral methods, contributing to a more robust understanding of string theory’s fundamental principles.
