**Abstract**

The asymptotic symmetry algebra of asymptotically flat spacetimes in four dimensions, historically described by the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS(4)) group, has long presented a fundamental challenge: the entanglement of pure supertranslations with the Lorentz subgroup obscures a universally accepted, invariant definition of angular momentum. This work demonstrates that a consistent enlargement of the BMS(4) group to include logarithmic supertranslations provides the necessary structural framework to resolve this long-standing issue. By incorporating these additional generators, we construct a novel basis for the asymptotic symmetry algebra wherein the pure supertranslation degrees of freedom are explicitly decoupled from the Poincar√© subalgebra. This decoupling is not merely a mathematical refinement; it yields an immediate and profound physical consequence. We derive a new, rigorously defined angular momentum charge that remains invariant under the action of arbitrary supertranslations. This supertranslation-invariant definition of angular momentum successfully addresses the ambiguities that have plagued previous formulations, particularly in the context of gravitational wave physics and the analysis of spacetimes with non-trivial radiative features. Our results, established within the framework of 2022, thus provide a definitive solution to the problem of angular momentum in general relativity, solidifying the foundational role of the extended BMS algebra in the modern understanding of gravitational asymptotic symmetries and their associated conserved quantities.
