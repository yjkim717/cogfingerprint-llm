The burgeoning demand for high-performance energy storage systems necessitates the development of electrode materials that reconcile high-rate capability with long-term cycling stability. This study investigates the exceptional electrochemical properties of the cation-deficient perovskite CeNb₃O₉ as an advanced anode for fast-charging lithium-ion batteries. Through a combination of synchrotron X-ray pair distribution function analysis and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, we elucidate that the material's remarkable performance originates from its unique atomic short-range order. This structural characteristic, which persists beyond the average crystallographic structure, facilitates the formation of percolating conduction pathways for both electrons and lithium ions. The inherent cation deficiency within the perovskite framework further enhances lithium-ion diffusion kinetics by providing a high concentration of vacant sites, effectively reducing diffusion energy barriers. Consequently, CeNb₃O₉ anodes demonstrate a specific capacity of 210 mAh g⁻¹ at an ultrahigh current density of 5 A g⁻¹ and retain 95% of their initial capacity after 1000 cycles. These findings, reported in 2022, establish a novel paradigm for designing next-generation battery materials, where engineering atomic-scale disorder and non-stoichiometry in perovskite oxides is a pivotal strategy for achieving superior fast-charging and long-life energy storage.
