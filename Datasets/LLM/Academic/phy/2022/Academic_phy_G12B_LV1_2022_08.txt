Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal academic style suitable for a physics publication, and reflecting a 2022 context. I've aimed for precision and structured reasoning.  Following the abstract, Iâ€™ll include some notes on the choices made in crafting it.

**Abstract: Physical Information Storage and Intersubjective Validation in Relational Quantum Mechanics**

The persistent challenge of reconciling quantum mechanics with classical reality, particularly concerning the role of observation and the nature of quantum state reduction, motivates ongoing refinements of relational quantum mechanics (RQM). While RQM elegantly avoids the pitfalls of absolute state assignments by positing that states are relative to observers, it has faced criticism regarding the physical instantiation of information and the potential for observer-dependent inconsistencies. This work proposes a novel postulate, the "Information Anchorage Principle" (IAP), which asserts that any intersubjectively agreed-upon quantum state must correspond to a physically realizable, albeit potentially distributed, information storage system within the observed system.  The IAP dictates that the correlation structure defining a relational quantum state necessitates a corresponding physical substrate capable of encoding and preserving this information, thereby grounding the state in physical reality.  We demonstrate that the IAP resolves key objections to RQM, notably addressing the concerns raised by the Frauchiger-Renner thought experiment regarding the possibility of contradictory state assignments across multiple observers.  Furthermore, we explore the implications of the IAP for understanding quantum measurement and its connection to fundamental limits on information processing, suggesting a potential pathway toward a more complete and physically robust formulation of RQM, consistent with observed experimental data.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Tone & Terminology:** I used phrases like "persistent challenge," "elegantly avoids," "physical instantiation," "intersubjectively agreed-upon," "physical substrate," and "implications" to establish a formal academic tone. Keywords are incorporated naturally.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: 1) Problem/Motivation, 2) Proposed Solution (IAP), 3) Mechanism/How it works, 4) Resolution of existing concerns (Frauchiger-Renner), 5) Broader Implications.
*   **"Information Anchorage Principle" (IAP):** This is a fabricated name to give the postulate a concrete identity, as the original summary only mentioned a new postulate. It implies that the information is "anchored" to a physical reality.
*   **Frauchiger-Renner Reference:** This is crucial given the summary, and I explicitly state that the IAP addresses the concerns raised by it.
*   **2022 Context:** The phrasing avoids referencing specific, very recent (post-2022) developments, keeping it generally relevant within the ongoing discourse of RQM. The focus is on foundational questions that are enduring.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for the ~202 word target.
*   **Emphasis on Physicality:** The core of the abstract stresses the *physical* aspects of information storage, aligning with the summary's emphasis on addressing objections related to information.
