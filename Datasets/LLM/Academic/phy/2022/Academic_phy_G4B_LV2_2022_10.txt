**Abstract: Stochastic Modeling of pH Dynamics at Electrode-Electrolyte Interfaces for Enhanced Device Durability**

The longevity and reliability of electrochemical devices, particularly those employing aqueous electrolytes, are critically dependent on the stability of the electrode-electrolyte interface. This research leverages a combination of theoretical calculations and stochastic simulations to elucidate the complex pH dynamics occurring within small water pools situated at such interfaces. Focusing on the subtle yet significant influence of localized pH fluctuations, we employed the Rexpon force field to accurately model ion-specific interactions and subsequently generated a stochastic simulation framework. 

Our methodology addresses the inherent challenges of capturing pH variability in confined aqueous systems, utilizing a Monte Carlo approach to represent the stochastic generation and diffusion of ions. The simulations, parameterized with relevant electrochemical data, were designed to assess the impact of localized pH shifts on the overall ph dynamics. Preliminary results indicate a strong correlation between localized pH depressions and accelerated corrosion rates, specifically via enhanced anodic dissolution of the electrode material. 

Furthermore, the study highlights the crucial role of ion pair generation in mediating these pH changes, demonstrating that even minor deviations from equilibrium can propagate and amplify within the confined volume.  Understanding these mechanisms is paramount for developing strategies to mitigate detrimental effects, potentially through the incorporation of buffering agents or the implementation of surface modification techniques. The findings presented herein contribute to a fundamental understanding of interfacial stability and offer a robust theoretical basis for improving the durability of electrochemical devices operating in aqueous environments.
