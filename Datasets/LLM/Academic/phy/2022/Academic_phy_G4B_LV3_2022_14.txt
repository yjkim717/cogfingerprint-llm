**Abstract**

Recent theoretical investigations have proposed a novel framework for understanding black hole solutions, framing them not merely as gravitational singularities, but as emergent topological thermodynamic defects. This research, building upon the concept of generalized off-shell free energy, demonstrates a strong correlation between black hole structure and associated topological numbers. Specifically, we identify a universal winding number, intrinsically linked to the asymptotic thermodynamic behavior of the black hole system – namely, its entropy and temperature – providing a robust classification mechanism.  The significance of this approach lies in its potential to bridge the gap between classical general relativity and quantum gravity.  Analyzing these defects allows for a deeper exploration of thermodynamic defects and their role in spacetime geometry.  Further, this topological characterization offers a promising avenue for investigating the holographic principle and potentially resolving singularities within black hole horizons.  Our findings, presented in 2022, suggest a fundamental connection between topology, thermodynamics, and the quantum nature of gravity.
