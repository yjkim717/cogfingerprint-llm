This abstract reviews the fundamental principles and recent advancements in geometric phase manipulation through metasurface platforms, with particular focus on Pancharatnam-Berry phase implementations in optical systems. We systematically analyze how subwavelength-structured metasurfaces enable precise phase modulation by controlling the geometric phase acquired by circularly polarized light during polarization state transformations. The discussion encompasses both theoretical frameworks and experimental demonstrations of geometric phase metasurfaces, highlighting their advantages in achieving broadband performance and polarization-dependent wavefront shaping. Recent developments in dielectric metasurfaces are emphasized, showcasing enhanced efficiency and multifunctional capabilities compared to plasmonic counterparts. The analysis concludes by identifying emerging applications in compact optical devices and outlining persistent challenges in large-scale fabrication and dynamic reconfigurability that represent critical frontiers for future research in nanophotonics and metamaterial engineering.
