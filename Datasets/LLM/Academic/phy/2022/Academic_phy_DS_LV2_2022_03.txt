This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of time-independent correlation functions in extremal supersymmetric black hole configurations within four-dimensional N=2 supergravity. Utilizing exact supergravity solutions, we establish a rigorous framework for computing n-point correlation functions through the holographic mapping to boundary conformal field theory. Our investigation reveals that the supergraviton mode governs the dominant contributions to these correlators in the extremal limit, where the near-horizon geometry exhibits an enhanced symmetry structure. The methodology developed herein enables explicit computation of correlation functions without temporal dependence, providing new insights into the microscopic description of extremal black holes. These results substantiate the correspondence between gravitational observables in the bulk and conformal data at the boundary, advancing our understanding of quantum gravity in supersymmetric settings.
