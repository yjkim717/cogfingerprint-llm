"In the realm of quantum computing, the third law of thermodynamics imposes a fundamental constraint on qubit initialization, governed by the Nernst unattainability principle. As quantum circuits scale, maintaining fidelity becomes increasingly challenging due to the thermodynamic limits on qubit reset. This study examines the interplay between thermodynamic constraints and quantum computing scalability. We analyze the impact of the third law on qubit initialization and propose novel strategies to mitigate its effects, thereby enhancing quantum circuit fidelity. Our findings provide insight into the thermodynamic underpinnings of quantum computing, informing the development of more robust quantum architectures in 2022."
