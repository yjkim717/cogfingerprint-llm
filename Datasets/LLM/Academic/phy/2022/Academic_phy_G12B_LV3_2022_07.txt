**Abstract:** Recent advances in numerical relativity (NR) have yielded high-precision simulations of binary black hole scattering events. However, discrepancies persist between NR results and analytical predictions from post-Minkowskian (PM) gravity. This work addresses this challenge by employing an effective-one-body (EOB) formalism to recast PM waveforms, facilitating a more direct comparison with NR data. We present a novel method for extracting a radiation-reaction gravitational potential from NR simulations and demonstrate substantial improvements in the agreement between NR and PM predictions, furthering our understanding of strong-field gravity and gravitational wave physics.
