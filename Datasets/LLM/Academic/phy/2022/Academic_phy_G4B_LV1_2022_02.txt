**Abstract**

Recent advancements in string theory have increasingly focused on rigorously establishing unitarity within compactified models. This work introduces a novel formulation of string amplitudes, predicated on a re-evaluation of tree-level contributions and their subsequent integration with partial wave analysis. Specifically, we derive an expression for these amplitudes that, within the constraints of superstring theories limited to D â‰¤ 6 dimensions, exhibits demonstrable unitarity.  Crucially, the derivation leverages a refined treatment of massive poles, accounting for their impact on scattering processes and preserving the fundamental requirement of probability conservation.  The presented formalism offers a pathway to more precise calculations of scattering cross-sections and provides a benchmark for testing the consistency of higher-dimensional string compactifications.  Further investigation is warranted to explore the implications of this amplitude expression for phenomenological predictions and the underlying landscape of string theory solutions.
