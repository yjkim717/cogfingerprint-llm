**Investigating Stellar Dynamics in Asymptotically Anti-de Sitter Spacetime via AdS/CFT Correspondence**

We present a novel approach to simulating stellar motion within asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, leveraging the theoretical framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Utilizing a carefully calibrated, spatially localized source term within the conformal field theory (CFT) dual, we demonstrate the generation of dynamically evolving, orbiting stellar configurations within the AdS bulk.  This method bypasses traditional numerical relativity techniques by directly manipulating the CFT sector, offering a potentially efficient route to explore gravitational phenomena in strongly curved backgrounds. Specifically, we detail the construction of the source operator and its impact on the emergent spacetime geometry. Preliminary results indicate a direct correlation between the source’s properties and the resulting stellar trajectories –  observing stable, Newtonian-like orbits. Further investigation will focus on quantifying the correspondence between CFT parameters and gravitational observables, potentially providing insights into the holographic nature of gravity and the dynamics of black hole formation within this context.
