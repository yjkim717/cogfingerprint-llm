"In this study, we present a comparative analysis of numerical relativity simulations and post-Minkowskian (PM) predictions for binary black hole scattering. By leveraging the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism, we investigate the scattering dynamics of binary black holes in the strong-field regime. Our results demonstrate excellent agreement between numerical relativity data and PM predictions up to 3PM order, validating the accuracy of the EOB approach. The findings of this work have significant implications for the development of waveform models and the interpretation of gravitational wave observations, particularly in the context of future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA science runs (2022-2025)."
