**Abstract**

Precise distance measurements are fundamental to understanding the scale and structure of the Milky Way and its satellite galaxies. This work examines the impact of Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) parallax uncertainties on Cepheid distance calibrations, specifically focusing on the implications for the Magellanic Clouds. Utilizing the established period-luminosity relation for Cepheid variables, we assessed the consistency of distances derived from EDR3 with previously established calibrations. Results indicate a systematic offset of approximately 3% within the EDR3 data, attributable primarily to residual parallax errors and the influence of metallicity variations across Cepheid populations. These findings highlight the critical need for refined parallax solutions and improved metallicity estimates to bolster the accuracy of extragalactic distance measurements. Further investigation is warranted to quantify the full extent of these systematic uncertainties and their potential impact on cosmological distance ladders and the precise determination of distances to nearby stellar systems, particularly within the Local Group.
