**Inferring Effective Dimensionality and Information Bottlenecks in High-Dimensional Data via Gaussian Mixture Mutual Information Estimation**

The burgeoning field of deep learning has yielded remarkable successes in complex data analysis, yet the inherent opacity of these models poses a significant challenge to fundamental understanding. This paper addresses the crucial problem of interpreting latent representations learned by deep neural networks, particularly in scenarios involving high-dimensional input spaces. We introduce a novel computational framework, termed Gaussian Mixture Mutual Information Estimation (GMM-MI), for robustly approximating mutual information between input data and internal network activations. GMM-MI leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to characterize the distribution of latent variables, enabling a computationally efficient and statistically sound estimation of the mutual information metric. Unlike existing approaches, our method exhibits enhanced resilience to non-Gaussianity and multimodality often encountered in deep learning latent spaces. We demonstrate that GMM-MI can effectively delineate information bottlenecks within network architectures, providing insights into feature selection and representational compression. Furthermore, we propose that the estimated mutual information serves as a proxy for effective dimensionality, allowing for a quantitative assessment of the information content retained during the learning process.  Analysis reveals a connection between the mutual information landscape and the emergence of disentangled representations.  This work offers a valuable tool for probing the inner workings of deep learning models and advancing our understanding of information processing in complex systems.
