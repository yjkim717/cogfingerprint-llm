**Abstract**

We present a novel approach to probing the geometric properties of asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes by leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence. Our methodology establishes a framework for generating and analyzing stellar orbits within these backgrounds, achieved through controlled manipulation of source configurations in the dual conformal field theory (CFT). Specifically, we demonstrate how modifications to the CFT source terms can induce observable stellar dynamics in the bulk AdS spacetime, allowing for the extraction of geometric information – such as spacetime curvature and asymptotic behavior – directly from observed stellar trajectories. This technique offers a potentially powerful tool for validating holographic duality predictions and exploring the relationship between quantum field theory and gravitational phenomena. The presented approach holds promise for investigating star formation processes within AdS/CFT contexts, offering a new avenue for connecting theoretical predictions with potentially observable astrophysical analogs.
