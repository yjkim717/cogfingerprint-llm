Title: Revisiting Cepheid Distance Calibrations with Gaia Early Data Release 3: Implications for the Cosmic Distance Ladder

Abstract:
The Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) has provided unprecedented parallax measurements, enabling a recalibration of Cepheid distance scales. However, our analysis reveals significant discrepancies between Cepheid distances derived from EDR3 parallaxes and geometric distances obtained from detached eclipsing binaries. This tension arises from the period-luminosity relations used in Cepheid distance calibrations, which appear to be sensitive to the adopted parallax zero-point. We investigate the astrophysical implications of these discrepancies on the cosmic distance ladder, focusing on the impact on Hubble constant measurements. Our results suggest that the EDR3-based Cepheid distance scale may require further refinement to achieve consistency with other astrophysical measurements. This study highlights the need for continued scrutiny of Cepheid distance calibrations and their role in shaping our understanding of the universe's scale and evolution. (2022)
