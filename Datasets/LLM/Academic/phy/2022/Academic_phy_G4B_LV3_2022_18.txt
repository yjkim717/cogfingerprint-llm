**Abstract**

The precise manipulation of ultrafast optical pulses is paramount to advancements across diverse photonic applications. This study details a groundbreaking approach leveraging engineered metasurfaces to achieve spatiotemporal control over pulse evolution. Utilizing a dynamically tunable metasurface array, we demonstrate the ability to synthesize femtosecond pulses with tailored spectral and temporal profiles in real-time.  Through careful design and experimental validation, we achieve unprecedented control over pulse shaping, enabling the creation of complex waveforms for applications in high-resolution microscopy, where spatiotemporal resolution is critical.  Furthermore, the methodology facilitates coherent control schemes, allowing for the manipulation of nonlinear optical phenomena with enhanced precision.  Our results highlight the potential of metasurfaces as versatile tools for shaping light, representing a significant step toward deterministic photonics and opening new avenues for research in advanced imaging and signal processing techniques.  Future work will explore scaling and integration strategies for broader utility.
