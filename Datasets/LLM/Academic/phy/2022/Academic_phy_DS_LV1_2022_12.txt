**Abstract**

The photoisomerization of rhodopsin, a paradigmatic biological quantum event, exhibits remarkably high quantum efficiency. While the role of the protein environment in guiding this reaction is acknowledged, a precise mechanistic understanding of how electrostatic interactions govern the underlying quantum dynamics remains incomplete. In this work, we employ high-level quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) non-adiabatic dynamics simulations to elucidate the critical role of excited-state degeneracy in the retinal chromophore. Our simulations reveal that the specific electrostatic field of the opsin protein scaffold induces a splitting of the degenerate excited-state manifold into distinct conical intersection seams. This electrostatic tuning creates a bifurcating reaction pathway, partitioning the excited-state population into productive and non-productive channels. We quantitatively demonstrate that the relative energetic accessibility and topography of these intersection seams, directly controlled by the protein's electrostatic preorganization, are the primary determinants of the observed near-unity quantum yield. These findings, reported in 2022, establish a general principle of electrostatic control over quantum degeneracy, with profound implications for the design of biomimetic photonic materials and the understanding of photobiology.
