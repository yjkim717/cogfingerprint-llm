We propose a novel holographic framework for constructing dynamical, multi-star systems in asymptotically antiâ€“de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes via the AdS/CFT correspondence. By introducing time-periodic boundary sources for specific scalar operators in the dual conformal field theory (CFT), we generate coherent, orbiting configurations of bosonic fields in the bulk gravitational theory. These sources explicitly break boundary rotational invariance, inducing a non-trivial stress-energy tensor that backreacts on the AdS geometry. Through detailed analysis of the coupled Einstein-Klein-Gordon system, we demonstrate that these boundary-driven perturbations result in stable, gravitationally bound objects executing orbital motion within the bulk. This methodology provides a controlled, fully non-linear approach to studying dynamical multi-body gravity in AdS, with implications for thermalization, holographic entanglement, and the nature of geometric interiors beyond static scenarios.
