**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum optics increasingly relies on efficient generation of entangled photon pairs for foundational research and technological advancement. This work reports a novel approach to entangled photon pair production leveraging a lithium niobate metasurface integrated with nonlinear crystal technology. Utilizing a specifically designed metasurface, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the rate of spatially entangled photon pair generation compared to conventional techniques. The metasurface, fabricated from lithium niobate, acts as an efficient nonlinear optical transducer, facilitating the parametric down-conversion process with optimized spectral overlap. Detailed analysis reveals a direct correlation between metasurface geometry and the generated entanglement fidelity, highlighting the potential for tailored quantum light sources. These findings represent a crucial step towards miniaturized and integrated quantum devices, specifically targeting applications in quantum key distribution and enhanced sensing. Future work will focus on exploring broader spectral ranges and investigating the scalability of this metasurface-based approach for practical quantum information processing.
