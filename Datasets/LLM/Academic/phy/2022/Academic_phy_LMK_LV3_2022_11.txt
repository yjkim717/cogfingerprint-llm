"In this study, we leverage the AdS/CFT correspondence to construct a stellar model orbiting within an asymptotically AdS spacetime, thereby illustrating the holographic principle's capability to extract bulk geometry information from stellar motion. By analyzing the gravitational dynamics of the star and its dual quantum field theory description, we demonstrate that the stellar trajectory encodes the underlying spacetime geometry. Our findings provide novel insights into the interplay between gravitational physics and quantum field theory, shedding light on the holographic principle's role in 2022 theoretical physics."
