**Abstract**

Geometric phase metasurfaces have emerged as a powerful platform for realizing compact and efficient optical devices, offering unprecedented control over light propagation at the subwavelength scale. This review synthesizes recent advancements in the field, focusing on the exploitation of the Pancharatnam-Berry phase for gradient phase modulation within planar metasurface architectures. We detail the fundamental principles underpinning geometric phase accumulation, highlighting its advantages over traditional phase modulation schemes, particularly in achieving broadband and polarization-insensitive performance. The discussion encompasses a range of meta-atom designs and fabrication techniques employed to generate spatially varying phase profiles, enabling functionalities such as beam steering, focusing, holography, and polarization conversion.  Furthermore, we examine strategies for overcoming challenges related to losses and fabrication complexity, including the incorporation of high-index materials and advanced nanofabrication methods.  Finally, we assess the current state-of-the-art and outline future research directions, emphasizing the potential of geometric phase metasurfaces to revolutionize optical technologies and enable the development of integrated photonic circuits with enhanced capabilities. The review aims to provide a comprehensive overview for researchers entering this rapidly evolving field.
