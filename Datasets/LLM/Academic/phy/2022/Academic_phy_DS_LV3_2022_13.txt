In this study, we investigate the implications of the third law of thermodynamics, specifically the Nernst unattainability principle, for fault-tolerant quantum computing. While quantum algorithms often assume perfect zero-temperature initialization, we demonstrate that finite effective temperatures inherent to physical systems impose fundamental limits on quantum circuit fidelity. Through theoretical modeling of superconducting qubit arrays, we quantify the asymptotic scaling of gate errors with respect to residual thermal excitations. Our results establish that the thermodynamic cost of maintaining ultra-low temperatures grows exponentially with system size, creating a fundamental tension between quantum error correction thresholds and cooling requirements. These findings necessitate a paradigm shift in quantum architecture design, suggesting that future scalable quantum processors must explicitly account for thermodynamic constraints in their fidelity targets. This work bridges quantum thermodynamics with practical quantum engineering, providing crucial insights for achieving computationally meaningful quantum advantage.
