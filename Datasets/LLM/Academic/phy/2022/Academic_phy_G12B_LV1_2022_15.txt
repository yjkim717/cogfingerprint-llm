**Abstract: Enhanced Electrochemical Performance of Cation-Deficient Perovskite Anodes via Short-Range Order Engineering**

The persistent demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates the exploration of novel anode materials beyond conventional graphite. Perovskite oxides, with their tunable structural and electronic properties, have emerged as promising candidates, yet their application has been hampered by issues of structural instability and poor rate capability. This work investigates the impact of cation deficiency on the electrochemical performance of perovskite anodes, revealing a surprising and beneficial correlation with atomic short-range order (SRO). We synthesized and characterized a series of cation-deficient perovskite materials, observing the formation of a unique SRO characterized by preferential cation segregation and the emergence of nanoscale domain structures.  Electrochemical testing, including galvanostatic charge-discharge cycling and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, demonstrates that these cation-deficient perovskites exhibit significantly enhanced rate capability and exceptional cycling stability compared to stoichiometric counterparts. Specifically, we observed charge times reduced by [insert percentage or specific time reduction here] and a capacity retention of [insert percentage here] after [insert number] cycles at a current density of [insert current density here].  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate the mechanism, indicating that the SRO facilitates efficient lithium-ion diffusion and mitigates volume changes during cycling, thereby suppressing electrode degradation. These findings suggest a viable strategy for improving the performance of perovskite anodes through controlled cation deficiency and the resultant manipulation of SRO, opening new avenues for developing next-generation LIBs.

*Future work will focus on correlating the precise SRO motifs with electrochemical performance, exploring the influence of different cation vacancies, and investigating the scalability of this synthesis approach for industrial applications.*

**Key Considerations & Potential Customizations:**

*   **Replace Bracketed Information:**  The bracketed sections ([...]) *must* be replaced with specific, quantitative data from a hypothetical experiment to make this a truly compelling abstract.
*   **Perovskite Composition:** Specify the perovskite composition (e.g., La<sub>0.8</sub>Sr<sub>0.2</sub>MnO<sub>3</sub>) in the abstract for clarity.
*   **Characterization Techniques:** Briefly mention specific characterization techniques used (e.g., X-ray Diffraction, Transmission Electron Microscopy, X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy) to support your claims about SRO.
*   **DFT Details:** If DFT was used, specify the level of theory (e.g., GGA-PBE, hybrid functional) and the key parameters investigated.
*   **Target Journal:** Tailor the language and level of detail to the specific journal you intend to submit to.
