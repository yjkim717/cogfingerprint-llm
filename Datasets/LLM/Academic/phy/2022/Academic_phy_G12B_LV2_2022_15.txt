**Abstract**

The pursuit of high-performance anode materials remains a critical challenge in the advancement of lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology. While conventional anode materials often suffer from capacity fade and rate limitations during prolonged cycling, recent investigations into perovskite oxides offer a promising avenue for improvement. This study reports on the electrochemical performance of a novel cation-deficient perovskite oxide (CNO) as an anode material for LIBs, demonstrating a synergistic relationship between compositional tuning and atomic-scale structural features. Specifically, the deliberate introduction of cation vacancies within the perovskite lattice results in a unique atomic short-range order (ASRO) characterized by localized structural distortions.  These distortions are hypothesized to facilitate rapid lithium-ion diffusion kinetics and mitigate volume changes associated with lithium intercalation/deintercalation processes.

Electrochemical characterization, including galvanostatic cycling at various current densities, reveals that the CNO exhibits exceptional rate capability and long-term cycling stability exceeding that of conventional anode materials.  Detailed analysis indicates a minimal capacity fade over hundreds of charge-discharge cycles, even at high current densities.  We propose that the ASRO, arising from cation deficiency, provides a robust framework that resists structural degradation and maintains efficient lithium-ion transport pathways. Further investigations employing X-ray diffraction and advanced microscopy techniques are planned to fully elucidate the evolution of the ASRO during cycling.  Ultimately, this work highlights the potential of cation-deficient perovskite oxides as a viable and high-performing anode material for next-generation LIBs, contributing to the development of energy storage solutions with improved performance and longevity.
