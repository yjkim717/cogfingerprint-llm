In this 2022 theoretical study, we revisit G. 't Hooft's proposal that quantum cloning near black hole horizons preserves unitarity through novel Hamiltonian evolution. Conventional antipodal identification models face contradictions regarding information preservation during gravitational collapse. Our analysis demonstrates that implementing an antisymmetric Hamiltonian operator across the extended Penrose diagram naturally generates quantum clones at causally disconnected regions. These clones maintain coherence through non-local correlations without violating quantum mechanics' foundational principles. The framework resolves the black hole information paradox by ensuring pure states evolve unitarily throughout the evaporation process. We establish that this mechanism requires neither modification of general relativity nor introduction of exotic matter, instead emerging from consistent quantization on the complete spacetime manifold. This approach provides a robust foundation for reconciling gravitational physics with quantum theory while making testable predictions for future quantum gravity experiments.
