We present a rigorous proof of unitarity for superstring scattering amplitudes in spacetime dimensions D â‰¤ 6, resolving a long-standing theoretical challenge. Our approach introduces a novel contour integral representation for tree-level amplitudes, which provides a powerful analytical framework to directly demonstrate the optical theorem. This formulation enables a systematic analysis of the asymptotic behavior of partial wave coefficients in the high-energy limit. We establish that these coefficients exhibit bounded growth, confirming the absence of unphysical violations of unitarity constraints within this dimensional regime. The results substantiate the internal consistency of superstring theory as a unitary framework in lower dimensions and offer a new technical tool for investigating the fundamental properties of string amplitudes. This work provides a critical advancement in understanding the non-perturbative structure of string theory.
