**Abstract**

The pursuit of high-performance energy storage materials has increasingly focused on perovskite structures, particularly those exhibiting cation deficiency. This study investigates the electrochemical behavior of a novel cation-deficient cesium nickel oxide perovskite (CNO), demonstrating a significant enhancement in lithium-ion battery characteristics. Utilizing X-ray diffraction and density functional theory calculations, we observed the formation of a robust atomic short-range order (ASRO) within the CNO lattice, correlating directly with increased structural stability.  Electrochemical testing revealed a marked improvement in rate capacity, achieving sustained power delivery at elevated current densities.  Specifically, the ASRO appears to mitigate cation migration and facilitate enhanced lithium-ion diffusion pathways.  These findings suggest that strategically engineered cation deficiencies, promoting ASRO, represent a promising avenue for designing advanced cathode materials capable of superior energy storage performance. Further investigation into the precise mechanistic underpinnings of this phenomenon is warranted.
