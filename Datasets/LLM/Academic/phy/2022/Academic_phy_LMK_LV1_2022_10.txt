Title: Nanoscopic Investigation of pH at the Electrode-Electrolyte Interface in Neat Water using Advanced Force Fields and Stochastic Simulations

Abstract:

The pH of neat water at the nanoscopic scale has been a subject of significant interest in recent years, particularly in the context of understanding electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. In this study, we employ the RexPoN force field, a highly accurate and transferable force field, in conjunction with stochastic simulations to investigate the pH of neat water at the nanoscopic scale. Our simulations reveal that the pH of neat water deviates significantly from its bulk value at the electrode-electrolyte interface, exhibiting a pronounced nanoscopic scale effect. We demonstrate that the RexPoN force field, which incorporates reactive and polarizable terms, provides a more accurate representation of the complex interactions between water molecules and the electrode surface compared to traditional non-reactive force fields. Our stochastic simulations, performed using a combination of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods, allow us to capture the inherent fluctuations and uncertainties in the system, providing a comprehensive understanding of the pH behavior at the nanoscopic scale. The results of this study have significant implications for the understanding of electrochemical reactions and the design of electrochemical devices, particularly in the context of energy storage and conversion applications. By providing a detailed understanding of the pH behavior at the electrode-electrolyte interface, our study contributes to the development of more efficient and sustainable electrochemical technologies.
