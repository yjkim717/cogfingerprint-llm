**Abstract**

The manipulation of ultrashort optical pulses with tailored spatiotemporal profiles represents a significant challenge in nonlinear optics. This work introduces a novel approach leveraging metasurface engineering to achieve precise control over ultrafast pulse shaping. Utilizing a specifically designed metasurface architecture, we demonstrate the ability to dynamically modify the wavefront and temporal evolution of femtosecond laser pulses. The underlying mechanism relies on nonlinear optical resonances within the metasurface structure, enabling coherent control of the pulse’s amplitude and phase.  Experimental results, corroborated by rigorous numerical simulations, reveal a high degree of spatiotemporal fidelity, achieving significant alterations in pulse bandwidth and spatial intensity distributions.  These findings highlight the potential of metasurfaces as active components for advanced optical systems, facilitating applications ranging from high-resolution microscopy to ultrafast material processing. Further research will focus on scaling and integrating these techniques for complex pulse sequences.
