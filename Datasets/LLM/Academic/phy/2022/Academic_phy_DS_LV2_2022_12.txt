**Abstract**

The primary photochemical event in vision is initiated by the ultrafast photoisomerization of the retinal chromophore within the rhodopsin protein. While this process is known for its high quantum efficiency, the precise mechanistic role of the protein environment in steering the excited-state dynamics remains a subject of intense investigation. In this study, we employ high-level quantum-classical simulations to elucidate the sub-100-fs dynamics following photoexcitation. Our results demonstrate a critical bifurcation event in the excited-state population occurring at approximately 15 femtoseconds post-excitation. This early-time splitting of the wavepacket is identified as a key determinant of the reaction quantum yield, effectively partitioning the population between reactive and non-reactive pathways. A detailed electrostatic analysis reveals that this bifurcation is not an intrinsic property of the chromophore but is directly governed by the pre-organized electrostatic field of the opsin protein. We conclude that the protein matrix acts as a femtosecond-scale electrostatic catalyst, imposing a conformational bias that guides the system toward the productive photoproduct state, thereby rationalizing the remarkable efficiency of this fundamental biological process.
