Title: Resolving Space-like Singularities in General Relativity through Loop Quantum Gravity

Abstract:
The resolution of space-like singularities remains a long-standing problem in general relativity, wherein the curvature scalars diverge, rendering the spacetime geodesically incomplete. Recent advancements in loop quantum gravity (LQG) have led to a deeper understanding of the quantum geometry underlying these singularities. By employing the kinematical Hilbert space of LQG, we analyze the quantum resolution of space-like singularities in various gravitational models. Our results indicate that the quantum geometry effects lead to a bounce, replacing the classical singularity with a quantum bridge. The effective spacetime is rendered geodesically complete, and the curvature scalars remain finite. We discuss the implications of these findings for the black hole singularity and the cosmological singularities, highlighting the potential of LQG to provide a consistent, non-perturbative quantum gravity framework for resolving space-like singularities. Our analysis is grounded in the 2022 understanding of LQG and its applications to gravitational physics.
