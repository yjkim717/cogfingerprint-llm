**Abstract**

Accurate prediction of strong-field gravitational phenomena remains a significant challenge in theoretical astrophysics. This work presents a novel post-Minkowskian (PM) approach for analyzing black hole scattering events, leveraging recent advancements in numerical relativity simulations. Specifically, we compare the outcomes of numerical relativity calculations – employing state-of-the-art algorithms to model binary black hole interactions – with established analytical approximations. Our analysis reveals systematic discrepancies between these methods, necessitating refinements in existing PM techniques.  We introduce a modified PM formalism, incorporating higher-order corrections to the gravitational potential, which demonstrably improves the fidelity of the analytical predictions. These results highlight the continued value of combining numerical and analytical strategies in probing the intricacies of gravity near black holes and provide a stepping stone towards more precise forecasts for gravitational wave astronomy in the coming decade.
