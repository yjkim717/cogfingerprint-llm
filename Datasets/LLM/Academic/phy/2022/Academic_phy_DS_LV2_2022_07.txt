We present a systematic comparison between numerical relativity simulations of black-hole scattering and analytical predictions from the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion. By reformulating the conservative dynamics within the effective-one-body (EOB) framework, we construct a gauge-invariant radial potential directly from numerical scattering angles. Our analysis reveals that this potential, when expressed in terms of the gravitational coupling constant, exhibits remarkable agreement with high-order PM calculations through fourth post-Minkowskian order. Furthermore, we incorporate radiation-reaction effects via a dissipative component in the EOB dynamics, demonstrating consistent energy loss with numerical waveforms. These results establish a unified description of black-hole dynamics from weak-field scattering to strong-field merger, providing a critical bridge between perturbative methods and non-perturbative numerical simulations for precision gravitational-wave modeling.
