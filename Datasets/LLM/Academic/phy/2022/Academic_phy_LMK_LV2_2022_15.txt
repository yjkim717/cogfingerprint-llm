Title: Unveiling the Role of Atomic Short-Range Order in Cation-Deficient Perovskite Oxides for Enhanced Lithium-Ion Storage

Abstract:

The development of high-performance anode materials is crucial for advancing lithium-ion battery technology. Recently, cation-deficient perovskite oxides have emerged as promising candidates due to their unique structural characteristics. In this study, we investigate the electrochemical properties of CeNb3O9, a cation-deficient perovskite oxide, and reveal its exceptional rate capacity and long-term cycling stability. Our findings indicate that the atomic short-range order within the material's structure plays a pivotal role in facilitating intercalation pseudocapacitance, thereby enhancing lithium-ion storage. The presence of short-range order enables efficient charge transfer and promotes reversible lithium-ion intercalation, resulting in improved electrochemical performance. This work provides valuable insights into the structure-property relationships governing cation-deficient perovskite oxides, shedding light on their potential applications in high-performance lithium-ion batteries. Our results underscore the significance of atomic short-range order in designing advanced anode materials for next-generation energy storage systems.
