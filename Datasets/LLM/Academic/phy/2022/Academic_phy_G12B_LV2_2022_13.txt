**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum computation necessitates operation at temperatures approaching absolute zero to mitigate thermal decoherence and maintain qubit fidelity. This requirement presents a fundamental tension with the Nernst unattainability principle, a cornerstone of classical thermodynamics, which dictates that absolute zero is an unattainable limit in finite thermodynamic systems. This paper investigates the implications of this conflict for the development of scalable quantum computers. We analyze the thermodynamic cost associated with achieving and maintaining the ultralow temperatures required for quantum circuit operation, considering both cryogenically cooled architectures and emerging quantum computing modalities. While quantum systems inherently exhibit non-classical behavior, the macroscopic infrastructure supporting them – including cooling systems, control electronics, and shielding – remains governed by classical thermodynamic laws. We argue that the energy expenditure required to circumvent the Nernst unattainability principle imposes a practical limit on the scalability and energy efficiency of quantum computation. Furthermore, we explore potential avenues for mitigating this thermodynamic overhead through innovations in qubit design, cryogenic engineering, and the exploration of alternative quantum computing paradigms that may exhibit reduced sensitivity to thermal noise, ultimately impacting the projected feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum computation.
