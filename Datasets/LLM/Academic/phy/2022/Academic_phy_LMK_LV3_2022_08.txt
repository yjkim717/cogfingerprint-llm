Title: Reconciling the Physicality of Quantum Information: A Novel Postulate for Relational Quantum Mechanics

Abstract:
Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) has been at the forefront of interpreting quantum theory, emphasizing the relational nature of quantum states. However, the tension between the physicality of information and its inherent inaccessibility poses a significant challenge. This article proposes a new postulate for RQM, addressing this dichotomy and facilitating intersubjective agreement regarding past quantum events. By reexamining the fundamental principles of quantum information within the RQM framework, we introduce a postulate that reconciles the physical manifestation of quantum information with its observational inaccessibility. This novel postulate enables a more robust understanding of quantum events, fostering a consistent narrative across different observers. Our proposal is grounded in the 2022 advancements in quantum information theory and contributes to the ongoing discourse on the foundations of quantum mechanics, offering a refined interpretation that aligns with the principles of RQM.
