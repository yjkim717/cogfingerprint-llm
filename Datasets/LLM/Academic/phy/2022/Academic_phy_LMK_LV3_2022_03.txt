In 2022, research on supersymmetric black holes revealed novel insights into correlation functions, deriving explicit formulas for two-point functions and integral expressions for n-point correlators. By leveraging supergraviton modes and supercharges, the study established a framework for understanding extremal black hole behavior. Extensions to non-supersymmetric cases were also explored, broadening the implications for theoretical physics and our understanding of black hole dynamics.
