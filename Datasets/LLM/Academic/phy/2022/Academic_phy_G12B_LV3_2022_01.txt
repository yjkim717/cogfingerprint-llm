**Abstract**

The long-standing information paradox confronting black hole physics motivates exploration of novel theoretical frameworks reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics. This work investigates a radical hypothesis wherein spacetime regions surrounding black holes exhibit a quantum cloning structure. Utilizing Penrose diagrams to map causal relationships, we propose that quantum states characterizing regions behind the event horizon are exact replicas of states in seemingly disparate regions of spacetime. This non-local correlation offers a potential mechanism for preserving unitarity, a fundamental tenet of quantum theory, which is seemingly violated by Hawking radiation. Further investigation of this "quantum cloning black hole" model could provide insights into the nature of black hole interiors, potentially generalizing our understanding of black hole structure and offering avenues towards a consistent quantum theory of gravity.
