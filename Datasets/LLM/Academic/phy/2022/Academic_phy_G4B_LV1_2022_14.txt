**Abstract**

Black hole solutions within classical general relativity are increasingly viewed through the lens of thermodynamic concepts, prompting investigations into their potential as thermodynamic defects. This work proposes a novel framework utilizing free energy calculations to characterize these black holes, specifically exploring their emergent topological properties. We demonstrate that the black hole’s free energy landscape is intimately linked to the presence of winding numbers, which we define as a robust topological invariant.  Crucially, these winding numbers are shown to directly correlate with the black hole’s stability – deviations from a critical value indicating a susceptibility to event horizon formation.  Our analysis suggests a universal relationship between the free energy and the associated winding number, offering a promising avenue for understanding the fundamental constraints governing black hole equilibrium. Furthermore, this perspective connects black hole physics to broader theories of thermodynamic defects, potentially illuminating the role of spacetime topology in extreme gravitational environments.
