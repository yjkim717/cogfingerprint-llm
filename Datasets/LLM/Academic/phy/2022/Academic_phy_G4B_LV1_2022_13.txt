**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum computing faces significant thermodynamic challenges as it scales towards practical applications. This work investigates the detrimental impact of finite effective temperatures during qubit initialization protocols on the overall scalability of quantum processors. Utilizing a framework grounded in the third law of thermodynamics, we demonstrate that persistent thermal fluctuations, even at cryogenic temperatures, introduce non-equilibrium conditions within the qubit ensemble. Specifically, the imposition of a non-zero effective temperature limits the achievable coherence times and fidelity of quantum operations. 

Our analysis reveals a critical threshold wherein these thermal disturbances disproportionately increase error rates, effectively impeding the realization of robust quantum algorithms. We propose that mitigating this issue necessitates innovations in qubit control and isolation, potentially incorporating advanced error correction strategies or novel thermal management techniques. Further research is crucial to determine the precise scaling limitations imposed by these thermodynamic constraints and to guide the development of fault-tolerant quantum architectures by 2025.
