**Abstract**

Recent quantum-classical simulations investigating the photoactivation mechanism of rhodopsin have uncovered a nuanced interplay between quantum coherence and environmental decoherence. Our simulations, performed in 2022, reveal a transient population splitting within the excited state manifold of rhodopsin, directly attributable to the degeneracy of electronic states and subsequently influencing the systemâ€™s quantum efficiency. The magnitude of this splitting, and therefore the efficiency of double-bond isomerization crucial for visual transduction, is strongly modulated by the surrounding protein electrostatic environment. These findings suggest an evolutionary trade-off wherein maximizing quantum efficiency may necessitate minimizing the influence of thermal noise, a constraint shaping the molecular architecture of rhodopsin and potentially explaining observed variations in visual pigment performance across species. Further exploration of this dynamic is critical for a comprehensive understanding of biological light harvesting.
