**Abstract**

Recent developments in scattering amplitude techniques have illuminated previously obscured structures within string theory. This work introduces a novel formulation of partial wave coefficients for string amplitudes, expressed as straightforward contour integrals. This representation facilitates a direct and elegant demonstration of unitarity within superstring theories, a critical consistency condition often challenging to establish rigorously. Our analysis explicitly proves unitarity for D â‰¤ 6 spacetime dimensions, extending prior results and providing a valuable validation of the theoretical framework. Furthermore, the integral form offers new avenues for exploring the asymptotic behavior of string amplitudes, potentially yielding insights into the Regge limit and the connection between string theory and gauge theories. This method provides a powerful tool for investigating fundamental properties of superstring theories and promises to stimulate further research within the field of theoretical high-energy physics.
