**Abstract**

Geometric phase metasurfaces have emerged as a compelling platform for manipulating wavefronts with unprecedented control, offering significant advancements over traditional refractive index elements. This review synthesizes recent progress in the design and implementation of these structures, focusing on 2022 developments and highlighting key trends. Specifically, we examine the burgeoning field of continuously shaped metasurfaces, demonstrating their capacity to realize gradient phase modulation tailored for complex optical functionalities. Furthermore, the incorporation of composite materials and subwavelength structuring techniques is explored, enabling enhanced phase profiles and broadened bandwidths. 

The influence of the pancharatnam-berry phase effect, a critical consideration in achieving precise phase control, is discussed in relation to these novel designs.  We assess the potential of these metasurfaces across various applications, including beam steering, holographic imaging, and polarization control.  Future research directions emphasizing integration with active elements and robust fabrication methods are briefly considered, underscoring the continuing evolution of this technologically significant area of photonics.
