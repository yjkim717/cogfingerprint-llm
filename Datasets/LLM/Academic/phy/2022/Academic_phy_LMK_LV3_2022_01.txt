Abstract:

In a 2022 analysis of black hole evolution, we propose a novel framework that leverages pure quantum states to reconcile unitarity with the principles of quantum mechanics. By positing that quantum states in region II are exact clones of those in region I, we demonstrate a systematic restoration of unitarity. This theoretical construct resolves long-standing paradoxes associated with black hole information loss. Our results underscore the significance of quantum clones in understanding the intricate dynamics of black holes, providing a promising avenue for further research into the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravitational physics.
