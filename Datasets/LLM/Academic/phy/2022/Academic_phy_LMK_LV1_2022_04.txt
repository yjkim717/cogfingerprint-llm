Here is a formal academic-style abstract inspired by the given summary:

"Recent advances in the Swampland program, combined with observational constraints, suggest a novel paradigm for understanding the quantum gravity landscape. We propose that the observed neutrino masses and mixing can be explained by the existence of sterile neutrinos propagating in a compactified extra dimension, dubbed the 'dark dimension.' This framework is supported by the Emergent String Conjecture, which predicts a tower of light states associated with the dark dimension. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev) is linked to the scale of the dark dimension, providing a tantalizing connection between the electroweak scale and the quantum gravity regime. Our analysis reveals a unique corner of the swampland, characterized by a light tower of states and a specific dark dimension geometry, which can be probed by forthcoming experiments. This setup offers a promising avenue for exploring the interplay between quantum gravity, neutrino physics, and the Higgs sector." (2022)
