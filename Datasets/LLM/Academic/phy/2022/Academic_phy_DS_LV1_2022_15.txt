**Abstract**

The development of high-performance anodes capable of withstanding ultra-fast charging regimes remains a pivotal challenge for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. This work investigates a novel cation-deficient perovskite oxide (Ln0.5A0.5)1-xTiO3-Î´ (where Ln and A are lanthanide and alkaline earth cations, respectively) as a promising anode material. We demonstrate that controlled A-site cation non-stoichiometry, rather than being detrimental, induces the formation of a robust atomic short-range order (SRO) within the perovskite framework. Advanced synchrotron X-ray pair distribution function (PDF) analysis and reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) refinements confirm that this SRO mitigates the typical structural degradation and phase transitions associated with rapid lithium insertion/extraction. The material exhibits an exceptional capacity retention of over 95% after 2,000 cycles at a high rate of 10 C, significantly outperforming conventional graphite and titanate anodes. Electrochemical analysis reveals minimal polarization and a low energy barrier for Li+ diffusion, attributed to the synergistic combination of the inherent open perovskite channels and the stabilized local structure provided by the SRO. These findings establish cation-deficient perovskites with engineered SRO as a new materials design paradigm for durable, fast-charging energy storage.
