Title: Quantum Efficiency Modulation in Rhodopsin: Insights from Quantum-Classical Simulations

Abstract:

Rhodopsin, a pivotal protein in visual transduction, has long been a subject of interest in understanding the intricacies of quantum efficiency in biological systems. Recent advancements in quantum-classical simulations have enabled a deeper exploration of the excited-state isomerization process in rhodopsin, shedding light on the factors influencing its quantum efficiency. Our study employs a hybrid quantum-classical simulation approach to investigate the role of protein electrostatics in modulating the quantum efficiency of rhodopsin. We observe a significant population splitting in the excited-state potential energy surface, which is intricately linked to the protein's electrostatic environment. The simulations reveal that the protein electrostatics play a crucial role in modulating the quantum efficiency by influencing the excited-state dynamics. Our findings indicate that the subtle interplay between the protein's electrostatic properties and the chromophore's excited-state isomerization pathway is a key determinant of rhodopsin's quantum efficiency. The results demonstrate that the quantum-classical simulations can accurately capture the complex interactions governing the quantum efficiency of rhodopsin, providing a nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the quantum efficiency of biological systems, highlighting the significance of protein electrostatics in modulating the excited-state dynamics of rhodopsin. The insights gained from this research have implications for understanding the fundamental principles governing quantum efficiency in biological systems, and may inform the development of novel bio-inspired systems.
