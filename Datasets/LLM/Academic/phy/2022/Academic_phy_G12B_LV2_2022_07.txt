**Abstract**

The coalescence of compact objects, particularly black holes, represents a crucial testbed for general relativity in the strong-field regime. While numerical relativity (NR) simulations remain the gold standard for obtaining highly accurate solutions in such scenarios, analytical approximations offer valuable complementary insights and provide a means to extrapolate NR results to parameter regimes inaccessible to direct computation. This study investigates the consistency between post-Minkowskian (PM) waveform predictions and NR data for black hole scattering events. We employ effective radial potentials, derived from PM expansions, to model the dynamics of binary black hole systems during the late inspiral and merger phases. Our analysis reveals a striking level of agreement between the PM predictions and corresponding NR simulations across a range of mass ratios and spins. This concordance provides strong support for the accuracy of PM approximations, particularly the effective-one-body formalism, in describing the dynamics of black hole binaries. Furthermore, it highlights the utility of PM calculations for providing analytical models that can be incorporated into gravitational wave data analysis pipelines, facilitating more precise parameter estimation and tests of general relativity.
