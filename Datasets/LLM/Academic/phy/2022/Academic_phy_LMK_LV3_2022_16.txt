Title: Enhancing Asymptotic Symmetry Algebra with Logarithmic Supertranslations

Abstract:
In a significant advancement in understanding asymptotic symmetries, the BMS(4) group has been extended to incorporate logarithmic supertranslations, thereby enriching the asymptotic symmetry algebra. This extension enables the formulation of supertranslation-invariant Lorentz charges, effectively resolving the longstanding issue of supertranslation ambiguities in defining angular momentum. By augmenting the Poincar√© algebra with these logarithmic supertranslations, we establish a more comprehensive framework for analyzing asymptotic symmetries. The resulting algebra preserves the Lorentz covariance, ensuring that the newly defined angular momentum is free from supertranslation-related ambiguities. This development has profound implications for our understanding of conserved quantities in asymptotically flat spacetimes. The enhanced asymptotic symmetry algebra provides a more nuanced and precise tool for investigating the intricate relationships between asymptotic symmetries, conserved charges, and the geometry of spacetime.
