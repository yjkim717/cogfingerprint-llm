We introduce a metasurface-based framework for the deterministic synthesis of ultrafast optical pulses with arbitrary spatiotemporal profiles. By integrating a dielectric metasurface directly into a conventional Fourier transform pulse-shaping apparatus, we circumvent the limitations of conventional methods in simultaneously controlling spatial and temporal degrees of freedom. The metasurface acts as a versatile spatiotemporal coupler, applying a spatially variant spectral transfer function that maps a prescribed spatial pattern onto the pulse's temporal envelope via a single optical transformation. This structured space-time coupling enables the generation of complex wave packets, such as non-diffracting and self-accelerating pulses, with unprecedented fidelity. Our experimental results demonstrate precise control over pulse-front curvature and local group delays, establishing a scalable and compact platform for applications in nonlinear optics, laser machining, and ultrafast imaging.
