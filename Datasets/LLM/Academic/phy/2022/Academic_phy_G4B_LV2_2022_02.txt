**Abstract**

The preservation of unitarity remains a fundamental challenge in the theoretical framework of superstring theories. This work introduces a novel formulation of string amplitude partial wave coefficients, offering a rigorous approach to establishing unitarity within the context of superstring theories. Utilizing a systematic expansion in partial waves, we derive a manifestly unitary expression, demonstrating its validity up to four spacetime dimensions (D=6). Specifically, our analysis incorporates the concept of massive poles, crucial for accurately representing the spectrum of superstring excitations, and explicitly connects these poles to the unitarity conditions. 

This refined representation addresses previous limitations in unitarity proofs, providing a more comprehensive and controlled method. The presented formalism holds significant implications for string phenomenology, potentially informing calculations of scattering amplitudes and providing a stronger foundation for exploring the landscape of superstring theories. Further investigation extending to higher dimensions remains a key area of ongoing research, with the potential to solidify unitarity as a cornerstone of these complex theoretical models.
