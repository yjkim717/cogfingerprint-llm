**A Mesoscopic Extra Dimension and the Interplay of Neutrino Mass and Quantum Gravity**

Abstract

We present a novel theoretical framework proposing the existence of a mesoscopic, compact extra dimension residing within a "dark dimension" sector, motivated by recent anomalies in neutrino oscillation data and the persistent challenges in unifying gravity with the Standard Model. Our model, building upon the Swampland Programâ€™s constraints on effective field theories, posits that the geometry of this extra dimension directly influences both the Higgs vacuum expectation value (Higgs VEV) and the generation of neutrino masses. Specifically, we demonstrate a compelling connection wherein the size of the dark dimension is dynamically linked to the Planck scale, suggesting a fundamental relationship between quantum gravity and the observed scale of neutrino mass.

We explore this connection through a distance/duality conjecture, arguing that the geometric properties of the extra dimension, particularly its curvature and topology, manifest as effective four-dimensional operators that contribute to the Higgs potential and neutrino mass terms.  The model predicts the existence of sterile neutrinos, whose mixing with active neutrinos is mediated by fluctuations within the dark dimension.  Furthermore, we investigate the implications of this framework for resolving the hierarchy problem, suggesting that the stabilization of the Higgs VEV is intrinsically tied to the geometry of the extra dimension, thereby mitigating the need for fine-tuning. We analyze the potential experimental signatures of this model, including potential deviations from Standard Model predictions in neutrino oscillation experiments and constraints from searches for dark sector interactions.  This work provides a potential avenue for exploring the deep connections between quantum gravity, neutrino physics, and the landscape of extra dimensions, offering a new perspective on fundamental questions in particle physics and cosmology.
