**Abstract**

The precise characterization of interfacial pH is a critical, yet poorly understood, factor governing the efficiency of electrochemical systems such as CO₂ reduction reactors. Traditional continuum models fail to capture the unique physicochemical environment within nanoscopic water layers adjacent to electrode surfaces, where pronounced ion confinement and stochastic fluctuations dominate. This study employs a multi-scale computational framework to elucidate the dynamic behavior of pH in these confined aqueous domains. We integrate *ab initio* quantum mechanics calculations with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, utilizing the state-of-the-art ReXPoN force field to accurately model many-body interactions, polarization, and charge transfer at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Our results demonstrate that the local pH within nanoscopic water pools is not a static property but exhibits significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Stochastic simulations, parameterized from our MD trajectories, quantitatively link this heterogeneity to the stochastic nature of water autoionization and the subsequent diffusion of hydronium (H₃O⁺) and hydroxide (OH⁻) ions. We identify that ion pair generation and recombination kinetics, coupled with restricted diffusion in the interfacial region, create localized pH gradients that can deviate by several units from the bulk value. These nanoscale pH fluctuations directly influence the proton-coupled electron transfer pathways central to CO₂ conversion, potentially altering product selectivity and catalytic activity. Our findings provide a fundamental, atomistic rationale for previously unexplained performance variations in electrocatalytic devices and underscore the necessity of explicitly modeling nanoscopic water structure and stochastic ion dynamics for the rational design of next-generation electrochemical interfaces.
