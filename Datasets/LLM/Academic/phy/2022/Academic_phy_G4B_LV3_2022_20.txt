**Abstract**

This work proposes a novel framework for neutrino mass generation predicated on a generalized symmetry-breaking mechanism, circumventing the challenges associated with conventional extensions to the Standard Model.  The approach leverages the introduction of lepton family magnetic monopoles, strategically coupled to a specific generalized global symmetry, to constrain the number of required new fields and symmetries.  Specifically, we explore the implications of this symmetry breaking for the existence and properties of hypothetical Z’ bosons, positing their role in mediating interactions relevant to neutrino mass diagonalization.  Employing techniques from quantum gauge theory, we demonstrate how this construction maintains consistency with current experimental constraints while offering a pathway to accommodate observed neutrino oscillation patterns.  Further investigation into the phenomenological consequences of this model is warranted, particularly concerning potential observable signatures within collider experiments and astrophysical observations.
