Title: Revisiting Relational Quantum Mechanics: A Novel Postulate for Reconciling Physicality of Information and Intersubjective Agreement

Abstract:
Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) has been a subject of interest in the realm of quantum foundations, as it attempts to resolve the tension between the physicality of information and the inaccessibility of certain information. In this context, we propose a novel postulate to augment the existing RQM framework. Our postulate posits that quantum states are relative to the observer, and the occurrence of quantum events is contingent upon intersubjective agreement among observers. By introducing this additional constraint, we demonstrate that the proposed postulate reconciles the seemingly disparate notions of physicality of information and inaccessibility of certain information. Our analysis, grounded in the principles of quantum mechanics, reveals that this revised framework provides a more comprehensive understanding of quantum states and events. The implications of this work are significant, as they shed new light on the fundamental nature of reality in the quantum domain.
