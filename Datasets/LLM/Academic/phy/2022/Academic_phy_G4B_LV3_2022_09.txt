**Abstract:**

This study presents GMM-MI, a novel methodology for enhancing interpretability within deep learning models applied to complex physical systems. Leveraging Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to estimate mutual information, GMM-MI provides a robust alternative to traditional information-theoretic approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique through rigorous validation using both synthetically generated datasets mimicking particle interactions and experimental data from a condensed matter physics simulation. The resultant representations, informed by mutual information, exhibit improved fidelity in capturing underlying system dynamics.  Crucially, GMM-MI’s probabilistic nature offers greater interpretability compared to purely deterministic methods, facilitating a deeper understanding of feature dependencies and ultimately contributing to more reliable representation learning in physics research.
