In this work, we establish a rigorous framework for demonstrating unitarity constraints within superstring perturbation theory through a novel contour integral formulation of partial wave coefficients. By analytically continuing tree-level string amplitudes into the complex angular momentum plane, we derive explicit representations for these coefficients that manifestly preserve unitarity bounds in spacetime dimensions D ≤ 6. Our methodology reveals how the inherent analytic structure of string amplitudes—particularly their pole structure and Regge behavior—naturally enforces unitarity via Cauchy's theorem applied to carefully chosen integration contours. This approach provides a first-principles verification of unitarity without recourse to spacetime effective field theories, thereby offering new insights into the fundamental consistency of string theory as a quantum gravitational framework. The results significantly advance the non-perturbative understanding of string-theoretic unitarity while suggesting potential extensions to higher-dimensional cases through further analytic continuation techniques.
