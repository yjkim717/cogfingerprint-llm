In this work, we establish a novel topological framework for characterizing black hole thermodynamics by identifying black holes as topological defects within the generalized off-shell free energy landscape. Through systematic computation of winding numbers associated with these defects, we demonstrate a universal classification scheme that transcends specific gravitational theories. Our analysis reveals that these topological invariants directly determine both local thermodynamic stability and global asymptotic behavior across diverse black hole solutions. The methodology provides a unified description of phase transitions and stability criteria, offering new insights into quantum gravitational effects near extremal limits. This topological approach resolves longstanding ambiguities in conventional thermodynamic analyses and suggests deeper connections between geometric structures and microscopic degrees of freedom in quantum gravity.
