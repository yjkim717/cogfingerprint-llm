**Abstract**

The Nernst unattainability principle, a foundational tenet of the third law of thermodynamics, posits the impossibility of reaching absolute zero temperature in a finite number of operations. This work investigates the profound implications of this principle for the scalability of fault-tolerant quantum computing. We demonstrate that the thermodynamic cost of qubit initialization diverges as the target temperature approaches zero, establishing a fundamental link between entropy extraction and quantum circuit fidelity. Through a model coupling a quantum processor to a finite-capacity cryogenic reservoir, we quantify the asymptotic resource overhead required to maintain a target fidelity as the number of logical qubits increases. Our analysis reveals that the unattainability principle imposes a thermodynamic bottleneck, placing fundamental constraints on the maximum attainable computational fidelity for large-scale quantum algorithms and necessitating a co-design of quantum error correction protocols with advanced cryogenic systems.
