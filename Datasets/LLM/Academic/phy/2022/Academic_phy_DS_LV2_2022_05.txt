**Abstract**

The astrometric data from the early third data release of the Gaia mission (EDR3) provide a foundational dataset for calibrating cosmic distance scales. This work critically assesses the utility of Gaia EDR3 parallaxes for calibrating the Period-Luminosity (P-L) relations of Galactic Cepheid variables, which serve as primary standard candles for extragalactic astronomy. While the improved parallax precision and accuracy of EDR3 represent a significant advance over previous data releases, our analysis demonstrates that the residual systematic uncertainties inherent in the parallax measurements impose a fundamental limit on the precision of Cepheid distance calibration. We quantify this limitation, concluding that the current Gaia EDR3 dataset restricts the achievable precision for the zero-point of the Cepheid P-L relation to approximately 3%. Consequently, this precludes the attainment of the 1% accuracy goal required for next-generation determinations of the Hubble Constant and other cosmological parameters that rely on the extragalactic distance ladder. Future Gaia data releases are anticipated to mitigate these systematic effects.
