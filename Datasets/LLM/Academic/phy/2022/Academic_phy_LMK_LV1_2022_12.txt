Title: Quantum Efficiency Modulation in Rhodopsin via Excited-State Population Splitting: A Quantum-Classical Insight

Abstract:

The visual pigment rhodopsin is a paradigmatic system for understanding the intricate interplay between quantum mechanics and biological function. Employing hybrid quantum-classical simulations, we investigate the excited-state dynamics of rhodopsin, revealing a pronounced excited-state population splitting that significantly influences its quantum efficiency. Our results demonstrate that this splitting is intricately linked to the protein's electrostatic environment and thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we find that the electrostatics of the opsin protein modulate the energy landscape of the retinal chromophore, thereby affecting the non-adiabatic transitions and subsequent isomerization. Furthermore, we show that thermal noise plays a crucial role in determining the branching ratio between the reactive and non-reactive pathways. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the quantum efficiency modulation in rhodopsin, shedding new light on the complex interplay between protein structure, electrostatics, and quantum dynamics in this prototypical biological system.
