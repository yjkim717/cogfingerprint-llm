Here is a formal academic-style abstract in the field of physics:

"Beyond the Standard Model, the origin of neutrino masses remains an open question. In this work, we explore the interplay between generalized global symmetries and neutrino mass generation. Focusing on noninvertible symmetries, we demonstrate that nonperturbative symmetry breaking can induce neutrino masses. Specifically, we examine the role of lepton family symmetries, which are naturally realized as noninvertible symmetries. By gauging a subset of these symmetries, we show that neutrino masses can be generated through instanton effects or other nonperturbative mechanisms. Our framework provides a novel approach to understanding the smallness of neutrino masses, leveraging the intricate structure of generalized symmetries. This work contributes to the ongoing effort to uncover the fundamental principles governing the universe, highlighting the potential of generalized symmetries to reveal new physics beyond the Standard Model."
