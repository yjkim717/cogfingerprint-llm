**Generation of Spatiotemporally Entangled Photon Pairs via Lithium Niobate Metasurface Fabrication**

The advancement of miniaturized quantum technologies necessitates efficient generation of entangled photon pairs. This work reports on a novel approach utilizing a lithium niobate metasurface to facilitate the production of spatially entangled photon pairs. Employing nonlinear optical processes within the lithium niobate crystal, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in photon pair generation rates compared to conventional techniques. The metasurface, engineered with precisely controlled subwavelength features, serves to localize and amplify the nonlinear susceptibility, promoting efficient four-wave mixing.  Crucially, the resulting photon pairs exhibit multimode entanglement, offering increased degrees of freedom for quantum information processing.  Experimental results indicate a robust correlation in spatial modes, verified through coincidence measurements. These findings represent a crucial step towards integrated quantum photonic circuits and highlight the potential of metasurface engineering for scalable quantum device fabrication.
