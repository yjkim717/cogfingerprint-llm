**Abstract**

The Gaia EDR3 catalog has revolutionized extragalactic distance measurements through its unprecedented parallactic precision. However, recent analyses of Cepheid variable stars reveal systematic discrepancies in distances derived from these parallaxes, suggesting limitations to the current accuracy of extragalactic distance determinations. This work examines the impact of observational biases and intrinsic stellar properties on Cepheid distance estimates, focusing particularly on the effects of reddening and metallicity. Utilizing a period-luminosity relationship calibrated against spectroscopic data, we quantify the systematic offsets observed across a sample of Cepheids. The results indicate that uncertainties stemming from unresolved interstellar reddening and variations in metallicity contribute significantly to distance measurement errors, ultimately restricting the precision achievable through solely relying on Gaia EDR3 parallaxes for extragalactic distance calibrations. Further refinements incorporating independent distance indicators are required to mitigate these effects.
