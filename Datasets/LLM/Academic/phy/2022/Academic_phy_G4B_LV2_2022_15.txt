**Abstract**

Recent advancements in lithium-ion battery technology necessitate exploration of novel anode materials exhibiting enhanced electrochemical performance. This study investigates the efficacy of a cation-deficient cerium niobium octaoxide (CeNb3O9) perovskite as a promising anode material, reporting on its performance within a lithium-ion battery context. Characterization utilizing X-ray diffraction revealed the presence of significant cation deficiency, concurrently fostering an intricate atomic short-range order (ASRO) structure. This ASRO, hypothesized to facilitate lithium-ion diffusion pathways, directly correlates with the observed rapid charge acceptance and sustained cycling stability. 

Electrochemical testing demonstrated a notable rate capacity, achieving [Insert specific rate capacity value here – e.g., 850 mAh/g at 5C] without significant capacity fade over [Insert specific number of cycles here – e.g., 200] cycles.  The observed improvements are attributed to the enhanced ionic conductivity promoted by the ASRO. These findings suggest that strategically engineered cation deficiencies within perovskite structures can represent a viable strategy for improving lithium-ion battery anode performance. Further research will focus on optimizing the defect concentration and correlating ASRO characteristics with electrochemical properties.
