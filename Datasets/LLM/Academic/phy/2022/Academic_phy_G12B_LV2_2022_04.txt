**Abstract:**

Motivated by the persistent challenges in reconciling the Standard Model of particle physics with quantum gravity, we explore a novel framework predicting the emergence of a mesoscopic extra dimension. This investigation leverages insights from the Swampland program, specifically focusing on constraints derived from effective field theory considerations and the expectation of non-trivial string theory UV completions [1, 2]. We propose that a dynamically generated, compact extra dimension, residing at an energy scale accessible to current and near-future experiments, can provide a compelling solution to several outstanding puzzles.

Our model predicts the existence of sterile neutrinos, naturally arising as Kaluza-Klein modes associated with the new geometry. The mass spectrum of these sterile neutrinos is sensitive to the compactification scale and the geometry of the extra dimension, offering testable predictions for neutrino oscillation experiments [3]. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the observed Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev) can be consistently generated within this framework, exhibiting a dependence on the extra-dimensional structure and potentially alleviating the hierarchy problem [4].  The resulting phenomenology suggests a distinct signature involving deviations from Standard Model predictions in both neutrino physics and electroweak precision measurements. We outline a pathway to experimentally probe this scenario, emphasizing the potential for future searches at high-luminosity colliders and dedicated neutrino detectors. This work offers a concrete example of how quantum gravity considerations, mediated through the Swampland, can inform and constrain models beyond the Standard Model, providing new avenues for connecting fundamental physics with observable phenomena.

**Key improvements and considerations:**

*   **Swampland Focus:** Explicitly mentions the Swampland program and its relevance.
*   **Mechanism Detail:** Hints at the mechanism (Kaluza-Klein modes) rather than just stating "sterile neutrinos exist."
*   **Testability:** Emphasizes the testable predictions and experimental avenues.
*   **Hierarchy Problem:** Briefly touches upon the hierarchy problem to provide context.
*   **Formal Language:** Uses precise and formal language common in physics abstracts.
