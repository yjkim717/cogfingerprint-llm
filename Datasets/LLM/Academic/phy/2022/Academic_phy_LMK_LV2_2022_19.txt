Title: Metasurface-Enabled Quantum Entanglement through Spontaneous Parametric Down-Conversion

Abstract:
The generation of spatially entangled photon pairs is a crucial aspect of quantum optics, with significant implications for the development of miniaturized quantum devices. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of lithium niobate metasurfaces in producing entangled photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). By carefully designing the metasurface to optimize the nonlinear optical response, we achieve efficient SPDC and subsequent generation of spatially entangled photon pairs. Our results show that the metasurface platform can be tailored to control the entanglement properties of the generated photons, paving the way for the development of compact, on-chip quantum devices. The integration of metasurfaces with quantum optics opens new avenues for the miniaturization of quantum technologies, enabling the creation of complex quantum systems with enhanced functionality and reduced footprint.
