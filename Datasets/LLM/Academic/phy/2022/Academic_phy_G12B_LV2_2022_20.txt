**Abstract**

The origin of neutrino masses remains a significant challenge in particle physics, motivating exploration of extensions to the Standard Model (SM). This work investigates a novel framework for generating neutrino masses leveraging generalized symmetry structures and incorporating the potential experimental signatures of beyond-the-SM (BSM) physics. Specifically, we propose a mechanism wherein neutrino mass generation is intimately linked to the spontaneous breaking of generalized symmetries, mediated by the exchange of Z' bosons.  A key feature of our model is the explicit incorporation of lepton family differences, manifested through non-abelian horizontal lepton symmetries. This symmetry architecture allows for the generation of distinct neutrino mass patterns and mixing angles consistent with current experimental constraints.  The resulting low-energy phenomenology predicts the existence of Z' bosons, whose properties are directly tied to the symmetry breaking scale and the structure of the horizontal flavor group.  We examine the theoretical consistency of the model and discuss potential avenues for experimental verification, focusing on collider searches for Z' bosons and precision measurements of neutrino oscillation parameters.  This approach provides a compelling avenue for connecting neutrino mass generation to testable predictions within BSM physics, offering a potential pathway towards resolving the puzzle of neutrino masses and exploring the landscape of flavor physics.
