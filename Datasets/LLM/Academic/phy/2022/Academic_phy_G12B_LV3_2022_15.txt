**Abstract**

The pursuit of high-performance lithium-ion batteries necessitates the exploration of novel electrode materials exhibiting both rapid charge-discharge kinetics and prolonged cycling stability. This study investigates the electrochemical behavior of a cation-deficient perovskite, CeNb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. Our findings reveal exceptional high-rate capability and extended cycle life, surpassing conventional perovskite-based electrodes. We attribute this enhanced performance to the unique atomic short-range order observed within the CeNb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub> structure, facilitating efficient lithium-ion diffusion. Furthermore, the materialâ€™s inherent structural characteristics promote the formation of interconnected three-dimensional conduction pathways, minimizing interfacial resistance and enabling robust electron transport. These combined features contribute to the observed superior electrochemical properties, suggesting CeNb<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub> as a promising candidate for next-generation, fast-charging, long-life lithium-ion battery technologies.
