In this 2022 theoretical study, we advance the framework of relational quantum mechanics (RQM) by introducing a foundational postulate on the physical embodiment of information. We posit that for an observer's quantum state attribution to constitute a factual "quantum event," the associated information must be instantiated within a physical memory system, subject to universal consistency constraints. This principle of information physicality directly addresses the challenge of intersubjective agreement, a long-standing conceptual difficulty in RYM. We demonstrate the operational power of this refined framework by applying it to the Frauchiger-Renner thought experiment, a paradigmatic scenario probing the consistency of quantum narratives across different observers. Our analysis shows that by demanding that all information be physically encoded and accessible, the apparent contradictions within the experiment are resolved. The model ensures that observers' accounts remain mutually consistent without abandoning the core relational tenet that quantum states are not absolute but are defined relative to an observer. This work establishes a more robust ontological footing for RQM, bridging the gap between its subjective character and the objective reality of recorded measurement outcomes.
