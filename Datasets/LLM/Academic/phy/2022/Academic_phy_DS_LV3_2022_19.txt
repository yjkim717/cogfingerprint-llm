In recent years, the integration of nanophotonic platforms with quantum optical processes has emerged as a pivotal strategy for advancing compact quantum technologies. This study presents a monolithic lithium niobate metasurface engineered to generate spatially entangled photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion. By leveraging subwavelength resonant unit cells, the metasurface facilitates pronounced field enhancement and quasi-phase-matching, circumventing traditional limitations of bulk nonlinear crystals. Experimental characterization confirms a 450-fold enhancement in photon-pair generation rates relative to unpatterned films, while quantum state tomography verifies the high-purity spatial entanglement of the output biphotons. These results underscore the potential of metasurface architectures to serve as highly efficient, ultra-compact sources for quantum information science, enabling applications in high-dimensional quantum cryptography and on-chip integrated photonics. The demonstrated platform marks a significant departure from conventional systems, offering a scalable pathway toward miniaturized quantum devices with tailored entanglement properties.
