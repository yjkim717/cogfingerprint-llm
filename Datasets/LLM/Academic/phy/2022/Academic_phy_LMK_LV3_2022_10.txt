"Unraveling the Impact of Nanoscale pH on Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: A Stochastic Simulation Approach"

The electrochemical reduction of CO2 is a promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion, yet its efficacy is hindered by the durability concerns of solar CO2 conversion devices. A critical factor influencing this durability is the pH of neat water at the nanoscopic scale, which remains poorly understood. In this study, we employ a Rexpon force field-based stochastic simulation framework to investigate the pH of neat water at the nanoscale. Our simulations reveal significant deviations from the expected bulk pH values, underscoring the importance of nanoscale pH in electrochemical CO2 reduction.

By analyzing the spatial distribution of hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions at the nanoscopic scale, we demonstrate that the pH of neat water exhibits substantial fluctuations, which can be attributed to the inherent stochasticity of ion dynamics. Our findings indicate that these fluctuations can significantly impact the local reaction environment, influencing the CO2 reduction reaction kinetics and product selectivity.

The insights garnered from this study have important implications for the design and optimization of solar CO2 conversion devices. By accounting for the nanoscale pH effects, device engineers can develop more robust and efficient CO2 reduction systems. Our research contributes to the ongoing efforts to improve the durability and performance of electrochemical CO2 reduction technologies, ultimately advancing the transition to a low-carbon energy paradigm. As of 2022, this work represents a crucial step forward in understanding the complex interplay between nanoscale pH and electrochemical CO2 reduction, paving the way for further innovations in this field.
