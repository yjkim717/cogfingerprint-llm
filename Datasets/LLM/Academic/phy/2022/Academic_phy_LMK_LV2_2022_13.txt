Title: Thermodynamic Limitations on Quantum Computing: Implications of the Third Law on Qubit Fidelity

Abstract:

The scalability of quantum computing architectures is predicated on maintaining high-fidelity qubit operations. However, the third law of thermodynamics imposes fundamental constraints on the achievable fidelity of quantum circuits, particularly when considering the preparation of qubits in mixed states. As quantum computers approach the thermodynamic limit, the entropy of the qubit environment becomes a significant factor in determining the overall fidelity of quantum computations. In this work, we examine the interplay between the third law of thermodynamics and the fidelity requirements for large-scale quantum computing. By analyzing the thermodynamic costs associated with preparing and manipulating qubits, we demonstrate that the third law imposes a fundamental limit on the achievable fidelity of quantum circuits. Our results have significant implications for the design of quantum computing architectures and the development of strategies for mitigating thermodynamic constraints on qubit fidelity.
