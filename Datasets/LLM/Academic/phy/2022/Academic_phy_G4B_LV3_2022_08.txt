**Abstract**

Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) confronts persistent challenges regarding the interpretation of quantum events and the establishment of intersubjective consensus. This work investigates a critical tension within RQM, specifically concerning the ontological status of observer information. We introduce a novel postulate positing the physical accessibility of observer-derived information, a concept central to information physicality. Grounded in considerations arising from the Frauchiger-Renner experiment and its implications for entanglement, this postulate seeks to circumvent established objections to RQM’s relational ontology.  By asserting a direct physical manifestation of observer influence, we aim to provide a more robust framework for understanding past quantum states.  Further, this framework offers a potential pathway towards resolving interpretive discrepancies and fostering a more unified understanding of quantum reality, moving beyond purely subjective interpretations.  The implications for foundational physics and the measurement problem are discussed.
