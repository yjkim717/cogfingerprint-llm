Title: Enhancing Asymptotic Symmetry Algebra: Logarithmic Supertranslations and Lorentz Charges

Abstract:
In the pursuit of resolving the long-standing issue of supertranslation ambiguities in the definition of angular momentum, we extend the BMS(4) group by incorporating logarithmic supertranslations. This augmentation enables the establishment of a Hamiltonian formalism that accommodates an asymptotic symmetry algebra, wherein the Lorentz charges are rendered supertranslation-invariant. By doing so, we provide a novel framework for describing the asymptotic behavior of gravitational systems. Our construction involves a careful analysis of the logarithmic supertranslation generators and their interplay with the BMS(4) algebra, leading to a redefinition of the Lorentz charges that is free from supertranslation-related ambiguities. This development has significant implications for our understanding of conserved quantities in asymptotically flat spacetimes. The resulting formalism offers a promising avenue for addressing the challenges associated with defining angular momentum in a supertranslation-invariant manner, thereby advancing our comprehension of gravitational physics.
