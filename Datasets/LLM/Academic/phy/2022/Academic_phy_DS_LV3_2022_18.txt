This study presents a novel framework for synthesizing structured space-time wave packets through the integration of dielectric metasurfaces within a 4f Fourier transform configuration. By leveraging the spatiotemporal control afforded by metasurface-enabled Fourier optics, we demonstrate arbitrary manipulation of ultrafast optical pulses across both spatial and temporal domains. Our experimental implementation generates complex wave packets with customized group velocities and dispersion profiles, overcoming fundamental limitations of conventional pulse-shaping techniques. The methodology enables precise engineering of spectral-phase relationships while maintaining femtosecond temporal resolution, validated through interferometric characterization. These advances establish a versatile platform for applications requiring spatiotemporally sculpted light, including quantum state manipulation, nonlinear microscopy, and terahertz-bandwidth optical communications. This work bridges nanophotonics and ultrafast optics, offering new paradigms for controlling light-matter interactions at extreme temporal and spatial scales.
