**Abstract**

This work presents a novel approach to simulating astrophysical phenomena utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence. We detail a methodology for constructing a dynamically evolving star within an asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, achieved through controlled manipulation of a source term within a dual Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Specifically, introducing a localized, scalar field perturbation in the QFT generates a corresponding gravitational distortion within the bulk AdS geometry, effectively mimicking stellar formation and orbital dynamics.  The observed stellar motion – parameterized by orbital radius and velocity – serves as a direct probe of the bulk geometry.  Crucially, this technique circumvents the computational challenges inherent in directly simulating relativistic gravity, offering a valuable tool for investigating star formation processes in extreme environments.  Further investigation will explore the influence of varying source characteristics on the resulting bulk spacetime, potentially revealing insights into the relationship between quantum field theory and asymptotically AdS spacetime curvature.  Preliminary results suggest a strong correlation between QFT source parameters and observed stellar trajectories, validating the efficacy of this approach.
