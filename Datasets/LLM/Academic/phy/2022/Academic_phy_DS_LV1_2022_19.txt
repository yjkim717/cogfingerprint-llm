**Abstract**

The miniaturization of quantum optical sources onto subwavelength platforms is a pivotal challenge for integrated photonic technologies. This work reports the experimental realization of spatially entangled photon pair generation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) from a monolithic lithium niobate (LN) metasurface. By engineering the meta-atoms to support pronounced Mie-type resonances, we achieve a significant 450-fold enhancement in the SPDC efficiency compared to an unpatterned LN thin film of equivalent thickness. Furthermore, we employ a spatially resolved coincidence measurement to verify the presence of high-dimensional entanglement, confirming the generation of multiple orthogonal spatial mode pairs. Our findings establish nonlinear dielectric metasurfaces as a compact and efficient platform for on-chip quantum state engineering, opening avenues for advanced quantum imaging and high-dimensional quantum information processing.
