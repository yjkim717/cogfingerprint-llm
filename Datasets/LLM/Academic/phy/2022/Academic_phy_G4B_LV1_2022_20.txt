**Abstract**

The persistent puzzle of neutrino masses and mixing necessitates exploring novel theoretical frameworks beyond the Standard Model. This work investigates a mechanism wherein noninvertible symmetries, specifically within the context of Z’ boson mediated theories, provide a compelling pathway to generate neutrino mass eigenstates. We posit that the presence of a noninvertible symmetry – characterized by a lack of invertible representations – fundamentally alters the gauge structure, inducing observable quantum gauge theory effects. These effects manifest as suppressed contributions to the neutrino mass matrix, effectively decoupling problematic ultraviolet sensitivities associated with conventional symmetry breaking.  Crucially, the associated Z’ boson remains a viable dynamical element, playing a role in stabilizing the symmetry and mediating the mass generation.  Our analysis suggests that the interplay between noninvertibility, leptonic symmetries, and Z’ boson interactions offers a potentially renormalizable approach to addressing the neutrino mass hierarchy, demanding further investigation into its phenomenological implications and testability within future experiments.
