Title: Constructing Asymptotically AdS Spacetimes with Dynamical Objects via Holographic Correspondence

Abstract:
We propose a novel method to generate asymptotically AdS spacetimes containing dynamical objects, leveraging the AdS/CFT correspondence. By mapping a scalar field theory on the boundary to a bulk geometry, we construct a spacetime with a star orbiting in AdS spacetime. Utilizing the holographic correspondence, we derive the bulk metric and scalar field configuration corresponding to a strongly coupled quantum field theory on the boundary, featuring a localized energy density representing the star. Our construction relies on a perturbative expansion of the bulk fields around the AdS background, ensuring asymptotic AdSness. The resulting spacetime provides a gravity dual to a QFT with a dynamically evolving energy density, enabling the study of strongly coupled phenomena in a gravitational context. This work advances our understanding of holography in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. (2022)
