**Abstract:**

We investigate correlation functions within the context of extremal, asymptotically anti-de Sitter black holes possessing *n*=2 supercharges.  These systems offer a unique arena for exploring strongly coupled quantum field theories due to their intimate connection to supersymmetric gauge theories via the AdS/CFT correspondence.  A key challenge in such investigations is the presence of time dependence arising from the black hole’s dynamics. This work presents a novel analytical framework demonstrating the emergence of time-independent correlation functions in a specific class of these black hole solutions.  We derive explicit expressions for these functions, revealing a direct dependence on the underlying bulk gravitational parameters – specifically, the black hole mass and angular momentum. Our approach leverages the enhanced supersymmetry to impose stringent constraints on the correlator structure, effectively decoupling the time evolution.  The implications of this time independence are discussed in relation to holographic duality, suggesting a potential avenue for extracting non-perturbative information about strongly coupled field theories without relying on explicit time evolution. This provides a significant step forward in leveraging black hole physics to probe regimes inaccessible by conventional perturbative techniques.
