In this work, we demonstrate how generalized global symmetries, specifically noninvertible symmetries arising in extended gauge theories, provide a novel framework for neutrino mass generation. By embedding the U(1)ₗᵢ₋ₗₜ gauge symmetry within an SU(3)ₕ horizontal symmetry structure, we establish a robust protection mechanism for neutrino masses against radiative corrections. Crucially, this framework enables neutrino mass generation exclusively through nonperturbative quantum effects mediated by magnetic monopoles, eliminating the conventional requirement for additional Higgs fields or imposed symmetries. The resulting z′ bosons associated with the lepton family difference symmetry acquire distinctive phenomenological signatures testable at collider experiments. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between noninvertible symmetries and topological defects offers a minimal and theoretically compelling explanation for the smallness of neutrino masses while maintaining consistency with cosmological constraints. This approach fundamentally recontextualizes neutrino mass generation within the broader landscape of generalized symmetry principles in quantum field theory.
