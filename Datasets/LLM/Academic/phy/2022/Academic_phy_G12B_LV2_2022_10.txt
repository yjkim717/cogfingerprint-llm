**Abstract**

The performance of nanoscale electrochemical devices, particularly those employing carbon dioxide reduction (CO₂RR), is increasingly recognized to be significantly influenced by the local chemical environment. This study investigates the dynamic behavior of pH within confined aqueous nanobubbles, employing a combined quantum mechanics/molecular dynamics (QM/MD) and stochastic simulation approach to elucidate the impact of pH fluctuations on ion pair generation and subsequent reaction pathways relevant to CO₂RR.  We utilize a reactive exponential (rexpon) force field within the MD simulations to accurately model bond formation and breakage events, allowing for the observation of spontaneous ion pair formation – a critical initial step in many electrocatalytic processes.

Classical MD simulations, while computationally efficient, often struggle to capture the subtle proton transfer events that dictate pH dynamics at the nanoscale.  Therefore, we integrate QM/MD calculations to provide accurate potential energy surfaces for key protonation/deprotonation reactions within the water pool. These QM/MD results are then incorporated into a coarse-grained stochastic simulation framework, enabling the exploration of longer timescales and larger system sizes inaccessible to purely QM/MD methods.  The stochastic simulations account for the inherent thermal fluctuations and the spatially-dependent nature of water pools, providing a more realistic representation of the electrochemical environment.

Our simulations reveal a significant degree of pH stochasticity within the nanoscale water pools, with fluctuations exceeding those typically observed in bulk aqueous solutions.  This heightened variability is attributed to the restricted diffusion and enhanced surface interactions within the confined geometry.  We demonstrate a direct correlation between pH fluctuations and the probability of generating specific ion pairs (e.g., [HCO₃⁻][H⁺]), influencing the selectivity of CO₂RR pathways. Preliminary results suggest that controlled manipulation of the water pool environment, through strategies such as surface functionalization, could offer a pathway for tuning the catalytic activity and product selectivity in CO₂RR devices.  Further work will focus on incorporating explicit electrode and electrolyte effects to achieve a more comprehensive model of nanoscale electrochemical interfaces.
