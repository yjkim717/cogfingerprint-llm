**Abstract**

The development of high-performance anodes is critical for advancing fast-charging lithium-ion batteries. While perovskite oxides offer a promising structural platform, their electrochemical performance is often limited by intrinsic transport kinetics and structural degradation. This work demonstrates that a cation-deficient perovskite anode exhibits exceptional fast-charging capability and remarkable long-term cycling stability. We reveal that the deliberate introduction of cation vacancies induces the formation of a specific atomic short-range order within the crystalline lattice. This unique local structural configuration, characterized by advanced synchrotron X-ray pair distribution function analysis, serves to modulate the electronic band structure, thereby enhancing intrinsic electronic conductivity. Concurrently, the short-range order creates a continuous and robust pathway for rapid lithium-ion diffusion, significantly reducing charge-transfer resistance. The combined effect of these properties enables the anode to accommodate high current densities without substantial capacity fade or structural pulverization. These findings, established in 2022, establish cation-deficient perovskites with tailored short-range order as a new paradigm for designing durable, high-power-density energy storage materials, providing a fundamental structural strategy beyond conventional crystallographic engineering.
