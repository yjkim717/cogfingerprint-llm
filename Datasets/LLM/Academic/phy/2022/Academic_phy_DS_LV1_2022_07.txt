We present a comprehensive comparison between numerical relativity (NR) simulations of black hole scattering and analytical predictions from the post-Minkowskian (PM) framework. By reformulating the conservative dynamics within the Effective-One-Body (EOB) formalism, we map the PM results into a gauge-invariant radial potential. Our analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of the full, non-perturbative radiation-reaction potential, derived from the dissipative sector, is crucial for achieving high-precision agreement with NR data. This synthesis of the PM-EOB map with self-force-informed potentials provides a robust model for the relativistic two-body problem, accurately capturing the transition from quasi-elliptic motion to plunge and merger, and validating the synergy between perturbative and non-perturbative methods in classical gravity.
