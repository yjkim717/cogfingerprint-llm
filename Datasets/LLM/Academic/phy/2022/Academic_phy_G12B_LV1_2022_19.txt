**Abstract**

The efficient generation of spatially entangled photon pairs is a critical requirement for advanced quantum technologies, including quantum imaging, quantum communication, and quantum sensing. While spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) remains a dominant source, achieving high generation rates coupled with precise spatial control remains a challenge. This work presents a novel approach leveraging lithium niobate (LiNbO₃) metasurfaces to substantially enhance the generation of spatially antibunched photon pairs.  We demonstrate a metasurface design facilitating efficient second-harmonic generation and subsequent SPDC, resulting in a significant increase in the heralded photon-pair rate compared to traditional bulk crystal configurations. The engineered metasurface geometry allows for precise control over the spatial mode of the generated photons, creating robust spatial entanglement characterized by the observation of antibunching in the coincidence counts.  Our findings highlight the potential of integrated photonic devices based on LiNbO₃ metasurfaces for compact and high-performance quantum light sources.  This architecture offers a pathway towards miniaturized and scalable quantum systems, paving the way for more practical implementations of entanglement-based quantum protocols. Further optimization of the metasurface design and exploration of different pump wavelengths are anticipated to yield even greater improvements in photon-pair generation efficiency.
