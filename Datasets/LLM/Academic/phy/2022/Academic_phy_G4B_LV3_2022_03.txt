**Abstract**

This work presents a novel investigation into the correlation functions within the context of extremal supersymmetric black holes, leveraging an exact solution derived from supergravity.  Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for both two-point and *n*-point correlators, providing a foundational framework for understanding quantum entanglement in these extreme spacetime geometries.  The supersymmetric nature of the black holes allows for a remarkably simplified treatment, revealing inherent time independence within the correlator formalism.  However, we explicitly acknowledge and characterize the deviation from this symmetry in the absence of supersymmetry, demonstrating a time-dependent behavior arising from the black hole’s dynamics.  These results offer crucial insights into the holographic duality and the emergent spacetime properties of black holes, contributing to a deeper comprehension of quantum gravity effects. Further research will explore the implications of these correlators for information retrieval and the thermodynamics of these systems.
