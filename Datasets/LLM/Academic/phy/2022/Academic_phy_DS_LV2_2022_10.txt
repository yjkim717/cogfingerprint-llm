**Abstract**

The operational efficiency and longevity of electrochemical devices for CO₂ conversion are critically limited by interfacial degradation processes, which are often governed by local chemical conditions that deviate significantly from bulk properties. A paramount yet poorly understood parameter in this context is the local pH at the electrode-electrolyte interface, particularly within nanoconfined water environments where the discrete nature of ions and solvent molecules becomes dominant. This study employs a multi-scale computational framework to quantitatively characterize the statistics of nanoscopic pH fluctuations and their impact on interfacial stability. We utilize molecular dynamics (MD) simulations parameterized with the ReaxPN reactive force field, which explicitly describes bond formation and breaking, to model the dynamic structure of water and hydronium/hydroxide ions within a nanoscale water pool adjacent to a model electrocatalyst surface. The ReaxPN framework provides a foundational understanding of the free energy landscapes and coordination geometries governing ion speciation.

To access the longer timescales necessary for robust statistical analysis of rare proton transfer and fluctuation events, we augment the MD approach with advanced stochastic simulations, specifically employing a Gillespie-type kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. This hybrid methodology allows us to propagate the system state based on transition rates derived from the MD-derived energetics, efficiently sampling the full distribution of local pH states. Our results reveal that the pH in nanoconfined electrochemical environments is not a static value but a spatially and temporally fluctuating field. We demonstrate that the magnitude of these fluctuations scales inversely with the effective water volume, leading to transient, spontaneous regions of extreme acidity or basicity even under nominally neutral bulk conditions. These stochastic excursions can directly catalyze deleterious side-reactions, such as catalyst corrosion or unwanted precipitation, that are not predicted by mean-field models. The insights derived from this work establish a fundamental physics-based link between nanoscale water ion dynamics and macroscopic device degradation, providing new design principles for enhancing the durability of next-generation CO₂ conversion technologies through the management of interfacial fluctuation statistics.
