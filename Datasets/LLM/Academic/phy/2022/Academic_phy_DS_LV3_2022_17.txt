In 2022, the field of electromagnetic metasurfaces witnessed significant theoretical and experimental progress in harnessing geometric phase phenomena for subwavelength optical control. This review systematically examines the evolution from classical Pancharatnam-Berry phase implementations to generalized geometric phase frameworks in structured photonic interfaces. We demonstrate how precisely engineered subwavelength structures enable full 2Ï€ phase modulation through geometric phase manipulation, surpassing conventional propagation phase limitations. The analysis highlights three transformative directions: continuously shaped metasurfaces achieving unprecedented wavefront engineering, composite geometric-phase architectures enabling multifunctional operation, and nonlinear geometric phase components facilitating frequency conversion processes. These advances establish geometric phase metasurfaces as a versatile platform for compact photonic systems, with particular implications for imaging, sensing, and quantum optical applications where precise phase control at subwavelength scales is paramount.
