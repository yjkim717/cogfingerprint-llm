**Abstract**

The calibration of Cepheid period-luminosity (PL) relations, a cornerstone of the extragalactic distance ladder, has entered a transformative phase with the advent of high-precision astrometry from Gaia's Early Data Release 3 (EDR3). This investigation leverages the improved parallax measurements for Galactic Cepheids to critically reassess systematic uncertainties inherent in distance calibrations. Our analysis reveals a fundamental error floor of approximately 3%, a limitation predominantly imposed by residual parallax systematics in the Gaia EDR3 dataset. Consequently, this intrinsic uncertainty propagates through the distance ladder, establishing a theoretical precision limit of ~1% for extragalactic distances derived from Cepheid variables. Furthermore, we quantify the non-negligible contribution of metallicity effects on PL relations, which introduces an additional layer of systematic bias that must be accounted for in high-fidelity cosmological studies. These findings, established in the context of 2022, underscore that while Gaia EDR3 provides unparalleled calibration power, the ultimate precision of the Hubble Constant remains constrained by these persistent astrophysical and instrumental systematics, demanding refined models and future data releases for further progress.
