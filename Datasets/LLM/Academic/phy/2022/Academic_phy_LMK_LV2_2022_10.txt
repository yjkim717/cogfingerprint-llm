Title: Investigating the pH of Neat Water at the Nanoscopic Scale: A Stochastic Simulation Approach

Abstract:

The pH of water at the nanoscopic scale has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its implications for understanding various electrochemical and biochemical processes occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface. In this study, we employ a combination of theoretical calculations and stochastic simulations to investigate the pH of neat water pools at the nanoscopic scale. Utilizing the ReaxFF force field, our simulations capture the intricate dynamics of water molecules and ions, enabling a nuanced understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing pH fluctuations. Our results indicate that the pH of neat water at the nanoscopic scale deviates significantly from the bulk value, exhibiting a pronounced dependence on the size of the water pool. The stochastic simulations reveal that this deviation arises from the enhanced fluctuations in the concentration of hydronium and hydroxide ions at the interface. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the ReaxFF force field accurately captures the complex chemistry of water, allowing for a reliable prediction of the pH at the nanoscopic scale. The findings of this study have important implications for understanding various electrochemical and biochemical processes occurring at the electrode-electrolyte interface, and highlight the need for a revised understanding of pH at the nanoscopic scale. Our work contributes to the ongoing discussion on the pH of water at the nanoscale, providing a comprehensive framework for future investigations in this field. (2022)
