**Abstract**

In 2022, investigations into black hole thermodynamics continue to explore connections between geometry and thermodynamics. This work presents a new perspective, framing black hole solutions as thermodynamic defects within the broader parameter space governing gravitational systems. We demonstrate a compelling correlation between the topological properties of these solutions, specifically quantified through winding numbers, and their thermodynamic stability. Our analysis reveals a universal topological number, intrinsically linked to the asymptotic temperature behavior of the black hole, offering a novel lens through which to probe quantum gravity effects. This approach potentially provides insights into the emergence of spacetime and the fundamental stability of black hole solutions.
