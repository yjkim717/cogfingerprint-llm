**Abstract**

We report on a significant advancement in the understanding of scattering amplitudes within the framework of superstring theory. This work introduces a new, compact expression for partial wave coefficients, derived through a meticulous analysis of superstring interactions. Crucially, this formulation facilitates a direct and unambiguous demonstration of unitarity for these amplitudes. Prior attempts to establish unitarity in string theory often relied on indirect arguments or were restricted to specific regimes. Our approach, leveraging the novel partial wave representation, provides a general proof applicable to superstring theories in dimensions up to D â‰¤ 6.  This result represents a substantial step towards a more complete non-perturbative definition of string theory and offers valuable insights into the consistency of quantum gravity. The implications extend to the study of anomaly cancellation and the exploration of potential connections between string theory and other areas of theoretical physics, representing a timely contribution given the ongoing efforts to refine our understanding of fundamental interactions within the landscape of string phenomenology.
