Title: Unveiling the Dark Dimension: Implications for Sterile Neutrinos and the Higgs vev from the Swampland Program

Abstract:
Recent advancements in the Swampland program have led to the prediction of a light tower of states and a unique extra mesoscopic dimension, herein referred to as the Dark Dimension. Leveraging observational data and theoretical constraints from quantum gravity, we explore the phenomenological implications of this framework. Notably, the existence of sterile neutrinos is naturally accommodated within this setup, offering a novel explanation for neutrino mass generation. Furthermore, the Dark Dimension scenario imposes a non-trivial constraint on the Higgs vacuum expectation value (vev), potentially resolving the hierarchy problem. Our analysis, grounded in the Swampland conjectures, provides a compelling narrative for the observed neutrino masses and the Higgs vev, underscoring the intricate interplay between quantum gravity, particle phenomenology, and the Dark Dimension. This work, informed by 2022 observational data, highlights the predictive power of the Swampland program in constraining beyond Standard Model physics.
