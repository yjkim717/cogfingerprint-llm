**Abstract**

Recent developments within the Swampland program offer a novel framework for addressing fundamental challenges in particle physics and cosmology. This work explores a potential realization of this program, proposing the existence of an additional, mesoscopic dimension characterized by massless fermions.  The theoretical impetus for this dimension stems from a refined application of Swampland constraints, specifically concerning the Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV) and its implications for effective field theory descriptions of gravity. 

We argue that the stabilization of this extra dimension necessitates the presence of sterile neutrinos, offering a mechanism for generating small neutrino masses consistent with current experimental observations. Furthermore, the scale of this dark dimension is directly linked to the observed neutrino mass hierarchy and provides a predictive model for the mass scale of associated sterile neutrino species. This framework represents a significant departure from conventional models, suggesting a deeper, multi-dimensional structure underlying the Standard Model.  

Future research will focus on quantifying the phenomenological consequences of this model, including potential observational signatures and its compatibility with precision electroweak measurements.  The proposed connection between quantum gravity, neutrino physics, and dark dimension geometry warrants further investigation as a potential pathway toward a more complete theory of the universe.
