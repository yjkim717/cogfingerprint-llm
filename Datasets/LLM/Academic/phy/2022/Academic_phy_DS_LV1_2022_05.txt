**Abstract**

The advent of Gaia's Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) has provided an unprecedented opportunity to refine the calibration of the Cepheid period-luminosity (P-L) relation, a cornerstone of the extragalactic distance ladder. This study critically assesses the systematic limitations within EDR3 parallax data that impede the achievement of sub-1% precision in distance measurements to nearby Galactic Cepheids. We identify and quantify two dominant sources of uncertainty. First, residual parallax zero-point offsets, which exhibit spatial and magnitude-dependent variations, introduce significant biases in the derived absolute magnitudes. Second, we investigate the metallicity dependence of the P-L relation, finding that the intrinsic dispersion is not fully accounted for by photometric metallicity estimates alone. Our analysis demonstrates that the combined effect of these systematics currently precludes the high-fidelity calibration required to constrain the Hubble constant below the 1% level. We conclude that a comprehensive forward-modeling approach, incorporating improved parallax correction maps and a multi-wavelength analysis to disentangle metallicity effects, is a prerequisite for leveraging future Gaia data releases to their full potential for fundamental cosmology.
