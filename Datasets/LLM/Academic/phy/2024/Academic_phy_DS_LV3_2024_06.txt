The 2024 Black Holes Inside and Out symposium addresses foundational challenges at the intersection of gravitational physics and quantum gravity. Recent theoretical advances probe the intricate dynamics of black hole evaporation, revealing profound implications for information conservation and the unitarity of quantum mechanics. This research rigorously examines black hole stability and entropy within the framework of general relativity, while also exploring extensions beyond it. A central theme is the development of novel observational and experimental tests to constrain competing quantum-gravitational models. By synthesizing insights from multiple theoretical paradigms—including string theory, loop quantum gravity, and semiclassical approximations—the conference aims to resolve long-standing paradoxes and chart a course toward a unified description of spacetime's quantum structure. These investigations are critical for advancing our understanding of fundamental physics in extreme gravitational regimes.
