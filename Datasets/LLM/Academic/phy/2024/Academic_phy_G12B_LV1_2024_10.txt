**Facet-Dependent Microkinetic Control of the Oxygen Evolution Reaction on Iridium Dioxide: A Quantum Mechanical Perspective**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a critical bottleneck in electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies. Iridium dioxide (IrO₂) exhibits exceptional catalytic activity for OER, yet the underlying mechanisms governing its performance remain incompletely understood. This work presents a combined experimental and theoretical investigation into the facet-dependent OER activity of IrO₂, employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the microkinetic pathways and redox processes that dictate catalytic efficiency. We synthesized and characterized IrO₂ nanocrystals exposing distinct crystallographic facets – (100), (110), and (111) – and assessed their OER performance through electrochemical measurements.  Computational analysis reveals significant variations in the adsorption energies of key OER intermediates (e.g., *oxo*, *hydroxo*, and *oxy*) across these facets, directly correlating with observed experimental differences in overpotential. A detailed microkinetic model, incorporating rate-limiting steps and transition state energies derived from DFT, demonstrates that the (110) facet exhibits the most favorable pathway due to a reduced energy barrier for the formation of the rate-determining adsorbed oxo species.  Our results highlight the crucial role of surface structure in controlling OER kinetics and suggest that facet engineering strategies offer a viable route to enhance IrO₂ catalyst performance.  Further, this study provides a robust quantum mechanical framework for understanding OER mechanisms on transition metal oxides, paving the way for the rational design of more efficient electrocatalysts.
