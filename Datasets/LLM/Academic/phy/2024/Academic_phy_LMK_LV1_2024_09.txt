Title: Assessing Predictive Performance of High-Dimensional Models through Data Space Validation via Sample Quantiles and Principal Axes

Abstract:
In the era of complex physical systems, high-dimensional models have become increasingly prevalent. Evaluating their predictive performance is crucial, yet challenging due to the curse of dimensionality. This study presents a novel methodology to assess the predictive accuracy of high-dimensional models by leveraging data space validation through sample quantiles and principal axes. By projecting high-dimensional data onto the principal axes of the sample quantiles, our approach facilitates a comparison between predicted and observed distributions. We employ a generative model to simulate data and compute sample quantiles, thereby enabling a robust validation framework. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated through its application to simulated datasets and real-world physical systems. Our results indicate that this approach provides a reliable and informative assessment of predictive performance, offering a valuable tool for model validation in high-dimensional spaces. (2024)
