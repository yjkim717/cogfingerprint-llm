Title: Revisiting Black Hole Evaporation in the Context of Semiclassical Gravity and Quantum Gravity Paradigms

Abstract:

The study of black holes has been a cornerstone in the quest to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics. As we approach the centenary of the inception of black hole physics, the intricacies of black hole evaporation remain a pivotal area of investigation. This paper revisits the phenomenon of black hole evaporation, juxtaposing the predictions of semiclassical gravity against the backdrop of various quantum gravity paradigms. By examining the Hawking radiation process through the lens of semiclassical gravity, we highlight the inherent limitations and paradoxes associated with this framework, particularly the information loss problem. We then explore how different approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum gravity and string theory, propose resolutions to these paradoxes by introducing novel structures at the Planck scale. Our analysis focuses on the implications of these quantum gravity models for the evaporation process, including potential modifications to the black hole entropy, temperature, and the nature of the remnants, if any. Furthermore, we discuss the observational prospects for distinguishing between these competing theories through the lens of future gravitational wave observations and potential signatures of quantum gravity effects in the black hole spectra. By synthesizing insights from semiclassical gravity and quantum gravity, this study aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of black hole physics and its role in the ongoing quest for a unified theory of quantum gravity.
