Title: Validation of High-Dimensional Models via Data Space Quantile Comparison

Abstract:

The increasing complexity of high-dimensional models necessitates rigorous validation techniques to ensure their accuracy and reliability. This study presents a novel methodology for assessing the validity of such models by comparing predicted and observed quantiles of observables in data space. By leveraging sample quantiles and principal axes, our approach provides a robust framework for evaluating model performance. Specifically, we utilize a generative model to simulate observables and compute their quantiles, which are then compared to empirical quantiles derived from observed data. The comparison is facilitated by projecting both predicted and observed quantiles onto the principal axes of the data, enabling a nuanced assessment of model fidelity. Our method offers a valuable tool for validating high-dimensional models, thereby enhancing confidence in their predictive capabilities. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated through its application to representative high-dimensional models, highlighting its potential to inform model refinement and improvement. (2024)
