**Abstract**

This work presents a novel approach to validating the predictive capabilities of high-dimensional models in particle physics, specifically focusing on the assessment of ensemble uncertainty. Utilizing sample quantiles derived from simulated datasets, we introduce a methodology predicated on comparing model-generated quantile distributions to observed empirical quantiles.  Dimensionality reduction, employing principal axes analysis, is implemented to mitigate the computational challenges associated with directly evaluating these high-dimensional models.  The efficacy of this technique is demonstrated through an application to a generative model simulating the distribution of cosmic ray muons.  By mapping model predictions onto a reduced data space, we achieve robust data space validation, providing a sensitive metric for discerning subtle deviations between theoretical forecasts and experimental observations.  This approach offers a valuable tool for scrutinizing complex physics models and informing experimental design strategies within the era of increasingly intricate simulations.
