**Abstract**

The increasing reliance on computationally intensive simulations in modern physics necessitates robust validation techniques for high-dimensional model predictions. This work introduces a novel approach leveraging sample quantile analysis for data space validation. We postulate that discrepancies between predicted and observed quantile distributions within the data’s intrinsic space provide a sensitive metric for assessing model fidelity. Specifically, we employ principal axis decomposition to identify dominant modes of variation in the data, correlating these principal axes with corresponding output variables from the high-dimensional model.  Deviation between predicted and observed quantile values along these principal axes indicates potential systematic biases. This method offers a non-parametric evaluation, mitigating the limitations of traditional error metrics.  Preliminary results, presented herein, demonstrate the efficacy of this technique in validating turbulence simulations, suggesting a pathway towards improved confidence in complex physics models by directly comparing predictive capabilities to empirical data distributions in 2024.
