Here is a formal academic-style abstract inspired by the given ideas:

"Relational Quantum Mechanics (RQM) reexamines the foundations of quantum physics, introducing a relational understanding that challenges traditional notions of objectivity. This paper assesses whether RQM's solipsistic undertones compromise science credibility, arguing that a nuanced relational approach can, in fact, reinforce the discipline's epistemological rigor (2024)."
