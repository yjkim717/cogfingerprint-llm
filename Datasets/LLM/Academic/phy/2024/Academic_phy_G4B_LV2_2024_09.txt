**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of high-dimensional modeling necessitates robust validation techniques, particularly when employing dimensionality reduction methods. This work introduces a novel approach for assessing the fidelity of these models, centered on the comparison of predicted and observed sample quantiles within the data space. We leverage sample quantiles – a statistically informative representation of data distribution – to establish a rigorous validation criterion.  Our methodology incorporates principal axes projection, a common dimensionality reduction technique, to facilitate this spatial comparison. 

Specifically, we formulate a metric evaluating the alignment between the quantile distributions generated by the high-dimensional model and those empirically observed in the reduced data space.  This approach provides a means to detect discrepancies introduced by dimensionality reduction, offering insight into potential model biases.  Preliminary investigations suggest this method offers improved sensitivity compared to traditional visualization-based validation, contributing a valuable tool for assessing the trustworthiness of complex, high-dimensional simulations and theoretical models within diverse physical systems. Further research will explore adaptive projection strategies and generalized quantile metrics.
