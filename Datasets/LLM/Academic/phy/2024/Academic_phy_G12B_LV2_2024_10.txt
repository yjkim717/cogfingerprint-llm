**Facet-Dependent Activity in Iridium Dioxide Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysis: A Grand Canonical Quantum Mechanical Perspective**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a critical bottleneck in sustainable energy technologies, demanding efficient and durable electrocatalysts. Iridium dioxide (IrO<sub>2</sub>) exhibits exceptional OER activity, yet the underlying mechanisms governing its performance across different crystallographic facets remain incompletely understood. This study presents a combined experimental and theoretical investigation elucidating the facet-dependent OER activity of IrO<sub>2</sub>. Through electrochemical measurements and advanced first-principles calculations employing grand canonical quantum mechanics (GCQM), we identify significant variations in OER kinetics and mechanistic pathways correlated with the (100), (110), and (111) facets.  GCQM enables a rigorous treatment of the complex electrochemical environment and allows for the accurate assessment of surface adsorbate binding energies and charge transfer processes. Our findings demonstrate that the (110) facet exhibits the highest OER activity, attributable to a favorable synergy between OOH<sup>*</sup> adsorption energetics and enhanced proton coupling pathways. Conversely, the (100) facet displays reduced activity due to a higher activation energy barrier for water oxidation. These results provide atomistic insights into the role of crystallographic orientation in dictating catalytic performance and offer a framework for rational catalyst design. Future work will focus on incorporating explicit solvent effects within the GCQM framework and exploring the influence of dopants and surface modifications on facet-specific OER activity to further optimize IrO<sub>2</sub> and related OER catalysts.
