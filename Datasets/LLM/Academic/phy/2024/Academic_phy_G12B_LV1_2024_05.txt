**Abstract**

Precise distance measurements are fundamental to resolving cosmological tensions within the Î›CDM framework. This study revisits the Cepheid and Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance scales, crucial anchors for the extragalactic distance ladder, with an emphasis on systematic uncertainties. We present updated comparisons of these distance indicators, incorporating refined photometric calibrations and addressing known metallicity dependencies. Utilizing a revised Wesenheit-Leavitt formulation, we explore the impact of varying metallicities on the derived distances, demonstrating a consistent sensitivity previously highlighted in earlier work. Numerical corrections to previously reported values are detailed, and new plots illustrating the agreement and discrepancies between Cepheid and TRGB distances are provided. Our analysis reinforces the robustness of the original conclusions regarding the influence of metallicity on Cepheid distance determinations, vital for accurate Hubble Constant estimations.
