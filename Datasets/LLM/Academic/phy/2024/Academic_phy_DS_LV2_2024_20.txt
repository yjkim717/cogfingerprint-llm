In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for generating keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter through conformal freeze-in within a strongly coupled conformal field theory (CFT) dark sector. The dark sector communicates with the Standard Model via a renormalizable neutrino portal interaction, inducing small active-sterile neutrino mixings. Crucially, the conformal symmetry of the dark sector, broken at a high scale, governs the non-thermal production of dark matter through freeze-in from Standard Model neutrino scattering. This framework simultaneously addresses the dark matter relic abundance and the origin of neutrino mass. We demonstrate that the specific scaling dimensions of CFT operators, combined with the portal coupling, naturally yield the correct dark matter density for a sterile neutrino in the keV mass range, consistent with structure formation constraints and observable in future X-ray line searches. This provides a unified, minimal, and testable paradigm linking conformal dynamics with two central puzzles of particle astrophysics.
