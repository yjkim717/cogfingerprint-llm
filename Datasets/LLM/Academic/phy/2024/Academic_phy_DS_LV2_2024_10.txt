This study elucidates the facet-dependent activity of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on IrOâ‚‚ electrocatalysts by integrating grand canonical quantum mechanical (GC-QM) simulations with experimental validation. We demonstrate that the intrinsic OER activity, measured via electrochemical analysis, is significantly higher on the (110) facet compared to the (101) and (100) surfaces. To deconvolute this phenomenon, we employed GC-QM to compute the surface Pourbaix stability diagrams and the free energy landscapes for the four-step OER mechanism. Our calculations reveal that the (110) facet stabilizes the *OOH intermediate more effectively, thereby reducing the thermodynamic overpotential. This atomic-scale insight was incorporated into a microkinetic model, which quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed activity trends. The model further identifies the potential-dependent transition in the rate-determining step from *O to *OOH formation as the key descriptor for facet performance. This work establishes a robust framework, bridging electronic structure calculations with surface redox kinetics, for the rational design of high-activity oxide electrocatalysts.
