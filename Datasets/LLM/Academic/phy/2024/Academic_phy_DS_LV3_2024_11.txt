In this theoretical investigation, we establish a novel quantum simulation framework wherein a one-dimensional chain of interacting Majorana fermions emulates quantum field theory phenomena in (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetimes. Our approach leverages the inherent non-locality of Majorana zero modes in topological superconductors to construct a scalable analog quantum simulator. Through exact diagonalization and tensor network methods, we demonstrate that precisely engineered spin-spin interactions within the Kitaev model directly correspond to quantum field dynamics in a spatially expanding Friedman-Robertson-Walker metric. The simulator successfully reproduces hallmark effects including cosmological particle production, where the effective expansion rate induces parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations, generating measurable particle pairs from vacuum. Furthermore, we quantify the emergent entanglement structure through bipartite entanglement entropy calculations, revealing lightcone-like propagation consistent with curved spacetime causal structure. Crucially, we identify a direct mapping between tunable spin coupling gradients and the Unruh effect, enabling experimental observation of thermal radiation from the perspective of accelerated observers through localized correlation measurements. This work provides a viable pathway for experimental verification of semi-classical gravity phenomena using existing superconducting qubit architectures, bridging condensed matter physics with fundamental questions in quantum gravity.
