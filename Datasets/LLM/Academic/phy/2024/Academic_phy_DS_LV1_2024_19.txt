**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum technologies necessitates the development of robust, miniaturized, and efficient sources of quantum light. While traditional bulk-optical components have enabled foundational demonstrations, their inherent scalability limitations present a significant bottleneck for integrated quantum photonic systems. This review critically assesses the recent paradigm shift towards employing flat optics, specifically dielectric metasurfaces, for the generation and manipulation of quantum states of light. We analyze advanced methodologies wherein metasurfaces, comprising subwavelength nanostructures, are engineered to directly interact with quantum emitters, enhancing their emission properties and facilitating the generation of entangled photon pairs through nonlinear processes such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion. The discussion extends to the precise wavefront shaping capabilities of these planar devices, which enable the on-chip generation of complex quantum states, including high-dimensional entanglement and vector-vortex beams. By consolidating multiple functionalities into a single, subwavelength-thick element, metasurface-based quantum light sources promise to underpin the next generation of compact, scalable, and high-performance quantum devices for applications in communications, computing, and metrology.
