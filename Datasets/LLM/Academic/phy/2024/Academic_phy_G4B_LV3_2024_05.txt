**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in distance measurement techniques, specifically utilizing Cepheid variables and Type Ia Supernovae (TRGB), necessitate continued scrutiny of systematic uncertainties. Freedman (2024) presents a critical erratum addressing numerical discrepancies within an earlier study examining these distance indicators. The revised analysis confirms a statistically robust, flat relationship between host galaxy metallicity and the Cepheid period-luminosity calibration, now supported by a refined regression model. These findings contribute to a more precise determination of extragalactic distances and highlight the importance of rigorous data validation in cosmological distance ladder approaches. Future research should explore the implications of this metallicity dependence for broader distance estimates and galaxy evolution models.
