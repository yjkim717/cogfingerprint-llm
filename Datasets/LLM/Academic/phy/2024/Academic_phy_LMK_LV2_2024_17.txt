Title: Enhanced Polarization Multiplexing with Dual-Layer Metasurfaces: A Cross-Talk Reduction Approach

Abstract:

Polarization multiplexing has emerged as a crucial technique in modern photonics, enabling the manipulation of light's polarization state to encode multiple signals. However, conventional single-layer metasurfaces suffer from limited degrees of freedom and inherent cross-talk, hindering their multiplexing capacity. In this study, we demonstrate that dual-layer metasurfaces can significantly enhance polarization multiplexing by increasing the available degrees of freedom and mitigating cross-talk. By designing a judiciously crafted Jones matrix, we optimize the dual-layer metasurface configuration to minimize cross-talk between adjacent polarization channels. Our results show a substantial reduction in cross-talk and a corresponding enhancement in multiplexing capacity compared to single-layer counterparts. The proposed dual-layer metasurface design paves the way for the development of multifunctional optical devices with improved performance, opening new avenues for applications in optical communication systems and beyond. This advancement has significant implications for the field of photonics in 2024 and beyond.
