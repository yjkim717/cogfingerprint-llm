**Abstract**

The experimental investigation of quantum field theories (QFTs) in curved spacetimes has long been impeded by the prohibitive energy scales of relativistic gravity. This work presents a scalable framework for simulating key phenomena of QFTs on non-trivial gravitational backgrounds using engineered spin-lattice systems. We demonstrate that the low-energy excitations of certain interacting spin models, particularly those hosting emergent Majorana fermions, are formally analogous to a discretized scalar field propagating on a curved spacetime metric. The geometry of this analogue spacetime is encoded in the tunable coupling constants of the spin Hamiltonian, allowing for the simulation of backgrounds such as an expanding universe or a black hole analogue. We numerically validate this mapping by observing the dynamical Casimir effect and Unruh-Hawking radiation in one- and two-dimensional arrays. Our results show clear signatures of particle production from the quantum vacuum due to the simulated spacetime dynamics, with measurable correlations in the spin degrees of freedom. This approach provides a robust, tabletop platform to probe fundamental questions in relativistic quantum information and high-energy physics, offering unprecedented experimental access to the interplay between quantum matter and geometry. The proposed quantum simulators thus bridge a critical gap between theoretical cosmology and controllable laboratory experiments.
