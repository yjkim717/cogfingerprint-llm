**Dynamically Tunable Electromagnetic Response via Electrochemical Lithiation-Induced Dielectric Polarization Modulation**

Recent advances in metasurface technology have spurred considerable interest in dynamically reconfigurable electromagnetic devices. This work presents a novel approach to achieving reversible electromagnetic switching by leveraging electrochemical lithiation to modulate dielectric polarization within a specifically designed metasurface architecture. We demonstrate that controlled insertion of lithium ions into a thin-film dielectric material, facilitated by electrochemical lithiation, induces a significant and reversible change in the material's permittivity. This permittivity modulation, occurring at the atomic scale and influenced by the introduction of disorder associated with lithium intercalation, directly impacts the resonant behavior of the metasurface. Experimental results reveal a pronounced shift in the metasurface’s transmission spectrum, exhibiting a transition between near-complete transparency and strong absorption states in response to applied electrochemical potential. The observed switching speed is currently limited by ion diffusion kinetics, but the underlying principle offers a pathway toward high-speed, low-power electromagnetic control.  Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between the degree of lithiation, the resulting dielectric constant, and the corresponding electromagnetic response, establishing a clear correlation amenable to device optimization. This technique presents a promising avenue for developing advanced photonic devices, including tunable filters, modulators, and absorbers, with potential applications in optical communications and sensing, particularly where integration with electrochemical systems is advantageous. Future research will focus on mitigating ion diffusion limitations and exploring alternative dielectric materials to enhance performance.
