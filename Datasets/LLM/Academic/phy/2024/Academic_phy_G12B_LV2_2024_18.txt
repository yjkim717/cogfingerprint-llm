**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of metasurface optics demands novel materials exhibiting high refractive index and robust optical performance across a broad spectral range. This work investigates tantalum pentoxide (Ta₂O₅) as a promising dielectric material platform for the fabrication of high-performance metasurfaces, extending operational capabilities into the ultraviolet (UV) and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Conventional dielectric metasurfaces often suffer from limitations in either spectral bandwidth or fabrication complexity. Ta₂O₅ presents a compelling alternative due to its intrinsically high refractive index (n ≈ 2.3 at 600 nm) and wide bandgap, offering potential for enhanced light manipulation and reduced losses.

We present a comprehensive analysis of Ta₂O₅’s optical properties, demonstrating its suitability for realizing diverse metasurface functionalities, including beam steering, polarization control, and subwavelength focusing. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations were employed to evaluate the performance of Ta₂O₅-based metasurfaces designed for operation at wavelengths spanning 200 nm to 700 nm.  Results indicate that Ta₂O₅ metasurfaces can achieve high efficiencies and robust performance even under varying incident angles, a critical consideration for practical applications. Furthermore, the chemical stability and relative ease of deposition of Ta₂O₅ films via atomic layer deposition (ALD) suggest a pathway towards scalable and reproducible fabrication. This research highlights Ta₂O₅ as a significant advancement in dielectric metasurface materials, paving the way for advanced optical devices in UV and visible photonics, with implications for applications in sensing, imaging, and optical communications.  Future work will focus on exploring hybrid metasurface designs incorporating Ta₂O₅ and other dielectric materials to further enhance functionality.
