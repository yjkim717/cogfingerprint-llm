Title: Topological Invariants in Black Hole Thermodynamics: A Unified Classification Framework

Abstract:
In this paper, we present a novel topological classification framework for black hole states within the thermodynamic parameter space, shedding light on the intricate relationships between Hawking temperature, entropy, and other thermodynamic variables. By employing advanced topological invariants, we elucidate the universal properties governing the behavior of diverse black hole configurations. Our analysis reveals that the thermodynamic parameter space can be partitioned into distinct topological sectors, each characterized by a unique set of critical exponents and scaling laws. The proposed framework provides a unified description of black hole thermodynamics, enabling the identification of novel phase transitions and critical phenomena. Furthermore, our results have significant implications for the development of a more comprehensive theory of quantum gravity, as they highlight the crucial role of topological invariants in understanding the thermodynamic properties of black holes.
