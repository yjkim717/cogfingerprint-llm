**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in materials science have yielded a novel electrochemical lithiation technique for manipulating dielectric properties with unprecedented control. This study details a methodology employing hierarchical disordering within semiconductive oxide materials to dynamically modulate dielectric polarization. Utilizing electromagnetic modulation – specifically, precisely timed electrochemical pulses – we achieve reversible switching between dielectric transparency and absorption regimes. Characterization reveals a significantly enhanced dielectric permittivity regulation capacity compared to established thermal or chemical annealing approaches.  The observed phenomenon is attributed to the localized structural rearrangements induced by lithiation, profoundly affecting the material’s response to electromagnetic radiation.  Preliminary investigations suggest a strong correlation between the degree of hierarchical disordering and the resultant reflection loss spectra.  Further research will focus on optimizing pulse parameters and exploring the potential for broadband electromagnetic control, representing a crucial step towards advanced metamaterial design and tunable photonic devices.
