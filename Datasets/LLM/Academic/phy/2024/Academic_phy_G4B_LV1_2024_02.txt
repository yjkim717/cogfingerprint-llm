**Abstract**

We present a novel approach to amplitude factorization utilizing all-order splits and multi-soft limits, rigorously derived from integral representations of particle and string theory.  Leveraging curve integral formulations, we demonstrate a systematic procedure for isolating and characterizing multi-soft limits within these amplitudes.  This framework is predicated upon a binary geometric interpretation, wherein the amplitudes decompose into distinct, topologically independent sectors.  We argue that this decomposition facilitates a topological expansion, allowing for the systematic construction of all-order approximations.  Specifically, we explore how these splits reveal underlying constraints and symmetries previously obscured by conventional perturbative techniques.  The resultant structure offers a potential pathway towards a more complete and nuanced understanding of high-energy scattering processes and the emergence of soft behavior in string theory, with implications for hadron collider physics and beyond.
