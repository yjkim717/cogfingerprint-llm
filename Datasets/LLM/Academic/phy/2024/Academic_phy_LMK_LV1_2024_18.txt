Title: "Tantalum Pentoxide Dielectric Metasurfaces for Ultraviolet and Visible Optics: A Novel Platform for High-Performance Metasurface Optics"

Abstract:

Dielectric metasurfaces have emerged as a promising platform for high-performance optics, enabling the manipulation of light at the nanoscale. However, the development of metasurface optics for the ultraviolet (UV) and visible regions has been hindered by the limited availability of suitable materials. In this work, we present tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) as a novel material platform for high-performance dielectric metasurface optics in the UV and visible spectral ranges. Leveraging the high refractive index, low absorption, and CMOS compatibility of Ta2O5, we demonstrate the design, fabrication, and characterization of Ta2O5-based metasurfaces exhibiting high transmission efficiency and polarization control. Our results show that Ta2O5 metasurfaces can achieve high-performance optical functionalities, including beam steering, focusing, and polarization conversion, with efficiencies exceeding 90% in the UV and visible regions. The proposed Ta2O5 platform offers a promising solution for the development of high-performance metasurface optics for a wide range of applications, including UV spectroscopy, imaging, and optical communication systems. Furthermore, the CMOS compatibility of Ta2O5 enables the monolithic integration of metasurface optics with electronic components, paving the way for the development of compact, high-performance optical systems. This work highlights the potential of Ta2O5 as a versatile material platform for dielectric metasurface optics and paves the way for further advancements in the field.
