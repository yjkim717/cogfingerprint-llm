**Abstract**

Understanding the mechanisms underlying efficient light-driven molecular motion is paramount to elucidating biological processes and developing novel optoelectronic devices. This study investigates the role of vibrational synchronization in photoisomerization, employing a combined quantum-classical dynamics approach. We demonstrate that promoter-mediated vibrational synchronization is essential for optimal photoisomerization efficiency in both Rhodopsin and a biomimetic molecular rotor, MeO-NAIP. Analysis reveals a significant correlation between vibrational coherence and isomerization kinetics, suggesting an evolutionary advantage in Rhodopsin’s design. Furthermore, our simulations highlight the pronounced influence of solvent environment on MeO-NAIP’s performance, indicating a sensitivity to microenvironmental factors often overlooked in traditional modeling. These findings underscore the importance of considering vibrational dynamics as a key determinant of molecular function and provide insights into the design of synthetic systems mimicking biological light-harvesting mechanisms.
