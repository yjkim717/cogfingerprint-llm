**Abstract**

We demonstrate that black hole-induced decoherence can be systematically reformulated within the framework of open quantum systems at finite temperature. By constructing an effective field theory for a quantum probe interacting with a black hole environment, we show that the resulting non-unitary evolution is thermodynamically consistent with a local temperature set by the surface gravity. The derived decoherence and dissipation rates are shown to be functionally equivalent to those generated by a conventional thermal reservoir, suggesting that black hole information loss is a manifestation of universal quantum statistical mechanics rather than a fundamental departure from it.
