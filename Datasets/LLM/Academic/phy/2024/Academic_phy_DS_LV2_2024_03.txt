This study establishes that quantum decoherence induced by black holes can be systematically described using finite-temperature effective field theory. By analyzing open quantum system dynamics, we demonstrate that gravitational decoherence signatures are thermodynamically consistent with modeling black holes as finite-temperature quantum objects. Crucially, the decoherence patterns mirror those observed in ordinary matter systems at equivalent temperatures, revealing universal thermodynamic constraints on quantum information degradation. Our framework bridges gravitational and condensed matter phenomena, providing measurable predictions for quantum coherence near event horizons while maintaining consistency with semiclassical gravity.
