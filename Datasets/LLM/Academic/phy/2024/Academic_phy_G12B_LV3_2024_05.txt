**Abstract:** Recent investigations into the extragalactic distance scale have prompted a re-evaluation of the relationship between Cepheid variable stars and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) as independent distance indicators. This work, presented as an erratum (Freedman et al., 2024), incorporates revised data and refined numerical analyses to compare these methodologies. While the original finding of a statistically insignificant correlation between Cepheid period-luminosity and metallicity is maintained, updated regression coefficients offer improved precision in distance estimations. These corrections underscore the robustness of the Cepheid period-luminosity relation despite metallicity variations, and contribute to a more reliable calibration of the cosmic distance ladder, essential for accurate cosmological parameter determination.
