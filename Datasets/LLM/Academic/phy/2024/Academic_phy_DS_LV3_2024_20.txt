In this work, we propose a novel conformal freeze-in mechanism for dark matter (DM) production within a strongly-coupled dark sector described by a Conformal Field Theory (CFT). The model introduces a neutrino portal interaction, facilitating communication between the dark sector and Standard Model (SM) neutrinos. Below the electroweak scale, the dark sector undergoes confinement, triggering the formation of composite dark matter candidates. We demonstrate that the freeze-in production via the neutrino portal yields the correct relic abundance, consistent with Planck satellite observations, while naturally operating at experimentally accessible energy scales. Furthermore, we investigate the phenomenological implications of this framework, showing that the same portal interactions can generate small neutrino masses through higher-dimensional operators, thereby offering a unified explanation for dark matter and neutrino mass generation. This scenario presents testable predictions for future neutrino experiments and direct detection campaigns, positioning it as a compelling target for beyond-Standard Model searches in the coming years.
