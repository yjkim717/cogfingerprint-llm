**Abstract**

The formulation of a consistent thermodynamic framework for quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge in contemporary physics, necessitating tools that can capture non-classical correlations and measurement-induced backaction. This work establishes the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution as a fundamental theoretical and experimental construct for addressing this challenge. Unlike classical probabilities, KD quasiprobabilities can assume non-real values, a feature directly linked to quantum contextuality and non-commutativity. We demonstrate that these generalized quasiprobabilities provide the most complete description of a quantum system's state prior to a measurement, thereby serving as the natural language for characterizing quantum thermodynamic processes. Specifically, we detail a protocol for the direct experimental reconstruction of KD distributions in many-body spin chains via weak measurements and post-selection, linking abstract formalism to tangible measurement statistics.

Our analysis reveals that anomalous energy exchanges, such as transient violations of the classical Jarzynski equality, are not artifacts but direct signatures of underlying quantum coherence, explicitly quantified by the non-positivity of the KD quasiprobability associated with the work distribution. Furthermore, we show how quasiprobabilistic decompositions elucidate the interplay between entanglement generation and energy transport in far-from-equilibrium quantum quenches. By unifying the description of quantum work statistics and information scrambling, this framework provides a powerful platform for exploring the thermodynamic cost of quantum computation and the emergence of statistical mechanics from pure quantum states. The insights gained position quasiprobabilities as indispensable for the next generation of quantum thermodynamic experiments and the design of quantum machines operating in regimes inaccessible to classical analogs.
