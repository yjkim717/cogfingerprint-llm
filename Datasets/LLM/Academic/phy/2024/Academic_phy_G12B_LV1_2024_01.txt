**Abstract: A Circle-Duality Framework for Quantum Harmonic Oscillators and the Emergence of Classical-Like Behavior**

The persistent challenge of reconciling quantum mechanics with classical intuition motivates continued investigation into potential underlying mechanisms for the emergence of classical behavior from fundamentally quantum systems. This work proposes a novel duality framework connecting the quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) and a classical particle constrained to motion on a circle. We demonstrate that transformations in Hilbert space, specifically exploiting the inherent periodicity of both systems, allow for a mapping between QHO states and configurations of a classical particle evolving under uniform circular motion. This mapping is not merely a mathematical curiosity; we argue that it provides a conceptual lens through which to explore the possibility of classical hidden variables.

The duality enables the definition of observables that are, in the classical limit, readily interpretable as the position and momentum of the circular particle.  Crucially, we investigate the impact of perturbations on the QHO within this duality, showing that these perturbations manifest as deviations from ideal circular motion, thus providing a potential pathway for the decoherence of hidden variables.  By examining the statistical distributions of these "circle-particle" configurations, we explore whether they exhibit characteristics consistent with classical probability distributions, offering a preliminary investigation into the potential for recovering classical-like behavior from a fundamentally quantum description.  Future work will focus on refining the mapping, exploring specific forms of perturbation, and developing quantitative metrics to assess the degree to which the duality captures aspects of classical hidden variable theories.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Emphasis on Duality:** I've made the duality the central focus, highlighting its potential as a framework rather than just a mathematical relationship.
*   **Hidden Variables Qualification:** Iâ€™ve carefully phrased the connection to hidden variables as a "potential mechanism" and a "possibility," avoiding definitive claims.  This is crucial given the contentious nature of hidden variable theories.
*   **Perturbations and Decoherence:** I've included the idea of perturbations to link the abstract to the usual discussion of decoherence, a common topic in the context of quantum-classical transition.
*   **Observables:** Mentioning the mapping of observables to classical quantities reinforces the connection.
*   **Future Work:** A brief statement about future directions is standard in abstracts.
*   **Year Context (2024):** The language and focus are relevant to current research trends in quantum foundations.  The emphasis on exploring specific mechanisms aligns with the ongoing efforts to understand quantum-classical transitions.
*   **Potential Expansion:** This abstract could be expanded to include:
    *   Specific mathematical details of the Hilbert space transformations.
    *   Discussion of the limitations of the duality.
    *   A brief mention of the types of hidden variable theories being considered (e.g., Bohmian mechanics).
    *   Elaborating on the quantitative metrics for assessing classical-like behavior.
