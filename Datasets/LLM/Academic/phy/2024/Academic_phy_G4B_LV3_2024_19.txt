**Abstract**

Recent progress in quantum information science increasingly relies on robust and precisely engineered quantum light sources. This review synthesizes advancements leveraging novel optical architectures to achieve enhanced control and manipulation of quantum emitters. Specifically, we examine the burgeoning role of flat optics, including nonlinear metasurfaces and advanced quantum dot arrays, in facilitating spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and enabling the generation of tailored photon pairs.  Furthermore, the utilization of color centers within solid-state materials, such as diamond and silicon carbide, is explored for their potential as independent quantum emitters and sources of correlated photons.  The integration of these techniques—particularly the application of flat optics to precisely position and control these emitters—allows for significant improvements in SPDC efficiency and spectral purity.  These developments represent a critical step toward realizing scalable and deterministic quantum light sources essential for quantum key distribution, quantum sensing, and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, with ongoing research focusing on minimizing decoherence and maximizing entanglement fidelity.
