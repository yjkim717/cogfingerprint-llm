**Abstract**

The advancement of integrated photonic systems increasingly demands efficient polarization management. This study investigates the performance of dual-layer metasurfaces for enhanced polarization multiplexing, reporting a substantial improvement over conventional single-layer approaches. Utilizing a carefully engineered metamaterial architecture, we demonstrate that incorporating a second layer within the metasurface dramatically increases the number of independently controlled polarization states achievable.  Analysis reveals a significant reduction in cross-talk between multiplexed channels, attributed to optimized phase retardation and impedance matching facilitated by the layered structure.  We employed a Jones matrix formalism to characterize the polarization response of the fabricated devices, quantifying the enhanced degree of polarization purity and the minimized interference between orthogonal states.  Experimental results validate the theoretical predictions, highlighting the potential of dual-layer metasurfaces as a key component in advanced optical communication and sensing applications. Further research will focus on scaling and integration strategies for practical implementation in 2024 and beyond.
