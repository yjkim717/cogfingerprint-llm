Title: Quasiprobability Distributions in Quantum Thermodynamics: Unveiling the Kirkwood-Dirac Representation for Many-Body Systems

Abstract:

The realm of quantum thermodynamics has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, with quasiprobabilities emerging as a pivotal tool for understanding the intricacies of quantum statistics in many-body systems. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive overview of quasiprobabilities, with a particular emphasis on the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution, a lesser-known yet powerful quasiprobability representation. We begin by delineating the fundamental definitions and properties of quasiprobabilities, highlighting their role in bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and classical statistical mechanics. The Kirkwood-Dirac distribution is then introduced as a specific quasiprobability representation, and its unique characteristics are discussed in the context of quantum thermodynamics.

We explore the applications of the Kirkwood-Dirac distribution in many-body systems, demonstrating its utility in characterizing quantum coherence, entanglement, and non-classicality. Furthermore, we examine the implications of quasiprobabilities for our understanding of quantum statistics, particularly in relation to the study of fluctuation theorems and the thermodynamic arrow of time. By elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of quasiprobabilities and their applications, this tutorial provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics and many-body physics. As we continue to navigate the complexities of quantum systems in 2024, the Kirkwood-Dirac representation stands poised to play a crucial role in shaping our understanding of the quantum thermodynamic landscape.
