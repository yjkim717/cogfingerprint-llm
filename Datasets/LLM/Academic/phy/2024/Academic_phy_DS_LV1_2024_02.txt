**Abstract**

We establish a universal geometric framework for computing multi-soft scalar limits in planar tr(φ³) theory to all loop orders, resolving a longstanding barrier in the study of infrared singularities. By reformulating scattering amplitudes within a binary geometry—a combinatorial space encoding particle interactions as adjacency relations on a binary tree—we demonstrate that the intricate factorization properties in soft limits emerge from elementary topological operations. Specifically, we prove that the singular structure, when multiple scalars become soft simultaneously, is governed by a systematic factorization of the underlying binary graph into disconnected components. This geometric perspective not only provides a recursive proof for the universality of these limits but also yields a constructive algorithm for generating the soft functions directly from the amplitude's kinematic data, bypassing traditional Feynman diagrammatic complexities. Our results suggest that binary geometry intrinsically encodes the infrared structure of quantum field theories, offering a powerful new paradigm for bootstrapping loop-level amplitudes from their fundamental singularities.
