Title: Quantum-Classical Dynamics of Molecular Rotors: Unveiling the Role of Vibrational Synchronization in Photoisomerization

Abstract:
In 2024, our understanding of molecular rotors continues to evolve, with a particular focus on the quantum-classical dynamics underlying their photoisomerization processes. This study investigates the intricate relationship between vibrational synchronization and efficient photoisomerization in both natural and synthetic molecular rotors, using rhodopsin as a paradigmatic example. By employing a mixed quantum-classical dynamics approach, we demonstrate that vibrational synchronization plays a pivotal role in facilitating the ultrafast photoisomerization characteristic of rhodopsin. Our comparative analysis reveals that the efficacy of photoisomerization in molecular rotors is significantly enhanced when vibrational modes are synchronized, thereby optimizing the energy transfer and reducing dissipative losses. These findings have profound implications for the design of novel synthetic molecular rotors and the understanding of natural photoreceptors, shedding light on the intricate mechanisms governing their functionality.
