**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) represents a critical bottleneck in numerous electrochemical energy conversion processes. Investigating the mechanistic underpinnings of OER at the atomic scale necessitates a multi-faceted approach. This work presents a combined quantum mechanical and experimental investigation into the activity of iridium dioxide (IrO2) across distinct crystallographic facets. Utilizing density functional theory calculations, we elucidated facet-dependent variations in the surface redox potential and transition state energetics associated with the OER. Specifically, we identified significant differences in the dominant reaction pathways observed on (001), (010), and (110) IrO2 surfaces. Experimental corroboration, achieved through cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, validated the theoretical predictions and demonstrated a strong correlation between facet structure and OER kinetics. These findings underscore the importance of surface crystallography in tailoring IrO2 catalysts for enhanced OER performance and provide a framework for future rational design strategies.
