We investigate the asymptotic symmetry structure of non-minimally coupled scalar-electrodynamics in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime, focusing on behavior at spatial infinity. By constructing a consistent Hamiltonian framework and applying suitable fall-off conditions for the coupled scalar and U(1) gauge fields, we derive the conserved charges generating asymptotic symmetries. Our analysis demonstrates that despite the presence of non-minimal interaction terms, the asymptotic symmetry group at spatial infinity remains isomorphic to that of the free Maxwell theoryâ€”namely, the infinite-dimensional global U(1) group. This result indicates that such couplings do not introduce new classically observable "large" gauge transformations beyond the known electric and magnetic charges. The findings, relevant for the soft photon theorem and memory effects, suggest a robustness of electromagnetic asymptotic symmetries against a specific class of interactions in flat space.
