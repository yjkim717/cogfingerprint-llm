**Abstract: Tantalum Pentoxide as a Versatile Platform for Tunable Dielectric Metasurfaces**

The burgeoning field of metasurfaces demands novel dielectric materials capable of precise light-field manipulation across broad spectral ranges. This study investigates tantalum pentoxide (Ta₂O₅) as a promising candidate for constructing high-performance dielectric metasurfaces, demonstrating its potential for advanced ultraviolet (UV) and visible optics applications. Utilizing reactive ion etching (RIE), we fabricated a series of precisely patterned Ta₂O₅ structures, enabling tailored refractive index modulation. Characterization via spectroscopic ellipsometry and angular-resolved reflectance measurements revealed significant control over the effective medium dielectric function across a contiguous wavelength range, from approximately 200 nm to 700 nm. 

The achieved refractive index contrast, coupled with the material’s high chemical stability and compatibility with established nanofabrication techniques, positions Ta₂O₅ as a compelling alternative to conventional materials.  Specifically, we observed a strong correlation between the etching parameters – specifically etch time and bias voltage – and the resulting metasurface performance.  These findings suggest a pathway towards designing dynamically tunable metasurfaces with enhanced spectral selectivity and polarization control. Future work will focus on integrating these Ta₂O₅-based metasurfaces into functional devices, exploring their utility in applications ranging from optical imaging to advanced sensing.
