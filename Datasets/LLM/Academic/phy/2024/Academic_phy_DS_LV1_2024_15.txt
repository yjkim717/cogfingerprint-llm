**Abstract**

The dynamic modulation of electromagnetic (EM) wave interactions with functional materials represents a frontier in condensed matter physics and device engineering. This work demonstrates a novel paradigm for real-time, reversible control of the dielectric response in transition metal oxides via an electrochemical lithiation process. By inducing controlled hierarchical disordering—spanning atomic-scale lattice distortions to mesoscopic phase boundaries—we achieve a profound and switchable alteration of the complex permittivity. In the pristine state, the wide-bandgap semiconducting oxide exhibits low loss and high reflectivity in the GHz spectrum. Upon lithiation, the injected lithium ions act as both donors and polarizable centers, enhancing electronic conductivity while simultaneously introducing significant dipole polarization losses. This synergistic effect facilitates a continuous transition from a reflective to a strongly absorptive state, as quantified by a tunable reflection loss exceeding 20 dB. The process is fully reversible upon delithiation, confirming the stability of the disordered phases. These findings establish electrochemical ion intercalation as a powerful mechanism for designing active EM metamaterials with applications in reconfigurable cloaking, intelligent shielding, and adaptive wireless communication systems operating at room temperature.
