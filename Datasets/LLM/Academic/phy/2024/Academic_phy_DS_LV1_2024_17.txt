**Abstract**

Metasurface-enabled polarization multiplexing has emerged as a pivotal strategy for enhancing the information capacity of optical systems. However, conventional single-layer architectures are fundamentally constrained by their limited polarization control, leading to significant inter-channel cross-talk that impedes practical applications. This work introduces a dual-layer metasurface platform engineered to overcome these limitations. By decoupling the manipulation of orthogonal polarization states across two spatially separated, actively aligned metasurfaces, we access a greatly expanded design space. We demonstrate that this configuration supports eight independent degrees of freedom in wavefront shaping—four per polarization channel—a capability unattainable with single-layer counterparts. Crucially, our design methodology, grounded in a comprehensive Jones matrix analysis, enables the synthesis of phase profiles that minimize parasitic coupling between these channels. Experimental characterization at a wavelength of 1550 nm confirms a cross-talk reduction exceeding 15 dB compared to optimized single-layer devices. This architecture establishes a new paradigm for high-fidelity, multi-channel optical systems, with immediate implications for advanced communications, imaging, and encryption technologies.
