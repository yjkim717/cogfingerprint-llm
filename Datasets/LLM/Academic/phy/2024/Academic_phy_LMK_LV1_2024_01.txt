Title: Unveiling Classical Hidden Variables through Quantum-Classical Duality in Harmonic Oscillators

Abstract:
In 2024, our understanding of the intricate relationship between quantum mechanics and classical systems continues to evolve. This study explores the duality between the quantum harmonic oscillator and a classical particle on a circle, leveraging the mathematical frameworks of Hilbert space and hidden variable theories. By examining the correspondence between the quantized energy levels of the harmonic oscillator and the angular momentum of a classical particle on a circular trajectory, we reveal novel insights into the nature of classical hidden variables. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum-classical duality provides a robust platform for investigating the role of hidden variables in reconciling quantum mechanics with classical determinism. The findings of this research contribute to the ongoing discourse on the foundations of quantum theory, shedding new light on the interplay between quantum and classical systems.
