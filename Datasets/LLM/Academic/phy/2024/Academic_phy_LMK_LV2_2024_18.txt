Title: High-Performance Ultraviolet Dielectric Metasurfaces Leveraging Tantalum Pentoxide Nanostructures

Abstract:

Dielectric metasurfaces have emerged as a revolutionary platform for manipulating light at the nanoscale, offering unprecedented control over optical wavefronts and polarization states. However, the development of high-performance metasurface optics in the ultraviolet (UV) region has been hindered by the limited availability of materials with high refractive index and low absorption. In this study, we introduce tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) as a promising material platform for UV dielectric metasurfaces, leveraging its high refractive index and transparency in the UV range. We demonstrate the design, fabrication, and characterization of Ta2O5-based metasurfaces comprising subwavelength nanostructures, which exhibit high optical efficiency and tailored spectral responses. Our results show that Ta2O5 metasurfaces can achieve high transmission efficiency (>80%) and precise control over the phase and polarization of UV light. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ta2O5 metasurfaces by demonstrating various optical functionalities, including beam steering, focusing, and polarization conversion. The high refractive index of Ta2O5 enables the realization of compact, high-numerical-aperture metasurfaces, making it an attractive platform for UV optics applications. Our work paves the way for the development of high-performance UV dielectric metasurfaces, with potential applications in spectroscopy, imaging, and optical communication systems. The proposed Ta2O5 metasurface platform is expected to have a significant impact on the field of UV optics, enabling new opportunities for the manipulation of light at the nanoscale.
