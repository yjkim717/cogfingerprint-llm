**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum photonics increasingly demands efficient and tailored sources of non-classical light. This review surveys recent advancements in the integration of flat optics, specifically nonlinear metasurfaces and nanostructures, for the enhanced generation and manipulation of quantum light sources. Leveraging the compact and versatile nature of these planar optical elements, we explore their application in spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) processes, demonstrating improved spectral control and enhanced generation rates of entangled photon pairs. Furthermore, we discuss the role of these engineered structures in coupling to and extracting photons from quantum emitters, such as quantum dots and defects, with high efficiency. The ability to precisely tailor light-matter interactions at the nanoscale promises transformative capabilities for quantum communication protocols, quantum computing architectures, and advanced quantum sensing and imaging modalities, signifying a critical pathway toward realizing practical quantum technologies in 2024 and beyond.
