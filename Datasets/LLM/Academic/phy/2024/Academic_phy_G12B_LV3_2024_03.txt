**Abstract:**

Recent investigations into the interplay between black hole physics and quantum decoherence offer a novel perspective on emergent spacetime. This work explores the consistency of decoherence effects arising from quantum systems interacting with black holes, demonstrating their compatibility with established quantum black hole theoretical frameworks. We employ an effective field theory approach to reveal a striking qualitative similarity between black hole dynamics and the behavior of ordinary matter at finite temperature. This shared behavior suggests a deeper connection between gravitational and thermodynamic phenomena, potentially providing insights into the emergence of classical spacetime from underlying quantum degrees of freedom and furthering our understanding of black hole information loss paradox.
