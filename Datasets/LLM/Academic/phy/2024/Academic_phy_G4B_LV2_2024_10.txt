**Abstract**

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalyzed by iridium dioxide (IrO<sub>2</sub>) exhibits significant activity variability, necessitating a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanistic factors. This research employs a combined quantum mechanical and experimental approach to elucidate facet-dependent differences in OER kinetics, published in 2024. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on various crystallographic facets of IrO<sub>2</sub>, focusing on the energetics of key redox processes and identifying preferential sites for electron transfer. Experimental electrochemical investigations, utilizing cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry, corroborated the DFT predictions, demonstrating a pronounced influence of surface morphology on OER efficiency. Notably, specific IrO<sub>2</sub> facets, characterized by distinct crystallographic orientations, exhibited markedly enhanced catalytic activity compared to others. These findings provide crucial insights into the complex interplay between surface structure, electronic properties, and surface redox processes governing the OER at IrO<sub>2</sub>.  The observed facet-dependent behavior highlights the importance of precise control over material synthesis for optimizing IrO<sub>2</sub>-based electrocatalysts.
