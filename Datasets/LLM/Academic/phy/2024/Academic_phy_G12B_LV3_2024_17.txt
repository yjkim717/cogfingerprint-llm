**Abstract:**

Recent advances in nanophotonics have spurred considerable interest in metasurface-based optical functionalities. This work investigates the potential of dual-layer metasurface architectures for enhanced polarization multiplexing capabilities. Single-layer metasurfaces, while demonstrating promising initial results, are inherently limited by their constrained degrees of freedom and susceptibility to cross-talk between orthogonal polarization channels. To address these limitations, we present a design utilizing a dual-layer configuration, effectively expanding the accessible parameter space and facilitating independent control over polarization states. Numerical simulations demonstrate a substantial reduction in inter-polarization cross-talk – a critical factor for high-fidelity data transmission – alongside a demonstrable increase in multiplexing capacity. These findings highlight the significant potential of dual-layer metasurfaces for realizing high-capacity, multifunctional optical devices, paving the way for advanced optical communication and sensing technologies within the evolving landscape of integrated photonics.
