**Abstract**

We investigate a novel conformal freeze-in mechanism for generating both dark matter and neutrino masses within a neutrino portal framework. This model posits a weakly interacting dark sector, characterized by a conformal field theory, which interacts with the Standard Model via a mediator coupling to active neutrinos.  Employing a conformal symmetry ansatz, we demonstrate how the dark sector’s scalar field, driven by a potential energy, can efficiently ‘freeze-in’ neutrino masses through a non-perturbative effective field theory approximation.  Crucially, this approach predicts a specific spectral index for neutrino masses, dependent on the dark sector’s coupling strength and scale.  We explore the implications for dark matter production, suggesting a thermally produced dark matter component with a mass tunable via the freeze-in parameters.  Sensitivity analyses are performed, highlighting the potential of this model to simultaneously address current neutrino oscillation anomalies and provide a compelling dark matter candidate, warranting further theoretical and phenomenological investigation.
