**Abstract: Spintronic Simulation of Quantum Field Theories in Curved Spacetime via Ising Models**

The investigation into the dynamics of quantum field theories (QFTs) within curved spacetime remains a significant challenge, necessitating novel methodologies for theoretical exploration. This work presents a compelling framework for simulating QFT behavior utilizing spin systems, specifically leveraging the Ising model as a translational bridge. We demonstrate that carefully constructed spin Hamiltonians can effectively capture key features of QFTs in curved backgrounds, establishing a direct correspondence through a defined ‘dictionary’ mapping QFT operators to spin operators. 

Our analysis centers on the emergence of Majorana fermions – quasiparticles exhibiting non-Abelian statistics – as a crucial consequence of curved spacetime effects within the simulated QFT. Through an illustrative example employing a modified Ising model, we showcase how the spin system’s dynamics reproduce the characteristic properties of these exotic particles, including their fractional statistics and topological protection. This approach offers a distinct advantage for studying QFTs in regimes inaccessible through traditional perturbative techniques. 

Furthermore, the Ising model’s inherent simplicity facilitates detailed analytical and numerical investigations, providing valuable insights into the interplay between spin correlations, curvature, and the emergence of fundamental particle properties.  The proposed method represents a promising avenue for exploring the holographic principle and the relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics, offering a computationally tractable pathway to investigate complex QFT phenomena in curved spacetime landscapes.  Future research will focus on extending this framework to more sophisticated QFT models.
