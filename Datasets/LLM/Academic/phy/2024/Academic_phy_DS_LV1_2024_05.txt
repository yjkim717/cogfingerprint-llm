In this study, we revisit the metallicity sensitivity of the Cepheid distance scale by comparing distances derived from the Wesenheit Leavitt Law with those from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method. Utilizing updated Gaia parallaxes and homogeneous photometry for 37 Galactic and Magellanic Cloud Cepheids, we recalibrate the period-luminosity relation. Our analysis, incorporating a Bayesian framework to account for intrinsic scatter, yields a metallicity coefficient of γ = -0.01 ± 0.05 mag/dex. This result robustly confirms the null metallicity dependence initially reported, reinforcing the Cepheid distance scale as a precise extragalactic standard for the 2024-era Hubble constant measurements and late-Universe cosmology.
