**Abstract**

Recent advancements in materials science have increasingly focused on exploiting electroactive phenomena for dynamic control of optical properties. This study reports a novel electrochemical strategy for inducing reversible switching between electromagnetic transparency and absorption in semiconductive oxide materials, leveraging hierarchical disorder and atomic-scale polarization modulation. Utilizing a precisely controlled electrochemical protocol, we demonstrate the capacity to dynamically manipulate dielectric polarization within the material’s microstructure.  Specifically, we observed a significant shift in the material’s refractive index, correlating directly with alterations in the induced polarization state.  Electromagnetic modulation, achieved through this electrochemical control, enables reversible switching between transparent and strongly absorbing regimes.  

Analysis via advanced microscopy techniques reveals a critical role for the inherent hierarchical disorder within the oxide lattice in facilitating efficient dielectric polarization realignment.  Furthermore, we characterize the resulting atomic-scale polarization distribution, demonstrating a strong spatial correlation with the observed optical switching. These findings represent a fundamental step toward developing responsive optical materials with applications ranging from tunable photonic devices to advanced sensing technologies, and establish a robust electrochemical pathway for controlling dielectric properties at the nanoscale.
