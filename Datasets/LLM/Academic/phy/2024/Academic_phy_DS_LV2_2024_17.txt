**Abstract**

Metasurfaces have revolutionized wavefront manipulation, yet single-layer architectures face fundamental limitations in polarization multiplexing capacity and cross-talk. This work introduces a dual-layer dielectric metasurface platform that substantially augments the available degrees of freedom (DoFs) for independent information channels. By strategically decoupling the geometric and propagation phase responses across two spatially separated metasurface layers, we demonstrate a polarization-multiplexing scheme supporting eight distinct DoFs. This is achieved by independently engineering the interaction of each layer with orthogonal circular polarization states, thereby enabling the simultaneous generation of four independent holographic images or structured light fields. Crucially, our design incorporates a sub-wavelength interlayer separation and optimized meta-atom geometries that significantly suppress inter-channel cross-talk. Experimental characterization at near-infrared wavelengths confirms a cross-talk reduction exceeding 15 dB compared to analogous single-layer devices, alongside high diffraction efficiencies. This dual-layer paradigm provides a robust and scalable framework for developing high-capacity, multifunctional optical devices—such as ultra-compact displays, optical encryption systems, and advanced imaging spectrometers—paving the way for next-generation photonic integration.
