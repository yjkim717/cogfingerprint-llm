**Quantile-Based Validation of High-Dimensional Generative Models: Application to Galaxy Photometric Data**

The increasing complexity of astrophysical simulations and observational datasets necessitates robust methods for validating high-dimensional generative models. Traditional evaluation metrics often struggle to adequately assess the fidelity of models producing complex, multi-parameter outputs, particularly in capturing the full distribution of observed data. This work proposes a novel evaluation framework centered on the comparison of predicted sample quantiles with empirical quantile distributions derived from observed data. We posit that accurate quantile prediction serves as a stringent test of a generative model's ability to reproduce the statistical properties of the target distribution, particularly in high-dimensional spaces where traditional summary statistics may be insufficient.

Specifically, we demonstrate the efficacy of this approach within the context of galaxy photometry, utilizing a score-based diffusion model trained to generate synthetic galaxy images and associated photometric properties. By comparing the predicted quantiles of key photometric features (e.g., magnitude, color indices) with those observed in real galaxy surveys, we provide a detailed assessment of the model's performance. Our results highlight the sensitivity of this quantile-based metric to subtle discrepancies in the modelâ€™s ability to accurately represent the underlying data distribution, offering a powerful tool for model refinement and comparison. This methodology provides a general framework applicable to other domains involving high-dimensional data generation and validation, potentially impacting fields beyond astrophysics such as climate modeling and materials science.
