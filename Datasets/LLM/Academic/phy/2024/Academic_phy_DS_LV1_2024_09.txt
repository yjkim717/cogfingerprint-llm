**Abstract**

In high-dimensional astrophysical inference, conventional validation metrics often fail to capture complex, non-Gaussian discrepancies between simulated and observed data. This work introduces a rigorous, data-space validation framework for generative models, such as those producing synthetic galaxy populations from cosmological simulations. The method quantifies model fidelity by comparing multivariate distributions through their sample quantiles projected onto data-driven principal axes. By performing this comparison on low-dimensional, yet physically informative, subspaces identified via principal component analysis, we circumvent the curse of dimensionality inherent in datasets like multi-band photometry catalogs. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using mock observations from the James Webb Space Telescope, showing that it robustly identifies systematic biases in recovered star formation histories and metallicity distributions that are overlooked by standard summary statistics. This provides a principled pathway for refining sub-grid physics implementations in next-generation cosmological models, ensuring they generate populations consistent with the full statistical complexity of modern astronomical surveys.
