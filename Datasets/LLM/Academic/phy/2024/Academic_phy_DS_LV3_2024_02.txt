In this work, we establish a comprehensive framework for computing scattering amplitudes in Tr(Φ³) theory through the lens of binary geometry. Our central result demonstrates that all-order split factorizations, which emerge naturally from this geometric formulation, enable the systematic derivation of loop-integrated multi-soft limits. These universal factorization properties are shown to extend beyond scalar theories; via appropriate kinematical shifts, we generalize the formalism to encompass color-ordered amplitudes for pions and gluons in Yang-Mills theory. This geometric approach provides a unifying principle for soft theorems across disparate quantum field theories, resolving long-standing challenges in the infrared structure of loop amplitudes. The resulting methodology offers a powerful computational tool for high-precision collider phenomenology and illuminates profound connections between combinatorial geometry and quantum field theoretic structures.
