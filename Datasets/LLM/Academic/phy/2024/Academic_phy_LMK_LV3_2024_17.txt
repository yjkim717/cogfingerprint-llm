Title: Enhancing Polarization Multiplexing Capacity with Dual-Layer Metasurfaces for Advanced Optical Devices

Abstract:
In the pursuit of advancing optical device capabilities, this study investigates the potential of dual-layer metasurfaces to significantly enhance polarization multiplexing capacity. By leveraging the additional degrees of freedom afforded by the dual-layer architecture, we demonstrate a marked increase in multiplexing capacity while concurrently mitigating cross-talk between channels. Our findings indicate that the proposed dual-layer metasurface configuration can support up to eight independent channels, thereby doubling the capacity of conventional single-layer metasurfaces. This advancement is poised to revolutionize the design of optical devices, enabling more efficient and complex optical signal processing. The results presented herein underscore the potential of dual-layer metasurfaces to redefine the landscape of optical multiplexing technologies, with profound implications for the development of next-generation optical communication systems.
