**Abstract**

Recent theoretical investigations suggest a profound connection between black hole thermodynamics and topological defect physics. This work proposes a novel classification scheme for black hole states, framing them as distinct topological defects characterized by their associated vector fields. Utilizing a modified thermodynamic framework, we identify four primary classifications, distinguished by the geometry of their event horizon and the magnitude of their Hawking temperature.  Specifically, we demonstrate a correlation between horizon radius and the topological charge of the defect, leading to dramatically different thermodynamic properties across various temperature regimes.  Our analysis predicts deviations from standard black hole entropy calculations, particularly at low temperatures, where subtle quantum effects associated with the topological nature of the event horizon become dominant.  Further investigation into these classifications promises to refine our understanding of black hole internal structure and the fundamental link between gravity, topology, and thermodynamics â€“ a critical area of research for 2024 and beyond.
