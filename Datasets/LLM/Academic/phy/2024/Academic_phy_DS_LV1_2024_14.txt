In this work, we establish a novel topological framework for classifying black hole thermodynamics, revealing universal structures in the thermodynamic parameter space. By constructing a topological current density from the generalized free energy, we identify four distinct classes of black hole states, each characterized by unique winding numbers. These topological invariants provide a robust, coordinate-independent classification that directly correlates with local and global thermodynamic stability. Our analysis demonstrates that transitions between these classes occur at critical points defined by the vanishing of the Hawking temperature or heat capacity divergences. This classification scheme offers a powerful tool for probing the microstructure of black holes and imposes new constraints on models of quantum gravity. The universal nature of these topological classes suggests fundamental organizational principles governing black hole thermodynamics across diverse gravitational theories.
