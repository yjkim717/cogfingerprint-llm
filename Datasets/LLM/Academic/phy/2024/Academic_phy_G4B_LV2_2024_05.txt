**Abstract**

Recent advancements in distance measurement techniques, specifically utilizing Cepheid variable stars and Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) luminosity, necessitate a refined understanding of their metallicity sensitivity. This erratum addresses a critical update to observational data presented in a prior Astrophysical Journal publication, meticulously verifying a robustly flat relationship between Cepheid distances and TRGB distances across a diverse stellar population.  Crucially, the revised analysis confirms a consistent metallicity dependence for both distance indicators, aligning with the Wesenheit Leavitt Law.  These findings contribute to improved extragalactic distance calibrations, mitigating systematic uncertainties inherent in traditional methods.  Further investigation into the precise nature of this metallicity effect, potentially leveraging detailed red giant branch morphology, is warranted to enhance the accuracy and reliability of cosmological distance measurements in 2024 and beyond.
