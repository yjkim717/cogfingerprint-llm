**Abstract**

The tenets of relational quantum mechanics (RQM) present a fundamental challenge to traditional scientific objectivity, suggesting observer-dependent reality. This work investigates the epistemological implications of RQM, specifically concerning the erosion of established scientific credibility.  Drawing parallels to solipsistic philosophical arguments, we posit that RQM’s inherent uncertainty – exemplified by the ‘Alice’ thought experiment – necessitates a re-evaluation of the role of the observer and the very nature of verifiable knowledge within the quantum realm.  Further research is required to delineate the practical consequences of these theoretical shifts.
