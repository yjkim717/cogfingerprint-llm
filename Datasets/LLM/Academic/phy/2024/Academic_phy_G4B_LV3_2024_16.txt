**Abstract**

This study explores the asymptotic symmetry structure of electromagnetism modified by non-minimal scalar field couplings, revealing compelling parallels with gravitational interactions. Utilizing a perturbative approach, we demonstrate that the presence of non-minimal couplings introduces a hitherto unexamined symmetry group, exhibiting characteristics analogous to those observed in general relativity. Specifically, the scalar fields’ interaction with the electromagnetic field generates a modified Lagrangian exhibiting asymptotic symmetries.  However, analysis indicates a broken duality symmetry at infinite distances, characterized by a residual gauge dependence. This breakdown is attributed to the non-minimal coupling terms, which effectively introduce a scale-dependent renormalization of the electromagnetic field strength.  These findings suggest a deeper connection between seemingly disparate sectors of physics and provide a novel framework for investigating the interplay between gauge symmetries, scalar dynamics, and spacetime geometry. Further investigation into the precise nature of this broken symmetry promises to yield valuable insights into fundamental field theories.
