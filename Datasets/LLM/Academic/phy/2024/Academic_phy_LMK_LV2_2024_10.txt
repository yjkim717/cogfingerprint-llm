Title: Unveiling Facet-Dependent Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity on Iridium Oxide via Grand Canonical Quantum Mechanics

Abstract:
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial process in various energy conversion technologies, with iridium oxide (IrO2) being a state-of-the-art catalyst. Despite its widespread application, the underlying mechanisms governing its catalytic activity remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the facet-dependent OER activity of IrO2 using grand canonical quantum mechanics (GC-QM) calculations. By examining five distinct facets, our results reveal a pronounced dependence of OER activity on the surface crystallographic orientation. GC-QM calculations accurately capture the observed activity differences, attributing them to variations in surface redox processes and the associated changes in the electronic structure. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the OER on IrO2, shedding light on the intricate interplay between surface chemistry and catalytic activity. This study offers valuable insights for the design of high-performance OER catalysts, paving the way for the development of more efficient energy conversion technologies.
