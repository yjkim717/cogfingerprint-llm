This paper establishes a profound connection between binary geometry and the factorization properties of scattering amplitudes in tr(φ³) quantum field theory and superstring theory. We demonstrate that split factorizations, previously observed as algebraic phenomena, emerge naturally from the combinatorial structure of binary geometries governing the amplitude's moduli space. This geometric interpretation provides a universal framework for computing multi-soft limits at arbitrary loop orders, resolving long-standing challenges in amplitude computations where multiple particles become soft simultaneously. Our approach yields explicit all-order formulae that smoothly interpolate between field theory and string amplitudes, revealing an underlying geometric unity. The results provide new computational tools for high-precision collider physics and suggest deeper connections between quantum field theory, string theory, and tropical geometry. This work opens avenues for extending binary geometric methods to broader classes of quantum field theories and their effective descriptions.
