Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a physics publication in 2024. I've aimed for precision and a structured argument, around the 160-word target.  Following the abstract, I've included some notes on the choices I made.

**Abstract:**

The emergence of classicality from quantum systems remains a fundamental challenge in theoretical physics. This work investigates the role of decoherence in the context of black hole physics, demonstrating a compelling connection between quantum gravitational effects and established thermal physics. Utilizing an effective field theory approach, we analyze the decoherence dynamics of a quantum probe interacting with a Schwarzschild black hole at finite temperature. Our calculations reveal that the decoherence rate exhibits a characteristic scaling dependent on the Hawking temperature, mirroring the behavior observed in finite-temperature condensed matter systems. Crucially, these results indicate that the decoherence induced by black hole horizons is not anomalous, but rather a natural consequence of the system’s interaction with a thermal bath. This finding strengthens the compatibility of quantum black hole models with broader quantum mechanical principles, suggesting that the classicality of black holes may arise from mechanisms analogous to those governing thermal equilibration in ordinary matter, thus providing further support for the validity of semi-classical gravity.

**Notes on Choices & Rationale:**

*   **Focus on Classicality:** The abstract explicitly frames the research within the larger problem of classicality, which is a central theme when discussing black holes and quantum mechanics.
*   **Effective Field Theory:**  I included this as it was a keyword and is a common approach for dealing with quantum gravity, especially when trying to avoid full quantum gravity calculations.
*   **Schwarzschild Black Hole:**  Specifying the black hole type makes the context more concrete.
*   **Hawking Temperature:**  Directly linking the decoherence rate to the Hawking temperature is a key point, drawing a parallel to thermal physics.
*   **Thermal Bath Analogy:** The core argument is about the analogy to a thermal bath, emphasizing the "finite temperature" aspect.
*   **Semi-Classical Gravity:**  This ties the findings to a broader theoretical framework.
*   **Formal Language:**  I used language appropriate for a physics abstract (e.g., "demonstrates," "exhibits," "crucially," "strengthens").
*   **Year Context (2024):**  The language and the highlighting of connections to existing theories reflect the current landscape of research in this area.  It avoids overly speculative language, reflecting a focus on consolidating existing understanding.
