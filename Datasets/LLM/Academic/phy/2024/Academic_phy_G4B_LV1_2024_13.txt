**Exploring Thermodynamic Anomalies via Quasiprobability Formalism in Many-Body Systems**

The characterization of quantum statistical behavior remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when considering the complexities inherent in many-body systems. Traditional approaches relying on density matrix formalism often struggle to capture subtle thermodynamic phenomena and energy exchange irregularities observed in strongly correlated materials. This work introduces a novel application of quasiprobability theory to provide a more intuitive and tractable framework for investigating these anomalies. Specifically, we leverage quasiprobabilities – a non-diagonal representation of quantum states – to directly map quantum mechanical observables onto a phase space, facilitating the direct calculation of thermodynamic quantities.

Our investigation focuses on systems exhibiting Kirkwood-Dirac type correlations, where emergent collective behavior profoundly impacts energy transfer. We demonstrate how the quasiprobability formalism allows for a detailed analysis of measurement outcomes, revealing deviations from expected equilibrium behavior. By employing a generalized thermodynamic framework based on quasiprobability amplitudes, we identify specific conditions under which energy exchange appears to violate classical constraints, suggesting a fundamental departure from purely statistical mechanics.  Further analysis concentrates on the role of entanglement and non-commutativity in these anomalous processes.  This approach offers a promising route towards a deeper understanding of quantum thermodynamics and the emergence of novel emergent phenomena in complex many-body systems, paving the way for future investigations into quantum materials and beyond.
