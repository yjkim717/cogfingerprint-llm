**Abstract:**

We present a novel derivation of gravitational waveforms arising from the scattering of massive bodies, employing a quantum amplitude formalism. This approach offers a distinct pathway to calculating gravitational dynamics beyond the strong-field regime, complementing established classical methods. Our analysis achieves full consistency with classical predictions, specifically the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, validated up to 5th order. A critical element of this derivation involves a rigorous treatment of frame-dependent effects through explicit frame rotations, ensuring gauge invariance. Furthermore, we address potential infrared divergences inherent in quantum gravity calculations via dimensional regularization, providing a well-defined and finite result. Finally, the contribution of zero-frequency gravitons to the waveform is carefully accounted for, demonstrating its significance in achieving accurate waveform generation. This work establishes a robust quantum-corrected framework for gravitational waveform modeling, with implications for future gravitational wave observations and tests of general relativity.
