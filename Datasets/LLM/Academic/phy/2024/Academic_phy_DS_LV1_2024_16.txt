**Abstract**

We investigate the asymptotic symmetry structure of non-minimally coupled scalar-electrodynamics in four-dimensional Minkowski space. By performing a careful Hamiltonian analysis at spatial infinity, we demonstrate that the asymptotic symmetries are entirely governed by a set of angle-dependent U(1) gauge transformations, despite the presence of derivative couplings that significantly alter the fall-off behavior of the fields. Crucially, we show that the canonical generators of these symmetries remain functionally identical to those of the free Maxwell theory, thereby yielding the same conserved charges and Ward identities. This result establishes a form of "infrared universality," indicating that the long-range memory effects and soft theorems associated with these asymptotic symmetries are robust against the introduction of this class of non-minimal interactions. Our findings suggest a profound decoupling between the theory's local dynamics and its global, infrared structure.
