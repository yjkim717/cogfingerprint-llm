## Erratum and Updated Analysis of Cepheid and TRGB Distance Scales with Metallicity Considerations

This erratum addresses numerical inaccuracies within a recent publication and presents revised visualizations concerning the consistency of distance scales derived from Cepheid variable stars and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) standard candle. Our re-analysis reinforces the previously established conclusion of a negligible correlation between stellar metallicity and distances obtained via both methodologies. Utilizing the Wesenheit Leavitt law and period-luminosity relations for Cepheids, we compare distance moduli to TRGB-derived distances across a range of metallicities. The updated plots, incorporating corrected data, demonstrate continued agreement within observational uncertainties, supporting the robustness of both distance indicators and minimizing concerns regarding systematic biases introduced by metallicity variations in extragalactic distance measurements. These findings remain crucial for refining the cosmic distance ladder in 2024.
