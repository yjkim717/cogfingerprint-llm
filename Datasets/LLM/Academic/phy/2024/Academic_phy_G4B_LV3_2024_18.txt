**Abstract**

Dielectric metasurfaces are rapidly emerging as versatile optical elements, and the selection of constituent materials critically impacts their performance. This work investigates tantalum pentoxide (Ta₂O₅) as a novel platform for constructing high-index dielectric metasurfaces tailored for advanced optical applications. Utilizing a systematic design approach, we demonstrate the fabrication and characterization of Ta₂O₅-based metasurfaces exhibiting broadband operation across the ultraviolet and visible spectral regions. Preliminary results indicate significant potential for polarization-independent focusing and the precise generation of structural color. The inherent refractive index of Ta₂O₅, coupled with its chemical stability, offers advantages over conventional materials, facilitating the creation of compact and robust metasurface devices. Further research will focus on optimizing metasurface geometry and exploring integration with other photonic components, paving the way for innovative advancements in ultraviolet and visible optics.
