**Abstract**

The precise characterization of energy exchange in quantum systems remains a central challenge in quantum thermodynamics, particularly as we push toward the experimental realization of complex many-body quantum devices. While the standard framework of two-point projective measurement protocols provides a foundation for defining work statistics, it is increasingly recognized as insufficient for capturing the full, non-classical nature of quantum processes. This tutorial addresses this gap by presenting a comprehensive exploration of quasiprobability distributions as a fundamental and practical tool for quantum thermodynamics. We focus specifically on the Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability (KDQ) and its generalizations, which offer a powerful, operator-based description of quantum fluctuations that can assume non-real valuesâ€”a direct signature of quantum contextuality and coherence. We begin by rigorously defining these quasiprobabilities, contrasting them with classical joint probabilities and highlighting their intrinsic connection to quantum non-commutativity and weak measurement techniques. Subsequently, we detail state-of-the-art experimental methodologies, including weak measurement and interferometric schemes, for the direct reconstruction of these distributions in platforms ranging from trapped ions to superconducting qubits. The core of our discussion demonstrates how KDQs yield a unified description of quantum work statistics and fluctuation theorems, elegantly encapsulating the effects of coherence and entanglement that are erased in conventional treatments. By applying this formalism to paradigmatic many-body systems, we illustrate its capacity to diagnose intricate out-of-equilibrium phenomena, such as information scrambling and many-body localization. This work establishes quasiprobabilities not merely as mathematical curiosities, but as indispensable instruments for probing the ultimate thermodynamic limits of emerging quantum technologies.
