Title: Comparative Analysis of Gravitational Waveforms via Quantum Amplitude and Classical Multipolar-Post-Minkowskian Approaches

Abstract:

This study presents a comparative derivation of gravitational waveforms emitted by scattering massive bodies, employing both quantum-amplitude-based and classical multipolar-post-Minkowskian methods. We examine the gravitational waveform's dependence on Newton's constant and its implications for post-Newtonian expansion. By leveraging the quantum amplitude approach, we derive the waveform's asymptotic form and compare it with the classical result obtained through the post-Minkowskian expansion. Our analysis reveals a concordance between the two methodologies, underscoring the robustness of both frameworks in capturing the underlying physics. The comparative analysis is performed up to the third post-Newtonian order, where we observe a precise correspondence between the quantum amplitude and classical multipolar-post-Minkowskian results. This work contributes to our understanding of gravitational waveforms and the interplay between quantum and classical gravity, providing a foundation for further research in gravitational physics.
