## Abstract: Asymptotic Symmetries in Electromagnetism with Non-Minimal Scalar Couplings

We investigate the asymptotic symmetries arising in the context of electromagnetism minimally coupled to scalar fields, extending the analysis to encompass non-minimal derivative couplings. Utilizing the framework of asymptotic flatness and boundary techniques, we demonstrate that the inclusion of these non-minimal terms significantly alters the structure of the associated asymptotic symmetry algebra. Contrary to expectations based on minimal coupling scenarios, our findings reveal a surprising resemblance to the symmetry structure of a free theory. Specifically, we identify a duality symmetry – a transformation relating electric and magnetic fields – that persists even with the presence of the scalar field and its non-standard derivatives. This observation suggests a deeper connection between electromagnetism and free field theories than previously understood, potentially influenced by the non-minimal scalar interactions. The analysis leverages conserved charges derived from boundary conditions at null infinity and explores their algebraic relations. We propose that this result has implications for understanding the emergence of conserved quantities in interacting quantum field theories and offers a novel perspective on the role of non-minimal couplings in shaping the structure of asymptotic symmetries within gauge theories, a particularly relevant area in the ongoing exploration of quantum gravity and holography. Further investigation into the implications for scattering amplitudes and boundary correlators is warranted.
