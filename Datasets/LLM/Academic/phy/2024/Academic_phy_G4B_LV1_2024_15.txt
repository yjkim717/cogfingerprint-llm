**Abstract: Reversible Electromagnetic Tuning via Electrochemical Control of Hierarchical Dielectric Disordering**

This study reports a novel approach to dynamically manipulating dielectric properties through electrochemical lithiation, achieving reversible switching of electromagnetic transparency in a specifically engineered material. Utilizing a hierarchical disordering architecture, we demonstrate a direct correlation between the degree of lithium intercalation and resultant dielectric polarization. Electrochemical manipulation induces a controlled, multi-scale reorganization of the material’s structure, leading to significant alterations in the local electric field and, consequently, observable shifts in the material’s optical response.  Spectroscopic characterization, including Raman spectroscopy and impedance measurements, confirms the atomic-scale polarization dynamics associated with the lithiation process.  This technique offers a pathway to creating responsive photonic devices with tunable refractive indices and enhanced electromagnetic transparency. The observed reversibility, coupled with the potential for precise control, suggests significant opportunities for advanced applications in metamaterials, optical modulators, and nanoscale sensing technologies, representing a fundamental advancement in materials science by 2024.
