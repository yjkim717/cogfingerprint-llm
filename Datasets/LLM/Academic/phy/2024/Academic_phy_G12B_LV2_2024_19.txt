**Abstract:**

The burgeoning field of quantum information science demands increasingly sophisticated and controllable sources of non-classical light. This review examines the confluence of flat optics and nonlinear photonics, specifically exploring the recent progress in utilizing planar optical elements – particularly metasurfaces – to engineer advanced quantum light sources. Traditional methods for generating entangled photon pairs, such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in bulk nonlinear crystals, are often limited by size, efficiency, and complex alignment requirements.  Here, we present a critical assessment of how nonlinear metasurfaces, fabricated using advanced nanofabrication techniques, offer compelling solutions to these challenges, enabling compact, highly efficient, and spectrally tailored SPDC devices. We discuss the design principles underlying these metasurfaces, focusing on strategies for enhancing the nonlinear response and controlling the generated photon’s spatial and temporal properties. Furthermore, we review the integration of quantum emitters, such as quantum dots and defects in diamond, within metasurface platforms to create hybrid quantum light sources exhibiting enhanced coherence and novel entanglement schemes. The review highlights current limitations, including material losses and fabrication complexities, and outlines promising future research directions. These include exploring higher-order nonlinear processes within metasurfaces, developing all-dielectric metasurfaces to mitigate losses, and investigating dynamically reconfigurable metasurfaces for on-demand control of quantum light generation, ultimately paving the way for scalable quantum technologies for secure communication and quantum computation.
