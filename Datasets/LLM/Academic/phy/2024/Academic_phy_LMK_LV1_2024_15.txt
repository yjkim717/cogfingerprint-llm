Title: Electrochemical Lithiation-Induced Electromagnetic Modulation in Semiconductive Oxides

Abstract:
In 2024, advancements in electromagnetic modulation have led to significant breakthroughs in various fields. This study presents an electrochemical lithiation-driven strategy to achieve reversible electromagnetic switching in semiconductive oxides, leveraging hierarchical disorder to modulate dielectric polarization. By intercalating lithium ions into the oxide lattice, we induce a tunable range of electromagnetic responses, enabling broad operation bandwidth. The lithiation process alters the material's electronic structure, resulting in a semiconductor-to-metal transition that facilitates electromagnetic modulation. Our results demonstrate a reversible switching behavior, with a modulation depth exceeding 90% and a switching time of <1 ms. The proposed mechanism is supported by density functional theory calculations, revealing the crucial role of lithium-induced disorder in modulating the dielectric response. This work paves the way for the development of high-performance electromagnetic devices, with potential applications in radar, communication, and sensing systems.
