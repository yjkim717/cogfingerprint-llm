In 2024, the calibration of the cosmic distance scale remains critically dependent on the Cepheid periodâ€“luminosity relation (Leavitt Law). This study rigorously re-examines the potential systematic influence of Cepheid metallicity on this fundamental standard candle. Utilizing updated samples with refined TRGB (Tip of the Red Giant Branch) distances, we perform a high-precision regression analysis. Our findings robustly confirm a statistically negligible metallicity dependence, yielding a revised, flat metallicity coefficient. This result substantiates the continued reliability of Cepheids for extragalactic distance measurements and reinforces the foundation for the ongoing determination of the Hubble constant, mitigating a key systematic uncertainty in the distance ladder.
