**Abstract**

Recent developments in theoretical physics have increasingly explored the interplay between gauge symmetries and modified gravity, particularly within the framework of extended supergravity. This work examines the asymptotic symmetry structure of electromagnetism incorporating non-minimal coupling terms, investigating potential connections to gravitational dynamics and symmetry breaking phenomena. Utilizing techniques of asymptotic analysis, we demonstrate that the resulting field equations exhibit characteristics analogous to those arising from conventional gravitational couplings, suggesting a deeper underlying unity.  Specifically, the presence of the non-minimal coupling induces a subtle duality symmetry within the electromagnetic sector, impacting the spectrum of scalar field excitations.  These findings propose a novel perspective on the relationship between gauge and gravitational interactions, potentially offering insights into the cosmological evolution of the early universe and the nature of dark energy. Further investigation is warranted to fully characterize the implications of this emergent symmetry structure.
