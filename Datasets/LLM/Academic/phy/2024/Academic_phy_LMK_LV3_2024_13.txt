Title: Quasiprobability Distributions in Quantum Thermodynamics: Unveiling Quantum Statistics and Energy Exchanges

Abstract:
The realm of quantum thermodynamics has witnessed a surge of interest in quasiprobabilities, particularly Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities, as a tool for understanding quantum statistics and energy exchanges in many-body systems. This tutorial reviews the definition and interpretation of quasiprobabilities in the context of quantum mechanics, highlighting their role in elucidating the thermodynamic behavior of quantum systems. By examining the quasiprobability distributions of energy and work, we demonstrate how these constructs can be used to analyze the fluctuations and correlations that underlie quantum thermodynamic phenomena. Furthermore, we explore the applications of quasiprobabilities in characterizing the nonequilibrium thermodynamics of many-body systems, shedding light on the intricate interplay between quantum coherence and thermodynamic behavior. As research in this field continues to evolve in 2024, quasiprobabilities remain a vital component in the pursuit of a deeper understanding of quantum thermodynamics.
