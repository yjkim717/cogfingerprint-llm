Title: Unveiling Facet-Dependent Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity on Iridium Oxide Surfaces: A Quantum Mechanics Perspective

Abstract:
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a crucial process in various energy storage and conversion technologies. Iridium oxide (IrO2) has emerged as a promising electrocatalyst due to its high activity and stability. However, the underlying mechanisms governing its facet-dependent OER activity remain unclear. In this study, we employ grand canonical quantum mechanics (GC-QM) calculations to investigate the OER activity on five distinct IrO2 facets. Our results reveal a strong correlation between the surface atomic arrangement and the OER activity, with the (110) facet exhibiting the highest activity. The GC-QM calculations accurately capture the observed differences in activity across the various facets, attributing them to variations in the adsorption energies of key reaction intermediates. Our findings provide valuable insights into the design of high-performance IrO2-based electrocatalysts and highlight the importance of facet engineering in optimizing catalytic activity. This study contributes to the advancement of sustainable energy technologies by elucidating the fundamental principles governing OER activity on IrO2 surfaces.
