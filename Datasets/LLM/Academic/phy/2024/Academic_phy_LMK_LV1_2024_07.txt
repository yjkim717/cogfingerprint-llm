Title: Gravitational Waveforms from Spinless Massive Body Scattering: A Comparative Analysis of Quantum Amplitude and Classical Approaches

Abstract:
In this study, we investigate the gravitational waveform emitted during the scattering of spinless massive bodies, juxtaposing derivations grounded in quantum amplitude calculations with those rooted in classical post-Minkowskian (PM) and multipolar-post-Minkowskian (MPM) frameworks. By leveraging Newton's constant as a perturbative parameter, we systematically compute the waveform at leading order in the PM expansion. Our quantum amplitude-based derivation employs the KMOC formalism, whereas the classical derivation utilizes the MPM methodology, complemented by the application of the radiative multipole moments. The two approaches yield congruent results for the gravitational waveform, demonstrating the robustness of our analysis. This consistency underscores the efficacy of both quantum amplitude and classical methods in capturing the underlying physics of gravitational wave emission in spinless massive body scattering, thereby paving the way for further exploration of gravitational wave phenomena within the PM framework in 2024 and beyond.
