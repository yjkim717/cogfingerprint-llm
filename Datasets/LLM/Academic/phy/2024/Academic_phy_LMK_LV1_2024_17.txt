Title: Enhancing Polarization Multiplexing in Metasurfaces: A Dual-Layer Approach for Cross-Talk Reduction

Abstract:
The burgeoning field of metasurface optics has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, driven by the quest for multifunctional optical devices. A critical aspect of this pursuit is polarization multiplexing, which enables the manipulation of light's polarization state to encode multiple signals. However, conventional single-layer metasurfaces often suffer from limited polarization multiplexing capacity and cross-talk between channels. In this study, we propose a dual-layer metasurface architecture that synergistically combines the Jones matrix formalism with polarization multiplexing to mitigate cross-talk and enhance device functionality. By carefully designing the dual-layer structure, we demonstrate a significant reduction in cross-talk and a corresponding increase in polarization multiplexing capacity. Our results pave the way for the development of high-performance, multifunctional optical devices, with potential applications in optical communication, sensing, and imaging. The proposed dual-layer metasurface paradigm is poised to revolutionize the field of metasurface optics in 2024 and beyond.
