**Abstract**

Recent developments in relational quantum mechanics (RQM) necessitate a re-evaluation of core scientific tenets. This work investigates RQM’s implications for epistemology, specifically concerning the objectivity of quantum phenomena and the resultant erosion of traditional scientific credibility.  The inherent observer-dependence within RQM, exemplified by the “Alice” thought experiment, suggests a radical shift from classical, realist interpretations.  Consequently, this study argues that RQM compels a critical examination of established physics, raising fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the foundations of scientific discourse in 2024.
