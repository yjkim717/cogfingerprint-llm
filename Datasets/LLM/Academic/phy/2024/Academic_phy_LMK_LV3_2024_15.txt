Title: Lithiation-Induced Hierarchical Disordering for Reversible Electromagnetic Modulation in Semiconductive Oxides

Abstract:
This study presents an innovative electrochemical lithiation-driven hierarchical disordering approach to modulate electromagnetic properties in semiconductive oxides. By inducing dielectric polarization and controlling hierarchical disordering, we achieve reversible switching between electromagnetic transparency and absorption. Our findings demonstrate a significant advancement in electromagnetic modulation, paving the way for the development of intelligent electromagnetic devices. The proposed strategy enables dynamic control over electromagnetic properties, offering promising prospects for applications in electromagnetic shielding and adaptive devices in 2024 and beyond.
