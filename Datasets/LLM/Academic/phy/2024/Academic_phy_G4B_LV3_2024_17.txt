**Abstract**

Recent advancements in metasurface technology have yielded a novel approach to polarization control, specifically through the implementation of dual-layer designs. This study investigates the efficacy of dual-layer metasurfaces in achieving enhanced polarization multiplexing, demonstrating a substantial improvement over conventional single-layer counterparts. Utilizing a rigorous numerical simulation framework, we observed a marked reduction in polarization cross-talk – a critical limitation in previous metasurface architectures – attributable to the increased operational degrees of freedom afforded by the layered structure.  The resultant enhanced spectral separation facilitates the simultaneous manipulation of orthogonal polarization states. These findings suggest that dual-layer metasurfaces represent a promising pathway toward creating sophisticated multifunctional optical devices with applications ranging from advanced imaging to integrated photonics. Further research will focus on optimizing layer materials and geometric configurations for maximized performance.
