**Abstract**

Recent advancements in gravitational wave astronomy necessitate a refined understanding of waveform generation from binary black hole scattering. This work presents a novel derivation of gravitational waveforms, employing a one-loop post-Newtonian expansion and meticulously addressing previously unexamined subtleties within the amplitude calculation. Specifically, we demonstrate how incorporating corrections related to quantum amplitude fluctuations fundamentally impacts the classical waveform prediction.  Our analysis reveals three critical omissions in standard derivations, leading to discrepancies between quantum and classical descriptions at higher orders.  By systematically incorporating these corrections – pertaining to the influence of loop corrections on the scattering amplitude and the subsequent modification of the post-newtonian expansion – we achieve quantitative agreement between these frameworks.  These findings contribute to a more robust theoretical foundation for interpreting gravitational wave signals and offer a pathway towards improved parameter estimation for compact binary systems.
