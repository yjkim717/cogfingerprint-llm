**Abstract**

Quantum thermodynamics increasingly demands robust methodologies for characterizing energy exchange in complex many-body systems. This work introduces Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities as a novel approach to analyze quantum statistical properties of work and heat, specifically targeting observed anomalies in energy transfer. Utilizing this formalism, we demonstrate its applicability to systems exhibiting non-equilibrium behavior, exemplified by the Ising model. Traditional density matrix approaches often struggle to capture these subtleties, particularly within strongly correlated environments. Quasiprobabilities offer a geometric representation that facilitates the direct mapping of quantum states onto a phase space, allowing for a more intuitive understanding of thermodynamic trajectories.  The resultant quasiprobability distributions provide insights into the underlying quantum correlations driving anomalous heat flows.  Further investigation will explore the connection between these quasiprobabilities and measurement outcomes, aiming to quantify the influence of measurement on the observed thermodynamic properties and offering a pathway toward a more complete description of quantum work extraction.
