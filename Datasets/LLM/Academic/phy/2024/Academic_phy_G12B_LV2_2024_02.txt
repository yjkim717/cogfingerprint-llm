## All-Order Multi-Soft Limits from Binary Geometry and Split Factorizations in Scattering Amplitudes

This work presents a novel approach to calculating all-order multi-soft limits within scattering amplitudes, with significant implications for both particle physics and string theory. We demonstrate a rigorous connection between these limits and the mathematical framework of binary geometry, leveraging split factorization formalisms to achieve unprecedented computational control. Traditionally, the study of multi-soft behavior has been limited by the rapid growth in complexity with increasing numbers of soft particles. Our method circumvents this obstacle by exploiting the inherent structure of binary geometry, which provides a natural parametrization of these factorizations.

Specifically, we detail how this geometrical perspective allows for the systematic derivation of loop-integrated multi-soft limits in the context of $\phi^3$ theory, showcasing the viability of the approach beyond simple tree-level calculations. The resulting formalism offers a powerful tool for refining theoretical predictions in scenarios dominated by soft radiation, and provides a new avenue for exploring holographic dualities and the emergence of spacetime from quantum gravity.  These findings represent a significant advance in our ability to analyze and predict scattering phenomena in complex quantum field theories and string theory backgrounds.
