**Abstract**

The development of novel optical elements with tailored functionalities necessitates materials exhibiting precise control over electromagnetic interactions. This study investigates the utilization of tantalum pentoxide (Ta₂O₅) as a promising dielectric material for constructing high-performance dielectric metasurfaces. Leveraging reactive ion etching (RIE) techniques, we demonstrate the fabrication of sub-wavelength structures utilizing Ta₂O₅, achieving controlled refractive index modulation across the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (Vis) spectral regions.  Preliminary investigations reveal a significant degree of tunability, suggesting potential applications in wavefront shaping and advanced imaging. Specifically, we hypothesize that precisely engineered Ta₂O₅ metasurfaces can facilitate localized electromagnetic field control, enabling the realization of miniaturized lenses and holographic devices.  Future research will focus on optimizing RIE parameters to enhance feature resolution and explore the material’s long-term stability under operational conditions. This work establishes Ta₂O₅ as a viable candidate for realizing sophisticated dielectric metasurfaces, contributing to advancements in ultraviolet and visible optics.
