**Vibrational Synchronization as a Key Determinant of Photoisomerization Efficiency in Rhodopsin and Biomimetic Molecular Rotors**

The efficient conversion of light energy into chemical change remains a central challenge in photophysics and bio-inspired energy systems. This research explores the role of vibrational synchronization in modulating the photoisomerization dynamics of Rhodopsin, a prototypical light-activated protein, and a synthetic molecular rotor model. Utilizing femtosecond spectroscopy and computational modeling, we demonstrate a strong correlation between the coherent vibrational modes of the rotor and the rate of its photoisomerization. Specifically, controlled synchronization of these vibrational states significantly enhances the efficiency of isomerization, mirroring the observed behavior in Rhodopsin’s chromophore.  These findings suggest that vibrational coherence acts as a critical intermediate step, facilitating efficient energy transfer pathways.  Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms reveals a potential feedback loop wherein isomerization itself induces vibrational restructuring.  This work provides a mechanistic framework for optimizing light-harvesting systems and designing biomimetic rotors with enhanced photoresponsive properties, advancing our understanding of quantum-classical dynamics in biological and synthetic systems.
