 Here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a physics publication, based on the provided summary and targeting a 2024 context:

**Abstract**

The quest for a consistent theory of quantum gravity necessitates stringent criteria to distinguish viable models from those destined to lead to inconsistencies. The Swampland program, derived from string theory considerations, offers a set of such constraints, primarily focusing on the absence of global symmetries and the existence of light modes. Building upon this framework, we propose the introduction of a novel “black hole scale” as a potentially crucial parameter in defining a consistent quantum gravity landscape. This scale, representing the characteristic size of black holes at the Planck scale, is argued to be intimately linked to potential phase transitions within the theory. We posit that deviations from a specific relationship between the Planck scale, the species scale (defining the complexity of particle content), and the black hole scale can signal a violation of consistency, analogous to Swampland conditions. Our analysis suggests that black hole formation and evaporation processes, particularly at energies approaching the Planck scale, may impose constraints on the allowed parameter space of quantum gravity models. This “black hole Swampland condition” offers a new avenue for exploring the boundaries of theoretical consistency and potentially provides testable predictions concerning the behavior of spacetime at extremely high energies, contributing to the ongoing effort to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity.
