In the context of quantum gravity, the validity of effective field theories (EFTs) is constrained by the Swampland program, which delineates consistent low-energy theories from those incompatible with a UV completion. This work introduces a third fundamental scale, Λ_BH, defined as the energy scale corresponding to the minimal black hole temperature at which the semiclassical Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and associated thermodynamic free energy are reliably computed within the EFT framework. We establish that Λ_BH provides a sharp cutoff, distinct from the Planck scale and the species scale, beyond which standard gravitational EFT computations for black hole thermodynamics break down. We rigorously derive this scale and demonstrate its interplay with the Swampland Distance Conjecture and the Covariant Entropy Bound. Consequently, we postulate a new Swampland condition: any EFT coupled to gravity must have its cutoff bounded above by Λ_BH to ensure consistency with quantum gravitational principles. This proposal refines the Swampland criteria and has profound implications for model-building in quantum gravity and cosmology.
