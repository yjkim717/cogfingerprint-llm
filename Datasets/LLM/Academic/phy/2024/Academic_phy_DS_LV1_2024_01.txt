**Abstract**

We demonstrate a rigorous duality mapping between the quantum harmonic oscillator and a class of classical stochastic systems governed by hidden variables. This correspondence is established by constructing an isomorphism between the oscillator's Hilbert space and a classical phase space augmented with a probabilistic measure derived from the hidden variable distribution. Crucially, we prove that the Born rule probabilities, \(P(x)=|\psi(x)|^2\), emerge as marginal distributions over these hidden degrees of freedom, thereby reproducing all statistical predictions of the quantum model. This framework resolves the apparent logical conflict between deterministic classical underpinnings and observed quantum statistics by showing that quantum superposition and interference are isomorphic to specific, non-local correlations among the classical variables. The duality provides a novel interpretive lens, suggesting that key quantum phenomena in this foundational system can be viewed as emergent from a causally local, albeit epistemically inaccessible, classical substrate. This result challenges the conventional boundary between quantum and classical descriptions, offering a potential pathway for re-contextualizing quantumness in more complex systems.
