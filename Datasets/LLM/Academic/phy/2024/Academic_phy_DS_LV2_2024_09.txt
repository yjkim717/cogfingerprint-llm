In high-dimensional astrophysical modeling, conventional validation metrics often fail to capture the full complexity of generative model outputs. We introduce a data-space validation framework leveraging sample quantiles of observables to rigorously assess predictive performance in high-dimensional regimes. Our method constructs empirical confidence bands from simulated data realizations and compares them against observed distributions through quantile-based discrepancy measures. Applied to galaxy photometry data—where traditional low-dimensional summaries discard significant information—this approach robustly identifies systematic biases in generative models that remain undetected by standard metrics. The methodology demonstrates particular utility for validating cosmological simulations against multi-band imaging surveys, revealing subtle mismatches in color distributions and morphological properties. This work establishes sample quantiles as powerful diagnostics for high-dimensional model fidelity, providing astronomers with principled tools to improve physical models through comprehensive data-space validation.
