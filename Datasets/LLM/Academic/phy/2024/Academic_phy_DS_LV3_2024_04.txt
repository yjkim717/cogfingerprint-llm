In the ongoing quest to refine the effective field theory (EFT) landscape of quantum gravity, the identification of reliable energy scales remains paramount. This work investigates the thermodynamic implications of a novel third scale, Λ_BH, recently posited to reside below both the Planck and species scales. We demonstrate that Λ_BH demarcates a critical phase transition in the microscopic description of black holes, representing the minimal temperature at which semiclassical entropy and free energy calculations remain robust within the EFT framework. Our analysis confirms that the breakdown of these thermodynamic descriptions below Λ_BH is not merely a computational artifact but a fundamental signature of the underlying quantum gravity regime. Consequently, we formalize the existence of Λ_BH as a new Swampland criterion, arguing that any purported low-energy EFT inconsistent with this thermodynamic cutoff must be relegated to the Swampland. This provides a powerful new tool for constraining viable particle physics models coupled to gravity, directly linking black hole thermodynamics to the consistency of the quantum gravitational landscape.
