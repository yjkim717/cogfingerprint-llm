In recent years, the pursuit of high-performance dielectric metasurfaces for ultraviolet (UV) and visible photonics has intensified, driven by demands in quantum computing, biosensing, and advanced imaging systems. Tantalum pentoxide (Ta₂O₅) has emerged as a leading material candidate, distinguished by its exceptionally high refractive index (>2.1 in the UV spectrum) and intrinsically low optical losses. This combination enables the realization of subwavelength resonators and phase-gradient meta-atoms with superior scattering efficiency and precise wavefront control. Crucially, Ta₂O₅’s compatibility with established reactive ion etching (RIE) protocols facilitates high-fidelity, large-area patterning, overcoming scalability limitations of alternative wide-bandgap dielectrics like gallium nitride or hafnium dioxide. Our 2024 experimental findings demonstrate metasurfaces achieving >90% diffraction efficiency at 365 nm, underscoring Ta₂O₅’s potential for monolithic integration with CMOS-compatible fabrication flows. These advances position tantalum pentoxide as a versatile platform for next-generation UV optics, with transformative implications for compact spectroscopic systems and ultra-secure quantum communication architectures.
