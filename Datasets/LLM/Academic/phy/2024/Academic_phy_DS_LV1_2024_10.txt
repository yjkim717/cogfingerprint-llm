In this 2024 study, we employ grand canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT) and microkinetic modeling to elucidate the facet-dependent electrocatalytic activity of rutile IrO₂ for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Our computational framework explicitly accounts for the potential-dependent stabilization of surface adsorbates—specifically *O, *OH, and *OOH intermediates—across the (110), (100), and (101) crystallographic orientations. We demonstrate that the relative OER activity, quantified via theoretical overpotentials, is governed by potential-induced shifts in the potential-determining step, which vary significantly between facets due to differences in local coordination and surface polarity. The (110) facet exhibits optimal *O–*OH coupling, leading to a lower kinetic barrier for O–O bond formation, whereas the (101) surface shows pronounced adsorbate–adsorbate repulsion under reaction conditions. These insights, validated by single-facet electrochemical measurements, establish a grand canonical perspective for rational design of facet-engineered oxide electrocatalysts, moving beyond ground-state adsorption energetics to potential-explicit activity descriptors.
