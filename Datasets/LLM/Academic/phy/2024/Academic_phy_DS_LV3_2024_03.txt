In this 2024 theoretical study, we establish that black hole-induced decoherence in quantum systems manifests universal characteristics analogous to finite-temperature environments. Through effective field theory methods, we demonstrate quantitative parallels between gravitational decoherence and dissipative processes in ordinary matter. Our analysis reveals that event horizon fluctuations generate decoherence patterns consistent with thermal quantum systems, providing a unified framework for understanding information loss across microscopic and astrophysical scales. These findings bridge black hole thermodynamics with open quantum system dynamics, offering new insights into quantum-gravitational phenomena under realistic conditions.
