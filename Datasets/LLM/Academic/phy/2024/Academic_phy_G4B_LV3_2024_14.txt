**Abstract**

Recent advancements in black hole thermodynamics have prompted a novel investigation into the underlying structure of black hole states, specifically leveraging the framework of topological defects. This work presents a theoretical framework for four universal topological classifications of black hole states, predicated on their observed thermodynamic behavior. Utilizing a combination of generalized hydrodynamic approaches and considerations of Hawking temperature fluctuations, we demonstrate that these classifications reveal previously unappreciated instabilities – particularly localized temperature gradients – alongside robust, stable configurations.  Crucially, these classifications exhibit scale invariance, offering a potential pathway towards a more complete understanding of quantum gravity effects near black hole horizons.  Furthermore, our analysis suggests a hierarchical structure within these classifications, correlating black hole size and temperature regimes with distinct topological signatures.  These findings contribute to a growing body of research exploring the connections between black hole physics, defect theory, and the pursuit of a unified quantum theory of gravity, offering a new lens through which to examine universal black hole classifications in 2024.
