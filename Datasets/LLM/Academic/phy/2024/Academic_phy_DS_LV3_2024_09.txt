In 2024, the validation of high-dimensional physical models remains a central challenge, particularly for generative frameworks simulating complex systems. This study introduces a rigorous data-space validation methodology that leverages sample quantiles to systematically evaluate predictive performance. By constructing empirical distributions from both observed data and model outputs, we quantify discrepancies across the full probabilistic structure rather than relying on moment-based metrics alone. The approach is demonstrated on state-of-the-art generative models for galaxy photometry, where high-dimensional spectral energy distributions are reduced to interpretable quantile sequences. Our analysis reveals that traditional goodness-of-fit tests often overlook structured residuals in tail behavior, which are critical for astrophysical inference. The proposed technique provides a computationally tractable framework for identifying model misspecification in high-dimensional spaces, establishing a new standard for robustness in cosmological simulations. This advancement enables more reliable parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification in next-generation sky surveys.
