**Abstract**

The rational design of molecular rotors with targeted photoisomerization quantum yields necessitates a predictive understanding of how specific vibrational modes govern nonadiabatic dynamics at conical intersections. In this work, we employ quantum-classical trajectory surface hopping simulations to elucidate the mechanistic role of promoter vibrations in a series of structurally related cyanostilbene-derived rotors. Our analysis reveals that the photoisomerization efficiency is not merely a function of the energy barrier but is critically dependent on the transient synchronization of a key torsional reaction coordinate with high-frequency, auxiliary vibrational modes in the excited state. This synchronized motion dynamically funnels the wavepacket through the conical intersection seam, significantly enhancing the reaction probability. These findings establish vibrational synchronization as a fundamental design principle for controlling quantum efficiency in synthetic molecular machines, offering a new paradigm that moves beyond static structural considerations to embrace dynamic, mode-specific photochemical control.
