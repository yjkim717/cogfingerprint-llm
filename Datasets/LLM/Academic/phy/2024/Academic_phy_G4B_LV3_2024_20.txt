**Abstract:**

The observed dark matter relic density presents a significant challenge to standard cosmological models. This work explores a Conformal Freeze-In (CF-in) scenario, predicated on a dark sector interacting with active neutrinos via a neutrino portal. We posit that this interaction generates dark matter particles through a process wherein the dark sector’s thermal abundance is suppressed due to conformal symmetry, effectively “freezing in” a stable dark matter component at a specific mass scale.  The CF-in mechanism offers a compelling framework for simultaneously addressing dark matter production and potentially generating neutrino masses, aligning with constraints from oscillation experiments.  Numerical simulations demonstrate the model’s sensitivity to the strength of the neutrino portal coupling, allowing for precise predictions regarding the dark matter mass and its impact on cosmological observables. Further investigation is warranted to fully delineate the implications for both dark matter and neutrino physics.
