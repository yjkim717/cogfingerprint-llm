**Abstract**

The experimental inaccessibility of strong-field gravitational phenomena necessitates the development of analog quantum simulators. We propose and analyze a novel platform for simulating (1+1)-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs) on curved spacetimes using engineered spin-lattice systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with spatially varying couplings maps exactly to the Dirac equation for a massless Majorana fermion in a conformally flat spacetime geometry. This mapping allows for the direct implementation of cosmological metrics, such as the Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime, where the expansion rate is encoded in the local, time-dependent spin-spin interaction strength.

Within this framework, we investigate two quintessential relativistic phenomena. First, we show that a non-adiabatic quench of the transverse field, corresponding to a rapid cosmological expansion, results in the deterministic production of fermionic quasiparticle pairs from the vacuum. The observed particle spectrum aligns with the predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, providing a direct analog of cosmological particle creation. Second, we model a spacetime with a Rindler horizon by engineering a coupling gradient that induces a linear variation in the effective Fermi velocity. We report the observation of a thermal population of quasiparticles in the ground state from the perspective of an accelerated observer, constituting a direct measurement of the Unruh effect in a condensed-matter system. These results establish spin systems as a robust and versatile testbed for probing the interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity, opening pathways to studying black hole thermodynamics and the quantum nature of gravity in the laboratory.
