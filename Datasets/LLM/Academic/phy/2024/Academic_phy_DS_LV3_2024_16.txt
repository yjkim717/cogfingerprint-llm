In this 2024 investigation, we establish that non-minimally coupled electromagnetic theories retain identical asymptotic symmetry structures as their free counterparts, despite introducing scalar field interactions. Through rigorous asymptotic analysis at null infinity, we demonstrate that the asymptotic symmetry group remains characterized by angle-dependent U(1) gauge transformations, preserving the infinite-dimensional structure previously known for free Maxwell theory. However, the inclusion of scalar couplings fundamentally constrains the duality symmetry manifest in the free theory. Our results reveal that while electric-magnetic duality persists as a local property of the field equations, the asymptotic boundary conditions reduce the full SL(2,R) duality group to its compact U(1) subgroup. This work provides crucial insights into how interactions modify fundamental symmetries in gauge theories while preserving asymptotic structures, with implications for infrared physics and memory effects in interacting field theories.
