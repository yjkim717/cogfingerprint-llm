Input: Keywords: relational quantum mechanics, solipsism, science credibility, quantum physics, c. rovelli Summary: C. Rovelli's paper explores the potential impact of relational quantum mechanics on the perceived validity of scientific endeavors, specifically examining claims suggesting it challenges the foundations of science.

Output: Abstract: Recent developments in relational quantum mechanics, as articulated by C. Rovelli, necessitate a re-evaluation of established scientific paradigms. This paper investigates the philosophical implications of these theories, particularly concerning the notion of an objective reality. Specifically, we examine how relational interpretations potentially introduce solipsistic undercurrents, thereby impacting broader science credibility and demanding critical assessment of foundational assumptions within quantum physics by 2024.
