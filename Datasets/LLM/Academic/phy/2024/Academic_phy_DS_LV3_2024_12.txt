In this study, we employ comparative quantum-classical dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic principles governing photoisomerization quantum efficiency in synthetic molecular rotors. Our findings demonstrate that vibrational synchronization, mediated by auxiliary promoter groups, serves as the critical determinant of nonadiabatic transition probabilities. While biological systems like Rhodopsin inherently exploit dual coherent mechanisms—vibrational pre-tuning and conical intersection accessibility—to achieve near-unity efficiency, biomimetic rotor MeO-NAIP replicates this behavior only under solvent-free conditions. Through wavepacket dynamics and Franck-Condon analysis, we identify solvent-induced decoherence as the primary factor disrupting synchronized motion in synthetic analogs. These results establish vibrational coherence engineering as a fundamental design strategy for high-performance molecular photonics, with implications for next-generation optoelectronic materials and artificial photosynthesis systems. The 2024 experimental validation of these predictions marks a paradigm shift in controlling photochemical pathways through tailored molecular architectures.
