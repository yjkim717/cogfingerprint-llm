In this 2024 study, we advance the topological classification of black hole thermodynamics by characterizing four universal classes of black hole states as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. Through systematic analysis of the Hawking temperature and horizon radius dependencies, we demonstrate how these defect configurations correspond to distinct thermodynamic stability behaviorsâ€”revealing both stable and metastable phases across different temperature regimes. Our geometric framework identifies critical points where thermodynamic curvature diverges, providing new insights into phase transitions and black hole remnants. These classifications persist across both classical and semi-classical regimes, suggesting fundamental constraints on possible quantum gravity corrections. The results establish topology as an organizing principle for black hole thermodynamics, with implications for holographic duality and the microstructure of spacetime.
