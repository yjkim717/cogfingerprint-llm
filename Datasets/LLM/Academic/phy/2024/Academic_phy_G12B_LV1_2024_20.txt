Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, aiming for a formal, academic style suitable for a physics publication in 2024. I've focused on expanding the concept and adding some plausible theoretical details.  I've also aimed for a word count around 226.  Please read the notes at the end after the abstract, as they explain some of the choices I made.

**Conformal Freeze-In Dark Matter via a Neutrino Portal and Pseudo-Goldstone Boson Dynamics**

We present a novel dark sector model predicated on the principle of conformal invariance, offering a compelling framework to address both the dark matter puzzle and the origin of active neutrino masses. Our model features a pseudo-Goldstone boson (PGB) dark sector interacting with the Standard Model (SM) via a neutrino portal – specifically, a Yukawa coupling to a right-handed neutrino. The PGB sector is constructed to exhibit approximate conformal symmetry, leading to a suppression of ultraviolet sensitivity and naturally mitigating the hierarchy problems typically encountered in traditional dark matter models.  We explore a “conformal freeze-in” mechanism where dark matter production occurs primarily through non-perturbative interactions mediated by the neutrino portal as the Universe cools. This freeze-in scenario is highly sensitive to the scale of conformal breaking, which we relate to the PGB mass and the strength of the neutrino Yukawa coupling.  We perform a detailed numerical analysis, demonstrating that viable dark matter relic abundances can be achieved for a wide range of parameter space, while simultaneously providing a naturally suppressed mechanism for generating the observed neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism. Furthermore, we investigate the phenomenological implications for low-energy neutrino experiments, considering potential signatures accessible to current and future detectors. Our results suggest a potentially testable connection between the dark sector, neutrino mass generation, and conformal field theory.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Extensions:**

*   **Pseudo-Goldstone Boson (PGB):** I felt this was a logical extension of "conformal field theory" and provided a more concrete particle type to discuss. PGBs are often associated with approximate conformal symmetry.
*   **Conformal Freeze-In:**  This term isn't standard, but it combines the two key concepts. The idea is that the conformal invariance influences the freeze-in process.
*   **Neutrino Portal Specificity:**  Mentioning the right-handed neutrino clarifies the type of interaction.
*   **Hierarchy Problem Mitigation:** This is a common motivation for conformal invariance – it helps stabilize parameters.
*   **Seesaw Mechanism:** I included this because neutrino portal models often naturally link to the seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation.
*   **Phenomenological Implications:**  I added a sentence about low-energy neutrino experiments to suggest testability.
*   **Year Context (2024):** This informed the inclusion of considerations for *current* and *future* experiments, reflecting the state of the field.
*   **Technical Detail:** I intentionally avoided getting *too* bogged down in detailed calculations (which would be in the body of the paper), focusing on broader conceptual elements suitable for an abstract.
*   **Further Development:**  A full paper would require significantly more detail on the specific conformal group, the scale of conformal breaking, and the full parameter space exploration.



I hope this is a good starting point!
