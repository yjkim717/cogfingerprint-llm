Title: Advancing Ultraviolet Optics with Tantalum Pentoxide Dielectric Metasurfaces

Abstract:
In a significant advancement in the field of photonics, tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) emerges as a promising material platform for high-performance dielectric metasurface optics. This study demonstrates the efficacy of Ta2O5-based metasurfaces in the ultraviolet (UV) and visible spectral regions, showcasing their potential to revolutionize optical devices. By harnessing the high refractive index and low absorption properties of Ta2O5, the proposed metasurfaces achieve efficient beam manipulation and spectral control. The results indicate that Ta2O5-based dielectric metasurfaces can operate with high transmission efficiency and polarization control, paving the way for novel applications in UV optics, spectroscopy, and optical sensing. This research contributes to the ongoing development of metasurface optics, enabling innovative solutions for high-performance optical systems in 2024 and beyond. The findings underscore the vast potential of Ta2O5 in advancing the field of photonics.
