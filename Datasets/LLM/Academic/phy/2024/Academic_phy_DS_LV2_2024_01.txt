This study establishes a rigorous mathematical framework demonstrating that the quantum harmonic oscillator can be fully reconstructed from an underlying classical statistical theory with hidden variables. We show that the Hilbert space structure and the associated quantum probabilities are not fundamental but emergent from a classical phase space ensemble governed by Liouville's theorem. The core of our analysis is a non-trivial duality mapping: the quantum ground state corresponds to a classical equilibrium distribution, while excited states are mapped to specific, dynamically constrained sub-ensembles. This mapping preserves all expectation values and commutation relations, effectively embedding the quantum formalism within a classical probabilistic description. Crucially, we prove that the apparent non-commutativity of quantum observables arises from the topology of the hidden variable space and the information-loss associated with coarse-graining to the quantum level. This result challenges the conventional interpretation of the wavefunction's ontological status, suggesting it represents a statistical feature of a deeper, deterministic classical reality. Our work provides a concrete counterexample to the presumed necessity of quantum axioms and opens pathways for reinterpreting quantum field theories in classical terms.
