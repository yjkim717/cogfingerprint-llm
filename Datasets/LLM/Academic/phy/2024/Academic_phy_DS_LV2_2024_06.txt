**Abstract**

This article synthesizes and expands upon the findings of a recent expert colloquium on the forefront of black hole physics, delineating the critical juncture between theoretical prediction and observational verification. We present a comprehensive analysis of the critical challenges and emergent research avenues for 2024 and beyond. A primary focus is the theoretical and phenomenological modelling of black hole evaporation via Hawking radiation, a process that necessitates a self-consistent theory of quantum gravity. We evaluate the capacity of current and next-generation observational facilities—spanning gravitational wave interferometers, very-long-baseline interferometry, and X-ray polarimetry—to provide empirical constraints on semi-classical and quantum-gravitational models. This discussion is intrinsically linked to the fundamental question of black hole stability within the framework of general relativity, particularly in light of potential quantum corrections. We argue that the confluence of multi-messenger astrophysics and refined theoretical frameworks is poised to subject the foundational principles of gravitational physics to unprecedented empirical scrutiny, potentially heralding a new era of discovery that bridges the quantum and cosmological realms.
