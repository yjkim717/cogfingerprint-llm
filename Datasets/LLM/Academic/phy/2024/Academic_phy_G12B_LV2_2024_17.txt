**Abstract**

The burgeoning demand for high-capacity optical communication systems necessitates innovative approaches to data transmission. Polarization multiplexing (PolM) offers a compelling solution by leveraging the orthogonal polarization states of light to increase the data throughput. However, conventional metasurface-based PolM implementations often suffer from limited multiplexing capacity and significant cross-talk between polarization channels, hindering practical application. This work investigates the potential of dual-layer metasurface architectures to overcome these limitations. We demonstrate, through rigorous electromagnetic simulations and analysis, that strategically designed dual-layer metasurfaces provide enhanced degrees of freedom for independent polarization control, leading to improved multiplexing performance. Specifically, the spatial separation afforded by the layered design mitigates inter-polarization interference and significantly reduces cross-talk compared to single-layer counterparts. Our findings reveal a direct correlation between layer interaction and the suppression of unwanted polarization coupling, enabling a more robust and efficient PolM system. These results represent a significant advancement in metasurface optics, paving the way for higher-density PolM systems and contributing to the development of next-generation optical communication technologies. Further research will focus on fabrication challenges and experimental validation of these designs.
