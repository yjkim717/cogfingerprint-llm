**Abstract: A Novel Scale of Quantum Gravity â€“ Lambda<sub>BH</sub>**

Recent theoretical developments in quantum gravity necessitate a refined understanding of phase transitions within the Planck and black hole scales. This work introduces a hitherto largely unexplored scale, designated Lambda<sub>BH</sub>, predicated on a critical reorganization of black hole entropy and free energy. We posit that Lambda<sub>BH</sub> lies demonstrably below the species scale, marking a fundamental shift in the landscape of quantum gravity.  

Our analysis leverages the swampland condition, arguing that deviations from classical general relativity become increasingly significant at this lower scale. Specifically, we propose that the emergence of Lambda<sub>BH</sub> corresponds to a spontaneous symmetry breaking, altering the effective dimensionality of spacetime and impacting the relationship between gravitational and thermodynamic properties.  Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanism driving this transition and its potential implications for cosmology and the very nature of spacetime at the most fundamental level.  This scale offers a potentially crucial bridge between established concepts and the elusive quantum theory of gravity.
