This erratum presents updated numerical calibrations and revised figures for the Cepheid distance scale, incorporating recent high-precision photometric data. We re-evaluate the metallicity sensitivity of the Wesenheit Leavitt Law, a pivotal period-luminosity relation used in extragalactic distance determinations. Our refined analysis, employing an expanded sample of Cepheids with homogeneous metallicity measurements, robustly confirms the original conclusion: no statistically significant correlation exists between Cepheid-based distances and stellar metallicity. This null result, achieved through rigorous Bayesian regression techniques, strengthens the foundation of the cosmic distance ladder and mitigates a key systematic uncertainty in the determination of the Hubble constant, thereby reinforcing the standard candle validity of Cepheid variables in diverse galactic environments.
