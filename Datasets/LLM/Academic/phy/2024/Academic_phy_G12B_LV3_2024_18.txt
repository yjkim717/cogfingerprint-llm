**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of dielectric metasurface optics demands materials exhibiting high refractive index contrast and broad spectral tunability. This work investigates tantalum pentoxide (Ta₂O₅) as a promising platform for realizing advanced optical functionalities across the ultraviolet (UV) and visible spectrum. We demonstrate the potential of Ta₂O₅ to enable efficient modulation of light fields through carefully designed metasurface geometries. Unlike conventional plasmonic metasurfaces, dielectric structures based on Ta₂O₅ offer reduced losses and enhanced compatibility with UV wavelengths. Furthermore, we address critical scalability challenges inherent in existing dielectric materials such as titanium dioxide, presenting a pathway towards large-area fabrication. Our findings suggest Ta₂O₅ represents a significant advancement in dielectric metasurface design, paving the way for novel applications in areas including UV imaging, advanced optical sensing, and compact photonic devices.
