Title: Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Modulation through Hierarchical Disorder in Semiconductive Oxides via Electrochemical Lithiation

Abstract:
The burgeoning demand for adaptive electromagnetic devices necessitates innovative materials with dynamically tunable properties. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of electrochemical lithiation in modulating the electromagnetic response of semiconductive oxides by tailoring their atomic-scale dielectric polarization. By inducing hierarchical disorder through lithiation, we achieve a reversible and non-volatile modulation of the electromagnetic properties, facilitating the development of reconfigurable electromagnetic switching architectures. Our findings reveal that the lithiation-induced polarization engineering enables a pronounced variation in the dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity of the oxides, thereby allowing for a dynamically tunable electromagnetic response. The proposed lithiation-mediated modulation paradigm offers a promising pathway for the design of next-generation electromagnetic devices with adaptive functionalities, thereby paving the way for advancements in fields such as electromagnetic sensing, communication, and energy harvesting.
