Title: Simulating Curved Spacetime Dynamics with Topological Quantum Systems: A Majorana Fermion Approach

Abstract:

The intersection of quantum field theory and condensed matter physics has led to innovative approaches in simulating complex spacetime geometries. In this work, we demonstrate that a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model on a ring, described by the Ising model with a transverse field, can effectively simulate the dynamics of Majorana fermions in curved spacetimes. By exploiting the topological properties of this system, we establish a correspondence between the lattice model and the Dirac equation in (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. Specifically, we show that the FLRW metric, a cornerstone of modern cosmology, can be emulated by suitably tuning the coupling strengths and external fields in the spin model. Furthermore, we investigate the Unruh effect, a phenomenon where an accelerating observer perceives a thermal bath, and demonstrate that our lattice model can capture the essential features of this effect. Our results provide a novel framework for exploring the interplay between quantum mechanics, relativity, and topology, with potential applications in quantum simulation and quantum computing. By leveraging the versatility of topological quantum systems, we pave the way for the experimental realization of complex spacetime geometries and the exploration of fundamental phenomena in a controlled laboratory setting. This work, conducted in 2024, contributes to the ongoing effort to unify quantum field theory and condensed matter physics, shedding new light on the intricate relationships between spacetime, matter, and energy.
