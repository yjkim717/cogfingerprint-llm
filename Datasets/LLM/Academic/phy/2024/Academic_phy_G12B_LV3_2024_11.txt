**Abstract**

Recent theoretical advancements have explored novel avenues for simulating quantum field theory (QFT) phenomena in condensed matter systems. This work presents a rigorous mapping between a two-dimensional quantum field theory defined on curved spacetimes and a spin-1/2 model localized on a ring geometry. Specifically, we demonstrate a correspondence wherein the dynamics of a scalar field in curved backgrounds are effectively replicated by the evolution of a system of interacting quantum spins. This emergent duality offers a potentially transformative approach to studying QFT in gravitational settings, circumventing the computational challenges inherent in traditional approaches. We focus on the implications for understanding particle production processes, particularly those arising from the Unruh effect, a hallmark of accelerated observers in flat spacetime. Our analysis reveals that the Unruh mode creation can be faithfully emulated by observing specific correlations and entanglement structures within the spin system. This provides a pathway towards experimentally verifying predictions of QFT in curved spacetime, leveraging the advancements in precision measurements of quantum spin networks.  The framework presented here, incorporating Majorana fermion analogues, holds promise for future investigations into more complex QFT models and potentially facilitates the exploration of quantum gravity phenomena accessible through condensed matter analogues.
