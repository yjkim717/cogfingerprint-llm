**Abstract**

Recent investigations into photoisomerization processes within molecular rotors, exemplified by both biological systems like rhodopsin and synthetic analogues such as MeO-NAIP, highlight the pivotal role of vibrational dynamics. Employing quantum-classical trajectory simulations, this study elucidates a mechanism wherein vibrational synchronization, specifically involving ‘promoter’ vibrational modes, significantly enhances the efficiency of photoinduced molecular rearrangements. Our findings demonstrate that coherent coupling between electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, mediated by these promoter vibrations, facilitates directed energy flow and overcomes competing non-radiative decay channels.  The observed correlation between vibrational coherence lifetimes and isomerization yields suggests a pathway toward optimizing quantum efficiency. This work provides valuable insights into fundamental photophysical processes and proposes design principles for constructing artificial molecular switches and light-harvesting systems with improved performance, aligning with ongoing efforts to engineer artificial photosynthesis and advanced optoelectronic devices. Further research will focus on exploring the impact of environmental coupling on these synchronization phenomena.
