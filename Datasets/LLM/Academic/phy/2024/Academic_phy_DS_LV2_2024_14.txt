In this study, we present a comprehensive topological classification of black hole thermodynamic states within the framework of general relativity and quantum gravity. By analyzing the global structure of the thermodynamic parameter space, we identify four distinct topological classes characterized by their stability properties under variations of the Hawking temperature and other thermodynamic potentials. Our methodology employs differential topology to map critical points and phase transitions, revealing universal behavior across diverse black hole families. The results demonstrate that each topological class governs specific stability regimes, with implications for black hole evolution and holographic duality. This classification provides a unifying principle for understanding black hole thermodynamics and establishes a foundation for exploring quantum gravitational effects in strongly curved spacetimes.
