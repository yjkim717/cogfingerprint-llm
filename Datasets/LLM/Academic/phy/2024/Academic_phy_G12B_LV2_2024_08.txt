**Abstract**

Recent discourse within foundational quantum physics has explored the implications of relational quantum mechanics (RQM) for the objectivity of scientific knowledge. This work examines arguments, as articulated by Rovelli and others, positing that a consistently relational interpretation, wherein observation and system definition are inextricably linked, may challenge the traditional demarcation between science and solipsism. We critically assess the potential for undermining empirical validity within RQM frameworks, considering its impact on relational understandings of physical reality and the broader implications for scientific methodology in 2024.
