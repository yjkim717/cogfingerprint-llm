In this 2024 theoretical study, we extend Gerard 't Hooft's foundational work on the quantum-classical duality by rigorously constructing a deterministic hidden variable model for the quantum harmonic oscillator. Our framework demonstrates that the complete quantum description of this system within its infinite-dimensional Hilbert space can be exactly reproduced by an underlying classical system exhibiting uniform circular motion. The model posits that the seemingly probabilistic outcomes of quantum measurements are fundamentally governed by a classical probability distribution over the hidden variables, which correspond to well-defined initial phases of the classical motion. We prove that this construction does not violate the precepts of quantum logic but rather provides an ontological substrate for its epistemological rules. The quantum probabilities, as calculated via the Born rule, emerge precisely from averaging over these unknown but classical initial conditions. This result challenges the conventional interpretation of quantum randomness as irreducible, suggesting instead that certain quantum systems can be understood as emergent from deterministic, local, and classical mechanical laws.
