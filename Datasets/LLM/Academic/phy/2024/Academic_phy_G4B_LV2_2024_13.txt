**Abstract: Quasiprobability Approaches to Quantum Thermodynamics and Many-Body Systems**

The characterization of quantum statistical mechanics remains a significant challenge, particularly when extending established thermodynamic frameworks to complex many-body systems. This work introduces a novel application of quasiprobability theory as a tool for investigating quantum thermodynamics, aiming to bridge the gap between quantum mechanics and observable thermodynamic quantities. We leverage quasiprobabilities – a non-diagonal representation of quantum states – to facilitate the analysis of energy exchange anomalies and emergent phenomena observed in interacting quantum systems. 

Specifically, we examine the utility of quasiprobability formalism in the context of Kirkwood-Dirac models, a widely utilized approach for describing correlated many-body systems. By transforming quantum states into quasiprobability space, we gain enhanced analytical tractability, enabling a more direct mapping between quantum mechanical properties and thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity and entropy. This approach allows for a systematic investigation of the interplay between quantum entanglement, many-body correlations, and thermodynamic behavior. 

Our investigation highlights the potential of quasiprobabilities to provide a more intuitive and computationally efficient pathway for understanding the fundamental principles governing quantum thermodynamics. Furthermore, we explore the implications of measurement outcomes within this framework, suggesting a connection between the act of measurement and the emergence of thermodynamic properties. Future research will focus on extending these methods to more sophisticated many-body models and exploring their applicability in characterizing novel quantum materials and devices.
