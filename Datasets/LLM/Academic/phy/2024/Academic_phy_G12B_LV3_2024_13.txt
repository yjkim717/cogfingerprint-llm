**Quasiprobability Formalism for Analyzing Quantum Thermodynamic Signatures in Many-Body Systems**

The burgeoning field of quantum thermodynamics necessitates robust tools for characterizing energy flow and statistical behavior in quantum systems undergoing thermodynamic transformations. This work explores the utility of quasiprobability formalisms, specifically the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability representation, as a powerful analytical framework for investigating quantum statistics of work, heat, and energy exchanges within many-body systems. Unlike classical probability distributions, KD quasiprobabilities permit the description of quantum trajectories, thereby offering insights into the impact of quantum correlations and Hamiltonian constraints on thermodynamic outcomes. We demonstrate how deviations from classical thermodynamic expectations manifest as anomalies in the quasiprobability space, directly attributable to entanglement and non-classical correlations. Furthermore, we investigate the challenges posed by Hamiltonian incompatibility, a frequent occurrence in open quantum systems, and how these challenges influence the interpretation of quasiprobability-derived thermodynamic quantities. The application of this approach to model systems reveals a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum correlations, energy transfer, and thermodynamic irreversibility, providing a crucial pathway towards developing more accurate and predictive models of quantum thermodynamic processes relevant to emerging quantum technologies.
