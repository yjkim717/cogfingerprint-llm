**Abstract**

Recent advancements in quantum simulation offer a novel pathway to investigate theoretical concepts previously inaccessible through conventional methods. This work presents a framework utilizing spin systems to emulate quantum field theories within curved spacetimes, specifically leveraging the correspondence between simplified spin models and relativistic field descriptions. We demonstrate this principle through an analysis of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric, mapping its dynamics onto an Ising-type spin model, and subsequently exploring the emergent behavior of Majorana fermions within this simulated environment.  

Our investigation reveals the potential of this approach to probe fundamental phenomena such as the Unruh effect – the perceived acceleration of an observer in a uniformly accelerating frame – and to quantify entanglement entropy in curved spacetime geometries. The Ising model’s inherent simplicity allows for tractable numerical simulations, providing a foundation for exploring more complex QFTs.  Further research will focus on extending this methodology to incorporate higher-dimensional spacetimes and investigating the impact of topological order on the simulated quantum field dynamics.
