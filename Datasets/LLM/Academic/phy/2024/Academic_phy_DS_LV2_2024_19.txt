The burgeoning synergy between quantum optics and flat optics has catalyzed transformative advances in quantum light source engineering. This review systematically examines the integration of quantum emitters with dielectric and plasmonic metasurfaces to realize high-efficiency, on-chip quantum light sources. We analyze how subwavelength meta-atoms enable precise wavefront shaping of quantum states, facilitating the generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs with unprecedented purity and brightness. The discussion encompasses resonant enhancement mechanisms, spectral control, and directional emission properties afforded by Mie-resonant and bound states in the continuum architectures. Furthermore, we critically assess scalable fabrication methodologies and heterogeneous integration approaches pivotal for transitioning these systems from laboratory demonstrations to deployable quantum technologies. The convergence of flat optics with quantum emitters presents a paradigm shift for quantum information processing, sensing, and communications, heralding new frontiers in integrated quantum photonics.
