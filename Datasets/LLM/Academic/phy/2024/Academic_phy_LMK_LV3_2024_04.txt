In the pursuit of a consistent theory of quantum gravity, we introduce the $\Lambda_{\text{m BH}}$ scale, marking a critical temperature threshold for neutral black holes. This novel scale is proposed as a Swampland condition, constraining the landscape of effective field theories. By analyzing the black hole scale and species scale, we demonstrate that $\Lambda_{\text{m BH}}$ imposes a stringent bound on the gravitational coupling, thereby refining our understanding of the quantum gravity swampland. Our findings provide a new framework for testing the consistency of quantum gravity theories, shedding light on the intricate interplay between gravity, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics in 2024.
