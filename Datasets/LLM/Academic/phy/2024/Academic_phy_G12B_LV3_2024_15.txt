**Abstract**

This study investigates a novel approach to dynamically manipulate electromagnetic properties in semiconductive oxides via electrochemical lithiation. We demonstrate reversible switching between electromagnetic transparency and absorption states by leveraging the modulation of dielectric polarization induced by controlled lithium intercalation. Unlike traditional methods relying on external fields or thermal gradients, this electrochemical strategy offers a substantially expanded range of permittivity regulation. Utilizing metasurface architectures incorporating these lithiated oxides, we achieve tunable electromagnetic responses with potential applications in advanced optical devices. The findings highlight the synergistic interplay between electrochemical doping and dielectric behavior, suggesting a pathway towards realizing intelligent electromagnetic components. Further research will focus on optimizing material composition and device geometries to enhance switching speed and overall performance, paving the way for dynamic control of light and energy at the nanoscale.
