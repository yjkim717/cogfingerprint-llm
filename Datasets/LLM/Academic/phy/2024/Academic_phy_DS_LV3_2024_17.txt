In 2024, the pursuit of multifunctional optical systems has driven innovations in metasurface architectures, particularly through polarization multiplexing strategies. Conventional single-layer metasurfaces face inherent limitations in their degrees of freedom, constraining their information capacity and inducing significant cross-talk between orthogonal polarization channels. This work demonstrates that a dual-layer metasurface platform overcomes these fundamental constraints. By decoupling the phase and amplitude modulation for distinct polarization states across two spatially separated layers, we effectively increase the available degrees of freedom to eight. This expanded design space enables the independent and simultaneous control of multiple optical functions. Crucially, our experimental results confirm a substantial reduction in cross-talk, with inter-channel interference suppressed to below -25 dB. The realized devices achieve high diffraction efficiencies exceeding 85% across the targeted wavelength band. This architecture establishes a robust framework for high-capacity, multi-channel optical elements, directly applicable to next-generation imaging, sensing, and secure communication systems.
