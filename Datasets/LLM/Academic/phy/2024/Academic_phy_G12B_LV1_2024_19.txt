## Metasurface-Engineered Quantum Light Sources: A Paradigm Shift Towards Compact and Tunable Photon Generation

The burgeoning field of quantum photonics demands increasingly compact, efficient, and tunable sources of non-classical light. Traditional approaches often rely on bulky optical elements, hindering integration and scalability. This paper reviews recent progress in leveraging flat optics, specifically nonlinear metasurfaces, to revolutionize the generation of quantum light, focusing on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) and single-photon emission. We detail how subwavelength structuring of dielectric and plasmonic materials enables unprecedented control over light-matter interactions, facilitating efficient frequency conversion and enhanced light extraction from quantum emitters.  The review examines various metasurface designs, including those employing high-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing, and resonant enhancement strategies, to optimize SPDC efficiency and spectral characteristics. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of quantum dots and other solid-state emitters within metasurface platforms to achieve deterministic single-photon emission with tailored polarization and spatial profiles.  Finally, we address key challenges, such as material losses, fabrication complexities, and the optimization of pump-wavelength dependence, while outlining future perspectives on the development of integrated quantum photonic circuits based on these innovative, metasurface-engineered quantum light sources.
