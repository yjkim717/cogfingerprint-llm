Title: Simulating Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes with a Spin-1/2 Model: A Study of Majorana Fermions and the Unruh Effect

Abstract:

The intricate interplay between quantum mechanics and general relativity is a longstanding challenge in modern physics. Recent advances in quantum simulation have enabled the exploration of quantum field theory (QFT) in curved spacetimes, a crucial step towards understanding the behavior of particles in gravitational backgrounds. In this work, we demonstrate that a spin-1/2 model can effectively simulate QFT in curved spacetimes, reproducing the phenomenon of particle production and the Unruh effect. Specifically, we show that the model can be mapped to a system of Majorana fermions, which are known to emerge in certain topological insulators and superfluids. By analyzing the model's behavior in various spacetime geometries, we observe the production of Majorana particles, a signature of QFT in curved spacetimes. Furthermore, we establish a direct connection between the model's parameters and the Unruh temperature, demonstrating that the simulated Unruh effect is a genuine quantum phenomenon. Our results are corroborated by numerical simulations of the Ising model, a paradigmatic example of a statistical mechanics system that can be related to QFT through the transfer matrix formalism. The present study provides a novel framework for exploring the fundamental principles of QFT in curved spacetimes, with potential implications for our understanding of black hole physics and the early universe. As such, it contributes to the ongoing effort to develop a deeper understanding of the interplay between gravity, quantum mechanics, and thermodynamics.
