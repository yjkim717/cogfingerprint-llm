**Abstract: Mapping Quantum Field Theory Dynamics via Spin System Simulation in Curved Spacetime**

The investigation of quantum field theory (QFT) within curved spacetime geometries presents significant theoretical challenges, largely due to the complexity of directly simulating relativistic quantum phenomena. This work proposes a novel approach leveraging the inherent properties of spin systems to effectively emulate QFT dynamics under curved backgrounds. We introduce a “translation dictionary” – a parameterized mapping – facilitating the correspondence between observables within a simplified Ising model and corresponding quantities within a chosen QFT sector. 

Specifically, we explore the behavior of interacting spin systems, parameterized to represent scalar fields and their interactions, within a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric. The resulting simulation allows for the investigation of phenomena such as effective field theory renormalization and the emergence of effective chiral symmetry breaking in curved spacetime.  Crucially, this framework offers a potential pathway to probing the existence and properties of Majorana fermions, often predicted to arise in warped spacetime scenarios. 

Preliminary results demonstrate a strong qualitative agreement between the spin system’s emergent behavior and predictions from the underlying QFT, suggesting a robust method for studying complex QFT effects. Further research will focus on extending this approach to incorporate more sophisticated QFT models and exploring the sensitivity of the simulation to parameter variations, ultimately establishing a valuable tool for theoretical exploration in cosmology and fundamental physics.
