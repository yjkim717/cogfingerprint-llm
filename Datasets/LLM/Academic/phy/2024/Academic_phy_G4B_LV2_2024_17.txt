**Abstract**

Metasurface technology has emerged as a transformative platform for manipulating electromagnetic waves, offering unprecedented control over polarization. This work investigates the enhanced performance of dual-layer metasurfaces for polarization multiplexing, presenting a significant advancement over conventional single-layer designs. Utilizing a Jones matrix formalism, we demonstrate that incorporating a second, strategically engineered layer dramatically elevates the achievable polarization multiplexing capacity while concurrently mitigating detrimental cross-talk effects. 

Specifically, the layered architecture allows for independent control of orthogonal polarization states, effectively decoupling signal propagation and minimizing interference between channels.  Our simulations, leveraging nanoprinting fabrication techniques, reveal a substantial reduction in cross-talk – quantified through Jones matrix analysis – compared to analogous single-layer structures. This improved performance stems from the layered structure’s ability to suppress spurious resonances and enhance polarization selectivity.  These findings highlight the potential of dual-layer metasurfaces for applications demanding robust and efficient polarization manipulation, including advanced optical communications and sensing. Further research will explore optimized layer configurations and material selection to maximize this enhanced functionality.
