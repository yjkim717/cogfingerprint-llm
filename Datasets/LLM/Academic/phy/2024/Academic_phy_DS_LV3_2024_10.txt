In this 2024 study, we employ grand canonical quantum mechanics combined with microkinetic modeling to elucidate the facet-dependent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) mechanisms on IrO₂ surfaces. Our computational framework reveals that the (100), (001), and (110) facets exhibit superior catalytic activity, while the (101) and (111) facets demonstrate markedly lower performance. This divergence stems from distinct surface redox processes governing adsorbate evolution pathways. On high-activity facets, optimized intermediate binding energies facilitate efficient proton-coupled electron transfer, whereas unfavorable adsorption thermodynamics on low-activity facets introduce kinetic bottlenecks. The potential-dependent microkinetic analysis further establishes that the rate-determining steps shift across facets, with the (110) surface achieving an exceptional turnover frequency through balanced *O and *OOH stabilization. These findings provide atomic-level insights into structure-activity relationships, suggesting that strategic facet engineering could enhance IrO₂ electrocatalyst design for advanced energy conversion technologies.
