The maturation of flat optical platforms has precipitated a paradigm shift in quantum photonics, enabling the design of ultra-compact, chip-integrated quantum light sources. In 2024, research has converged on two primary methodologies: nonlinear dielectric metasurfaces for the spontaneous generation of entangled photon pairs via parametric processes, and plasmonic or all-dielectric nanostructures coupled to deterministic quantum emitters such as quantum dots or color centers. These metasurface-based architectures facilitate unprecedented control over the emission properties—including directionality, polarization, and orbital angular momentum—of the generated quantum states. This enhanced control, combined with the inherent scalability of nanofabrication techniques, directly addresses the critical bottleneck of source integration and miniaturization for practical quantum technologies. Consequently, these developments are poised to accelerate the deployment of robust quantum systems for secure communications, advanced imaging, and linear optical quantum computing, marking a significant departure from bulk-optics-based approaches.
