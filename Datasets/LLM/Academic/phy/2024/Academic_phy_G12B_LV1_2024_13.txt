## Quasiprobability Formalism for Unveiling Thermodynamic Anomalies in Quantum Many-Body Systems

**Abstract:** The burgeoning field of quantum thermodynamics necessitates novel theoretical frameworks to rigorously analyze energy flow and dissipation in quantum systems, particularly those exhibiting strong correlations. Traditional thermodynamic descriptions, predicated on probabilistic interpretations of macroscopic measurements, encounter challenges when applied directly to the quantum realm. This work introduces and elaborates on the application of quasiprobability formalisms, specifically drawing upon the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) representation, to investigate thermodynamic properties of quantum many-body systems. We demonstrate how quasiprobabilities, despite their inherent non-probabilistic nature and potential for negative values, offer a powerful tool for reconstructing measurement statistics and identifying deviations from classical thermodynamic expectations.

Our analysis focuses on scenarios where energy exchange processes exhibit anomalies, such as those arising from quantum correlations and entanglement within the system. Utilizing the KD quasiprobability, we can effectively map quantum operations onto a seemingly classical phase space, allowing for the application of familiar thermodynamic concepts like work, heat, and entropy production. However, crucial consideration must be given to the interpretation of negative quasiprobabilities, which we interpret as indicators of non-classical correlations impacting energy flow.  We present a framework for identifying and characterizing these correlations, demonstrating their role in driving thermodynamic behaviors that are forbidden within the classical realm.  Furthermore, we explore the implications of this approach for understanding the thermodynamics of complex quantum systems, including ultracold atomic gases and nanoscale devices.  This approach provides a novel perspective on the interplay between quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and the emergence of macroscopic behavior in many-body systems, opening avenues for designing and controlling quantum devices with tailored thermodynamic properties.
