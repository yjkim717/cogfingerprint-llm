**Abstract:** This paper investigates the implications of recent philosophical discourse surrounding relational quantum mechanics (RQM) for the foundations of scientific epistemology. Building on the work of Rovelli, we explore the proposition that RQM's inherent perspectivism – wherein quantum states are defined relationally between observers – potentially undermines traditional notions of objective scientific truth. We critically assess the challenge to scientific inquiry posed by this solipsistic interpretation within the broader context of contemporary quantum physics.
