**Abstract: Enhanced Polarization Multiplexing Capacity and Crosstalk Mitigation in Dual-Layer Metasurface Architectures**

The burgeoning demand for high-bandwidth optical communication necessitates exploring novel approaches to maximize data transmission efficiency. Polarization multiplexing (PolM) offers a compelling solution by leveraging the orthogonal polarization states of light to effectively double the data carrying capacity. However, practical PolM systems are often limited by significant crosstalk between polarization channels, degrading signal integrity. This work investigates the potential of dual-layer metasurface designs to overcome these limitations and substantially improve PolM performance. We present a theoretical and numerical analysis demonstrating that strategically engineered dual-layer metasurfaces can achieve superior polarization isolation and expanded degrees of freedom compared to conventional single-layer structures. Specifically, the layered architecture allows for independent and tailored control over the phase and amplitude of orthogonal polarizations, minimizing unwanted coupling and significantly reducing crosstalk. Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations, validated through rigorous electromagnetic analysis, reveal a marked reduction in crosstalk penalties—up to [insert specific percentage or dB reduction here, e.g., 3 dB]—while simultaneously enhancing the polarization multiplexing capacity. These findings highlight the promise of dual-layer metasurfaces as a key enabling technology for next-generation, high-capacity optical communication systems, paving the way for more efficient and robust data transmission. Future work will focus on fabrication considerations and experimental validation of these designs at telecom wavelengths.
