**Reorganization of Gravitational Wave Amplitudes for Enhanced Observational Fidelity**

Gravitational waveform modeling remains a critical challenge in extracting information from future gravitational wave detectors. This work presents a refined approach to waveform derivation, emphasizing a reconciliation between quantum and classical descriptions via a strategic re-evaluation of amplitude contributions. Specifically, we introduce a post-Newtonian expansion incorporating a novel five-point amplitude formalism, designed to account for subtle, yet potentially significant, effects arising from the scattering of massive bodies during binary coalescence.  

Our methodology moves beyond standard perturbative techniques, aiming to directly address the quantum amplitude’s influence on the observed waveform.  Through a systematic reorganization of these amplitudes, we achieve improved agreement with established quantum field theory predictions.  Preliminary results suggest that this revised amplitude structure offers enhanced sensitivity to low-frequency gravitational waves and potentially mitigates systematic uncertainties related to higher-order post-Newtonian terms. We anticipate this framework will contribute to more robust parameter estimation and facilitate deeper insights into strong-field gravity.
