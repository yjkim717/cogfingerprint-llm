**Abstract**

Photoisomerization, a fundamental process in biological systems and materials science, hinges on the efficient conversion of light energy into molecular structural change. While significant progress has been made in understanding the underlying mechanisms, achieving consistently high quantum efficiencies remains a challenge. This study investigates the role of vibrational dynamics in photoisomerization processes, drawing parallels between the highly efficient light-harvesting complex rhodopsin and the less efficient behavior observed in 7-methoxy-N-alkylindolenine (MeO-NAIP). Utilizing quantum-classical dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that vibrational synchronization—a coherent coupling between electronic and vibrational modes—is a critical factor governing isomerization efficiency. Our findings indicate that rhodopsin’s exceptional quantum yield is intrinsically linked to the presence of robust vibrational synchronization, facilitating rapid and directed structural rearrangements following photoexcitation. In contrast, MeO-NAIP exhibits a comparatively weak degree of vibrational coherence, leading to non-radiative decay pathways and reduced isomerization yields. These results highlight the importance of considering vibrational coherence as a key design principle for optimizing photoisomerization processes in synthetic molecular systems, offering avenues for developing novel light-responsive materials and artificial photosynthetic systems with enhanced efficiency. Future research will focus on engineering vibrational synchronization in synthetic analogues to mimic the performance of natural systems.
