**Abstract: Advancing Quantum Light Source Engineering via Flat Optics and Nanostructured Emitters**

The burgeoning field of quantum information science increasingly relies on robust and efficient quantum light sources. This review synthesizes recent progress in harnessing flat optics to revolutionize the design and operation of these sources, specifically focusing on advancements realized in 2023 and 2024. We highlight the growing utility of flat optical elements – including metamaterials and photonic crystals – in mitigating wavefront distortions and improving the spatial mode quality of light generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Crucially, this enhanced light quality is now intimately coupled with the integration of nanostructured quantum emitters, such as quantum dots and color centers, offering tailored spectral and temporal properties.  The combination of flat optics and these advanced emitters enables superior control over the emitted photon statistics and reduces deleterious effects previously associated with traditional refractive elements.  Future research directions will likely prioritize scalable fabrication techniques and the development of novel flat optical architectures to further unlock the potential of these integrated quantum light sources for applications in quantum communication and computation.
