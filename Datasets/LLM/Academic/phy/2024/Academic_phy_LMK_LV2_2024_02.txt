Title: Unifying 'Split' Factorizations in Scattering Amplitudes through Binary Geometry and Topological Expansion

Abstract:
This paper elucidates the underlying origin of 'split' factorizations observed in tree amplitudes of particles and strings, and extends their applicability to all orders in perturbation theory. By leveraging the framework of binary geometry and curve integral formulation, we establish a profound connection between the multi-soft limits of scattering amplitudes and their topological expansion. Our analysis reveals that the 'split' factorizations arise from the intricate interplay between the geometric structure of the moduli space and the singularity structure of the amplitudes. We demonstrate that the binary geometry provides a natural organization principle for the topological expansion, enabling a systematic generalization of 'split' factorizations to higher orders. This work provides a unified understanding of the factorization properties of scattering amplitudes, shedding new light on the underlying mathematical structures governing particle and string interactions.
