## Quantile-Based Validation of High-Dimensional Cosmological Models via Data Space Projection

Assessing the fidelity of complex cosmological models remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional parameter spaces and intricate observational data. Traditional goodness-of-fit metrics often struggle to adequately capture nuanced discrepancies across the distribution of predicted observables. This paper introduces a novel methodology for robust model validation, focusing on the comparison of predicted quantile functions against observed data. We posit that examining quantile agreement offers a more sensitive and robust assessment than point estimates, especially when the underlying data distributions are non-Gaussian or exhibit complex correlations.

Our approach leverages principal axes analysis, a dimensionality reduction technique, to project the high-dimensional model output space onto a lower-dimensional subspace capturing the dominant variance in observable quantities, such as galaxy photometric properties. Within this reduced space, we directly compare observed and predicted quantile functions using statistical distance measures. This allows for a targeted evaluation of model performance across specific percentile ranges of the data, identifying areas of systematic bias or underestimation.  The method is demonstrated through simulated data and applied to a mock galaxy survey, highlighting its potential for discriminating between competing cosmological models and informing future observational strategies.  We conclude that quantile comparison, coupled with data space projection, provides a powerful and versatile framework for rigorously validating high-dimensional cosmological simulations and theoretical predictions.
