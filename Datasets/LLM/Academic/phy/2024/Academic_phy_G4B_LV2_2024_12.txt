**Abstract**

Photoisomerization, a fundamental process underpinning biological light-harvesting and signaling, remains a complex phenomenon exhibiting variable efficiencies across diverse systems. This research addresses this challenge by examining the dynamics of photoisomerization in Rhodopsin, a prototypical biological chromophore, alongside a synthetic biomimetic molecular rotor designed to emulate key structural features. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques, we demonstrate a significant correlation between vibrational synchronization within the rotor molecule and the overall efficiency of isomerization. Specifically, coherent vibrational modes appear to act as ‘promoters,’ facilitating the transition between isomeric states. 

Our findings reveal a previously underappreciated coupling between intramolecular vibrational energy transfer and the isomerization pathway. The observed synchronization suggests a degree of orchestrated molecular motion, contrasting with purely stochastic models.  These results provide mechanistic insight into the factors governing photoisomerization, highlighting the potential for biomimetic design to enhance light-harvesting capabilities and informing future studies on the role of vibrational control in complex biological systems.  Further investigation will focus on quantifying the promoter molecule’s contribution and exploring this synchronization phenomenon within other photoisomerizing systems.
