## The Epistemological Fragility of Scientific Objectivity: A Relational Quantum Mechanics Perspective

**Abstract:** Contemporary investigations into relational quantum mechanics (RQM) raise profound questions regarding the foundations of scientific objectivity. Departing from traditional interpretations predicated on observer-independent reality, RQM posits that physical properties are defined solely through relationships between interacting systems. This paper explores the implications of such a view, arguing that if all observations are inherently relational, the notion of a universally valid, objective scientific description becomes epistemologically fragile. We examine the potential for RQM to destabilize the credibility of established scientific claims, particularly those relying on the assumption of an external, observer-agnostic reality. This analysis necessitates a re-evaluation of scientific methodology and the role of the observer within the process of knowledge acquisition.
