**Abstract**

Current approaches to formulating a consistent theory of quantum gravity frequently encounter divergences and inconsistencies at extreme energy scales. This work introduces a novel scale, designated $\Lambda_{m BH}$, predicated on the existence of the smallest black hole undergoing a phase transition.  We posit that this scale represents a critical boundary within the landscape of quantum gravity, offering a potential refinement to the established Swampland condition.  Specifically, the emergence of $\Lambda_{m BH}$ necessitates modifications to effective field theories, demanding a non-perturbative treatment of spacetime geometry near the Planck scale.  Theoretical investigation suggests this scale is intrinsically linked to the species scale, potentially mediating interactions between quantum gravitational effects and observable phenomena.  Further research will explore the implications of $\Lambda_{m BH}$ for string theory compactifications and the viability of asymptotically safe quantum gravity models, ultimately contributing to a more complete understanding of the universe’s fundamental structure.
