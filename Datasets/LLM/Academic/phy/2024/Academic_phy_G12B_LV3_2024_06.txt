**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in observational astrophysics and theoretical physics have intensified scrutiny of black hole phenomena, demanding a comprehensive re-evaluation of established frameworks. *Black Holes Inside and Out 2024* synthesizes contemporary research, addressing critical challenges at the intersection of general relativity and quantum gravity. This compilation explores black hole stability, Hawking radiation and evaporation processes, and rigorous tests of general relativity in strong-field regimes. Furthermore, it examines the implications of black hole observations for developing and refining candidate quantum gravity models, highlighting areas where current theoretical predictions diverge from empirical evidence. The collection underscores the pivotal role of black holes as laboratories for probing fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model.
