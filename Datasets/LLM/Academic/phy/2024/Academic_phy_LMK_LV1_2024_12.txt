Title: Unveiling the Role of Vibrational Synchronization in Photoisomerization Dynamics of Molecular Rotors: A Comparative Study

Abstract:

The efficiency of photoisomerization in molecular rotors is a crucial aspect of their functionality, with significant implications for natural systems like rhodopsin and synthetic applications. This study presents a comparative analysis of the quantum-classical dynamics underlying photoisomerization in natural and synthetic molecular rotors, with a focus on the impact of vibrational synchronization. Employing advanced computational methodologies, we investigate the role of synchronized vibrational modes in modulating the isomerization efficiency. Our results demonstrate that vibrational synchronization significantly enhances the photoisomerization yield in both rhodopsin and synthetic molecular rotors. Notably, the study reveals distinct synchronization patterns between natural and synthetic systems, underscoring the importance of tailored vibrational modes in optimizing photoisomerization efficiency. These findings have profound implications for the design of high-performance molecular machines and the understanding of biological processes mediated by photoisomerization. (2024)
