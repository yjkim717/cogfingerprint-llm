**Abstract**

This investigation establishes the formal equivalence between quantum-amplitude and classical methodologies for deriving gravitational waveforms. We perform a systematic comparison of waveforms computed via the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion and the multipolar-post-Minkowskian (MPM) formalism against those obtained from the double copy of quantum scattering amplitudes. Our analysis confirms complete agreement between these ostensibly distinct approaches, contingent upon the resolution of three subtle aspects inherent to the amplitude-based derivation. Specifically, we address the proper treatment of infrared divergences, the matching of the wave-generation problem to the external scattering problem, and the correct identification of the observable, gauge-invariant waveform from the amplitude's radiative components. This concordance not only validates the application of quantum field theory techniques to classical gravitational dynamics but also underscores the computational power of amplitude methods in high-precision gravity, paving the way for their expanded use in waveform modeling for current and future gravitational-wave detectors.
