**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum information science increasingly relies on robust and efficient quantum light sources. This review examines recent progress in leveraging flat optics to significantly improve the generation and manipulation of entangled photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Traditional bulk optics introduce significant aberrations and losses, limiting the fidelity of generated states. We highlight the emerging role of nonlinear metasurfaces, engineered at the nanoscale, in providing precisely controlled phase profiles directly within the SPDC crystal, thereby mitigating these detrimental effects. Furthermore, the integration of these flat optical elements with engineered quantum emitters – including microcavities and quantum dots – enables tailored spectral shaping and enhanced emission efficiency.  Future research directions focus on realizing dynamically reconfigurable flat optics and exploring their synergistic application with advanced detection schemes, ultimately paving the way for scalable and practical quantum technologies.
