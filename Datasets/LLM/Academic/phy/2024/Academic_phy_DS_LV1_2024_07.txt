**Abstract**

In the contemporary pursuit of high-precision gravitational-wave astronomy, the synergy between classical general relativity and quantum field theory has emerged as a powerful calculational paradigm. This work presents a systematic comparison of gravitational waveforms for bound and unbound two-body systems, derived independently via the multipolar-post-Minkowskian (MPM) formalism and the quantum-amplitude-based approach. We demonstrate that the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion of the classical result and the classical limit of the quantum amplitude yield waveforms that are in complete, non-trivial agreement up to the third PN order. A critical component of this concordance is the consistent application of dimensional regularization to handle infrared and ultraviolet divergences present in both frameworks, ensuring a well-defined matching procedure. Furthermore, we elucidate the treatment of tail effects and the identification of the total angular momentum within the amplitude-based derivation, resolving subtle interpretational discrepancies. This robust cross-validation not only solidifies the theoretical foundations of waveform modeling but also establishes the quantum-amplitude method as a potent and efficient tool for extracting high-order PN corrections from scattering data, directly informing the next generation of waveform templates for LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observations.
