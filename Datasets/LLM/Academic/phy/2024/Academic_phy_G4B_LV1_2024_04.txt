**A Novel Hierarchy of Scales in Effective Gravity Theories**

Effective field theories (EFTs) provide a valuable framework for describing gravitational phenomena at accessible energy scales. However, current EFT approaches often struggle to accurately represent dynamics at the Planck scale, necessitating significant truncation. This work introduces a hitherto largely unexplored hierarchy, termed Λ<sub>BH</sub>, predicated on a black hole phase transition occurring below the species scale. We posit that Λ<sub>BH</sub> represents a critical threshold where standard EFT expansions become increasingly inadequate, reflecting a fundamental shift in the gravitational landscape.  This scale is proposed to bridge the gap between the EFT’s applicability and the underlying quantum gravity regime.  Its inclusion promises to refine EFT calculations, particularly concerning black hole physics and early universe cosmology.  Further investigation is warranted to fully characterize the implications of Λ<sub>BH</sub> and its potential to improve the predictive power of EFTs across a broader range of gravitational scales, ultimately contributing to a more complete understanding of quantum gravity.
