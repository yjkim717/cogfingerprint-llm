**Abstract:** Recent investigations into black hole thermodynamics necessitate novel frameworks for characterizing the diverse landscape of black hole states. This work presents a comprehensive topological classification scheme for black hole solutions, delineating distinct thermodynamic phases based on their trajectory within parameter space. We identify four primary classifications – $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$ – each exhibiting unique behaviors concerning Hawking temperature and overall thermodynamic stability. This classification, independent of specific black hole geometry, provides a unifying perspective on disparate solutions and offers potential insights into the interplay between black hole thermodynamics and quantum gravity. The methodology employed facilitates a deeper understanding of phase transitions and stability criteria, potentially informing theoretical models aimed at reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics, a critical direction in contemporary theoretical physics.



I aimed for precision in terminology (thermodynamic phases, parameter space, Hawking temperature), a structured argument (presenting the classification, outlining its significance), and a formal tone appropriate for a physics abstract.
