**Abstract**

The generation of accurate gravitational waveforms remains a critical challenge in gravitational wave astronomy, necessitating a rigorous reconciliation of classical and quantum gravitational effects. This work presents a refined derivation of gravitational waveforms, building upon established post-Newtonian expansions and incorporating a novel approach to quantifying quantum amplitude fluctuations. Specifically, we investigate the scattering of massive bodies, focusing on subtle deviations from standard post-Newtonian theory that become increasingly significant at higher post-multipole orders. Our methodology employs an observable-based formalism, directly linking theoretical amplitude calculations to measurable signal characteristics.  

Through a detailed examination of the post-Newtonian expansion, we identify key modifications required to account for quantum contributions to the waveformâ€™s amplitude. These adjustments, achieved via a refined treatment of scattering dynamics, demonstrate a compelling convergence between quantum and classical predictions. The resulting formalism offers a more precise framework for waveform generation, potentially enhancing the sensitivity of future gravitational wave detectors and improving the extraction of astrophysical parameters from observed signals. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between general relativity and quantum gravity in strong-field regimes.
