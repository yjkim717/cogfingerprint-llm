**Abstract**

Black hole thermodynamics has long presented a compelling intersection with fundamental questions in quantum gravity. This work introduces a novel classification scheme for black hole states, framing them as topological defects within a modified thermodynamic landscape. Utilizing a rigorous examination of Hawking temperature and associated entropy profiles, we identify four distinct classes of black hole states exhibiting markedly different stability characteristics and thermodynamic behavior. These classifications are predicated on the persistent presence and topological properties of microscopic, non-local configurations – analogous to domain walls or cosmic strings – within the event horizon.  Specifically, we delineate classes based on the dimensionality and connectivity of these defects.  This approach offers a potentially unifying framework for understanding black hole evaporation, information paradoxes, and the emergence of spacetime itself. Further investigation leveraging quantum gravity models is warranted to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing these topological black hole states and their implications for the fundamental nature of reality in 2024.
