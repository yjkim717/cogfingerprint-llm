**Abstract:** Recent developments in scattering amplitude theory have revealed unexpected factorizations within particle and string amplitudes, presenting a challenge to conventional approaches. This work investigates the underlying geometric origin of these ‘split’ factorizations, establishing a direct link to binary geometry within the curve integral formulation. We demonstrate that this connection facilitates the systematic computation of loop-integrated multi-soft limits to all orders in loop momentum, a previously intractable problem. Our analysis provides a novel framework for understanding and calculating amplitudes in diverse physical contexts, exemplified by applications to pion amplitudes and gluon scattering processes in tr(φ³ theory). This approach offers a potentially powerful tool for refining calculations in quantum field theory and exploring connections to string theory amplitudes.
