In this study, we present a rigorous unification of quantum-amplitude and classical gravitational waveform calculations at third post-Minkowskian order, resolving long-standing discrepancies in the theoretical description of gravitational radiation. By systematically incorporating multipolar-post-Minkowskian expansions with post-Newtonian corrections, we demonstrate exact agreement between quantum scattering amplitudes and classical general relativity predictions. Our analysis reveals that careful treatment of three critical factors—Lorentz frame rotations, dimensional regularization of infrared divergences, and the inclusion of zero-frequency graviton modes—is essential for this concordance. The cancellation of infrared divergences through coherent state exponentiation is shown to preserve the classical limit, while subtle frame rotation effects account for previously mismatched angular momentum contributions. This work establishes a robust framework for high-precision waveform modeling, with direct implications for gravitational-wave data analysis and the foundational understanding of radiation reaction in extreme mass-ratio inspirals. Our results provide crucial validation for amplitude-based methods in strong-field gravity and open new avenues for calculating higher-order corrections in the gravitational self-force program.
