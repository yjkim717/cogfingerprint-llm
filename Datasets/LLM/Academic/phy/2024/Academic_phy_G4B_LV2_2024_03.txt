**Abstract**

The longstanding tension between classical general relativity and quantum mechanics presents a significant challenge to our understanding of black holes. This work investigates the role of decoherence in bridging this divide, proposing a novel equivalence between decoherence induced by black holes and the interaction of quantum systems with ordinary matter at finite temperature. Utilizing an effective field theory approach, we demonstrate that the dynamics of information loss within a black hole horizon can be mathematically reproduced by considering a system coupled to a thermal bath.  Specifically, we analyze the timescale of decoherence, revealing a critical temperature wherein these two processes become indistinguishable.  This finding suggests a potentially unified framework for describing black hole physics, mitigating the information paradox and offering a pathway toward a more complete quantum theory of gravity. Further research will explore the implications for observable signatures and the constraints on quantum black hole models.
