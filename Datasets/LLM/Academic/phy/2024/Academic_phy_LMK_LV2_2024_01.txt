Title: Unveiling Classical Hidden Variables in Quantum Harmonic Oscillators through Duality with Circular Motion

Abstract:
This study establishes a fundamental connection between the quantum harmonic oscillator and a classical particle on a circular trajectory, elucidating the presence of classical hidden variables within the quantum framework. By mapping the quantum harmonic oscillator onto a classical system, we demonstrate that the Hilbert space of the quantum oscillator can be equivalently represented by the classical phase space of a particle moving on a circle. This duality reveals that the quantum fluctuations can be interpreted as arising from the uncertainties in the classical hidden variables associated with the circular motion. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the quantum-classical correspondence, shedding light on the intricate relationship between quantum mechanics and underlying classical structures. The implications of this duality are explored, offering new insights into the foundational aspects of quantum theory. (2024)
