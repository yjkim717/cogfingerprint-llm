In this study, we demonstrate that electrochemical lithiation induces hierarchical disordering in semiconductive oxides, fundamentally altering their dielectric polarization properties. Through systematic impedance spectroscopy and vector network analysis, we reveal that this structural evolution enables a reversible transition between electromagnetic transparency and absorption states. The modulated complex permittivity yields a tunable reflection loss spanning from -15 dB to -45 dB, with an operational bandwidth exceeding 8 GHz in the X-band region. Our findings establish that lithium-ion concentration gradients directly govern the charge carrier mobility and interfacial polarization phenomena, facilitating dynamic electromagnetic response. This mechanism provides a robust platform for developing intelligent electromagnetic devices, including adaptive radar-absorbing materials and reconfigurable meta-surfaces. The reported approach offers significant advantages over conventional fixed-response materials, particularly for next-generation cognitive electronic warfare systems requiring real-time spectrum agility and multifunctional operation.
