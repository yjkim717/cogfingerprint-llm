**Abstract:** The quest for a consistent theory of quantum gravity necessitates stringent criteria to distinguish viable models from those destined for phenomenological failure. Building upon the established Swampland program, this work introduces a novel constraint predicated on the thermodynamic properties of minimal black holes. We define a characteristic scale, $\Lambda_{m BH}$, derived from the entropy and free energy considerations of the smallest black hole solutions within a given quantum gravity framework. This scale serves as a potential Swampland condition, restricting the space of consistent theories by imposing limits on UV behavior. Furthermore, we explore the connection between $\Lambda_{m BH}$ and transitions observed in the decompactification limits of quantum gravity models, suggesting a deeper relationship between black hole thermodynamics and the fundamental structure of spacetime at the Planck scale. This approach offers a new avenue for probing the consistency of candidate quantum gravity theories, complementing existing species scale and Planck scale analyses.
