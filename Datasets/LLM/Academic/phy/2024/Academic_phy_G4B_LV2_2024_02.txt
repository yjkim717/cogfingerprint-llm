**Abstract**

We present a novel framework for all-order amplitude splitting, predicated on a connection to binary geometry and facilitating the rigorous computation of multi-soft limits within particle and string theory. Traditional perturbative approaches often struggle to accurately capture effects near multi-soft divergences, necessitating sophisticated non-perturbative methods. Our formalism leverages a topological expansion, mapping amplitudes to a binary space defined by geometric constraints. This allows for the systematic decomposition of scattering amplitudes into a series of ‘splits,’ each corresponding to a distinct multi-soft limit. 

The inherent geometric structure of this binary space guarantees all-order validity, mitigating the issues of convergence encountered in conventional techniques.  Specifically, we demonstrate how this splitting procedure provides a direct route to evaluating amplitudes in the relevant multi-soft regime.  Further investigation will explore the application of this method to specific physical scenarios, including [mention a specific example, e.g., D-brane scattering or gluon radiation], with the aim of advancing our understanding of soft-gluon dynamics and related phenomena.
