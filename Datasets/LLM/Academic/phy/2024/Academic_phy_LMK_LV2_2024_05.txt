This study presents an erratum to a previously published article, revising numerical values and plots pertaining to Cepheid distances and metallicity sensitivity. Utilizing the Wesenheit Leavitt Law and TRGB distance scales, our analysis confirms the absence of a statistically significant correlation between Cepheid distance and metallicity. The updated results reinforce the robustness of the period-luminosity relation, a fundamental tool in astrophysical research. Our findings, contextualized within the current (2024) understanding of Cepheid variables, provide further insight into the intricacies of distance measurement in astrophysics.
