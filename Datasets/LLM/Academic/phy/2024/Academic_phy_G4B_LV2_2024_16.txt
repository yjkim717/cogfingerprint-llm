**Abstract**

Recent theoretical investigations into the dynamics of gravity and gauge fields have increasingly highlighted the profound implications of asymptotic symmetries. This work explores the emergent symmetries within non-minimally coupled electromagnetism embedded within extended supergravity models, presenting a novel perspective on the interplay between gauge and gravitational sectors. Specifically, we demonstrate the presence of asymptotic symmetries analogous to those observed in conventional gravitational couplings, suggesting a deeper, underlying structural similarity. Crucially, our analysis reveals the existence of a broken duality symmetry, a phenomenon typically associated with higher-dimensional theories.  This broken symmetry, coupled with the non-minimal coupling of electromagnetism, introduces a distinctive feature within the supergravity framework.  Further investigation into the specific form of this symmetry and its potential role in determining the effective action are warranted, offering a promising avenue for exploring novel supergravity models and their connections to established duality principles.
