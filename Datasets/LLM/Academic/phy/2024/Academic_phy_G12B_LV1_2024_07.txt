**Reconciling Quantum and Classical Gravitational Waveform Amplitudes via Observable-Based Regularization**

The extraction of gravitational waveforms from binary systems provides a crucial testing ground for general relativity and, increasingly, for extensions incorporating quantum gravitational effects. However, a consistent framework bridging the classical post-Newtonian (PN) expansion and a quantum description of gravitational interactions remains a significant challenge. This work presents a novel approach, leveraging an observable-based formalism to reconcile these disparate regimes, focusing on waveform amplitudes calculated within a quantum field theory framework. We employ a dimensional regularization scheme to address infrared divergences arising from the emission of soft gravitons, a persistent complication in higher-order PN calculations.

Our analysis rigorously examines the structure of the waveform amplitude, systematically comparing results obtained from quantum field theory calculations with the classical PN expansion.  Through a detailed amplitude matching procedure, we demonstrate agreement between the two approaches to fifth post-Newtonian order (5.5 PN), representing a substantial extension beyond previous investigations. Crucially, our method reveals the subtle interplay between quantum corrections and the classical PN parameters, illuminating potential avenues for incorporating genuine quantum gravity effects into waveform models. This improved consistency fosters greater confidence in the interpretability of gravitational wave observations and paves the way for more robust tests of gravity at strong-field regimes, particularly relevant to the ongoing and future observations from LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. Future work will explore the implications for waveform phase and the impact of higher-order quantum corrections.
