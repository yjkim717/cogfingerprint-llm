In 2023, loop quantum gravity (LQG) provides a compelling framework for resolving the long-standing problem of black hole singularities through discrete quantum geometry. By replacing the classical singularity with a non-singular, high-curvature spacetime region, LQG predicts the formation of regular black holes. These objects exhibit a modified causal structure, characterized by the possible absence of a traditional event horizon and the potential emergence of transient trapping surfaces. This reconfiguration addresses foundational issues across several paradigms: for eternal black holes, it suggests a complete, non-singular extension of spacetime; in gravitational collapse, it prevents the formation of a final singularity; and critically, for Hawking evaporation, it offers a unitary evolution by providing a geodesically complete spacetime geometry. Consequently, the information loss paradox is naturally circumvented, as the complete evaporation process leaves no remnant singularity, preserving quantum information. This synthesis of singularity resolution with a consistent description of black hole lifecycles marks a significant advance in unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity.
