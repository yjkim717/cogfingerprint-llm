**Abstract:**

The generation and manipulation of high-dimensional quantum states are crucial for advancing quantum information processing and quantum communication technologies. Here, we present a novel approach to realizing complex polarization entanglement using a compact, nonlinear lithium niobate metasurface. Our design leverages the exceptional nonlinear optical properties of lithium niobate, integrated into a subwavelength periodic structure to enhance second-harmonic generation efficiency and enable efficient two-photon polarization shaping. Specifically, we demonstrate the generation of arbitrary polarization-entangled qutrit states, representing a significant step beyond traditional qubit-based entanglement schemes. This is achieved through precise control over the metasurface's geometry, enabling tailored phase and polarization responses within the nonlinear material. The experimental results confirm the high fidelity of the generated entangled qutrit states, validated through quantum state tomography. This miniaturized platform offers a pathway towards scalable and integrated quantum photonic circuits, overcoming limitations associated with bulky nonlinear crystals and complex optical setups typically required for high-dimensional entanglement generation. The demonstrated polarization engineering capabilities open avenues for advanced quantum communication protocols and complex quantum information processing architectures.
