ABSTRACT: We present a systematic framework for constructing generalized symmetries in four-dimensional quantum field theories with discrete gauge groups, emphasizing phenomenological applications. By circumventing advanced category theory, we develop an operator-based formalism where non-invertible symmetries emerge from gauging discrete subgroups with 't Hooft anomalies. These categorical symmetries are shown to enforce selection rules beyond conventional symmetry analyses, leading to novel constraints on low-energy particle spectra and decay processes. Our approach demonstrates how generalized symmetry structures naturally arise in theories accessible to high-energy phenomenology, providing new topological criteria for model building beyond the Standard Model.
