In this work, we propose a novel, globally regular Lorentzian metric that provides a complete, singularity-free description of gravitational collapse and subsequent transition into a white hole within a single asymptotic region. By integrating insights from loop quantum cosmology, we resolve the classical Schwarzschild singularity, replacing it with a Planck-scale spacetime region governed by quantum gravitational effects. The metric satisfies the Einstein field equations outside this non-singular core and facilitates a continuous, time-symmetric evolution from black hole to white hole phases. We analyze the causal structure and demonstrate the absence of event horizons in the classical sense, replaced by transient trapping surfaces. This model suggests that black hole to white hole transitions could be a fundamental process in quantum gravity, with potential implications for information recovery and late-time cosmology.
