**Abstract:**

Recent theoretical investigations into many-body quantum systems exhibiting strong long-range interactions have illuminated the dynamics of topological defect formation at quantum critical points. Utilizing full counting statistics, this work presents an analytical framework for quantifying defect generation, demonstrating a fundamentally quantum mechanical process distinct from classical considerations. Specifically, we establish a universal relationship between defect distribution moments and the underlying system parameters, circumventing the need for specific microscopic models.  The observed universality is intrinsically linked to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, whereby slow, correlated driving during a quantum phase transition facilitates the emergence of these topological defects.  Our findings suggest that the precise identification and characterization of these defects, through statistical analysis, provides a valuable probe of the emergent quantum behavior near critical points.  Further research will explore the implications of this framework for condensed matter systems and related quantum field theories.
