**Abstract**

This investigation critically examines the resolution of spacetime singularities within the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), with a specific focus on its implications for the causal structure of regular black hole models. While LQG’s discrete quantum geometry successfully replaces the classical singularity with a non-singular, high-curvature transition region—often conceptualized as a Planck-star core—this achievement introduces profound conceptual tensions. We analyze these tensions across three dynamical scenarios: eternal black holes, gravitational collapse, and black hole evaporation. For eternal regular black holes, we demonstrate that the elimination of the event horizon’s interior singularity challenges the conventional Penrose diagram and necessitates a re-evaluation of global causal boundaries. In the context of collapse, the quantum-geometric repulsion that halts collapse can lead to exotic, non-local causal structures or the formation of long-lived, transient horizons. Most significantly, in evaporating black holes, the potential for a non-singular endpoint and the possible survival of information through the final phase transition conflict with semi-classical expectations, suggesting a fundamental modification of the information paradox. We conclude that while LQG provides a robust mechanism for singularity resolution, it simultaneously demands a reformulation of black hole thermodynamics and causality at the Planck scale. (195 words)
