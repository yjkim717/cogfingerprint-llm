Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a physics publication in 2023. I've aimed for precision and a logical structure, aiming for the requested word count.  Following the abstract, I'll include some notes about the choices I made and potential avenues for expansion.

**Abstract: Singularity Resolution and Black Hole-White Hole Transition via Loop-Quantum Cosmology Inspired Metrics**

The persistent challenge of spacetime singularities within the standard framework of General Relativity, particularly at black hole event horizons, motivates investigations into alternative gravitational descriptions. This work explores a novel, static Lorentzian metric that facilitates a continuous transition from a black hole to a white hole within a single, bounded asymptotic region, thereby circumventing the formation of a classical singularity. The metric’s construction is informed by principles derived from Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC), incorporating quantum geometric effects to modify the classical Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse model. Specifically, we leverage an effective gravitational dynamics arising from LQC to regularize the curvature invariants near what would traditionally be a singularity.

The resulting spacetime exhibits a smooth, albeit unusual, topology, characterized by a finite radius representing the transition zone.  We demonstrate that the metric satisfies the Einstein field equations with a stress-energy tensor consistent with a non-standard form of matter, potentially reflecting quantum gravitational corrections.  While the physical interpretation of this matter remains an area of ongoing investigation, the presented solution offers a preliminary framework for exploring singularity-free black hole evolution and the potential connection between black holes and white holes, potentially providing insights into the early universe and the nature of quantum gravity.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **LQC Influence:**  I explicitly mentioned LQC as an inspiration, aligning with the keywords.  The phrase "effective gravitational dynamics arising from LQC" is intended to suggest a more nuanced connection than simply using LQC equations directly.
*   **Oppenheimer-Snyder Connection:**  The reference to the Oppenheimer-Snyder model anchors the work in a well-established context of gravitational collapse.
*   **Singularity Resolution:** The core focus is on singularity avoidance, a key motivation.
*   **Non-Standard Matter:**  Introducing “non-standard matter” is a common approach in these types of solutions. It acknowledges that a singularity-free spacetime often requires exotic energy conditions. I've included a caveat about its interpretation.
*   **Topology:** I’ve highlighted the unusual topology as an important feature.
*   **Future Directions:** The closing sentence points toward future research directions.
*   **Formal Tone:** I've used language typical of physics abstracts (e.g., "facilitates," "circumventing," "preliminary framework").
*   **Word Count:** The abstract is around 186 words.

**Potential Expansions (depending on the actual research):**

*   **Specific LQC Quantities:** If the metric derivation involved specific LQC variables (e.g., holonomy-flux algebra), those could be mentioned.
*   **Curvature Invariants:** Quantifying the behavior of specific curvature invariants (e.g., Kretschmann scalar) near the transition zone would strengthen the claim of singularity resolution.
*   **Physical Interpretation of Matter:**  Elaborate on possible physical interpretations of the exotic
