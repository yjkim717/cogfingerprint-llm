**Abstract**

We derive rigorous constraints on the extent of field space supporting metastable de Sitter vacua in quantum gravitational theories, leveraging the species scale as a covariant ultraviolet cutoff. By integrating the Emergent String Conjecture with the behavior of the species scale in Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications, we demonstrate that traversing a field distance Δϕ ∼ Λ_s(ϕ)^{-1} inevitably triggers a descent to a supersymmetric vacuum where an emergent string becomes light, invalidating the initial effective description with a positive potential. This dynamical cutoff implies an absolute upper bound, Δϕ ≲ M_pl / √N, on the field range for which a slowly varying positive potential V(ϕ) > 0 can self-consistently be described within a single effective theory. Our findings provide a refined swampland criterion that precludes parametrically large trans-Planckian field excursions in de Sitter-like backgrounds, offering a universal geometric obstruction rooted in the entropy bounds of the underlying quantum gravity.
