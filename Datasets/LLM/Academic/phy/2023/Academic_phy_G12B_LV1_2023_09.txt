**Abstract:**

Understanding the formation and evolution of dark matter halos remains a central challenge in cosmology. While N-body simulations have provided invaluable insights, characterizing the intricate relationship between halo mass accretion history and the resulting density profiles remains computationally demanding and often reliant on phenomenological assumptions. This work introduces a novel approach leveraging explainable artificial neural networks (XNNs) to directly learn and quantify the connection between halo evolution and its internal density structure. We train a convolutional neural network on a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations, focusing on the mutual information between the time-dependent mass accretion rate and the halo's radial density profile at various redshifts.  The XNN framework allows for the extraction of interpretable features, revealing previously obscured correlations and providing a data-driven perspective on the interplay between merging histories and the emergence of characteristic density profile shapes, such as the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile and its deviations.  Our findings offer a pathway toward improved halo models and a deeper understanding of structure formation, potentially mitigating the need for complex, empirically-tuned fitting functions by directly mapping halo growth to observable density structures. This methodology presents a promising avenue for future research in exploring the complex physics of dark matter halo evolution.

**Notes on Choices & Considerations:**

*   **Formal Tone:** I used more complex sentence structures and avoided colloquialisms.
*   **Precise Terminology:** Included terms like "N-body simulations," "Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile," "redshift," "mutual information," and "convolutional neural network" to align with the field.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: problem statement, proposed solution, methodology, key findings, and potential impact.
*   **2023 Context:** The phrasing reflects current trends in using machine learning and explainable AI in astrophysical research.  The mention of "mitigating the need for complex, empirically-tuned fitting functions" acknowledges the ongoing effort to move beyond purely empirical models.
*   **Word Count:**  I aimed for the requested ~176 words.
