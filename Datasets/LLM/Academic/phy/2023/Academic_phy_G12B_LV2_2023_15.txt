**Abstract: Enhanced Lithium-Ion Storage in Layered Sodium Niobate (NaNb₁₃O₃₃) via Interlayer Spacing Effects**

The development of high-performance electrode materials remains a critical challenge for next-generation lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). This study investigates the electrochemical properties of layered sodium niobate (NaNb₁₃O₃₃) as an anode material for LIBs, demonstrating its remarkable lithium-storage capabilities.  Central to this performance is the inherent, and substantial, interlayer spacing within the NaNb₁₃O₃₃ structure. This expansive interlayer distance facilitates rapid lithium-ion diffusion and insertion/extraction processes, contributing to superior rate performance compared to conventional intercalation materials. Electrochemical testing, utilizing galvanostatic cycling at various current densities and temperatures, reveals exceptional charge/discharge efficiency and capacity retention over extended cycling regimes.  Specifically, the material exhibits robust cyclic stability, retaining a significant percentage of its initial capacity after hundreds of cycles, even at low-temperature operation (down to -20°C).

Detailed analysis suggests that the large interlayer spacing minimizes kinetic limitations associated with lithium-ion transport, reducing polarization and enabling efficient utilization of the active material. Furthermore, this structural feature appears to mitigate volume changes during lithiation/delithiation, contributing to the observed stability. While these findings are promising, future research should focus on the precise correlation between interlayer spacing modulation (e.g., through chemical doping or structural templating) and electrochemical performance, alongside *in-situ* characterization techniques to elucidate the lithium-ion storage mechanism within NaNb₁₃O₃₃. Optimization of electrolyte composition and electrode architecture could further enhance its overall battery performance.
