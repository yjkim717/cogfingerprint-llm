## Constraining the Hubble Constant: A Synergistic Approach Leveraging JWST Observations and Distance Ladder Calibration

**Abstract:** The ongoing tension between the Hubble Constant (H₀) values derived from early-universe observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and those obtained from late-universe measurements utilizing the distance ladder presents a significant challenge to the standard ΛCDM cosmological model. This paper reviews recent advancements in H₀ determination, focusing on the transformative impact of data acquired by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and exploring complementary methodologies aimed at mitigating systematic uncertainties. Specifically, we examine the recalibration of the Cepheid variable distance indicators, utilizing JWST’s enhanced infrared capabilities to penetrate dust obscuration and improve photometric precision. These refined Cepheid distances are crucial for anchoring the distance ladder, which subsequently informs Type Ia Supernova (SN Ia) luminosity calibrations.  Furthermore, we discuss the application of Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, another established distance indicator, and its increasing accuracy afforded by JWST observations, particularly in resolving individual red giant stars in distant galaxies.

The pivotal role of JWST lies in its ability to precisely measure the infrared luminosities of Cepheids and TRGB stars in galaxies previously inaccessible to such detail. This allows for a more robust and statistically significant sample of calibrators, reducing the reliance on sparsely populated datasets.  We explore the potential of combining Cepheid and TRGB distance measurements to provide independent and cross-validated H₀ estimates.  Beyond observational improvements, we consider theoretical investigations into alternative dark matter models, such as Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) modifications and extensions, as potential avenues to reconcile the discrepancies without invoking new physics beyond the standard model.  Finally, we discuss the prospect of future, synergistic observations combining JWST data with ground-based facilities to further refine distance measurements and constrain cosmological parameters, ultimately aiming to resolve the H₀ tension and deepen our understanding of the universe’s expansion history.  The implications of these developments for the viability of ΛCDM and the search for new physics are also addressed.
