We investigate the universal scaling of topological defect generation in quantum systems with strong long-range interactions near quantum critical points. While the Kibble-Zurek mechanism traditionally predicts defect density scaling with quench rate through critical exponents of the underlying phase transition, our findings reveal that sufficiently strong long-range interactions fundamentally alter this paradigm. Through analytical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that defect production transitions to a universal quantum regime where the density becomes independent of the transformation rate. This rate-independent scaling emerges from the interplay between long-range coupling and quantum critical fluctuations, which dominate over the conventional critical slowing-down effects. Our results establish a new universality class for dynamical quantum phase transitions and suggest that quantum systems with power-law interactions exhibit distinct non-equilibrium critical behavior beyond the standard Kibble-Zurek paradigm.
