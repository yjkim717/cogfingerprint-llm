**Abstract**

Recent investigations into the black hole information paradox have explored novel resolutions leveraging the geometrical structure of spacetime. In a 2023 proposal, G. 't Hooft posits that an inherent binary symmetry present within Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates offers a potential pathway toward resolving this longstanding problem. This symmetry suggests the elimination of a conventional black hole interior, proposing instead a quantum mechanical relationship wherein the interior region constitutes a duplicate, or "clone," of the external spacetime geometry. This framework challenges established notions of black hole interiors and necessitates further exploration of its implications for quantum gravity and the preservation of information during black hole formation and evaporation.
