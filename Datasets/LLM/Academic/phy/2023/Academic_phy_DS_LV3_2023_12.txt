In this 2023 computational chemistry study, we present a comprehensive performance analysis of hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) implementations optimized for modern accelerator architectures. Through systematic benchmarking of QUICK and AMBER packages on both NVIDIA V100 and AMD MI100 GPUs, we demonstrate that strategic performance optimization enables cross-platform computational efficiency. Our methodology incorporates memory hierarchy optimization, kernel fusion techniques, and architecture-specific instruction tuning to maximize floating-point throughput. The optimized implementations achieve 3.8-4.2Ã— speedup over previous-generation hardware while maintaining numerical precision within chemical accuracy thresholds. Notably, the AMD MI100 platform demonstrates comparable performance to NVIDIA V100 across multiple QM/MM test systems, indicating maturation of alternative accelerator ecosystems for scientific computing. These advancements significantly expand accessible timescales for biomolecular simulations, enabling microsecond-scale QM/MM sampling of enzymatic reactions and solvent effects. The cross-platform performance parity establishes new foundations for hardware-agnostic computational chemistry workflows while addressing increasing demands for accelerated quantum chemical calculations in pharmaceutical and materials science applications.
