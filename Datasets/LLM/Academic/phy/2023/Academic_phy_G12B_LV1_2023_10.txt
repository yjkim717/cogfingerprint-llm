**Abstract: Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity in Platinum-Nickel Nano-octahedra via Gaseous Etching and Surface Compositional Tuning**

The ongoing global demand for efficient energy storage and conversion technologies necessitates advancements in electrocatalysis, particularly for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a critical process in fuel cells and metal-air batteries. Here, we report a novel surface engineering strategy for enhancing the ORR performance of Pt-Ni nano-octahedra through controlled gaseous etching. Utilizing a chlorine-based etching process, we demonstrate the selective removal of nickel from the nano-octahedral structure, resulting in a strategically modified surface composition characterized by a significantly increased platinum enrichment.  High-resolution scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer following the etching treatment. Electrochemical measurements reveal a substantial improvement in both the ORR activity and durability of the etched Pt-Ni nano-octahedra compared to their as-synthesized counterparts. Specifically, a reduction in overpotential of [insert specific value, e.g., 35 mV] at [insert current density, e.g., 10 mA cm⁻²] and an enhanced stability over [insert time, e.g., 100 hours] of accelerated durability testing were observed. We attribute these enhancements to the optimized surface electronic structure and increased availability of catalytically active platinum sites facilitated by the compositional modification. This work highlights the efficacy of gaseous etching as a scalable and precise technique for surface compositional control in electrocatalytic materials, offering a promising pathway towards the development of high-performance ORR catalysts for next-generation energy devices. Further investigations are underway to explore the influence of etching parameters on the resulting surface morphology and catalytic properties.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Customization:**

*   **Specificity:** I've included bracketed placeholders (e.g., “[insert specific value, e.g., 35 mV]”) where you would need to insert actual experimental data to make the abstract fully complete. This is crucial for a real abstract.
*   **Rationale:** The abstract explicitly states the *reason* for the improvement (optimized surface electronic structure and increased platinum sites). This is vital for demonstrating scientific understanding.
*   **Scalability:** The phrase "scalable and precise technique" is included to address potential industrial relevance.
*   **Future Work:**  Mentioning ongoing research ("Further investigations are underway...") is a common and valuable addition to an abstract.
*   **Physics/Materials Science Framing:** I've used language emphasizing materials characterization techniques (SEM, XPS) and focused on the underlying physical principles (surface electronic structure).
*   **Year Context (2023):** The language and focus are consistent with current trends in electrocatalysis research, which is heavily focused on improving durability and efficiency for real-world applications.
*   **Chlorine-based etching:** I specified a chlorine-based etching process as
