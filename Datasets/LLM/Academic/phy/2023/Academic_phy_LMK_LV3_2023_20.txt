This study explores the application of generalized global symmetries in quantum field theories, leveraging categorical and discrete symmetries to advance particle phenomenology. By integrating these concepts, we provide novel insights into the symmetries governing high-energy physics, enhancing our understanding of fundamental interactions in 2023.
