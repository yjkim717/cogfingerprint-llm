**Abstract**

We introduce a novel perspective on calculating scattering amplitudes in colored scalar theories, formulating them as a rigorous counting problem embedded within the framework of topological expansion.  Traditional perturbative methods often struggle with the complexity arising from loop diagrams and kinematic divergences. Our approach leverages the inherent topological structure of the theory to systematically enumerate valid scattering configurations, circumventing many of these difficulties.  We define a kinematic space – a carefully constructed parameterization reflecting the relevant momenta – that allows for a direct mapping between scattering amplitudes and combinatorial counts.  This allows us to perform an efficient and controlled topological expansion, ultimately providing a robust method for computing loop scattering amplitudes.  Preliminary results suggest this technique offers significant advantages in addressing the longstanding counting problem associated with these amplitudes, particularly in scenarios involving multiple loop contributions and non-perturbative effects. Further investigation will focus on extending this formalism to more complex theoretical models.
