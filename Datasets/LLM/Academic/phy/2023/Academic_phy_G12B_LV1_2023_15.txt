**Abstract: Enhanced Lithium Intercalation Dynamics in Layered Sodium Niobate (NaNb₁₃O₃₃) for High-Performance Electrochemical Energy Storage**

The burgeoning demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries necessitates the exploration of novel electrode materials with enhanced electrochemical properties. This study investigates the lithium storage capabilities of layered sodium niobate (NaNb₁₃O₃₃), a material distinguished by its exceptionally large interlayer spacing. We hypothesize that this structural feature facilitates rapid lithium-ion diffusion and mitigates volume changes during cycling, ultimately leading to improved rate performance and cyclic stability.

Through a combination of *in-situ* X-ray diffraction and electrochemical characterization, we demonstrate that NaNb₁₃O₃₃ exhibits significantly accelerated lithium intercalation kinetics compared to conventional layered electrode materials. The observed rate capability surpasses that of benchmark materials at comparable current densities, attributed to the reduced kinetic barriers for lithium-ion transport within the expansive interlayer galleries. Furthermore, the material demonstrates remarkable cyclic stability, retaining over 85% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles at a current density of 1C. Analysis of the electrochemical impedance spectra reveals a consistently low charge transfer resistance throughout the cycling process, further supporting the facile ion mobility.  These findings highlight the potential of NaNb₁₃O₃₃ as a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, particularly in applications requiring high power density and extended operational lifespan, even at sub-ambient temperatures.  Future work will focus on optimizing the material's morphology and exploring surface modifications to further enhance its electrochemical performance.
