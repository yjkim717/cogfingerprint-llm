**Abstract**

The high-energy regime of scattering encounters provides a critical testing ground for theoretical approaches to the two-body problem in general relativity. While various analytical frameworks, including amplitude-based methods and the multipolar-post-Minkowskian (MPM) formalism, have been developed to model the associated gravitational-wave emission, their precise connection remains an active area of inquiry. This work performs a systematic comparison of the gravitational bremsstrahlung waveforms generated by a hyperbolic black hole encounter, as derived from quantum-amplitude techniques and from a first-principles MPM formulation. We demonstrate explicit agreement between the two methodologies at leading post-Newtonian (PN) orders, confirming their mutual consistency in the low-velocity, weak-field limit. However, we identify and quantify a significant discrepancy emerging at higher PN levels, specifically in the tail and memory contributions to the waveform. We trace the origin of this divergence to the treatment of infrared physics and the emission of soft gravitons, which is handled differently within the two frameworks. Our results highlight a subtle interplay between ultraviolet and infrared sectors in the post-Minkowskian expansion and underscore the necessity of a unified formalism to accurately describe high-precision observables for future gravitational-wave astronomy.
