**Abstract**

Recent theoretical investigations leveraging loop-quantum cosmology propose a novel spacetime geometry exhibiting a dynamically linked black hole and white hole solution. This research introduces a Lorentzian metric specifically designed to circumvent traditional singularity formation, utilizing an asymptotic region that seamlessly connects these disparate spacetime features. The metric’s construction incorporates a globally defined geometrical parameter, hypothesized to dictate the duration of the black hole to white hole transition.  Employing a modified Oppenheimer-Snyder model, we demonstrate that this configuration avoids the problematic singularities inherent in classical general relativity.  Crucially, the proposed spacetime maintains well-defined physical properties within the asymptotic region, offering a potential framework for understanding cosmological evolution and the early universe.  Further investigation will focus on quantifying the influence of the geometrical parameter and exploring potential observational signatures associated with this transition.
