**Abstract**

Recent theoretical work (Maldacena, 2023) explores a novel quantum mechanical model utilizing interacting oscillators and Majorana fermions to simulate aspects of black hole physics within an emergent universe paradigm. This simplified system offers a tractable platform for investigating holographic relationships, suggesting a potential route towards experimentally verifying black hole characteristics. The study provides a preliminary estimate of the qubit resources required to observe key features, such as event horizon dynamics, within this emergent framework. These findings contribute to ongoing efforts to bridge the gap between quantum gravity, condensed matter physics, and the exploration of cosmological origins.
