**Abstract:**

The precise determination of the Hubble constant (H₀) remains a central challenge in modern cosmology, with ongoing discrepancies between local measurements and those inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This paper synthesizes recent advancements in H₀ estimation, critically evaluating the impact of novel observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) alongside established techniques. Specifically, we examine the utilization of Cepheid variable stars as standard candles, acknowledging the complexities introduced by intrinsic luminosity uncertainties and metallicity effects within these extragalactic distance indicators. 

The analysis incorporates updated spectroscopic redshift measurements and photometric data from JWST, contributing to a refined extragalactic distance scale. Furthermore, the work addresses persistent systematic uncertainties associated with local H₀ determinations, including those stemming from the peculiar velocity of the Local Group and the calibration of the ΛCDM cosmological model. We discuss how these uncertainties propagate through H₀ estimates and their implications for parameter space constraints.  Finally, we explore the potential of future observations, particularly those leveraging the James Webb Space Telescope’s infrared capabilities, to further constrain the Hubble constant and ultimately resolve the current tension.  The presented framework emphasizes the need for continued rigorous investigation and improved data analysis techniques to establish a robust and consistent extragalactic distance scale.
