**Abstract**

This study investigates a novel lithium niobate metasurface architecture for the controlled generation and manipulation of polarization-entangled photon pairs. Utilizing nonlinear optical effects within the lithium niobate substrate, we demonstrate the fabrication of multiplexed metagratings capable of precisely shaping photon polarization states.  The resulting metasurface exhibits enhanced control over entanglement fidelity, a critical requirement for advancing quantum technologies. Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework – predicated on qutrit state encoding – for representing and manipulating multi-dimensional quantum information.  This approach offers a pathway towards miniaturized, optically controlled quantum devices, circumventing limitations associated with traditional solid-state qubit systems.  Experimental results, coupled with rigorous simulation, validate the efficacy of this technique and suggest promising avenues for integrated quantum photonics research in 2023 and beyond.
