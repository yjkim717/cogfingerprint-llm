"In this study, we establish the equivalence of two distinct approaches to redefining Lorentz generators within the framework of Einstein gravity. Utilizing the Hamiltonian formalism, we demonstrate that both methods yield identical asymptotic symmetry algebras, encompassing supertranslations. By rigorously examining the Lorentz generators under these redefinitions, we prove their equivalence, thereby providing a unified understanding of the asymptotic structure of Einstein gravity. Our findings, grounded in a precise analysis of the asymptotic symmetry algebra, contribute to a deeper understanding of the theoretical foundations of gravitational physics in 2023."
