**Abstract**

This work investigates a hitherto unexplored connection within Einstein gravity, demonstrating an equivalence between Hamiltonian formulations of Lorentz generators and null infinity techniques. Utilizing asymptotic symmetry algebra, we reveal that redefining the Lorentz group’s generators through Hamiltonian dynamics mirrors the geometric perspective offered by null infinity extrapolations. Specifically, the constraints arising from Hamiltonian mechanics, when rigorously applied, yield results consistent with the asymptotic behavior of spacetime at null infinity. This correspondence provides a novel framework for understanding the supertranslations, fundamental symmetries within Einstein gravity, and their relationship to the boundary conditions at null infinity. The implications extend to a deeper theoretical understanding of spacetime structure and the quantization of gravity.  Further research will explore the ramifications of this equivalence for black hole physics and cosmological models, with this finding presented as a key contribution to 2023’s gravitational theory landscape.
