**Abstract**

Dark matter halos represent a fundamental component of cosmic structure formation, yet their precise density profiles remain a subject of ongoing investigation. Utilizing a novel machine learning approach, we present a framework employing neural networks to characterize halo density distributions across a range of radii.  Specifically, our methodology leverages mutual information analysis to quantify the relationship between halo mass accretion histories and the resultant inner and outer density profiles.  Preliminary results indicate statistically significant correlations between observed halo morphology – as inferred from simulated dark matter distributions – and the rate of mass influx during early formation epochs.  These findings suggest that neural network modeling offers a powerful tool for disentangling the complex interplay of gravitational dynamics and baryonic feedback in shaping dark matter halo structure, providing new constraints for cosmological simulations and N-body studies in 2023.
