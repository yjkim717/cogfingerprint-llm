Title: Comparative Analysis of Gravitational Bremsstrahlung Amplitudes and Multipolar-Post-Minkowskian Waveforms: Implications for High-Order Post-Newtonian Expansions

Abstract:
This study presents a detailed comparison between one-loop gravitational bremsstrahlung amplitudes and multipolar-post-Minkowskian waveforms, examining their consistency across various post-Newtonian (PN) levels. Our analysis reveals that, at lower PN orders, the two approaches demonstrate satisfactory agreement, validating the robustness of both methods in the perturbative regime. However, at higher PN levels, significant discrepancies emerge, underscoring the limitations of the PN approximation in capturing the intricate dynamics of gravitational radiation. By scrutinizing the scattering amplitudes and multipolar expansions, we identify the sources of these divergences and discuss their implications for the accuracy of waveform predictions. Our findings highlight the need for further refinement of both approaches, particularly at higher orders, to ensure reliable modeling of gravitational bremsstrahlung in astrophysical contexts. The results of this comparison have important implications for the development of more accurate waveform templates in gravitational wave astronomy. (2023)
