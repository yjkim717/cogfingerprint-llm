**Abstract:**

The ongoing tension between local and early-universe measurements of the Hubble constant (H₀) represents a significant challenge to the ΛCDM cosmological model. Recent observational efforts, leveraging the unprecedented capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), are providing refined distance ladder calibrations utilizing Cepheid variable stars and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) standard candles. These independent measurements, converging at values systematically higher than those inferred from Planck observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), fuel the "Hubble tension." This abstract reviews the current state of H₀ determinations, highlighting the JWST's impact on reducing systematic uncertainties in Cepheid-based distance scales. Resolving this discrepancy may necessitate revisions to the ΛCDM framework or the introduction of new physics, such as early dark energy or modified gravity, thereby impacting our fundamental understanding of the universe's expansion history and composition.
