In the ongoing pursuit of high-performance anode materials for advanced lithium-ion batteries, the structural architecture of niobate compounds has emerged as a critical determinant of electrochemical efficacy. This investigation centers on shear ReO3-type sodium niobate (NaNb₁₃O₃₃), a material distinguished by possessing the largest interlayer spacing within its structural family. The expanded interlayer spacing is identified as a pivotal structural feature that facilitates enhanced lithium-ion diffusion kinetics, thereby directly addressing the perennial challenges of rate performance and cyclic stability in fast-charging applications. Systematic electrochemical characterization conducted in 2023 reveals that this material exhibits exceptional specific capacity retention exceeding 85% after 2,000 cycles at elevated current densities, alongside remarkable performance maintenance at sub-zero temperatures. The robust framework of NaNb₁₃O₃₃ effectively mitigates the substantial volumetric expansions typically associated with lithium intercalation processes, which conventionally lead to rapid capacity fade in oxide-based anodes. Furthermore, the material's intrinsic pseudocapacitive contribution, enabled by its unique layered configuration, promotes rapid surface-controlled charge storage mechanisms without compromising structural integrity. These collective attributes—superior lithium storage capability, unprecedented rate performance, and long-term cyclic stability—establish sodium niobate as a transformative candidate for next-generation energy storage systems, potentially enabling the development of electric vehicles with reduced charging times and enhanced operational reliability across diverse climatic conditions.
