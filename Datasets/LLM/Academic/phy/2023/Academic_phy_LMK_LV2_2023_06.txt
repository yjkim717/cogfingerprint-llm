"Resolving Black Hole Singularities in Loop Quantum Gravity: A Regular Black Hole Paradigm"

In the framework of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), we investigate the quantum geometry of regular black holes, addressing the long-standing issue of black hole singularities. By employing a quantum extension of the Kruskal space-time, we demonstrate that the singularity is resolved, and the spacetime is rendered globally hyperbolic. Our analysis reveals novel conceptual features, including the emergence of a quantum bounce and the disappearance of the classical singularity. The regular black hole paradigm presented herein provides a robust and singularity-free description of black hole physics, consistent with the principles of LQG. This work advances our understanding of black hole physics and highlights the potential of LQG to resolve the long-standing problem of spacetime singularities, offering new avenues for exploring the interplay between quantum gravity and black hole physics in 2023.
