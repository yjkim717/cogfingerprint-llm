Title: Probing Quantum Chaos through Krylov Complexity: A Study of Billiard Systems

Abstract:
The notion of Krylov complexity has emerged as a promising diagnostic tool for investigating quantum chaos. In this work, we examine the efficacy of Krylov complexity in capturing the chaotic dynamics of quantum billiards, specifically focusing on stadium and Sinai billiards. By analyzing the Lanczos coefficients and Lyapunov exponents associated with these systems, we demonstrate a strong correlation between Krylov complexity and the onset of quantum chaos. Our results show that the Krylov complexity grows exponentially with time in chaotic regimes, with a rate closely related to the classical Lyapunov exponent. In contrast, integrable billiards exhibit a significantly slower growth rate, underscoring the utility of Krylov complexity as a measure of quantum chaos. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between quantum mechanics and classical chaos, shedding light on the quantum signatures of chaotic behavior. (2023)
