**Abstract**

Precise predictions of gravitational wave observables necessitate increasingly sophisticated calculations beyond standard post-Newtonian (PN) approximations. This work investigates the consistency between one-loop gravitational bremsstrahlung effects and the multipolar-post-minkowskian (MPM) waveform model, focusing on the regime of soft gravitational radiation. Utilizing a post-newtonian expansion, we present results demonstrating a divergence between these two approaches at higher PN orders. Specifically, discrepancies emerge when evaluating contributions to the waveform’s multipole expansion, particularly within the soft expansion framework. These discrepancies are attributed to the failure of the MPM formalism to fully account for the radiative corrections inherent in one-loop bremsstrahlung calculations.  The observed discrepancies highlight a critical need for refinement of the MPM model, potentially requiring incorporation of higher-order soft theorems or alternative expansion techniques. Further investigation is warranted to establish a robust framework for accurately predicting gravitational wave signals in strong field scenarios.
