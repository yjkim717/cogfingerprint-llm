"In the framework of quantum gravity, we establish novel bounds on field space regions characterized by slowly varying positive potentials, pertinent to Calabi-Yau compactifications in string theory. Our analysis reveals a logarithmic correlation between field range and potential, constrained by the species scale. This bound imposes significant restrictions on the landscape of viable effective field theories, refining our understanding of the Swampland conjectures. By elucidating the intricate interplay between field space geometry and gravitational constraints, our findings contribute to the ongoing exploration of quantum gravity phenomenology in 2023."
