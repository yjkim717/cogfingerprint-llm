In this work, we present a novel meta-optics-based vector visual cryptography system that advances optical encryption paradigms through the integration of dielectric metasurfaces. Conventional optical encryption methods often suffer from bulky configurations and computational latency in decryption. To address these limitations, we engineer a compact platform leveraging the wavefront-shaping capabilities of subwavelength meta-atoms, which encode cryptographic information directly into the polarization and phase states of light. Our system employs a visual cryptography scheme where the secret image is decomposed into multiple shares, each realized as a distinct metasurface optical element. Decryption is achieved in real-time via coherent superposition of the transmitted optical fields, requiring no electronic computation and thus enabling instantaneous visual reconstruction. Experimental validation confirms robust encryption security against computational attacks, facilitated by the high-dimensional parameter space of vectorial light manipulation. This approach establishes a new framework for high-security, low-latency optical information protection, with potential applications in secure communications and anti-counterfeiting technologies.
