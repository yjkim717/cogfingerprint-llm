**Abstract:**

This study investigates the topological characteristics of timelike circular orbits in the spacetime geometries of static, spherically symmetric black holes. Employing a topological descriptor – the winding number – we classify distinct orbital configurations around Schwarzschild, scalarized Einstein-Maxwell, and dyonic black holes. Our analysis reveals that the presence of scalar hair, arising from scalar-tensor theories, and quasi-topological terms introduced by dyonic charges, fundamentally modify the orbital parameters and stability properties. Notably, these modifications do not alter the underlying topological invariant, the winding number, demonstrating a robust connection between spacetime topology and orbital dynamics. These findings offer insights into the resilience of topological features in black hole spacetimes and their implications for probing deviations from General Relativity.
