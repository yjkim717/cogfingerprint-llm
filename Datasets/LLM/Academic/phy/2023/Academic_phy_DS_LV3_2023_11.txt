In this study, we advance the characterization of quantum chaos by analyzing the Krylov complexity in chaotic billiard systems. Employing the stadium and Sinai billiards as paradigmatic models, we compute the Lanczos coefficients derived from energy eigenstate expansions in the Krylov basis. Our results demonstrate that the statistical variances of these coefficients exhibit a strong positive correlation with both the classical Lyapunov exponents and the spectral properties of quantum energy levels, such as level spacing distributions. This correlation underscores Krylov complexity as a robust, unifying metric that bridges classical chaotic dynamics and quantum signatures of chaos. The findings, contextualized within 2023 research, affirm the utility of operator growth measures in quantifying chaos across diverse quantum systems, with implications for quantum information and fundamental physics.
