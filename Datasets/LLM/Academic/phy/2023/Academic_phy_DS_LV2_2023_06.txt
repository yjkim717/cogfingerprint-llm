**Abstract**

This chapter presents a systematic investigation into the resolution of black hole singularities within the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG). By replacing the classical spacetime continuum with a discrete quantum geometry, LQG provides a natural mechanism for singularity avoidance, leading to the formation of regular black hole interiors. We analyze the implications of this quantum gravitational repulsion across three principal scenarios: eternal, gravitational collapse, and evaporating black holes. Our analysis reveals that while the central singularity is universally resolved, the resulting causal structures exhibit novel and non-trivial features. For instance, the fate of the inner horizon and the potential for black-to-white hole transitions present significant conceptual challenges that refine our understanding of information preservation and unitarity. We critically assess these model-dependent outcomes, emphasizing the interplay between the underlying quantum geometry and the global causal properties of the resulting effective spacetimes. This work consolidates recent advances, clarifying both the robust achievements and the open questions in constructing a consistent quantum description of black holes free of classical pathologies.
