**Abstract**

Sodium niobate materials are increasingly investigated as anode candidates for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. This study details the synthesis and characterization of a novel sodium niobate exhibiting a substantially expanded interlayer spacing, achieved through controlled compositional modification.  Electrochemical testing revealed a marked improvement in rate performance, with a current density capability exceeding previously reported values for similar materials. Furthermore, the expanded interlayer structure demonstrably enhances cyclic stability, evidenced by minimal capacity fade over extended cycling.  Analysis of impedance spectra suggests reduced ion diffusion resistance contributing to these observed improvements.  The resultant material demonstrates particularly encouraging low-temperature performance, suggesting potential for broader applicability in diverse operating conditions. These findings underscore the strategic importance of interlayer engineering in optimizing sodium niobate for advanced battery technologies.
