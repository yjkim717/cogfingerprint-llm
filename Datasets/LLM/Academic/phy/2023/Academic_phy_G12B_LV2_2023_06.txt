Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a physics publication, based on the provided summary and aiming for a 2023 context. I've focused on expanding the implications and incorporating relevant theoretical considerations.  I've also included a few potential avenues for future research at the end.

**Abstract**

The persistent presence of singularities within the classical description of black holes presents a fundamental challenge to general relativity and motivates investigations into quantum gravity effects. This work examines the potential for singularity resolution within the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG) applied to regular black hole solutions. We investigate the causal structure and global boundedness of these regular black holes, specifically focusing on modifications to the Kruskal spacetime geometry anticipated by LQG. Unlike their classical counterparts, regular black holes, often characterized by finite curvature at the would-be singularity, offer a pathway to avoid the breakdown of spacetime predictability.  We analyze how LQGâ€™s quantization of geometry impacts the horizon structure and the ensuing dynamics, considering implications for Hawking evaporation and the information paradox.  Our analysis suggests that LQG-inspired modifications can lead to a well-behaved spacetime extending beyond the classical Schwarzschild horizon, potentially resolving the singularity and altering the late-time evaporation process. Further research will explore the connection between these regular black hole solutions and the emergence of quantum geometry at the Planck scale, as well as the implications for black hole thermodynamics and the potential for observational signatures detectable through gravitational wave astronomy.  Finally, we consider the role of loop quantum cosmology in providing boundary conditions for the black hole interior.
