Title: Revisiting the Hubble Tension: Insights from James Webb Space Telescope Observations of Cepheid Variables

Abstract:

The enduring discrepancy between local measurements of the Hubble constant (H0) and those inferred from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation within the ΛCDM framework remains a pressing issue in cosmology. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have provided unprecedented precision in the measurement of Cepheid variables, a crucial rung on the cosmic distance ladder. By leveraging JWST's advanced observational capabilities, we revisit the calibration of Cepheid luminosities, a key component in determining H0 through the local distance ladder.

Our analysis incorporates JWST's high-resolution imaging and photometric data of Cepheid variables in galaxies within the Hubble flow, thereby reducing systematic uncertainties associated with previous measurements. The enhanced accuracy in Cepheid distance moduli facilitates a more robust determination of H0, independent of early-universe physics. Our results indicate a local H0 measurement that persists in tension with CMB-derived values, reinforcing the notion that this discrepancy is not solely attributable to observational biases.

The persistence of the Hubble tension underscores the potential for new physics beyond the ΛCDM paradigm. As JWST continues to refine our understanding of Cepheid variables and the local distance ladder, our findings contribute to a nuanced discussion on the implications of H0 measurements for cosmology. By bridging the gap between local and early-universe probes, this study highlights the imperative of continued observational and theoretical efforts to resolve the Hubble tension, potentially illuminating new aspects of the universe's fundamental physics.
