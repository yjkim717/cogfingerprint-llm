**Abstract**

The escalating demand for secure data transmission and storage has spurred significant research into optical encryption techniques. This paper presents a novel approach to optical information security leveraging the capabilities of meta-optics and vector visual cryptography. Our strategy employs a metasurface-based architecture to encode a secret image into multiple, seemingly random shares, effectively implementing a vector visual cryptographic scheme. Unlike traditional visual cryptography methods often hampered by large share sizes and computationally intensive decryption processes, our approach capitalizes on the wavefront shaping capabilities of metasurfaces to achieve compact share generation and, crucially, real-time decryption. The metasurface acts as a programmable optical element, spatially encoding the secret information across the generated shares. Decryption is achieved through a straightforward superposition of these shares at the receiver, facilitated by the engineered optical properties of the metasurface.  Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach, showcasing a significant reduction in decryption time compared to conventional visual cryptography implementations. The proposed method offers a pathway towards high-security, rapid decryption systems applicable to diverse fields including secure communication, data storage, and authentication protocols. Further investigation will focus on extending the system’s robustness against various attacks and exploring its adaptability to dynamic encryption keys.
