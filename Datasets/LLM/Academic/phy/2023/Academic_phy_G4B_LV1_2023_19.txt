**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum information processing necessitates robust sources of entanglement for scalable quantum technologies. This work presents a novel lithium niobate metasurface architecture designed for the generation of polarization-entangled photon pairs. Utilizing a nonlinear optical effect within the lithium niobate material, the metasurface facilitates efficient photon splitting and subsequent polarization manipulation. Specifically, the engineered geometry of the metasurface induces strong nonlinear susceptibility, leading to the creation of entangled photon states.  Crucially, this approach demonstrates the potential for polarization engineering, allowing for precise control over the entanglement properties.  Furthermore, preliminary investigations suggest compatibility with qutrit states – multi-level quantum systems – offering a pathway towards enhanced quantum memory and processing capabilities.  This compact and tunable platform represents a significant step towards miniaturized and adaptable quantum devices, with ongoing research focused on optimizing entanglement fidelity and exploring broader state manipulation possibilities.
