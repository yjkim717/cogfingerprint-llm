**Title:** Resolving the Hubble Tension: A JWST-Calibrated Distance Ladder Using Cepheid Variables and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch

**Abstract:**

The persistent discrepancy between the early-universe measurement of the Hubble constant (H₀) from the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis and late-universe measurements from the cosmic distance ladder constitutes a pivotal crisis in modern cosmology. A leading hypothesis posits that this "Hubble tension" stems from unaccounted systematic uncertainties in the calibration of Cepheid period-luminosity relations in the anchor galaxies of the distance ladder. The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its superior infrared resolution and sensitivity, provides an unprecedented opportunity to mitigate these systematics. This study presents a revised distance-ladder measurement of H₀, leveraging JWST's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) to re-calibrate Cepheid photometry in key galaxies such as NGC 4258 and the hosts of recent Type Ia supernovae. We concurrently employ the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, observable with JWST in the same fields, as a cross-check to disentangle uncertainties related to metallicity dependence and crowding that have historically plagued HST data. Our preliminary analysis of JWST Cycle 1 observations demonstrates a significant reduction in the photometric scatter of the Cepheid Leavitt Law. The resulting H₀ value shows a marked convergence towards the CMB-preferred value, suggesting that previous Cepheid-based measurements were indeed biased by unresolved systematic effects. This JWST-calibrated ladder provides the most stringent local constraint on H₀ to date, critically informing whether the residual tension necessitates new physics beyond the standard ΛCDM cosmological model.
