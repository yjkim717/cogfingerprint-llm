**Abstract**

Recent investigations into four-dimensional Einstein gravity have revealed a compelling structural equivalence between disparate formulations of Lorentz generators. This work demonstrates that both Hamiltonian approaches, grounded in canonical quantization, and a null infinity-based definition of these generators exhibit an underlying unity.  The core of this equivalence lies in the direct sum of the Poincaré algebra, representing kinematic symmetries, with an infinite-dimensional Abelian algebra. Crucially, this extended algebra incorporates supertranslations, reflecting the inherent gauge redundancy within Einstein gravity’s action.  Specifically, the asymptotic symmetry algebra (ASA) governing the theory is identified as this combined structure.  Employing null infinity as a convenient boundary, the Lorentz generators emerge as elements within this larger algebra, allowing for a unified description of their action and implications for renormalization group flows.  Further exploration of this connection promises to refine our understanding of gravity’s fundamental symmetries and their relationship to spacetime geometry.
