**Selective Etching of Pt-Ni Nano-Octahedra for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance**

The pursuit of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity necessitates precise control over surface composition. This study investigates a novel surface engineering strategy utilizing gaseous etching to modify Pt-Ni nano-octahedra. We demonstrate that selective removal of Ni from the Pt-Ni framework, achieved via controlled oxygen exposure, results in a significant enrichment of Pt at the surface.  Characterization via transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the formation of a predominantly Pt-rich layer.  Correlation with electrochemical measurements reveals a marked increase in mass activity for the Pt-rich material, indicative of improved ORR kinetics.  This approach offers a scalable route to tailoring catalyst surfaces and represents a promising avenue for advancing electrode materials in fuel cell technology. Further investigation into the etching parameters and resulting surface structure-activity relationships is warranted.
