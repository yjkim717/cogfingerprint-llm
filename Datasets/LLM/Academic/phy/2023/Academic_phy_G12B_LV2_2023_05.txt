Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a physics publication, based on your provided summary and adhering to your specifications (2023 context, ~348 words, formal tone, structured reasoning).  I've aimed for a level of detail and terminology appropriate for a specialist audience.  Following the abstract, I've included a brief explanation of the choices made in its construction.

**Abstract:**

The precise determination of the Hubble constant (H₀) remains a central challenge in contemporary cosmology, revealing a persistent and statistically significant tension between measurements derived from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and those obtained from the local distance ladder. This discrepancy, often referred to as the "Hubble Tension," casts doubt on the standard ΛCDM cosmological model and motivates ongoing efforts to refine both observational techniques and theoretical frameworks. This review synthesizes recent progress in H₀ measurements, with a particular focus on the transformative capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and its potential to resolve systematic uncertainties plaguing current estimates.

Traditional local distance ladder methods, relying on Cepheid variable stars and Type Ia supernovae as standard candles, have been subject to criticisms regarding metallicity effects, dust extinction, and calibration uncertainties in the Cepheid period-luminosity relationship. JWST’s unprecedented infrared sensitivity offers a pathway to mitigate these systematic errors through improved observations of Cepheid distances, particularly in galaxies beyond the local group, and more precise characterization of dust composition and extinction laws. Furthermore, the telescope’s ability to resolve finer details in star-forming regions allows for more accurate determination of Cepheid metallicities, reducing a key source of systematic bias.

We examine the implications of early JWST data for the Hubble constant, assessing its impact on the tension with CMB-derived values from Planck. While definitive conclusions are premature, initial results indicate a possible shift in the local H₀ measurement, although the magnitude of this shift and its statistical significance remain under investigation.  The abstract also discusses alternative explanations for the Hubble Tension, including early dark energy models, modified gravity theories, and evolving dark energy parameters, and considers how JWST observations, alongside complementary ground-based surveys, might provide crucial constraints on these models. Finally, we outline future prospects for refining H₀ measurements and the potential for JWST to unveil new physics beyond the standard cosmological paradigm.

    1.  **Introduction:** States the problem (Hubble Tension) and its significance.
    2.  **Background:** Briefly describes the traditional methods and their limitations.
    3.  **JWST's Role:** Explains how JWST addresses the limitations.
    4.  **Current Status:** Discusses the impact of early JWST data and its ongoing analysis.
    5.  **Alternative Explanations:** Acknowledges other possible causes of the tension.
    6.  **Future Prospects:** Outlines future research directions and potential discoveries.
*   **Year Context (2023):** The language reflects the current stage of JWST observations.
