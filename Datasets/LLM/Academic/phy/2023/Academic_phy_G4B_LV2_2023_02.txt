**Abstract**

We introduce a novel perspective on calculating scattering amplitudes in colored scalar theories, utilizing a topological expansion framework to recast the traditionally complex task as a counting problem.  Existing perturbative approaches often struggle with the exponential growth of Feynman diagrams, necessitating sophisticated techniques for amplitude evaluation.  Our method leverages the inherent topological structure of the theoryâ€™s Lagrangian to define a well-defined counting procedure, intrinsically connected to the kinematic space of the scattering process.  Specifically, we map the amplitudes to a combinatorial space amenable to topological analysis, allowing for a systematic and potentially more efficient computation.  This approach offers a promising avenue for tackling the counting problem inherent in these models, particularly as it relates to the precise determination of scattering amplitudes for colored scalar particles.  Preliminary investigations suggest this framework provides a robust foundation for exploring higher-order corrections and potentially generalizing to other gauge theories, with the 2023 focus being on establishing the foundational principles and initial computational validation.
