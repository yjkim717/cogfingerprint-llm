**Abstract**

The topology of spacetime surrounding black holes is profoundly influenced by the distribution of matter, particularly scalar fields. This study investigates the impact of distinct topological configurations of timelike circular orbits – often termed “timelike circular orbits” – on the global structure of black hole solutions, focusing on the role of scalar hair. Utilizing advanced numerical relativity techniques and examining a suite of idealized black hole models, we demonstrate that the presence of scalar hair does not fundamentally alter the underlying topological properties of these orbits.  Specifically, the winding number associated with these orbits, a key topological invariant, remains invariant under varying scalar field configurations.  Our findings suggest that while scalar hair introduces localized distortions in the geometry, it does not induce a change in the global connectivity of the spacetime surrounding the black hole. This observation provides crucial constraints on models attempting to incorporate scalar hair as a mechanism for generating observable topological features, highlighting the dominant role of the black hole’s mass and angular momentum in dictating its spacetime topology.
