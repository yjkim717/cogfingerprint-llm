In this study, we employ explainable neural networks to analyze the relationship between the mass accretion histories of dark matter halos and their internal density profiles. Using mutual information as a quantitative measure, we systematically recover the known correlation with the scale radius and identify the mass accretion rate as a previously underappreciated governing parameter. Our interpretable machine learning framework reveals that halos with higher recent accretion exhibit systematically shallower inner density slopes, providing new insights into halo assembly bias and structure formation in a Î›CDM cosmology.
