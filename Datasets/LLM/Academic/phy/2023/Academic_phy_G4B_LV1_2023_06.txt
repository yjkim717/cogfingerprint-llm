**Abstract**

The persistent challenge of singularities within classical General Relativity necessitates a robust quantum theory of gravity. This work investigates the implications of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) for the structure of regular black holes, moving beyond traditional semiclassical approximations. Utilizing a novel quantization scheme derived from LQG’s background independence, we model the spacetime geometry near the event horizon, revealing deviations from the expected singularity formation.  Specifically, we demonstrate how quantum fluctuations in the metric, governed by the area and volume operators, introduce a subtle modification to the causal structure.  Preliminary calculations suggest a suppressed singularity, potentially linked to a nascent form of Hawking evaporation occurring at scales inaccessible to standard thermal descriptions.  Further investigation is required to fully characterize the emergent spacetime dynamics and assess the implications for information loss paradoxes, ultimately contributing to a more complete understanding of black hole physics within the LQG framework.
