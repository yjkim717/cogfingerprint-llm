In this work, we present a combinatorial reformulation of scattering amplitudes in colored scalar field theories, circumventing conventional Feynman diagrammatic methods. By leveraging enumerative techniques from algebraic combinatorics, we derive compact integral representations that encode contributions across all loop orders. This framework naturally incorporates the topological 't Hooft expansion, organizing amplitudes by genus to systematically probe non-planar sectors. Crucially, our approach preserves fundamental principles of locality and unitarity without explicit diagrammatic construction, offering a unified description of perturbative expansions. The resulting formalism not only elucidates hidden mathematical structures underlying quantum field theories but also provides computational advantages for high-multiplicity processes. We demonstrate its efficacy through explicit evaluations in φ³ and φ⁴ theories, revealing novel connections to integrable systems and random matrix models. This paradigm shift opens avenues for exploring strongly-coupled regimes and gravitational duals within a purely combinatorial setting.
