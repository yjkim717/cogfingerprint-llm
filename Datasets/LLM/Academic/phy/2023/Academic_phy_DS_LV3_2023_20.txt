In 2023, the study of generalized and categorical symmetries has emerged as a transformative framework for analyzing quantum field theories (QFTs). This paradigm extends beyond conventional global symmetries, offering profound insights into non-invertible symmetry structures and their implications for particle phenomenology. We demonstrate that discrete symmetries, particularly when gauged, furnish novel constraints on possible ultraviolet completions of effective field theories. These developments provide powerful new tools for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model, thereby reshaping our approach to long-standing problems in high-energy physics.
