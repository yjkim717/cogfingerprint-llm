**Meta-Optics Enabled Vector Visual Cryptography for Real-Time Secure Data Transmission**

This research presents a novel approach to secure data transmission leveraging the principles of meta-optics and vector visual cryptography.  We demonstrate a system utilizing a meta-surface lens array to manipulate light propagation in a manner conducive to vector visual cryptography (VVC).  Specifically, modulated light patterns, representing encrypted data, are projected onto a receiving surface, where a specialized meta-camera reconstructs the visual cipher.  Crucially, the system achieves real-time decryption, facilitated by an embedded processor analyzing the reconstructed visual data.  The inherent complexity of the meta-optical manipulation significantly enhances the security of the VVC scheme, mitigating traditional cryptographic vulnerabilities.  Preliminary investigations indicate a robust resistance to common visual cryptanalysis techniques.  Further work will focus on optimizing meta-surface design for bandwidth and exploring integration with quantum key distribution protocols, promising a significant advancement in secure photonic communication.
