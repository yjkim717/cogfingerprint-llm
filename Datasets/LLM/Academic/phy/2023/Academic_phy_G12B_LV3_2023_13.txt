**Abstract**

The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) traditionally describes defect formation during continuous phase transitions. However, its application to quantum systems undergoing slow annealing across quantum critical points (QCPs) presents unique challenges due to the inherently quantum nature of the process. This work presents an analytical investigation into the generation of topological defects during quantum annealing of a system exhibiting long-range interactions. We derive the full counting statistics of these defects, demonstrating that the resulting distribution is governed by a purely quantum mechanism, distinct from classical KZM predictions. Our analysis reveals a universality in the moments of the defect distribution, independent of specific system details beyond the underlying critical behavior. This finding highlights the emergence of novel scaling behaviors and provides a deeper understanding of defect formation in quantum systems, with implications for quantum annealing algorithms and the study of emergent phenomena in condensed matter physics. The results offer a new perspective on the interplay between quantum fluctuations, topological order, and the dynamics of annealing processes near QCPs.
