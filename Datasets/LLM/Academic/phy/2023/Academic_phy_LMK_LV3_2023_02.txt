"In 2023, we introduce a combinatorial framework for scattering amplitudes in colored scalar theories, leveraging kinematic space and topological expansion to bypass Feynman diagrams. By applying novel combinatorial ideas, we derive a simplified expression for scattering amplitudes, enhancing computational efficiency. This innovative approach redefines the theoretical landscape, providing a more intuitive understanding of particle interactions and paving the way for further research in phy."
