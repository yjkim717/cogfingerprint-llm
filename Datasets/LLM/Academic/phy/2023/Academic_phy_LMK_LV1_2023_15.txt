Title: Enhanced Lithium Storage in Sodium Niobate with Tunable Interlayer Spacing: A Novel Approach to High-Rate, Long-Life Electrode Materials

Abstract:

The development of high-performance lithium-ion batteries necessitates the exploration of novel electrode materials that can facilitate rapid charging and discharging while maintaining long-term cyclic stability. In this context, we report the synthesis and characterization of sodium niobate (NaNbO3) with engineered interlayer spacing as a promising anode material for lithium storage. By modulating the interlayer distance through a controlled hydrothermal process, we achieve a significant enhancement in the rate performance and cyclic stability of NaNbO3. The enlarged interlayer spacing enables efficient lithium-ion intercalation and de-intercalation, resulting in a high reversible capacity of 250 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1. Moreover, the material exhibits exceptional rate capability, retaining 80% of its initial capacity at a high current density of 5 A g-1. The cyclic stability of the material is also noteworthy, with a capacity retention of 95% after 500 cycles at 1 A g-1. The superior electrochemical performance is attributed to the optimized interlayer spacing, which mitigates the structural strain associated with lithium-ion insertion and extraction. Our findings highlight the potential of NaNbO3 with tailored interlayer spacing as a viable anode material for high-rate, long-life lithium-ion batteries, paving the way for the development of advanced energy storage systems.
