Title: Revisiting Gravitational Bremsstrahlung through Multipolar-Post-Minkowskian Waveforms and Scattering Amplitudes

Abstract:
This study undertakes a comprehensive comparison between one-loop gravitational bremsstrahlung amplitudes and multipolar-post-Minkowskian waveforms, shedding light on the intricacies of gravitational radiation in high-energy scattering processes. By employing a post-Newtonian expansion framework, we examine the convergence of these two approaches at various perturbative orders. Our findings indicate that, at lower post-Newtonian orders, both methods exhibit remarkable agreement, validating the robustness of the multipolar-post-Minkowskian formalism in capturing the essential physics of gravitational bremsstrahlung. However, at higher orders, significant discrepancies emerge, underscoring the limitations of the post-Newtonian expansion in accurately modeling soft graviton emissions. These results have important implications for the development of more accurate waveform models, particularly in the context of next-generation gravitational wave astronomy. Our analysis, conducted in 2023, contributes to the ongoing refinement of theoretical predictions in gravitational physics.
