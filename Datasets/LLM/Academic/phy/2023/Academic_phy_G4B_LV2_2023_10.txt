**Abstract**

Recent advancements in electrocatalysis necessitate strategies for manipulating the surface properties of transition metal nanoparticles to optimize performance. This research investigates a novel approach to enhance the electrocatalytic activity of Pt-Ni nano-octahedra through controlled gaseous etching, specifically utilizing oxygen plasma treatment. Our investigation demonstrates that selective etching, resulting in a Pt-rich surface shell, dramatically alters the atomic composition and morphology of the initial material. Electrochemical characterization, employing cyclic voltammetry and linear sweep voltammetry, reveals a substantial augmentation in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. 

Specifically, the etched Pt-Ni nano-octahedra exhibit a significantly increased current density and improved kinetic perofrmance compared to the pristine material.  The observed enhancement is attributed to the increased Pt surface area and modified electronic structure facilitated by the shell formation. These findings highlight the potential of gaseous etching as a versatile surface engineering technique for precisely tailoring the catalytic properties of nanoscale materials, with implications for the development of next-generation electrocatalysts and fuel cell technologies. Further investigations into the etching parameters are ongoing to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
