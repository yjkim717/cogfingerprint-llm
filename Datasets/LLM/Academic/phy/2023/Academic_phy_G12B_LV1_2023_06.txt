**Abstract: Quantum Geometry and the Resolution of Black Hole Singularities: A Loop Quantum Gravity Perspective on Regular Black Hole Evaporation**

The persistent problem of singularities within the classical framework of General Relativity remains a central challenge in theoretical physics. Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) offers a promising avenue for addressing this issue by quantizing spacetime itself. This work investigates the implications of LQG for regular black hole solutions, specifically focusing on the resolution of the central singularity and exploring novel dynamics during Hawking evaporation. We consider regular black holes, characterized by finite curvature at the would-be singularity, as potential manifestations of quantum gravitational effects. Utilizing a coarse-grained description inspired by LQG, we analyze how modifications to the classical spacetime geometry influence the Penrose diagrams and causal structure, effectively eliminating the singularity within the horizon. Our analysis extends to the late-time evaporation phase, exploring whether the quantum nature of spacetime fundamentally alters the Hawking radiation spectrum and the black hole's ultimate fate.  We examine scenarios where the quantum geometry introduces a minimal length scale, potentially leading to a “bounce” or transition to a different spacetime regime rather than complete evaporation.  Furthermore, we contrast our findings with those derived from other approaches to singularity resolution, such as modified gravity theories. This investigation aims to provide a more complete picture of black hole physics within a fully quantum gravitational theory and provides a potential framework for understanding the fate of information in these extreme environments.
