**Abstract:**

Recent developments in quantum field theory necessitate refined approaches to analyzing symmetry properties, particularly concerning discrete symmetries and their impact on particle phenomenology. This work introduces the concept of ‘generalized symmetries,’ extending traditional symmetry frameworks to accommodate non-Abelian transformations and richer algebraic structures. We posit that these generalized symmetries offer a powerful tool for systematically investigating the effects of discrete symmetries – such as parity, charge-parity (CP), and time-reversal – on particle decay rates, scattering amplitudes, and the generation of mass. Utilizing categorical techniques, we construct a formalism allowing for the explicit computation of symmetry breaking effects. Preliminary applications to the Standard Model demonstrate the potential of this methodology to predict subtle deviations from expected behavior, ultimately contributing to refined particle phenomenology and improved constraints on new physics beyond the Standard Model in 2023 and beyond.
