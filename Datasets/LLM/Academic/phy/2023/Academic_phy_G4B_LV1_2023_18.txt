**Abstract**

The precise manipulation of atomic ensembles is fundamental to advancing quantum information processing and precision measurement. This work presents a novel approach to magneto-optical trap (MOT) construction, leveraging the tailored electromagnetic properties of metasurfaces to enhance trapping efficiency and control. Specifically, we detail the fabrication and characterization of a metasurface-based polarization-multiplexed splitter, designed to generate a spatially complex and highly uniform light field within the MOT volume.  The metasurface, engineered with sub-wavelength metagratings, exhibits enhanced second harmonic generation, facilitating efficient polarization multiplexing.  Experimental results demonstrate a significant increase in strontium atom capture rate and improved spatial uniformity compared to conventional MOT designs.  These findings highlight the potential of metasurfaces as a versatile tool for shaping light fields and optimizing atomic trapping geometries, paving the way for more compact and controllable quantum systems.  Further investigation into adaptive metasurface control promises even greater precision and versatility in future MOT architectures.
