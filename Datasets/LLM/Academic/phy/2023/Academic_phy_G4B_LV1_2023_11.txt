**Abstract**

Characterizing quantum chaos remains a significant challenge, necessitating novel approaches beyond traditional Lyapunov exponents. This work introduces Krylov complexity as a potentially robust quantifier of chaotic behavior in quantum systems. Utilizing the Lanczos algorithm, we compute Lanczos coefficients from numerically simulated dynamics of the Sinai billiards, a classically well-studied model exhibiting sensitive dependence on initial conditions.  A key finding demonstrates a statistically significant correlation between the magnitude of these Lanczos coefficients and the corresponding classical Lyapunov exponents.  Furthermore, we explore the relationship between Krylov complexity and the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, suggesting a link to the system’s intrinsic mixing.  These results indicate that Krylov complexity may provide a valuable tool for discerning quantum chaotic behavior, offering a complementary perspective to existing methodologies and opening avenues for investigation into the fundamental connection between classical and quantum dynamics.
