**Abstract**

The characterization of quantum chaos remains a significant challenge within theoretical physics. This research explores the application of Krylov complexity as a novel metric for quantifying chaotic behavior in quantum systems, specifically focusing on the interplay between classical and quantum dynamics. Utilizing the framework of the Sinai billiards, a paradigmatic model for chaotic systems, we demonstrate a strong correlation between the magnitude of Lanczos coefficients – derived from spectral analysis – and classical Lyapunov exponents. These Lanczos coefficients, representing a measure of dynamical sensitivity, provide a pathway to assess the inherent complexity of the quantum system’s evolution.  Our findings suggest that Krylov complexity offers a potentially robust indicator of quantum chaos, bridging the gap between classical and quantum descriptions.  The observed relationship underscores the continued relevance of classical chaos theory in understanding the fundamental properties of quantum systems, opening avenues for future investigations into the emergence of quantum behavior from classical precursors.
