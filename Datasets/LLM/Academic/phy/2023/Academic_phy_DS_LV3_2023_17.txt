In 2023, the integration of meta-optics with vector visual cryptography has established a paradigm shift in optical encryption methodologies. By exploiting the multi-dimensional degrees of freedom in light—including phase, amplitude, and polarization—metasurface-based encryption platforms enable spatially dislocated information encoding. This approach fundamentally enhances security by distributing cipher components across distinct physical channels, rendering them resistant to conventional interception techniques. The decryption process is facilitated by a synchronized meta-camera system, which performs real-time optical correlation and vector field reconstruction without digital computation. This system achieves decryption latencies below 10 milliseconds, fulfilling the critical demand for high-speed secure communications. Our experimental validation confirms a theoretical secrecy capacity approaching the Shannon limit, positioning meta-optics as a cornerstone for next-generation cryptographic hardware in both terrestrial and satellite-based secure networks.
