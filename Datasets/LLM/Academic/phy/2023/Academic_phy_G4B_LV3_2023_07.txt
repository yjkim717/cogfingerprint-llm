**Abstract**

Recent advancements in numerical relativity have led to increasingly sophisticated waveform models describing gravitational wave propagation. However, a critical gap remains in fully accounting for the effects of quantum gravity. This study investigates the discrepancy between one-loop gravitational bremsstrahlung amplitudes, calculated via a post-Newtonian expansion, and corresponding multipolar-post-Minkowskian waveform predictions. Utilizing a novel, high-order perturbative approach, we demonstrate substantial quantitative disagreements emerge at higher post-Newtonian orders, particularly concerning the evolution of multipoles during inspiral. These discrepancies directly impact the accuracy of radiation reaction calculations, essential for modeling compact binary coalescence events. Furthermore, the observed divergence has implications for the soft expansion formalism, potentially necessitating revisions to current perturbative treatments.  The results underscore the need for incorporating quantum gravitational corrections to enhance the predictive power of gravitational waveform models and refine our understanding of strong-field gravity.
