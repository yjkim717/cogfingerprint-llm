**Abstract:** This work investigates the theoretical possibility of a singularity-free spacetime geometry facilitating a continuous transition between black hole and white hole horizons within a unified asymptotic region. Utilizing loop quantum cosmology as a framework for modeling the quantum gravitational regime at the core, we derive a novel Lorentzian metric characterized by the absence of a central singularity. The proposed spacetime geometry is constrained by a local Killing symmetry and defined by two macroscopic parameters, enabling a potentially viable model for exploring the quantum-gravity-corrected interior of black holes. These results offer a pathway towards resolving the information paradox and advancing our understanding of spacetime evolution.
