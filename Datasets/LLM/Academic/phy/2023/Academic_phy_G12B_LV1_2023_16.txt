Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a physics publication in 2023. I've aimed for precision and structure, and a word count around 172.

**Abstract:**

The canonical Hamiltonian formulation of Einstein gravity in four dimensions faces challenges regarding the precise definition of asymptotic symmetries, particularly concerning the treatment of supertranslations. This work presents a novel demonstration of the equivalence between two distinct approaches to redefining the asymptotic Lorentz generators at null infinity (ℜ). One method leverages a coordinate-dependent redefinition of the boundary conditions, while the other employs a Lie derivative transformation acting on the asymptotic metric.  We rigorously show that these seemingly disparate constructions yield identical asymptotic symmetry algebras, effectively resolving ambiguities arising from the arbitrary choice of coordinate systems used to describe supertranslations.  This equivalence is established through a detailed analysis of the generating functions within the Hamiltonian framework, explicitly mapping the generators of one approach to those of the other. Crucially, this result reinforces the underlying consistency of asymptotic symmetry constructions in Einstein gravity and provides a robust foundation for future investigations into the relationship between asymptotic symmetries, conserved charges, and quantum gravity phenomena. The implications for understanding boundary dynamics and extracting physical observables are discussed.

**Notes on the Abstract:**

*   **Formal Language:** Uses precise terminology like "asymptotic symmetry algebras," "null infinity (ℜ)," "Lie derivative transformation," and "generating functions."
*   **Structured Reasoning:** Clearly states the problem, the approach, the key result (equivalence), and the implications.
*   **Year Context (2023):**  The phrasing and focus acknowledge current research trends in asymptotic symmetries and their connection to quantum gravity.
*   **Specificity:** It references both approaches mentioned in the summary, providing a bit more detail than the original.
*   **Academic Tone:** Avoids colloquialisms and maintains a professional, objective voice.
