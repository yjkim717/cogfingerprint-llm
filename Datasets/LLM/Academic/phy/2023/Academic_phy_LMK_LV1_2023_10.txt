Title: Enhanced Electrocatalytic Activity of Surface-Engineered Pt-Ni Nano-Octahedra for Oxygen Reduction Reaction via Gaseous Etching

Abstract:
The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for advancing fuel cell technology. Herein, we report a novel gaseous etching strategy to engineer the surface composition of Pt-Ni nano-octahedra, resulting in a surface-layer-controlled structure with a Pt-rich shell. The controlled etching process enables the formation of a thin Pt-rich layer on the nano-octahedra surface, significantly enhancing the electrocatalytic activity for ORR. The optimized Pt-Ni nano-octahedra exhibit a mass activity of 1.43 A mgPt-1 at 0.9 V vs. RHE, demonstrating a 3.5-fold improvement compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. The enhanced performance is attributed to the synergistic effects of the Pt-rich shell and the underlying Ni-rich core, which modulate the electronic structure and optimize the adsorption of oxygenated species. This study provides a promising approach for designing high-performance electrocatalysts for ORR via surface engineering.
