In this work, we establish the complete equivalence between the Hamiltonian formulation and the null infinity framework for defining supertranslation-invariant Lorentz generators in four-dimensional asymptotically flat Einstein gravity. By systematically analyzing the asymptotic symmetry algebra, we demonstrate that both approaches yield identical expressions for the Lorentz generators when the supertranslation ambiguity is properly resolved. Our results unify two principal methodologies in gravitational physics, confirming that the Hamiltonian phase space construction at spatial infinity aligns precisely with the Bondi–Metzner–Sachs group structure at null infinity. This reconciliation resolves longstanding conceptual discrepancies and provides a robust foundation for computing conserved quantities in generic asymptotically flat spacetimes.
