**Emergent Black Hole Dynamics via Oscillator-Fermion Entanglement: A Novel Quantum Framework**

The prevailing paradigm of black hole formation necessitates a complex gravitational description, yet fundamental quantum principles remain inadequately integrated. This work proposes a simplified, yet potentially illuminating, model wherein a network of coupled oscillators and Majorana fermion excitations simulates the key features of a black hole within the context of an emergent universe scenario.  We investigate a discrete quantum system where the oscillators represent spacetime degrees of freedom, and Majorana fermions embody the quantized gravitational field.  By engineering specific coupling parameters, we demonstrate that this system exhibits emergent horizon behavior and an associated information loss phase, analogous to classical black hole thermodynamics.  Crucially, entanglement between oscillators and fermion modes drives the system toward a stable, isolated state, mirroring the event horizon.  These findings suggest that black hole dynamics may be fundamentally rooted in emergent quantum correlations, offering a new avenue for exploring the interface between quantum gravity and cosmological models, with implications for the nature of spacetime itself.  Further research will focus on quantifying the entanglement entropy and exploring deviations from standard Hawking radiation.
