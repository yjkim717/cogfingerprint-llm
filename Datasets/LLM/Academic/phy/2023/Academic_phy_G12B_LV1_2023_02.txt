**A Combinatorial Framework for Scattering Amplitudes: Towards a Diagram-Free Description of Quantum Field Theory**

Abstract:

The traditional calculation of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory relies heavily on Feynman diagrams, a perturbative expansion inherently tied to spacetime locality. This work presents a novel framework that bypasses the explicit construction and summation of Feynman diagrams, instead leveraging combinatorial structures to directly compute amplitudes. We explore a representation of kinematic space that facilitates the identification of underlying mathematical patterns governing scattering processes, mirroring the topological 't Hooft expansion. Our approach, rooted in algebraic geometry and combinatorics, reveals a deeper, non-perturbative structure from which scattering amplitudes emerge. Specifically, we demonstrate how amplitude recursion relations can be elegantly encoded within a combinatorial language, allowing for efficient computation and providing insights into the integrand structure beyond leading-order perturbation theory. This formalism suggests a fundamental re-evaluation of locality as an emergent property, hinting at a more geometric and combinatorial foundation for quantum field theory. Future directions involve exploring connections to string theory and developing practical algorithms for high-energy scattering calculations.

**Notes and Justification of Choices:**

*   **Emphasis on Diagram-Free Nature:** The abstract immediately highlights the core novelty – eliminating Feynman diagrams.
*   **Kinematic Space & 't Hooft Expansion:**  These keywords are explicitly integrated to connect the work to existing literature and established concepts.
*   **Mathematical Foundations:** I’ve included "algebraic geometry and combinatorics" to suggest the theoretical underpinnings, lending credibility and indicating the rigor of the approach.
*   **Recursion Relations:**  Mentioning recursion relations (e.g., those developed by Britto, Cachazo, and Tronc) is important, as they are a key element in modern amplitude calculations and often involve similar combinatorial techniques.
*   **Non-Perturbative Hints:**  The phrase "hints at a more geometric and combinatorial foundation" is crucial. It positions the work as potentially revolutionary, suggesting a deeper understanding beyond standard perturbative QFT.
*   **Future Directions:**  Referencing string theory and algorithmic development adds a forward-looking perspective and highlights potential impact.
*   **Locality as Emergent:**  This is a provocative statement aligning with the spirit of the original summary—that locality might not be fundamental but arises from a more basic structure.
*   **Word Count:** I carefully monitored the word count to stay within the 182-word target.



**Potential Expansion Areas (if a longer abstract were desired):**

*   **Specific Combinatorial Objects:** Mentioning specific types of combinatorial objects used (e.g., polytopes, graphs, or other relevant structures) would add more detail.
*   **Example Calculation:** Providing a very brief mention of a specific scattering process (e.g., gluon-gluon scattering) where the method has been applied would ground the abstract in concrete results.
*   **Connection to Dualities:** If the work has connections to dualities (e.g., AdS/CFT), that would be a significant
