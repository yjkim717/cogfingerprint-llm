**Abstract: Topological Classification of Timelike Circular Geodesics in Spherically Symmetric Black Hole Spacetimes**

The investigation of geodesics in the vicinity of black holes provides crucial insights into their spacetime structure and potential observational signatures. This work presents a detailed topological classification of timelike circular geodesics within the framework of spherically symmetric black hole solutions, building upon recent advances in geodesic topology. We demonstrate that the topology of these orbits is not solely determined by the orbital radius and angular momentum, but is fundamentally linked to a novel topological invariant, a winding number, characterizing the path's behavior within the event horizon. This winding number reflects the number of times the geodesic encircles the black hole's singularity.

Our analysis reveals distinct families of timelike circular orbits exhibiting qualitatively different topological configurations. Specifically, we identify cases where the winding number dictates the existence and stability of these orbits, potentially influencing the dynamics of particles and fields traversing the spacetime. Furthermore, we explore the implications of scalar hair, a feature appearing in certain black hole solutions, on the allowed topological configurations, finding that the presence of scalar fields can modify the winding number and consequently alter the orbital landscape.  This offers a new perspective on the observational constraints imposed by black hole "no-hair" theorems. Future work will focus on extending this analysis to rotating black holes (Kerr spacetime) and exploring the connection between geodesic topology and gravitational wave emission from orbiting sources, potentially providing a novel probe of black hole properties.  The mathematical formalism utilizes differential geometry and topological methods to rigorously characterize these orbital structures.

**Notes & Potential Expansion Points for a Real Submission:**

*   **Citations:** This abstract lacks citations. In a real submission, it would need citations to relevant works on:
    *   Geodesic topology in general relativity.
    *   Timelike circular orbits around black holes.
    *   Spherically symmetric black hole solutions (e.g., Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström).
    *   Scalar hair and its effects on black hole spacetimes.
    *   Winding number concepts in related physics areas (e.g., string theory, condensed matter).
*   **Mathematical Details:** The abstract mentions "mathematical formalism." A fuller paper would elaborate on the specific mathematical techniques used (e.g., Cartan-Karlhede frame, integral invariants).
*   **Specific Black Hole Models:** Mentioning the specific black hole models analyzed (e.g., Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström) would add clarity.
*   **Stability Analysis:** If a stability analysis was performed, it should be mentioned more explicitly.
*   **Gravitational Wave Connection:** The final sentence hints at gravitational waves. If there's a concrete link (e.g., how topology affects waveform characteristics), expand on that.
