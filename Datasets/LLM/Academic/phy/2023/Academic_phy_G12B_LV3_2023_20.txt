**Abstract:** Recent developments in category theory offer a powerful framework for understanding and classifying symmetries in quantum field theories (QFTs). This work presents an introductory exposition of generalized, or categorical, symmetries, highlighting their potential to enrich particle phenomenology. Departing from traditional group-theoretic approaches, this formalism allows for the incorporation of non-group-like structures, providing a more comprehensive description of symmetries present in modern QFT models. We explore the conceptual foundations of these symmetries and demonstrate their applicability to analyzing discrete symmetries and their implications for model building, with a particular focus on their utility within the context of high-energy physics research in 2023. This approach promises novel insights into the structure of fundamental interactions.
