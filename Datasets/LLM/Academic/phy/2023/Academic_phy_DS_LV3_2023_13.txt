In this 2023 study, we investigate how long-range interactions fundamentally alter defect formation dynamics during quantum phase transitions governed by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Through numerical simulations of extended Ising chains with power-law couplings, we demonstrate that conventional scaling laws—predicting defect density dependence on quench rate—break down completely in strongly long-range regimes. Remarkably, the defect density becomes independent of transformation rate, saturating at a universal value determined solely by critical exponents. Statistical analysis of topological defects reveals universal distribution functions that persist across different interaction ranges and lattice geometries. These findings establish that defect generation in long-range quantum systems follows universal scaling relations governed by equilibrium critical properties rather than non-equilibrium dynamics, suggesting new pathways for controlling defect formation in quantum simulators and engineered atomic systems.
