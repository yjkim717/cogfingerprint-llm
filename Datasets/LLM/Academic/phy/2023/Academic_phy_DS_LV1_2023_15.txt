**Abstract**

The development of high-performance anode materials is critical for advancing next-generation lithium-ion batteries, particularly for applications demanding rapid charging and operation under extreme conditions. This study investigates the electrochemical properties of sodium niobate (NaNbOâ‚ƒ) as a lithium-storage anode, with a specific focus on the role of its engineered crystal structure. We demonstrate that by synthetically tailoring the material to possess an expanded interlayer spacing, we significantly enhance lithium-ion diffusion kinetics. Electrochemical analysis reveals that this structural modification confers exceptional performance characteristics. The anode exhibits superior rate capability, maintaining a high specific capacity at elevated current densities, which is indicative of its fast-charging potential. Furthermore, the material demonstrates exceptional long-term cyclic stability, with minimal capacity fade over numerous cycles, attributed to the robust, strain-accommodating crystal framework. Notably, the anode also displays excellent low-temperature performance, a critical metric often overlooked in anode design. These findings underscore that strategic manipulation of interlayer spacing in niobate-based oxides is a highly effective paradigm for developing durable, high-power anodes, paving the way for their use in demanding energy storage systems.
