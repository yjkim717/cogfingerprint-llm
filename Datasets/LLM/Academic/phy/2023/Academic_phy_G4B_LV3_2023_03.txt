**Abstract:**

Recent theoretical investigations posit that black hole physics may be emergent from fundamentally quantum systems. This study presents a simplified model—incorporating interacting oscillators coupled with Majorana fermions—to approximate the dynamics of a black hole horizon. Leveraging this framework, we explore the potential for observing characteristic features associated with black hole event horizons via the manipulation of qubits. Specifically, the emergent oscillator network provides a tractable platform to investigate entanglement and information transfer, crucial for understanding black hole thermodynamics.  Estimates derived from this model suggest a qubit resource requirement scaling dependent on the horizon’s size, necessitating further investigation into robust quantum error correction strategies.  The successful implementation of this approach could represent a significant step toward bridging the gap between classical general relativity and quantum mechanics, offering new insights into the nature of spacetime itself.
