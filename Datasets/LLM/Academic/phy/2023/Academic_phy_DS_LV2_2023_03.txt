This theoretical investigation examines a minimal quantum mechanical model comprising interacting oscillators and Majorana fermions, conjectured to holographically describe black hole physics. We analyze the system's emergent thermodynamic and scrambling properties characteristic of black holes. A central result is a rigorous lower-bound estimate for the number of qubits required in a prospective quantum simulation to observe these non-perturbative gravitational features, thereby delineating a critical threshold for experimental verification of such microscopic models.
