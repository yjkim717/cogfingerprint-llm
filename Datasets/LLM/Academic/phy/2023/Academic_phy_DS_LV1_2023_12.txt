In this study, we present a cross-platform optimization of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics software, leveraging GPU acceleration to enhance computational efficiency. Our implementation focuses on the efficient construction of the quantum mechanical Fock matrix, a primary computational bottleneck in hybrid simulations. By developing architecture-aware kernels for both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, we achieve near-identical performance scaling across platforms. Benchmark calculations on representative enzymatic systems demonstrate a 7–12× speedup relative to conventional CPU-based simulations while maintaining numerical accuracy. These advancements facilitate longer time-scale QM/MM trajectories with higher-level electronic structure methods, providing new opportunities for studying complex biochemical processes with ab initio accuracy. This work establishes a critical foundation for portable high-performance computing in computational biophysics.
