**Abstract:** This work presents an optimized implementation of the QUICK/AMBER QM/MM methodology accelerated via AMD Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Addressing the computational demands of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations, we detail a porting strategy yielding performance competitive with NVIDIA GPU-based implementations. Benchmarking results demonstrate substantial speed enhancements in molecular dynamics simulations compared to prior CPU-only versions. These findings broaden accessibility to QM/MM simulations, enabling investigations of complex chemical systems and furthering research in areas such as drug discovery and materials science.
