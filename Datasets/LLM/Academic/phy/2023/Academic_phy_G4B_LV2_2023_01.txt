**Abstract**

The black hole information paradox remains a central challenge in theoretical physics, predicated on the apparent loss of information associated with matter crossing the event horizon. This work introduces a novel framework suggesting that an exact discrete symmetry, manifested through judicious coordinate transformations, offers a potential resolution. Utilizing Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates, we demonstrate that a specific transformation protocol effectively eliminates the horizon singularity, thereby circumventing the conventional singularity problem. This symmetry, posited to be intrinsic to the spacetime geometry, fundamentally alters the dynamics near the horizon.  The implications extend to the preservation of quantum information, as the absence of a singular horizon mitigates the requirement for exotic interior physics to maintain unitarity.  Further investigation is warranted to fully characterize the nature of this symmetry and its impact on quantum black hole dynamics, potentially offering a concrete pathway towards reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics in the context of black holes.
