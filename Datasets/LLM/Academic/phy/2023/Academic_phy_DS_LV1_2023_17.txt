**Abstract**

The escalating demand for secure information transmission necessitates advanced cryptographic paradigms that transcend conventional digital limitations. This work introduces a vector visual cryptography (VVC) framework synergistically integrated with dielectric metasurfaces to realize high-speed optical encryption and decryption. Unlike scalar-optical systems, our approach leverages the full polarization state of light as an information carrier. A pair of complementary, spatially variant metasurfaces are engineered to function as cryptographic keys. These subwavelength elements impart distinct, polarization-dependent geometric phase profiles to an incident beam. Individually, each metasurface key produces only a random, noise-like diffraction pattern. However, when the correct pair is coherently superimposed in the optical path, the vectorial interference reconstructs the plaintext image directly in the far-field, enabling real-time decryption at the speed of light without electronic computation. Experimental validation in 2023 confirms robust encryption security against computational attacks, as the systemâ€™s security is rooted in physical light-matter interactions rather than algorithmic complexity. This meta-optical VVC platform establishes a new paradigm for ultra-fast, physically secure optical information processing.
