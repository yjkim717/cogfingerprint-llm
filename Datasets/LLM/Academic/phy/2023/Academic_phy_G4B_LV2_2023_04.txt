**Abstract**

Recent developments in quantum gravity necessitate a refined understanding of spacetime structure at the Planck scale. This work investigates the spatial extent of regions exhibiting slowly varying positive potentials within these systems, employing a novel approach rooted in the species scale and informed by the emergent string conjecture. We derive upper bounds on the size of such potential landscapes, demonstrating a fundamental connection between the dynamics of quantum gravity and the geometry of the underlying field space. Specifically, our analysis utilizes the species scale – a measure of the minimal length scale required for defining local observables – to constrain the allowable spatial variation. 

These constraints are then rigorously applied within the context of Calabi-Yau threefolds, a prominent class of compactified manifolds frequently invoked in string theory. The resulting limits, expressed in terms of positive potentials, offer valuable insights into the potential for spacetime homogeneity at the most fundamental level.  The implications of these findings extend to understanding the emergence of classical spacetime from quantum degrees of freedom and provide a framework for exploring the landscape of quantum gravitational solutions.
