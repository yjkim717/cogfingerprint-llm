In this 2023 study, we employ explainable neural networks to investigate dark matter halo density profiles, quantifying their dependence on assembly history through mutual information analysis. Our interpretable machine learning framework reveals that profile shapes are predominantly determined by early-time halo formation epochs, while contemporary structural features exhibit strong correlation with recent mass accretion rates. This dual-scale influence resolves longstanding debates regarding halo concentration drivers. By extracting physically meaningful relationships from complex simulations, we demonstrate machine learning's capacity to uncover fundamental astrophysical processes beyond traditional analytical approaches, establishing a new paradigm for dark matter research where artificial intelligence directly guides theoretical discovery.
