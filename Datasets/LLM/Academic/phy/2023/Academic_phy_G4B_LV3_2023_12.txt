**Abstract**

Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations represent a computationally intensive approach to studying complex molecular systems. Recent advancements in GPU acceleration have presented opportunities to enhance the efficiency of these simulations. This study reports on the successful implementation and optimization of QM/MM calculations utilizing the QUICK force field and the AMBER classical mechanics package, executed on AMD Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) during 2023.  Benchmarking against established NVIDIA hardware demonstrates that the AMD GPU-accelerated workflow achieves performance parity for many standard molecular dynamics protocols. Critically, the optimized implementation yields demonstrable speedups – ranging from 1.5 to 2.3x – compared to prior CPU-based QM/MM simulations employing similar system sizes and parameters. These findings suggest a viable pathway for broadening access to high-accuracy molecular simulations, particularly for researchers utilizing AMD computing infrastructure, and highlights the potential for further performance gains through continued algorithmic refinement and hardware-specific optimization.
