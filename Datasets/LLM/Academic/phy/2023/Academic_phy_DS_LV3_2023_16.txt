In the Hamiltonian formulation of four-dimensional Einstein gravity, the definition of Lorentz generators at null infinity has been historically complicated by supertranslation ambiguities, which obscure the clean identification of angular momentum. Recent investigations in 2023 have resolved this long-standing issue by demonstrating the precise equivalence between two independent approaches for constructing Lorentz generators that are manifestly free from such ambiguities. This reconciliation establishes a unified framework connecting the Hamiltonian and asymptotic symmetry algebra formalisms, confirming that the generators derived via the Barnich–Troessaert bracket align exactly with those obtained through a careful phase space reduction. Consequently, these results solidify the foundational role of the Bondi–van der Burg–Metzner–Sachs algebra in characterizing gravitational charges and provide a consistent description of angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes.
