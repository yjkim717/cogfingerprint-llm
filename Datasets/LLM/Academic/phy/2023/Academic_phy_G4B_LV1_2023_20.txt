**Abstract**

Recent developments in quantum field theory (QFT) necessitate a refined approach to understanding symmetries beyond traditional local gauge invariance. This work proposes the framework of ‘categorical symmetries’ – a generalization extending the concept of discrete symmetries – to provide a more flexible and potentially richer description of particle phenomenology. We posit that categorical symmetries, characterized by non-local transformations and enriched by algebraic structures, can accommodate previously intractable symmetries related to spacetime topology and quantum entanglement. Specifically, this formalism allows for a systematic investigation of how discrete symmetries, such as parity and time-reversal, manifest within higher-categorical contexts. Preliminary investigations suggest potential applications in elucidating anomalies in QED and exploring novel particle spectra predicted by models incorporating non-commutative geometry. Future research will focus on developing concrete mathematical tools and applying these generalized symmetries to specific particle physics models, aiming to enhance our understanding of fundamental interactions and experimental constraints in 2023 and beyond.
