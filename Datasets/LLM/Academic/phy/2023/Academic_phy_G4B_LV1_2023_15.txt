**Abstract**

The pursuit of high-performance materials for lithium-ion battery technology has driven significant research into novel intercalation compounds. This work details the synthesis and characterization of a modified sodium niobate (Na<sub>x</sub>Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) exhibiting a strategically engineered interlayer spacing. Utilizing a shear reorientation technique during the solid-state synthesis, we achieved a substantial expansion of the interlayer volume, resulting in enhanced lithium ion diffusion pathways. Electrochemical testing revealed a marked improvement in rate performance, demonstrating a coulombic efficiency exceeding 98% at C/10 discharge rates. Furthermore, the expanded interlayer structure mitigates structural degradation, evidenced by a prolonged cycle life with minimal capacity fade. Analysis via X-ray diffraction confirmed the structural transition and correlated the interlayer spacing directly with observed electrochemical behavior. These findings suggest that controlled manipulation of interlayer spacing in sodium niobate provides a viable pathway toward developing next-generation sodium-ion batteries with superior energy density and operational stability.
