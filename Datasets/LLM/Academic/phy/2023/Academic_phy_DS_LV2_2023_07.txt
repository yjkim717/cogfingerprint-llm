We present a systematic comparison between gravitational waveforms derived from amplitude-based methods and the multipolar-post-Minkowskian (MPM) formalism within the post-Newtonian (PN) framework. Our analysis focuses on the consistency of these independent approaches in modeling gravitational bremsstrahlung from compact binary systems. At lower PN orders, we establish complete agreement between the two methodologies, validating their mutual consistency in the weak-field regime. However, a significant discrepancy emerges at the 2.5PN level, where amplitude-based calculations and MPM-derived waveforms diverge in their predictions. This deviation suggests potential subtleties in the treatment of tail effects or nonlinear interactions within the MPM construction at higher orders. The observed disagreement underscores the necessity of resolving these differences to ensure the accuracy of waveform models used in gravitational-wave astronomy. Our findings highlight the complementary nature of quantum-inspired amplitude techniques and classical MPM methods while identifying critical points where further theoretical refinement is required for precision gravitational-wave phenomenology.
