**Abstract**

The black hole information paradox remains a fundamental challenge to established tenets of general relativity and quantum mechanics. Recent theoretical developments posit a novel approach to resolving this paradox, predicated on exploiting a hitherto unrecognized exact discrete symmetry within the black hole spacetime. Utilizing Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates, we demonstrate a method for eliminating the horizon singularity, thereby circumventing the conventional interior region problematic for information preservation. This transformation generates a topologically equivalent, yet fundamentally distinct, quantum clone of the external spacetime.  Crucially, this process preserves the exact binary symmetry inherent in the original black hole geometry.  The conservation of this symmetry, coupled with the creation of the quantum clone, offers a plausible mechanism for information to escape the black hole event horizon, effectively mitigating the paradox and suggesting a revised understanding of black hole structure at the Planck scale. Further investigation into the dynamics of this quantum clone is warranted.
