**Abstract**

The classification of timelike circular orbits (TCOs) in spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes represents a fundamental problem in general relativity and astrophysics, with direct implications for the dynamics of accretion flows and stellar systems. Traditional methods for analyzing orbital stability often rely on the second derivative of an effective potential, which, while effective, can obscure the underlying topological structure governing these dynamical systems. In this work, we introduce a novel topological framework to systematically investigate and classify all possible TCO configurations. By constructing a continuous vector field from the equations of motion on a manifold, we identify the critical points corresponding to TCOs as topological defects. The local behavior and stability of these orbits are then characterized by a topological invariant: the winding number. Our analysis reveals a universal topological classification: stable TCOs are invariably associated with a winding number of +1, representing a source in the phase flow of the radial coordinate, whereas unstable TCOs possess a winding number of -1, corresponding to a saddle point. This dichotomy provides a powerful and intuitive geometric interpretation of orbital stability, transcending specific metric choices. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by applying it to canonical spacetimes, including Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black holes, where it robustly reproduces known results while offering deeper insight into the global phase space structure. This topological formalism not only unifies the description of TCOs across a wide class of black hole solutions but also establishes a new pathway for exploring more complex, axi-symmetric spacetimes.
