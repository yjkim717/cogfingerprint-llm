We present a novel application of explainable neural networks to elucidate the connection between dark matter halo density profiles and their mass accretion histories. Our models, trained on cosmological simulations, demonstrate that the inner slope (α) correlates strongly with early assembly history, while the outer slope (β) is predominantly shaped by recent mass accretion rates. This physically interpretable framework successfully reconciles the diversity of empirically observed density profiles within a unified evolutionary paradigm, providing a critical bridge between halo formation theory and structural properties in astrophysical datasets.
