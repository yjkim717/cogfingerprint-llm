**Abstract**

In 2023, advancements in quantum computing have reignited interest in the exploration of novel materials with unique topological properties. This study investigates the electronic structure of topological insulators using density functional theory, revealing a profound impact of spin-orbit coupling on their bandgap energies. Our results demonstrate that the interplay between topological invariants and symmetry-breaking perturbations yields a non-trivial topological phase transition. Furthermore, we elucidate the role of surface states in determining the transport properties of these materials. The findings of this research contribute to the understanding of topological materials and their potential applications in next-generation quantum technologies. By shedding light on the intricate relationships between topology, symmetry, and electronic structure, this work paves the way for the discovery of novel materials with tailored properties, driving innovation in the field of quantum physics.
