**Abstract**

Recent astrophysical simulations predict a complex relationship between dark matter halo density profiles and halo mass accretion rate, yet quantifying these interactions remains challenging. This study employs a novel approach utilizing explainable artificial neural networks (XAI) to investigate the evolution of dark matter halo density profiles within large astrophysical datasets. We trained a deep neural network to predict density profiles, subsequently leveraging XAI techniques – specifically SHAP values – to identify a dominant parameter controlling the outer halo density beyond the virial radius. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant correlation between the mass accretion rate and the asymptotic behavior of the density profile, suggesting a feedback mechanism driving halo structure. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of halo formation and evolution, moving beyond traditional N-body simulations to offer interpretable insights into the distribution of dark matter in the universe. Further research will explore the implications for cosmological models and galaxy formation.
