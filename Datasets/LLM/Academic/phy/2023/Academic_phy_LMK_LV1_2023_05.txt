Title: Revisiting the Hubble Tension: Insights from James Webb Space Telescope Observations of Cepheid Variables

Abstract:

The Hubble constant (H0) discrepancy, a longstanding issue in modern astrophysics, persists as a pressing challenge to the Lambda Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model. Recent measurements of H0 derived from Cepheid variable observations have yielded values that diverge from those inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), with its enhanced observational capabilities, has provided new insights into this conundrum. In this study, we present an analysis of JWST observations of Cepheid variables in nearby galaxies, leveraging the telescope's superior angular resolution and photometric precision to mitigate systematic uncertainties.

Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in the uncertainty associated with H0 measurements, owing to the improved accuracy in Cepheid distance moduli and the minimization of crowding and blending effects. The JWST data yield a value of H0 = 73.2 ± 1.4 km s−1 Mpc−1, in excellent agreement with previous Cepheid-based measurements. Notably, the JWST observations reveal a decrease in the systematic uncertainty contribution to the overall error budget, underscoring the telescope's capability to refine our understanding of the local distance ladder.

The persistence of the H0 discrepancy, despite the improved JWST measurements, suggests that the tension may be indicative of new physics beyond the ΛCDM paradigm. Our findings underscore the need for continued investigation into the sources of this discrepancy, as well as the importance of forthcoming observations with JWST and other next-generation facilities, which will further illuminate the nature of the Hubble tension and its implications for our understanding of the cosmos.
