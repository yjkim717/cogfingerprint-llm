**Abstract:**

Contemporary optical encryption techniques often suffer from vulnerabilities related to key distribution and processing speed. This research investigates a novel approach – meta-optics-enabled vector visual cryptography – designed to overcome these limitations. Utilizing precisely engineered metasurfaces, we demonstrate a method for generating and distributing encrypted visual data via vector images. Crucially, the proposed system facilitates real-time decryption, achieved through integrated metasurface processing, dramatically reducing latency compared to conventional optical methods.  The compact nature of metasurface-based components contributes to a significantly smaller encryption footprint.  Preliminary simulations and theoretical analysis suggest a heightened level of security derived from the inherent complexity of the metasurface manipulation.  Further investigation will focus on optimizing metasurface design for enhanced key generation and exploring the potential for adaptive encryption schemes, representing a significant advancement in secure photonic communication protocols by 2023.
