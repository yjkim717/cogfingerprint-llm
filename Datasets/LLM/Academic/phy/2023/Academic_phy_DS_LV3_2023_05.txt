**Abstract**

The persistent discrepancy in measurements of the Hubble constant (H₀), a fundamental parameter governing the expansion rate of the universe, represents a significant challenge to the standard cosmological model, ΛCDM. While early-universe probes, such as the Planck satellite's cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, yield a value of approximately 67.4 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹, late-universe distance-ladder techniques, historically reliant on Cepheid variable stars, consistently indicate a higher value near 73 km s⁻¹ Mpc⁻¹. This "Hubble tension," standing at a significance of over 5σ, suggests either unresolved systematic errors or new physics beyond the established model. The recent deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2023 marks a pivotal advancement in addressing this conundrum, primarily by mitigating systematic uncertainties inherent in previous observational campaigns. JWST's superior infrared sensitivity and resolution are now being leveraged to recalibrate the cosmic distance ladder with unprecedented precision. Key programs are obtaining high-fidelity photometry of Cepheids in the same anchor galaxies used to calibrate Type Ia supernovae, but crucially, at near-infrared wavelengths where the impact of interstellar extinction is substantially reduced. Concurrently, JWST is providing independent calibrations using the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method, a stellar population-based standard candle. By enabling a direct, systematics-controlled comparison between the Cepheid and TRGB distance scales within identical galactic environments, JWST observations are rigorously quantifying previously elusive sources of error, such as metallicity dependencies and photometric blending in crowded stellar fields. The initial results from these campaigns are refining the local H₀ measurement and placing stringent constraints on the magnitude of residual systematics. This empirical progress is critical for determining whether the Hubble tension necessitates revisions to fundamental physics or can be resolved through enhanced astrophysical understanding, thereby shaping the future trajectory of cosmological inquiry.
