Title: Topological Characterization of Timelike Circular Orbits in Spherically Symmetric Black Holes with Scalar Hair

Abstract:

The topological configurations of timelike circular orbits in spherically symmetric black holes with scalar hair are investigated using a novel approach based on a vector field with zero points. By defining a winding number associated with this vector field, we establish a topological invariant that characterizes the timelike circular orbits around these black holes. We demonstrate that the winding number is directly related to the number of stable and unstable timelike circular orbits, providing a deeper understanding of the orbital dynamics in these spacetimes. Our analysis reveals that the presence of scalar hair significantly affects the topological configurations of timelike circular orbits, leading to novel features not observed in hairless black holes. Specifically, we show that the winding number can be used to distinguish between different types of black holes with scalar hair, and that it provides a robust tool for classifying the topological properties of their timelike circular orbits. Our results have important implications for our understanding of the interplay between gravity, scalar fields, and the orbital dynamics of particles in curved spacetimes, shedding new light on the complex behavior of matter in the vicinity of black holes.
