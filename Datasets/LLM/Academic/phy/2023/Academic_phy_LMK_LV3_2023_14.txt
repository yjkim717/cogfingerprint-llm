Title: Topological Analysis of Timelike Circular Orbits in Spherically Symmetric Black Holes with Scalar Hair

Abstract:
This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the topological configurations of timelike circular orbits within spherically symmetric black holes endowed with scalar hair. By employing a topological framework, we classify the timelike circular orbits into distinct topological classes, characterized by their invariant total topological numbers. Our analysis reveals that the presence of scalar hair significantly influences the topological structure of these orbits, leading to novel topological features that diverge from their scalar-hairless counterparts. The findings indicate that the topological numbers remain invariant under continuous deformations of the spacetime, underscoring the robustness of our results. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between black hole geometry, scalar hair, and the topological properties of timelike circular orbits, shedding new light on the underlying physics of these complex systems.
