In this work, we present a novel, singularity-free Lorentzian metric solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the complete transition of a black hole into a white hole within the same asymptotic region. Departing from conventional gravitational collapse paradigms, our model is grounded in principles of quantum geometry, which provide a natural regularization mechanism for the classical singularity. We demonstrate that this spacetime geometry remains globally hyperbolic and causally stable throughout the transition process. The resulting framework suggests that black holes may not represent endpoints of gravitational collapse but rather transient states, with significant implications for information recovery and the ultimate fate of astrophysical black holes. This model offers a concrete geometric realization of black-to-white hole transitions, reconciling semiclassical gravity with foundational quantum gravitational insights.
