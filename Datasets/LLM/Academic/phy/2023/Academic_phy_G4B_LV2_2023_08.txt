**Abstract**

The singularity theorems of general relativity traditionally delineate distinct event horizons marking black hole formation and evaporation. This work introduces a novel Lorentzian metric formulation designed to represent a unified, asymptotic transition between these disparate phases â€“ specifically, the black hole to white hole metamorphosis. Leveraging a modified Oppenheimer-Snyder model, we construct a spacetime geometry wherein the collapse singularity smoothly evolves into an expansion singularity, effectively circumventing the conventional separation of black hole and white hole domains. 

Crucially, this metric is predicated on incorporating nascent concepts of quantum geometry, suggesting a potential role for non-commutative spacetime at extreme densities.  The proposed solution maintains a single, asymptotically flat region, offering a theoretical framework for investigating the dynamics preceding and following black hole evaporation.  Further investigation utilizing advanced numerical techniques is warranted to fully characterize the emergent quantum properties and test the predictive power of this unified Lorentzian description within 2023.
