**Abstract**

The reconciliation of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a central challenge in theoretical physics. This work investigates the spatial extent of classically stable regions within quantum gravitational backgrounds, focusing on systems characterized by positive scalar potentials. Leveraging the string conjecture and the concept of the ‘species scale’ – representing the characteristic volume of moduli space – we derive novel constraints on the size of these potential domains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the radius of such regions is fundamentally limited by the associated species scale, offering a quantitative relationship between the gravitational dynamics and the underlying geometric structure.  Our analysis employs a field space formalism, mapping scalar potentials onto a higher-dimensional manifold and utilizing positive potentials as indicators of local spacetime stability.  These bounds, parameterized by the species scale, provide a crucial step toward understanding the emergence of spacetime from quantum degrees of freedom and offer a potential framework for exploring Calabi-Yau threefold geometries within quantum gravity.
