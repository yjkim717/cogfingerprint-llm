**Abstract**

The exploration of symmetry principles remains a cornerstone of theoretical particle physics, yet conventional symmetries often prove insufficient to accommodate observed phenomena and constrain theoretical models. This work introduces the concept of “generalized symmetries” within the framework of quantum field theory (QFT), offering a novel approach to addressing limitations encountered in standard symmetry analyses. Specifically, we investigate how these generalized symmetries can provide a more flexible framework for incorporating discrete symmetries – such as parity and charge-parity – and their associated gauging mechanisms.  

By extending the scope of symmetry considerations beyond traditional Lie groups, we aim to enhance particle phenomenology, potentially leading to improved predictions for particle masses, mixing angles, and decay rates.  The investigation of gauging procedures for these generalized symmetries represents a crucial step toward constructing viable models consistent with experimental constraints.  Further research will focus on demonstrating the utility of this framework in specific QFT models, with an emphasis on its impact on observable particle properties.
