In this work, we report a gaseous etching methodology for the surface engineering of Pt-Ni nano-octahedra to significantly enhance their electrocatalytic performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Conventional Pt-based catalysts suffer from insufficient activity and durability, limiting their practical application in fuel cells. Our approach utilizes controlled etching in a reactive gas environment to selectively modify the nanocrystal surface, creating a structurally optimized Pt-skin configuration with high-index facets. Comprehensive structural characterization confirms the preservation of the octahedral morphology while inducing atomic-level surface restructuring. Electrochemical evaluation reveals that the etched Pt-Ni nano-octahedra exhibit a mass activity of 1.52 A mg⁻¹Pt at 0.9 V versus RHE, representing a 15.2-fold improvement over commercial Pt/C catalysts. Furthermore, accelerated durability testing demonstrates exceptional structural stability, with only 8.7% activity loss after 30,000 potential cycles. These findings establish gaseous etching as a powerful strategy for designing advanced electrocatalysts with simultaneously enhanced activity and durability, providing new insights into surface-property relationships in bimetallic nanostructures.
