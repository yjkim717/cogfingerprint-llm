**Abstract**

Recent cosmological simulations have yielded complex, often poorly understood, relationships between the formation histories of dark matter halos and their observed density profiles. This study, conducted in 2023, leverages explainable artificial neural networks (XAI) to investigate these connections, moving beyond traditional empirical fitting procedures. We demonstrate a statistically significant correlation between the early assembly timescale of dark matter halos and the shape of their inner density profiles, suggesting that initial growth phases imprint a lasting signature. Furthermore, our XAI analysis reveals that the outer slope of the halo density profile is primarily dictated by a single parameter quantifying recent mass accretion rates. This finding offers a simplified, physically motivated framework for understanding halo structure formation and provides a novel avenue for testing cosmological models against observational data from weak lensing and galaxy kinematics.
