**Abstract**

The accurate and efficient simulation of complex molecular systems necessitates robust computational methods. This work presents a significant advancement in the application of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations, specifically through the optimization and porting of a core implementation to leverage the processing power of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).  Traditional QM/MM calculations are frequently limited by computational expense; therefore, we investigated strategies to accelerate these simulations utilizing GPU acceleration. Our results demonstrate substantial performance gains – quantified through a detailed benchmarking suite – representing a notable improvement over conventional CPU-based approaches.  The successful adaptation of the QM/MM framework to AMD GPUs facilitates the exploration of larger system sizes and longer simulation timescales, expanding the scope of accessible research in areas such as drug discovery and materials science. Further investigation will focus on scaling and exploring heterogeneous computing architectures.
