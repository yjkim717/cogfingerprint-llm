**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum information processing necessitates increasingly compact and controllable sources of entanglement. This study presents a novel approach utilizing a lithium niobate metasurface to generate polarization-entangled photon pairs, representing a significant step towards miniaturized quantum devices. Employing nonlinear optical effects within the lithium niobate material, the metasurface facilitates efficient photon polarization engineering, offering precise control over the entanglement properties. Specifically, the design incorporates a periodic arrangement of subwavelength resonators, enabling tailored nonlinear susceptibility and enhanced photon-photon interaction.  Crucially, the spectral indistinguishability inherent in this architecture minimizes post-selection requirements, a significant hurdle in previous entanglement generation schemes. Furthermore, the demonstrated tunability of the metasurfaceâ€™s polarization response allows for dynamic manipulation of the entanglement state. We report initial experimental results demonstrating the generation of entangled photons in the polarization basis, paving the way for the implementation of qutrit states and advanced quantum communication protocols.  Future work will focus on characterizing the fidelity of the generated entanglement and exploring integration with photonic circuits.
