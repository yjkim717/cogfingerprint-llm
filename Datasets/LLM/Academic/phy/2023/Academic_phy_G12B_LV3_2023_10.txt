**Abstract**

The ongoing pursuit of efficient and durable electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a critical challenge in energy conversion technologies. This study presents a novel surface engineering strategy for optimizing the ORR performance of Pt-Ni nano-octahedra, leveraging gaseous carbon monoxide (CO) etching to induce a Pt-rich surface termination. Employing controlled CO exposure, we demonstrate selective removal of Ni surface atoms, resulting in a modified catalyst architecture characterized by increased Pt surface availability and reduced Ni-induced poisoning. Electrochemical characterization reveals a significant enhancement in ORR activity – evidenced by a lower onset potential and increased electron transfer kinetics – alongside improved durability compared to as-synthesized Pt-Ni nano-octahedra.  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirms the compositional shift towards a Pt-dominant surface. These findings underscore the potential of gaseous etching as a versatile and scalable technique for tailoring catalyst surface composition and morphology, ultimately advancing the development of high-performance electrocatalysts for fuel cell applications and related electrochemical devices.
