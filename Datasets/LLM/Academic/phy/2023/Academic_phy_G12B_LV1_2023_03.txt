Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a physics publication in 2023. I've aimed for precision and a logical structure.  Following the abstract, I'll include a few notes on the choices made.

**Abstract**

Recent theoretical developments suggest a profound connection between black hole physics and emergent spacetime. This work explores a simplified quantum mechanical model, comprising interacting bosonic oscillators and Majorana fermions, as a potential framework for describing a black hole within an emergent cosmological context. We propose that the collective behavior of these constituents, specifically the interplay between oscillatory modes and fermionic degrees of freedom, can manifest as an effective gravitational field, mimicking the event horizon geometry characteristic of black holes.  The model's dynamics are analyzed within a Hamiltonian formalism, revealing potential signatures of an emergent universe through subtle modifications to the oscillator spectrum at early times.  Furthermore, we investigate the stability of the system and explore the implications for information loss paradoxes, suggesting a possible resolution through the non-local entanglement structure arising from the fermionic component. This approach offers a novel avenue for investigating the holographic principle and the quantum origin of gravity.

**Notes on Choices & Justification:**

*   **Emphasis on Emergence:** The phrasing "emergent spacetime" and "emergent cosmological context" is central, reflecting the core theme.
*   **Precise Terminology:** Terms like "bosonic oscillators," "Majorana fermions," "Hamiltonian formalism," "event horizon geometry," and "holographic principle" are used to establish credibility and situate the work within the relevant theoretical landscape.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow:
    *   **Introduction/Motivation:** States the connection and the purpose.
    *   **Model Description:** Briefly describes the system (oscillators & fermions).
    *   **Key Dynamics:** Highlights the interaction and its consequence (effective gravitational field).
    *   **Cosmological Link:** Mentions the emergent universe connection through spectrum modification.
    *   **Further Investigation:** Touches on stability and information loss.
    *   **Conclusion/Significance:** States the broader implications.
*   **2023 Context:** The language is current and reflects ongoing research trends in quantum gravity and emergent spacetime.  The reference to "information loss paradoxes" is particularly relevant to contemporary debates.
*   **Word Count:** The abstract is carefully crafted to stay within the ~150-word limit.
*   **"Non-local Entanglement Structure":** This is a speculative addition, but it reflects a common idea in emergent gravity research â€“ that non-locality in the underlying quantum system might be related to the emergence of spacetime geometry.
