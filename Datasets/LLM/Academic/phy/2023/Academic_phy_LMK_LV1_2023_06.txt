Title: Resolving Black Hole Singularities through Quantum Geometry: A Loop Quantum Gravity Perspective

Abstract:
In the framework of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), we investigate the interior structure of regular black holes, focusing on the resolution of singularities and the resulting modifications to the causal structure of Kruskal space-time. By employing the principles of quantum geometry, we demonstrate that the curvature singularities inherent in classical black hole solutions are replaced by transition surfaces, connecting trapped and anti-trapped regions. The quantum-corrected geometry is shown to be free from singularities, with the curvature remaining bounded throughout the interior. Our analysis reveals that the LQG-corrected black hole interior is characterized by a quantum bounce, connecting two asymptotic regions via a wormhole-like structure. We discuss the implications of this novel causal structure for our understanding of black hole physics and the black hole information paradox. The results presented here provide a step towards a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between quantum gravity and black hole physics.
