Title: "Polarization-Engineered Quantum Metasurfaces for Advanced Qutrit Entanglement"

Abstract: We report the design and implementation of a nonlinear metasurface on lithium niobate, enabling the generation of arbitrary polarization-entangled qutrit states. By leveraging metagrating structures, our platform facilitates precise control over the polarization state of entangled photons, thereby advancing the field of quantum technologies. The demonstrated capability for polarization engineering paves the way for novel applications in quantum information processing and quantum communication. Our results highlight the potential of nonlinear metasurfaces for manipulating high-dimensional entanglement, a crucial aspect of next-generation quantum systems.
