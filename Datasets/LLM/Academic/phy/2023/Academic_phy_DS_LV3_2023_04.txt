In this work, we extend the framework of quantum gravity constraints on effective field theories by investigating the interplay between the species scale and field space geometry in Calabi-Yau compactifications. Building upon Vafa's 2023 findings regarding logarithmic field displacement bounds in positive potential regions, we demonstrate how the emergent string conjecture manifests as a universal infrared completion when approaching field space boundaries. Through systematic analysis of moduli space trajectories, we establish that the species scale Î›_sp provides a dynamical cutoff that tightens exponentially with field excursion, precisely correlating with the decompactification limits where string states become light. Our results confirm that the emergent string picture represents the unique consistent quantum gravitational completion beyond these asymptotic boundaries, while simultaneously yielding novel quantitative constraints on inflationary model-building in high-energy physics. This work substantially strengthens the evidence for fundamental connections between quantum gravity, string theory landscape statistics, and low-energy effective field theory phenomenology.
