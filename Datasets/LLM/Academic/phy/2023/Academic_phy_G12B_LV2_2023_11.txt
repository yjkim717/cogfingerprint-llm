**Krylov Complexity as a Probe of Quantum Chaos and Level Statistics**

Recent investigations into quantum chaos have highlighted the utility of Krylov complexity, a measure of state preparation time within a quantum circuit, as a potential bridge between quantum and classical dynamics. This work examines the relationship between Krylov complexity and manifestations of classical chaos in quantum systems, focusing on the paradigmatic example of the stadium billiard. We compute Krylov complexity for eigenstates of the Sinai billiard Hamiltonian and demonstrate a significant correlation between regions of high complexity and the presence of large Lyapunov exponents in the corresponding classical limit. Furthermore, we explore the connection between Krylov complexity and the statistical properties of energy levels, observing a tendency for higher complexity states to exhibit deviations from Gaussian level statistics, suggestive of underlying quantum chaos.  These findings provide further evidence for the sensitivity of Krylov complexity to the degree of classical chaos and its potential as a diagnostic tool for characterizing quantum systems exhibiting complex dynamics.  Future research will investigate the applicability of this approach to more complex potential landscapes and explore the role of Krylov subspaces in shaping quantum spectral properties.

**Explanation of Choices & Considerations:**

*   **Formal Tone & Language:** I used phrases like "Recent investigations," "This work examines," "demonstrate a significant correlation," and "provide further evidence" to establish a formal, academic tone.
*   **Precise Terminology:** I retained the provided keywords and incorporated related terms like "Hamiltonian," "spectral properties," "Gaussian level statistics," and "potential landscapes" to ground the abstract within the relevant physics subfield (quantum chaos, spectral analysis).
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow:
    *   **Introduction/Context:** Briefly establishes the field of quantum chaos and Krylov complexity's role.
    *   **Methodology:** States the system studied (stadium billiard) and the primary calculations (Krylov complexity, Lyapunov exponents).
    *   **Results:** Presents the key findings â€“ the correlation between complexity, chaos, and level statistics.
    *   **Conclusion/Outlook:** Summarizes the implications and suggests directions for future research.
*   **Year Context (2023):** The phrasing reflects current trends in the field, acknowledging Krylov complexity as a relatively recent area of active research and highlighting its increasing utility. The reference to "recent investigations" underscores this.
*   **Word Count:**  I aimed for the requested ~167 words, ensuring it was concise yet comprehensive.
*   **Avoidance of Overselling:** While highlighting the findings, I used cautious language ("suggestive of," "potential as a diagnostic tool") to avoid overstating the conclusions.



Do you want me to modify this abstract in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the level of detail?
