In this 2023 theoretical study, we resolve the black hole information paradox by implementing Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to eliminate coordinate singularities at event horizons. This framework reveals an exact binary symmetry within the extended spacetime manifold of quantum black holes, where interior and exterior regions exhibit precise topological correspondence. Through rigorous analysis in general relativity, we demonstrate this symmetry enables quantum cloning of information across horizon boundaries while preserving unitarity. The mechanism establishes that information encoded in Hawking radiation maintains complete entanglement with the black hole interior, thereby satisfying quantum mechanical conservation laws. Our findings provide a mathematically consistent unification of general relativity with quantum mechanics, fundamentally advancing our understanding of information preservation in gravitational systems.
