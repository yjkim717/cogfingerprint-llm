Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, suitable for a physics publication in 2023. I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and a tone consistent with contemporary research in this area.  Following the abstract, I'll include some notes on rationale and potential expansions.

**Abstract: Coordinate-Induced Interior Disappearance and Information Preservation in Black Hole Spacetimes**

The black hole information paradox, stemming from the apparent loss of quantum information during black hole formation and evaporation, remains a central challenge in theoretical physics.  We investigate a novel resolution predicated on the exploration of coordinate systems and their impact on spacetime geometry. Specifically, we examine the implications of exploiting inherent binary symmetries within the Kruskal-Szekeres formalism. Our analysis demonstrates that judicious application of coordinate transformations, designed to accentuate these symmetries, can lead to a geometric restructuring wherein the traditional black hole interior, including the singularity, effectively disappears. This interior disappearance is not a consequence of physical processes but rather an artifact of the chosen coordinate representation.  We argue that this coordinate-dependent elimination of the interior avoids the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics that fuels the information paradox.  Further, we explore the implications for the asymptotic behavior of fields, suggesting a mechanism by which information, rather than being lost, is encoded within the outgoing Hawking radiation through subtle correlations induced by the symmetry-preserving coordinate transformation. This approach offers a potentially testable framework for reconciling black hole thermodynamics with unitarity.

**Notes and Rationale:**

*   **Formal Tone:** The language is deliberately formal and avoids colloquialisms. Phrases like "we investigate," "our analysis demonstrates," and "we argue" are common in academic writing.
*   **Precise Terminology:**  Key terms like "Kruskal-Szekeres formalism," "information paradox," "Hawking radiation," "unitarity," "interior," and "asymptotic behavior" are used accurately and within their established scientific context.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow:
    1.  **Introduction:** States the problem (information paradox).
    2.  **Proposed Solution:** Introduces the coordinate transformation/binary symmetry approach.
    3.  **Mechanism:** Explains how the interior disappears due to coordinate choice.
    4.  **Implications:** Suggests how information might be preserved.
    5.  **Concluding Statement:** Highlights potential testability and broader significance.
*   **Year Context (2023):** The phrasing reflects current trends in black hole research, acknowledging that this is an *ongoing* area of investigation and emphasizing potential for experimental verification (though such verification is extremely challenging).
*   **Word Count:**  The abstract is designed to be within the typical range of 150-250 words for many physics journals.  (~174 words)
*   **Potential Expansion:**  A full paper based on this abstract would need to:
    *   Provide the specific coordinate transformations and show *mathematically* how the interior vanishes.
    *   Elaborate on the nature of the "subtle correlations" in Hawking radiation.
    *   Address potential criticisms and limitations of the approach (e.g., coordinate singularities, applicability to rotating black holes, etc.).
    *   Discuss how this framework interacts with other
