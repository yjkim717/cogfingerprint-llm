In 2023, recent advancements in loop quantum cosmology have led to the derivation of a singularity-free spacetime metric, facilitating a seamless transition of a black hole into a white hole within a unified asymptotic region. By leveraging the principles of quantum geometry, this novel Lorentzian metric resolves the long-standing black hole singularity problem, offering a profound understanding of the underlying spacetime structure.
