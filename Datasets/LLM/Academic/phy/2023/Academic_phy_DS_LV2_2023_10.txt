**Abstract**

The rational design of platinum-based nanocatalysts with optimized surface structures is paramount for enhancing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a critical process in clean energy technologies such as fuel cells. This study demonstrates a sophisticated surface engineering strategy for Pt-Ni nano-octahedra, employing a controlled gaseous etching process to precisely tailor their surface composition and morphology. Advanced electron microscopy and surface-sensitive spectroscopy confirm the formation of a Pt-rich, jagged surface layer on the initially smooth nano-octahedra. Electrochemical evaluation reveals that these surface-engineered catalysts exhibit a remarkable enhancement in ORR performance. Specifically, they achieve a mass activity of 1.52 A mgPt⁻¹, which is 18-fold greater than that of commercial Pt/C catalysts, alongside significantly improved durability, retaining over 95% of their initial activity after 30,000 accelerated degradation test cycles. The superior performance is attributed to the optimized electronic structure and the high density of low-coordinated surface sites introduced by the etching process, which facilitate oxygen adsorption and dissociation. These findings establish gaseous etching as a potent method for developing high-performance, durable electrocatalysts for next-generation energy conversion devices.
