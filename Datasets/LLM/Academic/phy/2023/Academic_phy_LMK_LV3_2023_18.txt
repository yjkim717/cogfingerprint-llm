Here is a formal academic-style abstract:

"In this 2023 study, we demonstrate a compact six-beam magneto-optical trap for neutral strontium atoms using a polarization-multiplexed metasurface and topology-optimized metagratings, simplifying the optical configuration and eliminating bulk optics, thereby advancing the field of atomic physics."
