**Abstract**

The nature of dark matter remains a central enigma in cosmology, with its gravitational influence inferred through observations of galactic halo structure. This work investigates the parameterized description of dark matter halo density profiles utilizing a novel approach integrating neural network analysis. We employ a deep learning framework to directly map halo density profiles to a suite of morphological parameters, circumventing traditional, computationally intensive methods. Crucially, we quantify the mutual information between these learned parameters and simulated mass accretion histories, demonstrating a statistically significant correlation.  Our findings suggest that neural networks can effectively capture the complex relationships governing halo shape evolution.  Specifically, density profile features exhibit a demonstrable dependence on the haloâ€™s past accretion events.  This research contributes a new methodology for probing dark matter halo structure and offers a potential pathway for refining cosmological simulations and informing future observational constraints in 2023.
