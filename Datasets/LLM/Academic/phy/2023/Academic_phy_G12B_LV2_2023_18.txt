Here's a formal academic-style abstract based on the provided summary, suitable for a physics publication in 2023:

"We present a novel architecture for a six-beam magneto-optical trap (MOT) designed for strontium (⁸⁷Sr) atoms, significantly reducing reliance on conventional bulk optical elements. This implementation utilizes polarization-multiplexed metasurfaces and precisely engineered metagratings to generate the requisite laser beams. The metasurface design minimizes optical aberrations and facilitates compact trap geometries. Experimental validation demonstrates stable trapping of strontium atoms, highlighting the potential of integrated metasurface optics for advanced atomic physics experiments. This approach offers a pathway toward miniaturized and more efficient MOT systems, paving the way for improved precision measurements and quantum information processing."
