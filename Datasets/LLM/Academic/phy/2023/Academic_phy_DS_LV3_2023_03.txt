In 2023, Maldacena's theoretical framework models black holes as emergent phenomena from a simplified quantum system comprising interacting harmonic oscillators and Majorana fermions. This conjectured correspondence enables the estimation of qubit requirements necessary to observe key black hole features, such as Hawking radiation and information dynamics, within controlled quantum simulations. The study bridges quantum gravity and quantum information science, proposing that fundamental aspects of spacetime and unitarity may be probed using engineered quantum processors, thereby advancing the empirical investigation of holographic principles.
