**Abstract**

The escalating demand for high-performance energy storage systems necessitates the development of advanced anode materials that can overcome the intrinsic limitations of conventional graphite, particularly under demanding operational conditions such as rapid charging and low temperatures. This study investigates the structural and electrochemical properties of sodium niobate (NaₓNbO₂) as a promising anode for lithium-ion batteries, with a specific focus on the critical role of its crystallographic interlayer spacing. We demonstrate that engineering a large interlayer spacing within the sodium niobate lattice significantly facilitates the intercalation and de-intercalation kinetics of lithium ions. This structural modification directly translates to superior electrochemical performance, as evidenced by exceptional rate capability, where high specific capacities are retained even at extreme current densities. Furthermore, the robust and stable host framework of the expanded structure mitigates volumetric strain during repeated cycling, resulting in exceptional long-term cyclic stability with minimal capacity fade over thousands of cycles. Notably, the enhanced ionic diffusivity also confers excellent low-temperature performance, maintaining significant capacity at sub-zero temperatures where conventional anodes typically fail. These findings underscore that the strategic manipulation of interlayer spacing in niobate-based materials is a fundamental and effective physical principle for designing next-generation anodes capable of powering advanced electronics and electric vehicles under a wide range of operational stressors.
