**Abstract (Version 1):**

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a critical bottleneck in electrochemical energy conversion devices, necessitating the development of efficient and durable electrocatalysts. While platinum (Pt) exhibits high intrinsic activity, its scarcity and high cost motivate research into alternative and enhanced materials. This study investigates a novel surface engineering strategy for optimizing Pt-Ni alloy electrocatalysts by leveraging selective nickel (Ni) removal via gaseous etching. We demonstrate the controlled extraction of Ni from Pt-Ni nano-octahedra, resulting in the formation of a Pt-rich surface layer with a unique morphology. Electrochemical characterization, including cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode measurements, reveals a significant enhancement in ORR performance, exhibiting a higher electrocatalytic activity and a reduced Tafel slope compared to the as-synthesized Pt-Ni alloy. Furthermore, accelerated durability tests demonstrate improved stability over extended operation, attributed to the enhanced corrosion resistance of the Pt-enriched surface. This gaseous etching approach provides a facile and scalable route to tune the surface composition of alloy electrocatalysts, offering a promising pathway towards high-performance and cost-effective ORR catalysts. Future work will focus on exploring the impact of etching parameters on surface composition and investigating the underlying reaction mechanisms using advanced spectroscopic techniques.

**Abstract (Version 2 - Emphasis on Mechanism):**

Addressing the critical need for improved oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts, this research explores a surface modification strategy targeting Pt-Ni alloy nano-octahedra. Selective gaseous etching of Ni from the alloy framework yields a Pt-rich surface layer, dramatically impacting catalytic performance. Electrochemical analysis, employing techniques such as linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveals a substantial increase in ORR activity and a reduction in kinetic overpotentials. The observed enhancement is attributed to the increased Pt surface availability and modified electronic structure resulting from Ni depletion. Durability assessments indicate improved resistance to catalyst degradation under ORR conditions. This work highlights the potential of controlled compositional modification through gaseous etching as a versatile tool for tailoring electrocatalyst properties.  Ongoing investigations are focused on elucidating the precise relationship between surface composition, electronic structure, and ORR reaction pathway utilizing in-situ characterization methods to gain a deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanism.

**Abstract (Version 3 - More Concise):**

The efficiency and durability of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts remain crucial for advancing electrochemical energy technologies. This study reports a surface engineering approach utilizing gaseous etching to selectively remove Ni from Pt-Ni nano-octahedra, generating a Pt-rich surface layer. Electrochemical measurements demonstrate a significant enhancement in ORR activity and improved durability compared to the parent Pt-Ni alloy. The technique offers a scalable route to optimize alloy electrocatalyst composition, potentially reducing reliance on pure Pt. Further research will investigate the influence of etching conditions and leverage advanced characterization to fully understand the structure-activity relationships.
