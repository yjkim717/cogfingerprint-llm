## A Combinatorial Approach to Scattering Amplitudes via Topological 't Hooft Expansion

Recent developments in scattering amplitudes have highlighted the potential for significant simplification through novel mathematical formalisms. This paper presents a new perspective on calculating these amplitudes, moving beyond the traditional reliance on Feynman diagrams and instead framing the computation as a combinatorial counting problem. We demonstrate how the 't Hooft expansion, a key tool in perturbative quantum field theory for revealing asymptotic behavior at high loop orders, can be elegantly recast in terms of combinatorial structures. Specifically, we establish a direct correspondence between the number of terms in the 't Hooft series and the enumeration of specific combinatorial objects, thereby bypassing the explicit construction and manipulation of complex Feynman diagrams. This approach leverages kinematic space techniques to further streamline the process, allowing for a more transparent and potentially computationally efficient calculation of scattering amplitudes. We anticipate this combinatorial reformulation will offer new insights into the structure of scattering amplitudes and provide a pathway towards developing more robust and scalable algorithms for precision calculations in quantum field theory, particularly relevant for current and future collider experiments.
