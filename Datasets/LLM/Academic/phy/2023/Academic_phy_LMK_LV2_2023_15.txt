Title: Enhanced Lithium Storage in Sodium Niobate with Expanded Interlayer Spacing: A High-Rate, Long-Cycle-Life Anode Material for Low-Temperature Applications

Abstract:

The increasing demand for high-performance, fast-charging, and durable energy storage systems necessitates the development of advanced lithium-ion battery anode materials. In this context, we report the synthesis and characterization of sodium niobate (NaNbO3) with an enlarged interlayer spacing, demonstrating its potential as a superior lithium-storage material. The expanded interlayer spacing in NaNbO3 facilitates rapid lithium-ion intercalation and de-intercalation, thereby enhancing its rate performance. Our electrochemical investigations reveal that the as-prepared NaNbO3 exhibits a high reversible capacity of 250 mAh g-1 at 0.1 A g-1, excellent rate capability with 120 mAh g-1 at 5 A g-1, and outstanding cyclic stability with 85% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 1 A g-1. Moreover, the material demonstrates satisfactory lithium storage performance at low temperatures, delivering 150 mAh g-1 at -20 Â°C. The superior electrochemical properties of NaNbO3 with expanded interlayer spacing can be attributed to the enhanced ionic diffusivity and reduced charge transfer resistance. Our findings suggest that the engineered NaNbO3 is a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, particularly for applications requiring fast charging, long cycle life, and low-temperature operation. This work provides a new perspective on designing high-performance energy storage materials through interlayer spacing engineering.
