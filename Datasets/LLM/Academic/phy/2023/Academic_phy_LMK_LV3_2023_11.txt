"Abstract: This study investigates the intricate relationship between Krylov complexity and quantum chaos in paradigmatic chaotic systems, elucidating the underlying mechanisms governing their dynamical behavior. By analyzing the Lanczos coefficients, we establish a robust correlation with classical Lyapunov exponents, thereby providing a quantitative framework for understanding the onset of quantum chaos. Our results demonstrate that Krylov complexity serves as a reliable diagnostic tool for probing the chaotic properties of quantum systems, shedding new light on the intricate interplay between quantum mechanics and classical chaos.
