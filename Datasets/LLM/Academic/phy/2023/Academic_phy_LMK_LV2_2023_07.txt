Title: Comparative Analysis of Gravitational Bremsstrahlung Amplitudes and Multipolar-Post-Minkowskian Waveforms

Abstract:
This study presents a detailed comparison between one-loop gravitational bremsstrahlung amplitudes and multipolar-post-Minkowskian waveforms, examining their consistency across various post-Newtonian levels. By leveraging the scattering amplitude framework, we compute the gravitational bremsstrahlung amplitude to one-loop order and juxtapose it with the corresponding multipolar-post-Minkowskian waveform. Our results demonstrate agreement between the two approaches at lower post-Newtonian levels, validating the efficacy of both methods in this regime. However, at higher post-Newtonian levels, discrepancies emerge, indicating potential limitations in the applicability of the multipolar-post-Minkowskian formalism. Notably, the soft graviton limit of the bremsstrahlung amplitude is found to be consistent with expectations. The observed differences at higher post-Newtonian levels underscore the need for further refinement in both approaches, highlighting a crucial direction for future research in gravitational physics.
