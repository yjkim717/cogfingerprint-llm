**Abstract**

We propose a novel resolution to the black hole information paradox by introducing an exact binary symmetry within a doubled Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate framework. This construction posits that the black hole interior is not an independent classical manifold but a quantum-gravitational clone of the exterior region. The symmetry enforces a strict correspondence between degrees of freedom, ensuring that information encoded in infalling matter is unitarily preserved through its quantum counterpart. This model, situated at the interface of semiclassical general relativity and quantum information theory, circumvents the need for firewalls or remnants. It suggests that the paradox is an artifact of an incomplete geometric description, which is resolved by acknowledging the intrinsically quantum-dual nature of the black hole spacetime.
