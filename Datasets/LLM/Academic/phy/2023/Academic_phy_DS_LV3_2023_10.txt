In this study, we report a controlled gaseous etching strategy employing carbon monoxide to engineer surface composition in Pt-Ni nano-octahedra, yielding a catalyst with a well-defined Pt-rich shell for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The structural evolution and surface atomic rearrangement were characterized using in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, confirming the formation of a Pt-skin surface layer. Electrochemical evaluations conducted in 2023 demonstrate that these architecturally refined nano-octahedra exhibit a mass activity of 1.52 A mgPt⁻¹ and a specific activity of 3.45 mA cm⁻² at 0.9 V versus RHE, representing a 15-fold and 18-fold enhancement, respectively, over commercial Pt/C benchmarks. Density functional theory calculations attribute this performance augmentation to the optimized d-band center position and the attenuated oxygen binding energy on the Pt-rich facets. This work establishes gaseous etching as a pivotal synthetic pathway for advanced electrocatalysts, directly addressing the critical need for high-performance, cost-effective fuel cell technologies.
