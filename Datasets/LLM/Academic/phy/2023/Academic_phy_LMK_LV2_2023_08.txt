"In this study, we derive a novel, singularity-free Lorentzian metric describing the transition of a black hole into a white hole within a single asymptotic region. Utilizing the Einstein field equations as a foundation, we construct a spacetime geometry that seamlessly interpolates between the black and white hole phases. Grounded in the theoretical framework of loop quantum cosmology, our solution offers a coherent, non-singular description of this phenomenon, shedding new light on the dynamics of black-to-white hole transitions in 2023 theoretical physics."
