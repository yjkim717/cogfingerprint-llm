**Abstract**

The prevailing paradigm of black hole thermodynamics posits an event horizon as a fundamental feature of spacetime, yet its microscopic origin remains elusive. This work explores a novel approach utilizing a simplified quantum system comprising interacting oscillators and Majorana fermions to model a nascent black hole within the framework of an emergent universe. We posit that the complex dynamics arising from these interacting constituents can generate emergent spacetime geometry, mimicking key characteristics of a black hole, including Hawking radiation analogues. Specifically, the Majorana fermions, exhibiting non-Abelian exchange statistics, are proposed to facilitate information retention within the system, circumventing conventional unitarity violations.  Numerical simulations reveal correlations indicative of black hole-like behavior, suggesting that this system represents a tractable platform for investigating the fundamental physics of black hole emergence and the potential role of topological quantum matter in constructing spacetime from more elementary constituents. Future research will focus on extending this model to incorporate gravitational effects and exploring its consistency with established cosmological principles.
