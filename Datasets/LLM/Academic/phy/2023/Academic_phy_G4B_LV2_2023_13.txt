**Abstract**

The emergence of quantum critical points (QCPs) in many-body systems exhibiting long-range interactions presents a compelling avenue for exploring novel quantum phenomena. This work investigates defect statistics within such systems, employing full counting statistics (FCS) to probe the underlying quantum dynamics. We demonstrate a fundamentally quantum generation process for defects, distinct from classical thermal fluctuations, and uncover universal scaling behaviors characteristic of QCPs. Specifically, our analysis reveals that defect occupation distributions adhere to non-equilibrium distributions, providing sensitive probes of the critical regime.  Crucially, we connect these observations to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, suggesting that topological defects are directly linked to the system’s symmetry-breaking transition.  Further, the influence of localized defects on the overall system’s entanglement structure is explored, highlighting the interconnectedness of defect formation and macroscopic quantum properties. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of QCP behavior and the role of disorder in mediating quantum phase transitions.
