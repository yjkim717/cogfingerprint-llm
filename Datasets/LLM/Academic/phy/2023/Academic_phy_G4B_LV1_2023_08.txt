**Abstract**

The longstanding theoretical duality between black holes and white holes, traditionally treated as distinct entities, presents a compelling challenge for general relativistic models. This work introduces a novel Lorentzian metric formulation designed to bridge this conceptual gap by proposing a unified asymptotic region encompassing both phenomena. Leveraging modifications to the Oppenheimer-Snyder metric, we delineate a spacetime geometry wherein a black hole’s singularity smoothly transitions into a white hole’s exterior, maintaining a consistent causal structure. Specifically, the metric incorporates adjustments to the radial coordinate and gravitational potential, facilitating a traversable connection between the ingoing and outgoing horizons.  Crucially, the asymptotic region is defined such that observable physics remains well-behaved, avoiding pathologies associated with singularities.  Further investigation utilizing this metric promises to illuminate the fundamental nature of spacetime curvature and potentially offer insights into the viability of white hole formation within a self-consistent cosmological framework.
