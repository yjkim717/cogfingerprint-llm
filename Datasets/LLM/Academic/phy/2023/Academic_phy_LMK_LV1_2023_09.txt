"In this study, we leverage neural networks to uncover the intricate relationships between dark matter halos' density profiles and their evolutionary histories. By analyzing astrophysical datasets, our model recovers established correlations between density profiles and mass accretion rates, while also revealing novel dependencies on halo formation timescales. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of neural networks in extracting complex patterns from cosmological simulations, providing new insights into the structural evolution of dark matter halos and shedding light on the underlying physical processes governing their formation and evolution."
