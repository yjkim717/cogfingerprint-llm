**Abstract:**

Recent theoretical developments in quantum gravity necessitate a refined understanding of field space topologies. This work presents novel constraints on the diameter of regions within field space exhibiting slowly varying, positive potentials – a characteristic feature of emergent string theory scenarios. Utilizing a species scale analysis, we derive upper bounds on these diameters, correlating them directly with the conjectured multi-dimensional nature of string compactifications. Specifically, the analysis incorporates insights from Calabi-Yau manifolds, suggesting a fundamental relationship between the landscape’s dimensionality and the permissible size of potential basins. These findings offer a crucial step towards quantifying the complexity of quantum gravitational configurations and provide testable predictions for observational signatures within cosmological models. Further investigation into the species scale’s influence on field space geometry remains a priority.
