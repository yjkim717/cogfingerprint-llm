**Abstract**

The emergence of topological defects during non-equilibrium phase transitions represents a fundamental challenge in condensed matter physics. While the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) conventionally describes defect formation in systems with short-range interactions, its applicability to systems exhibiting long-range order remains less well understood. This work presents an analytical investigation of defect statistics in quantum systems characterized by algebraically decaying interaction profiles. We demonstrate the existence of a novel, purely quantum defect generation mechanism that is independent of the slow cooling rate, contrasting with the rate-dependent predictions of the standard KZM. Our analysis, employing a theoretical framework incorporating full counting statistics, reveals a surprising universality in the defect probability distribution, irrespective of the specific form of the long-range interaction. These findings highlight the critical role of quantum fluctuations and coherence in shaping defect landscapes during quantum phase transitions, potentially impacting the emergent properties of diverse physical systems, including dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates and layered materials exhibiting long-range Coulomb interactions. The implications for understanding topological order and quantum criticality in these systems are discussed.
