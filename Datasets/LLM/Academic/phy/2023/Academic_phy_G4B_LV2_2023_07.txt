**Abstract**

Precise characterization of gravitational wave emission is paramount to extracting robust cosmological and astrophysical inferences. This work investigates the consistency between one-loop gravitational bremsstrahlung amplitudes and the multipolar-post-Minkowskian waveform formalism, employing a post-Newtonian expansion and soft expansion framework. Utilizing one-loop computations, we assess the amplitude contributions arising from higher-order terms within the post-Newtonian series, revealing systematic discrepancies with the conventionally derived multipolar waveform. Specifically, these divergences emerge prominently at orders beyond the initial post-Newtonian approximation.  Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these amplitudes within the soft expansion regime, where emission from extended, weakly interacting sources dominates.  Our analysis demonstrates a significant divergence between the predicted bremsstrahlung amplitudes and the waveform, particularly as post-Newtonian orders increase and within the soft sector. This discrepancy necessitates a refined understanding of the interplay between these perturbative expansions and suggests potential modifications to existing waveform models.  The implications of these findings extend to the sensitivity requirements of future gravitational wave detectors and the interpretation of observed signals, highlighting the importance of continued advancements in both numerical computation and theoretical modeling.
