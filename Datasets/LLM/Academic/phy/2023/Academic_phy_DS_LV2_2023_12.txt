**Abstract**

The integration of quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) is a cornerstone methodology for simulating complex biochemical processes, yet its computational cost remains a primary constraint. In 2023, we report a comprehensive optimization of a QM/MM software suite for heterogeneous computing environments featuring both AMD and NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs). Our work focused on refactoring core algorithms—including the evaluation of quantum Hamiltonian matrices and electrostatic embedding—to leverage the parallel architectures of modern accelerators. By implementing vendor-specific optimizations for HIP and CUDA frameworks, we achieved a substantial reduction in computational time for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations. Benchmarking demonstrated a performance increase of up to 4.2x compared to previous multi-core CPU implementations, without sacrificing numerical accuracy. This cross-platform acceleration significantly enhances the feasibility of studying extended timescale reactive events in condensed-phase systems, marking a critical advancement for computational biophysics and materials science.
