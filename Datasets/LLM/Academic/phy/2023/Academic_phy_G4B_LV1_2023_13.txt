**Abstract**

The emergence of topological defects in quantum systems undergoing slow, continuous transformations represents a compelling area of contemporary research. This work investigates the generation of these defects within systems characterized by long-range interactions, exploring the fundamental mechanisms driving their formation. Utilizing full counting statistics, we demonstrate that defect production is intrinsically quantum mechanical, deviating from classical nucleation theory predictions. Specifically, we propose that the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, traditionally applied to continuous phase transitions, provides a viable framework for understanding the dynamics of defect formation in these systems.  Our analysis suggests that the interplay between long-range correlations and the slow driving protocol dictates the precise nature and abundance of topological defects. Further investigation utilizing numerical simulations and theoretical modeling will be crucial to delineate the precise relationship between system parameters and defect characteristics, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of quantum phase transitions and emergent topological order.
