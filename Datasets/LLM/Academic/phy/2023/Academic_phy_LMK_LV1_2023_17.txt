Title: Meta-Optics Enabled Vector Visual Cryptography for Expedited Optical Encryption

Abstract:

In 2023, we witness a paradigm shift in optical encryption methodologies with the advent of meta-optics empowered vector visual cryptography. By harnessing the abundant degrees of freedom of light, including amplitude, phase, and polarization, this novel strategy achieves high-security and rapid decryption. The proposed meta-optics enabled approach exploits the nanoscale structuring of meta-atoms to create complex optical responses, thereby encoding encrypted information onto the vectorial light fields. The encoded information is then decoded using a vector visual cryptography technique, allowing for expedited decryption. Our results demonstrate a significant enhancement in security and decryption speed compared to conventional optical encryption methods. The integration of meta-optics with vector visual cryptography opens up new avenues for advancing optical encryption technologies, with potential applications in secure data transmission and storage. This work paves the way for the development of next-generation optical encryption systems with unprecedented security and speed.
