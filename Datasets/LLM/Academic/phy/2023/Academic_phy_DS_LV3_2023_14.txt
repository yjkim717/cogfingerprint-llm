In this 2023 study, we develop a comprehensive topological classification scheme for timelike circular orbits (TCOs) in spherically symmetric black hole spacetimes. By constructing a topological current from the radial equation governing orbital dynamics, we demonstrate that stable and unstable TCOs correspond to distinct topological configurations characterized by their winding numbers. Specifically, stable orbits manifest as topological defects with positive winding numbers, while unstable orbits exhibit negative winding numbers, creating a robust classification system independent of specific metric solutions. Through rigorous mathematical analysis across multiple hairy black hole models, we establish the invariance of the total topological number—the sum of winding numbers across all TCOs—despite variations in black hole parameters and matter field configurations. This topological invariance provides fundamental insights into the universal properties of orbital structures surrounding compact objects. Our framework reveals that transitions between orbital stability regimes occur only through topological phase transitions where winding numbers annihilate in pairs, explaining the persistent features observed across different black hole solutions. These findings establish topology as an essential tool for classifying gravitational systems and predict novel orbital phenomena in exotic spacetime geometries, with implications for gravitational wave astronomy and high-energy astrophysics observables.
