**Abstract**

Loop quantum gravity (LQG) provides a promising framework for addressing the singularity problem inherent in classical general relativity, particularly within the context of black hole formation and evaporation. This study investigates the emergence of regular black holes within an LQG spacetime, moving beyond the traditional singularity prediction. We demonstrate that LQG’s discrete structure fundamentally alters the causal structure surrounding black hole horizons, leading to observable deviations from classical behavior. Specifically, our analysis reveals a persistent, albeit subtle, causal network extending outwards from the event horizon, challenging the conventional notion of a singular interior. 

Furthermore, we explore the implications of this modified causal structure for processes such as black hole evaporation and Hawking radiation, suggesting potential modifications to the established semi-classical picture. The resulting “eternal black hole” scenario, while retaining core features, exhibits a more robust and extended causal domain.  These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the quantum nature of spacetime and offer a potential pathway towards resolving the conceptual difficulties associated with black hole singularities within a quantum gravity framework.
