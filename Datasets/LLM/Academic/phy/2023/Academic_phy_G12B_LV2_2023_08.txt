## Abstract: Singularity Resolution in Loop Quantum Cosmology via a Black Hole-White Hole Transition

This work investigates a potential resolution to the singularity problem inherent in classical black hole physics, leveraging the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC). We propose a novel, singularity-free spacetime metric within a Lorentzian manifold that describes a continuous transition from a black hole to a white hole, all contained within a single asymptotic region. This metric is parameterized geometrically, avoiding the need for exotic matter or external fields. The derivation is rooted in principles of LQC, wherein the quantization of spacetime geometry near the would-be singularity prevents the formation of a true singularity.

Our approach utilizes modified gravitational dynamics at high curvatures, reflecting the expected behavior predicted by LQC. The resulting spacetime exhibits a smooth evolution, connecting the event horizon of a black hole to the event horizon of a white hole without encountering an infinite density or curvature. We analyze the key properties of this metric, including its asymptotic behavior, energy conditions, and potential observational signatures. This model offers a compelling, albeit preliminary, avenue for exploring the quantum nature of black holes and provides a framework for investigating the possible emergence of white hole-like behavior within a consistent quantum gravity context. Further research will focus on exploring the stability of this solution and its implications for information loss paradox.
