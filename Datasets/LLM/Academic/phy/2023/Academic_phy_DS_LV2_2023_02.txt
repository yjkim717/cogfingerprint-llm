This paper introduces a novel combinatorial framework for computing scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory, establishing a direct correspondence between kinematic space structures and enumerative geometry problems. We derive integral formulas that reinterpret Feynman diagram expansions through topological decompositions, where specific counting problems in kinematic space generate complete amplitude expressions. The approach reveals an underlying combinatorial topology that organizes contributions by genus, naturally extending beyond planar limits. These formulations provide computational advantages for higher-loop amplitudes while offering new geometric interpretations of infrared-safe quantities. Our results demonstrate that certain amplitude singularities correspond to critical configurations in the associated counting problems, suggesting deeper connections between particle interactions and discrete mathematical structures.
