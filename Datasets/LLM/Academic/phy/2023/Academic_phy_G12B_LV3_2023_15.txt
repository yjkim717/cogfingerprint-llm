**Abstract:** This research investigates sodium niobate (NaNb₁₃O₃₃) as a promising anode material for advanced lithium-ion battery applications. Characterization reveals exceptional lithium-storage performance linked to the material’s distinctive layered structure and resultant expansive interlayer spacing. Electrochemical testing demonstrates superior rate capability and remarkable cyclic stability, even at sub-ambient temperatures. These findings suggest that the facile lithium-ion diffusion facilitated by the large interlayer distance contributes to the observed performance enhancements. Consequently, NaNb₁₃O₃₃ presents a compelling avenue for developing high-performance lithium-ion batteries with improved operational versatility and longevity.
