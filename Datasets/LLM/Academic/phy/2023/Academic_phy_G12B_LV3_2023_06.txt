**Abstract:**

Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) offers a compelling framework for addressing the singularity problem inherent in classical black hole solutions. This work investigates the emergence of regular black holes within the LQG paradigm, specifically exploring the implications of singularity resolution on the black hole's spacetime structure and dynamics. We highlight that while LQG provides mechanisms for avoiding the classical singularity, these resolutions can introduce novel, potentially counterintuitive, features.  A critical analysis reveals the sensitivity of these outcomes to the specific quantization scheme employed, underscoring the necessity for rigorous investigation of various approaches.  Further, we examine potential consequences for causality, the nature of event horizons, and the behavior of curvature invariants in the quantum geometry, particularly in the context of Hawking evaporation. This research emphasizes the importance of a nuanced understanding of quantum geometry when studying black holes.
