**Abstract:**

This work investigates the landscape structure of quantum gravity, specifically focusing on the geometry of field space and the prevalence of regions exhibiting slowly varying positive potentials. Utilizing the emergent string conjecture and a species scale estimate, we derive analytical bounds on the volume of such regions within a quantum gravitational framework. Our findings corroborate previously established constraints obtained via the Trans-Series Classification (TCC) methodology.  We apply these results to the concrete context of type II string flux compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds, demonstrating the implications for the statistical distribution of vacua. These bounds offer crucial insights into the potential ultraviolet completion of string theory and constrain the effective field theory descriptions that emerge at lower energies, contributing to a deeper understanding of the landscape problem in quantum gravity.
