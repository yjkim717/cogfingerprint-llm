**Abstract:**

The emergence of quantum chaos from classical dynamics remains a central challenge in theoretical physics. While classical chaos is readily characterized by Lyapunov exponents and other dynamical indicators, translating these concepts to the quantum regime proves complex. This work explores the utility of Krylov complexity, a measure of state preparation cost within a quantum circuit framework, as a probe of quantum-classical correspondence. Specifically, we examine the relationship between Krylov complexity and the spectral properties of quantum billiards – focusing on both the stadium and Sinai billiards – in 2023. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant correlation between Krylov complexity growth and the magnitude of Lanczos coefficients extracted from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation.  These Lanczos coefficients, traditionally linked to the spectral statistics of the system, here provide a bridge to classical chaos indicators. We demonstrate that the rate of Krylov complexity scaling exhibits behavior consistent with the expected scaling of Lyapunov exponents for the corresponding classical systems. This suggests Krylov complexity offers a novel, circuit-based perspective on characterizing quantum chaotic behavior and potentially quantifying the transition from regular to chaotic dynamics within quantum systems. Further investigation into the dependence of this relationship on system dimensionality and potential for generalization to other quantum chaotic models is warranted.
