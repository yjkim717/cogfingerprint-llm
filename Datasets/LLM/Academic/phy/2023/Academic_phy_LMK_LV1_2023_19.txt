Title: Polarization Engineering of Entangled Photons via Lithium Niobate Nonlinear Metasurfaces

Abstract:
We present a novel approach to generating and controlling polarization-entangled photons using a lithium niobate nonlinear metasurface. By carefully designing the metasurface's nanostructure, we achieve precise polarization engineering of the entangled photon pairs. The lithium niobate platform enables efficient spontaneous parametric down-conversion, while the metasurface's tailored geometry allows for manipulation of the polarization state of the generated photons. We demonstrate the generation of entangled photons with controllable polarization correlations, paving the way for the development of miniaturized, optically controlled quantum devices. Our results show that the polarization entanglement can be engineered to exhibit specific properties, such as maximal entanglement and tailored entanglement entropy. This work advances the field of quantum photonics and has implications for the development of compact, high-performance quantum information processing systems. The proposed platform is expected to have a significant impact on future quantum technologies.
