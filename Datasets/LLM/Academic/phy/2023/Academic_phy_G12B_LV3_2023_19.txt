**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum technologies demands scalable and integrated photonic components for advanced quantum information processing. This work presents a novel approach to manipulating high-dimensional quantum states through the design, fabrication, and experimental characterization of a lithium niobate metasurface platform. Utilizing multiplexed metagratings, we demonstrate precise control over two-photon polarization states, achieving efficient reshaping capabilities. Furthermore, we introduce a theoretical framework detailing the generation of arbitrary polarization-entangled qutrit states enabled by this metasurface architecture. Our simulations and experimental results validate the proposed design, showcasing its potential for realizing compact and dynamically tunable quantum optical circuits. This integrated approach, leveraging the exceptional nonlinear optical properties of lithium niobate, offers a significant step towards miniaturized, optically controlled quantum devices, ultimately contributing to the advancement of quantum communication and computation protocols.
