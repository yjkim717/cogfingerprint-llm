**Abstract:**

Recent efforts to refine the measurement of the Hubble constant (H<sub>0</sub>) have increasingly leveraged observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This study synthesizes advancements in H<sub>0</sub> determination, specifically examining the role of Type Ia supernovae and, critically, Cepheid variable stars and Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) stars as distance indicators. Utilizing the JAGB method, we assess how JWST’s enhanced photometric precision mitigates systematic errors inherent in traditional local distance ladder techniques.  Furthermore, the analysis considers the potential for JWST data to reconcile tensions between local H<sub>0</sub> estimates and cosmological parameters derived from Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, particularly within the framework of ΛCDM models.  Improved spectroscopic characterization of these standard candles, alongside precise photometry, offers a pathway towards a more robust and consistent value for the Hubble constant, ultimately impacting our understanding of the universe’s expansion history.
