**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of quantum photonics necessitates platforms capable of generating and manipulating complex quantum states within compact, on-chip architectures. In this context, we demonstrate a novel approach to polarization engineering of entangled photon pairs using a lithium niobate (LN) nonlinear metasurface. By leveraging the strong second-order nonlinearity of LN and the subwavelength light confinement afforded by metasurface design, we achieve precise control over the polarization state of the generated quantum light. This metasurface platform facilitates the deterministic generation of tunable, high-purity Bell states and other structured quantum states directly at the source. Our experimental results, corroborated by theoretical models, confirm that such engineering enables dynamic switching between orthogonal polarization-entangled states via electrostatic tuning of the LN meta-atoms. This work establishes nonlinear metasurfaces as a pivotal technology for advancing integrated quantum optics, paving the way for miniaturized and reconfigurable quantum information processors, sources for quantum key distribution, and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics.
