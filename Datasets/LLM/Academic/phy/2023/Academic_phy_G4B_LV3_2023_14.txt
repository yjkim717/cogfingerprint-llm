**Abstract**

This study examines the topological properties of timelike circular orbits surrounding black holes, utilizing a novel approach to characterize black hole structure. We explore distinct topological configurations arising from varying black hole models, focusing on the influence of scalar hair and quasi-topological terms. Our analysis demonstrates that the total topological number, a conserved quantity, remains invariant under these perturbations; scalar hair introduces local modifications but does not alter the global topology.  Furthermore, we establish a precise correlation between the black hole’s radius and its angular momentum, quantified through the observed topological invariants. These findings provide a refined understanding of black hole geometry and offer a framework for identifying and classifying black holes based on their topological signatures.  The results contribute to ongoing research concerning the fundamental relationship between geometry, topology, and exotic compact objects, with implications for gravitational wave astronomy and black hole information paradox studies in 2023.
