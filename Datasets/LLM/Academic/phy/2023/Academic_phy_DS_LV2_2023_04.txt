In this work, we establish rigorous bounds on the diameter of field space regions supporting slowly varying positive potentials within effective field theories coupled to quantum gravity. By synthesizing the Emergent String Coniguration with the species scale cutoff, we demonstrate that trans-Planckian field excursions are generically obstructed. The analysis reveals that any apparently unbounded direction in field space must decompactify to a perturbative string theory limit, wherein the effective field description breaks down. We substantiate this universal bound through a detailed examination of Calabi-Yau compactifications in string theory, where the infinite distance limits in complex structure moduli space are shown to coincide with the emergence of critical strings. This result provides a quantum gravitational origin for the Refined Swampland Distance Conjecture and imposes fundamental constraints on model-building in inflationary cosmology, particularly for large-field inflation scenarios. Our findings robustly integrate the species scale as a dynamical cutoff within the landscape.
