In this study, we establish a quantitative connection between Krylov complexity and quantum chaos by analyzing the statistical fluctuations of Lanczos coefficients in quantum billiard systems. Focusing on the chaotic stadium billiard, we demonstrate that the variances of these coefficients exhibit a robust correlation with both the classical Lyapunov exponent and the spectral statistics of the quantum Hamiltonian. Our results reveal that increased variance corresponds directly to heightened chaotic behavior, as quantified by level spacing distributions approaching the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. This approach provides a computationally efficient measure of quantum chaos, independent of spectral analysis, leveraging the universal growth dynamics of operators under the Krylov basis. These findings, obtained in 2023, advance the application of operator complexity in diagnosing quantum chaotic systems and offer new insights into the semiclassical limit of quantum dynamics.
