Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a physics publication, based on the provided summary and targeting a 2023 context. I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and a tone appropriate for a research audience.  I've also included a few potential avenues for elaboration based on the core idea.

**Abstract:**

The black hole information paradox, a long-standing conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics, persists despite decades of theoretical investigation. This work proposes a novel resolution predicated on a re-examination of the spacetime structure described by Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates. We demonstrate that a hitherto largely unexplored binary symmetry inherent within these coordinates leads to a significant modification of the standard black hole geometry. Specifically, this symmetry effectively eliminates the conventionally defined black hole interior, circumventing the horizon as a one-way membrane and thus resolving the information loss problem.

Our analysis suggests that quantum effects, particularly those influencing the black holeâ€™s microscopic degrees of freedom, manifest as a subtle perturbation of this symmetry. This perturbation, while preserving the overall information-preserving nature of the solution, dictates the precise mechanism by which information is encoded and eventually released. Further investigation is warranted to explore the implications for the black hole complementarity principle and to reconcile this approach with holographic duality. The potential for experimental verification, perhaps through observations of gravitational wave signatures from quantum black hole mergers, remains an exciting avenue for future research.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Expansion:**

*   **Emphasis on Novelty:** I highlighted the "hitherto largely unexplored" aspect of the binary symmetry to emphasize the originality of the approach.
*   **Quantum Effects Mention:** The inclusion of quantum effects acknowledges the need to connect this geometric argument to the underlying physics.
*   **Future Directions:** I added sentences suggesting future research directions (holographic duality, experimental verification) to demonstrate the ongoing nature of the research.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for approximately 178 words, as requested.
*   **Keywords are implied within the text** - no need to repeat them in the abstract.



Let me know if you'd like me to refine this further, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone!
