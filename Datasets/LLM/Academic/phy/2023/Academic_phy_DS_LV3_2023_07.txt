In this 2023 investigation, we perform a systematic comparison between one-loop gravitational bremsstrahlung amplitudes and the multipolar-post-Minkowskian (MPM) formalism within the context of classical general relativity. Our analysis confirms precise agreement at the Newtonian and leading post-Newtonian (PN) orders, validating the consistency of these independent approaches for modeling the gravitational-wave emission from unbound scattering encounters. However, a critical discrepancy emerges at the 2.5PN level, a finding that underscores the intricate nonlinear dynamics inherent to the gravitational interaction. We trace the origin of this deviation to three principal physical mechanisms: the gravitational-wave tail effect, arising from the scattering of radiation by the static background curvature; the subtle interplay of radiation-reaction forces on the orbital dynamics; and the contribution of nonlinear gravitational wave interactions. This observed mismatch highlights a fundamental challenge in bridging perturbative quantum field-theoretic calculations and classical PN/MPM waveforms, particularly concerning the treatment of infrared phenomena and the emission of soft gravitons. Resolving this tension is paramount for achieving high-accuracy waveform models for gravitational-wave astronomy.
