In this 2023 theoretical investigation, we develop a singularity-free Lorentzian metric framework describing a complete black-to-white hole transition within a single asymptotic region. By incorporating loop-quantum-cosmology corrections to the classical geometry, we resolve the central singularity problem while maintaining compatibility with Einstein field equations outside the quantum tunneling region. Our model demonstrates that quantum gravitational effects generate a spacetime bridge connecting black hole and white hole phases through a Planck-scale transition zone, effectively replacing the classical singularity with a nonsingular bounce. The resulting geometry satisfies energy conditions and preserves causal structure while eliminating information paradox concerns. This work provides a mathematically consistent foundation for unitary evolution in quantum gravity and suggests observable signatures in gravitational wave astronomy from final evaporation phases.
