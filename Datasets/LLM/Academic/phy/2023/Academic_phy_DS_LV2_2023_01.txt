This study proposes a novel resolution to the black hole information paradox by identifying an exact binary symmetry within the quantum gravitational description of black holes. Utilizing the Kruskal-Szekeres coordinate framework, we demonstrate that this symmetry enforces a quantum entanglement structure where the interior Hilbert space becomes a precise mirror of the exterior. Consequently, the horizon singularity is reinterpreted not as a locus of information loss but as a topological boundary connecting these isomorphic regions. Information encoded in Hawking radiation is thus preserved through its correlation with the interior clone. This model provides a non-perturbative mechanism for unitary evaporation, reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics.
