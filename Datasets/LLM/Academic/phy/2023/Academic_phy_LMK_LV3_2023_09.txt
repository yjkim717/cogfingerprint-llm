Abstract (2023): 
Utilizing a bespoke neural network architecture, this study elucidates the intricate relationship between the evolutionary trajectories of dark matter halos and their resultant density profiles. By leveraging diverse astrophysical datasets and advanced machine learning techniques, our analysis reveals novel insights into the structural formation and evolution of dark matter halos, thereby refining our understanding of cosmological structure formation.
