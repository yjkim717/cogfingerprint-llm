Title: Investigating Quantum Fluctuations in Topological Insulators

Abstract:

In 2023, the study of topological insulators continues to reveal intriguing properties of quantum materials. This research investigates the role of quantum fluctuations in topological insulators, focusing on the interplay between bulk and surface states. Utilizing a combination of density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory, we examine the effects of electron-electron interactions on the topological phase transition. Our results demonstrate that quantum fluctuations induce a non-trivial renormalization of the bulk bandgap, leading to enhanced surface conductivity. Furthermore, we observe a fluctuation-driven modification of the surface state's spin texture, which has implications for the development of topological quantum computing architectures. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationships between quantum fluctuations, topology, and electronic structure, shedding new light on the behavior of topological insulators and their potential applications in quantum technologies.
