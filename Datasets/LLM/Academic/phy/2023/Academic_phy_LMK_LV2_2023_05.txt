Title: Investigating the Hubble Tension: Implications for the $\Lambda$CDM Paradigm and Beyond

Abstract:

The Hubble constant ($H_0$) discrepancy, arising from the divergence between direct measurements using Cepheid variables and those inferred from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) within the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) framework, has become a pressing issue in modern cosmology. Recent observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have reaffirmed the robustness of Cepheid-based measurements, exacerbating the tension. This disparity not only underscores the limitations of our current understanding but also potentially signals the need for new physics beyond the standard cosmological model.

In this study, we reassess the $H_0$ discrepancy in light of the latest JWST observations and CMB data from the Planck satellite. We examine the systematic uncertainties associated with Cepheid variable measurements and explore possible explanations for the observed tension. Our analysis confirms that the discrepancy persists even when accounting for potential sources of error, suggesting that it may be indicative of a more fundamental issue with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

We discuss various theoretical frameworks that could potentially resolve the Hubble tension, including modifications to the standard model of cosmology, alternative dark energy models, and new physics in the early universe. Our findings highlight the need for continued investigation into the nature of the Hubble constant discrepancy, with implications for our understanding of the universe on large scales and the underlying laws of physics that govern its evolution. Ultimately, resolving this tension will be crucial for refining our cosmological model and advancing our knowledge of the universe.
