**Abstract:**

The escalating demand for secure optical communication and data storage necessitates the development of robust and efficient encryption methodologies. This work presents a novel approach to optical encryption leveraging the unique capabilities of meta-optics in conjunction with vector visual cryptography (VVC). Our strategy, developed within the context of advanced photonics research in 2023, utilizes a custom-designed metasurface to implement a multi-beam encoding scheme, transforming an input optical signal into a spatially distributed, visually encrypted form. This encoding process inherently incorporates the principles of VVC, where the original data is fragmented and distributed across multiple sub-images, requiring the simultaneous capture of all sub-images for decryption. Critically, the metasurface architecture facilitates real-time decryption by enabling coherent reconstruction of the original signal upon spatial superposition of the encrypted sub-images. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through numerical simulations, analyzing the impact of metasurface parameters on encryption strength and decryption fidelity. Furthermore, we explore the potential for scaling this system to higher data rates and incorporating dynamic metasurface elements for adaptive encryption.  Challenges remain in mitigating the effects of environmental noise and fabrication imperfections on metasurface performance, and future research will focus on addressing these limitations and exploring integration with existing optical communication infrastructure. The proposed meta-optics-empowered VVC scheme offers a compelling pathway towards high-security, rapid, and potentially scalable optical encryption solutions.
