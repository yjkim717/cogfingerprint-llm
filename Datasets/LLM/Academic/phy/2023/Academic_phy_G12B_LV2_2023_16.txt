**Abstract:**

The exploration of asymptotic symmetries in curved spacetime continues to refine our understanding of gravitational dynamics, particularly within the framework of Einstein gravity. This work presents a rigorous demonstration of the equivalence between two distinct methods for reconstructing Lorentz generators at null infinity, a crucial step in the ongoing development of asymptotically flat spacetimes. We analyze these approaches – one based on the standard Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) framework and the other utilizing a more general treatment of asymptotic transformations including supertranslations – within a consistent algebraic structure. Our findings reveal a deep connection, establishing that both methodologies ultimately yield isomorphic asymptotic symmetry algebras. This equivalence, derived through detailed examination of the commutation relations governing these generators, provides valuable insights into the underlying structure of spacetime at large distances. The implications extend to the consistency of asymptotic flatness conditions and offer a unified perspective on the incorporation of supertranslations within the established BMS theory. This finding contributes to the broader effort of characterizing gravitational fields and potentially sheds light on the emergence of quantum gravity phenomena in the asymptotic region.
