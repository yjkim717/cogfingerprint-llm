**Abstract**

Quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations are computationally intensive, frequently limiting their applicability for investigating complex chemical processes. This work presents a novel strategy for accelerating QM/MM calculations utilizing GPU acceleration, specifically targeting both AMD and NVIDIA architectures. We detail the implementation of optimized routines for key simulation steps, focusing on minimizing data transfer overhead and maximizing parallel processing efficiency.  Our approach, termed “Quick-MM,” leverages heterogeneous computing to achieve significant speed enhancements compared to conventional CPU-based simulations. Preliminary results demonstrate a median speedup of 3.2-5.8x across a suite of benchmark systems, representing a substantial advancement in accessible computational chemistry. Further investigation into algorithmic refinements and hardware-specific optimizations will continue to drive performance improvements, facilitating the exploration of previously intractable molecular systems within the realm of quantum dynamics.
