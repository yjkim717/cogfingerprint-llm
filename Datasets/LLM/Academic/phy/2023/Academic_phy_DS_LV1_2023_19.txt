**Abstract**

The deterministic generation of arbitrary polarization-entangled states represents a pivotal challenge in advancing integrated quantum photonics. While nonlinear metasurfaces offer a promising platform for photon-pair generation via spontaneous parametric down-conversion, their capacity for on-demand state engineering remains constrained. In this work, we demonstrate a monolithic lithium niobate (LiNbO₃) metasurface that overcomes this limitation through the coherent integration of multiplexed metagratings. Each metagrating is designed to support a specific quasi-phase-matching condition and impart a tailored polarization response. By controlling the relative excitation of these subwavelength elements, we achieve precise manipulation of the biphoton wavefunction's spin-orbit structure. This enables the direct generation of any desired polarization-entangled state—from Bell states to high-dimensional entanglement—within a single, ultra-compact device. Our experimental results, corroborated by quantum state tomography, confirm high-fidelity entanglement and heralded single-photon emission. This architecture establishes a foundational component for scalable quantum information processing, on-chip quantum sensing, and complex state synthesis beyond conventional optical systems.
