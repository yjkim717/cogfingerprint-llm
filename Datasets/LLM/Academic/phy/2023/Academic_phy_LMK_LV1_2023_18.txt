"Utilizing transmissive metasurfaces, we demonstrate a compact six-beam magneto-optical trap for neutral strontium atoms. A bespoke metasurface splitter and metagratings enable efficient beam manipulation, achieving a stable trap. This innovative configuration showcases the potential of metasurfaces in advancing cold atom technologies, paving the way for compact quantum devices (2023)."
