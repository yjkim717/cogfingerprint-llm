Okay, here's an original academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided keywords and summary, suitable for a physics audience and reflecting a 2023 context. I've aimed for precision and a structured argument.  Following the abstract, I'll include notes explaining some of the choices I made.

**Abstract:**

The landscape of high-energy phenomenology is increasingly demanding novel theoretical frameworks to address puzzles arising from experimental data and the Standard Model’s limitations. This work explores the burgeoning field of categorical symmetries as a potent tool for extending and enriching the traditional understanding of discrete and continuous symmetries in quantum field theories (QFTs).  Moving beyond the conventional group-theoretic realization of symmetries, we investigate how higher-categorical structures, particularly those involving 2-groupoids and ∞-groupoids, can encode subtle relationships between fields, symmetries, and their associated charges.  Specifically, we demonstrate how this categorical perspective allows for the systematic construction of non-local and higher-derivative symmetries, potentially resolving issues with anomalies and enabling novel model-building strategies.  We present concrete examples within the context of particle phenomenology, illustrating how generalized symmetries can constrain parameter spaces and lead to testable predictions at collider experiments. This approach offers a framework for classifying and understanding symmetries in a more fundamental way, paving the way for a deeper connection between theoretical QFT and observable phenomena.

**Notes on Choices and Justification:**

*   **Formal Tone & Vocabulary:** I used terms like "burgeoning field," "novel theoretical frameworks," "parameter spaces," and phrases like "systematic construction" to maintain a formal, academic style.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow:
    *   **Context/Motivation:** States the need for new frameworks in phenomenology.
    *   **Core Idea:** Introduces categorical symmetries as a solution.
    *   **Mechanism/Method:** Explains how categorical structures offer advantages (non-locality, higher derivatives).
    *   **Application:** Connects the theory to particle phenomenology and collider experiments.
    *   **Conclusion/Impact:** Highlights the broader implications for understanding symmetries.
*   **Precise Terminology:** Key terms like "quantum field theories (QFTs)," "discrete symmetries," "2-groupoids," and "∞-groupoids" are included to signal the technical nature of the work. I also used "higher-categorical structures" to be more accessible than just listing specific groupoids without context.
*   **2023 Context:** The abstract hints at current challenges in the field (Standard Model limitations, anomaly issues) that are active areas of research in 2023.  The emphasis on testable predictions reflects the modern focus on connecting theory to experiment.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for the ~170-word range as requested.
*   **Originality:** While inspired by the summary, the phrasing and specific details (mention of higher-derivative symmetries, anomaly resolution) are original.
