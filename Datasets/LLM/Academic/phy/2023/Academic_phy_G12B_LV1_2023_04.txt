**Abstract:**

The landscape of string theory compactifications, particularly those involving string flux and resulting in positive scalar potentials, presents a formidable challenge to understanding the observed hierarchy of scales in the universe. This work investigates the constraints imposed by quantum gravitational effects on the accessible field space regions characterized by slowly varying positive potentials. We adopt and extend the emergent string conjecture, positing that large-volume string compactifications are fundamentally constrained by an underlying quantum gravity structure.  Specifically, we derive analytical bounds on the permissible field space volume and field excursion lengths, predicated on the avoidance of singularities and the maintenance of stability within a quantum gravitational framework. Our analysis reveals a crucial connection between the scale of new physics, potentially associated with the “species scale,” and the allowed extent of these slowly varying regions.  We demonstrate that regions with excessively expansive, smoothly positive potentials are disfavored, suggesting a natural mechanism for the suppression of large field excursions and a potential resolution to the landscape problem. The implications for model building and the exploration of metastable vacua are discussed, alongside potential avenues for future research incorporating refined quantum gravity considerations.



I aimed to capture the core concepts – quantum gravity, field space, positive potentials, string flux compactifications, and the species scale – while crafting a logically structured argument.
