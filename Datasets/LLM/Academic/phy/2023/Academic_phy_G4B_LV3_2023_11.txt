**Abstract**

This study examines the application of Krylov complexity – a novel quantifier of dynamical chaos – to characterize quantum systems exhibiting chaotic behavior. Utilizing the Lanczos coefficient variance as a proxy for Krylov complexity, we establish correlations with established classical measures of chaos, specifically, classical Lyapunov exponents.  Analysis of a Sinai billiard system, a paradigmatic model for quantum chaos, reveals a statistically significant relationship between these metrics. Furthermore, we demonstrate a correspondence between Krylov complexity and the distribution of energy level spacings, suggesting a fundamental link between classical and quantum manifestations of chaotic dynamics. These findings propose Krylov complexity as a valuable tool for probing the quantum underpinnings of chaos, potentially offering new insights into the transition between classical and quantum descriptions of complex systems.  Future research will explore the broader applicability of this methodology to diverse quantum systems in 2024.
