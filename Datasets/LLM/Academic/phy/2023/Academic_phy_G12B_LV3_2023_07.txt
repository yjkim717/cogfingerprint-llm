**Abstract**

Recent advancements in gravitational wave physics necessitate rigorous theoretical investigations of non-linear gravitational effects. This study investigates gravitational bremsstrahlung, the emission of gravitational waves from scattering processes, by comparing one-loop scattering amplitude calculations with multipolar-post-Minkowskian (PM) waveform predictions. Our analysis, conducted in the context of contemporary gravitational wave phenomenology (2023), reveals a notable consistency between the two approaches at lower post-Newtonian orders, validating established approximations for weak-field scattering. However, significant discrepancies emerge at higher-order terms, particularly concerning the inclusion of radiation reaction effects and non-linear contributions to the scattering process. These deviations highlight the limitations of purely perturbative calculations and underscore the importance of incorporating fully non-linear dynamics for accurate waveform modeling. The observed divergences provide valuable insights into the complexities of gravitational self-interactions and offer a pathway for refining existing theoretical frameworks. Future research will focus on developing more comprehensive computational techniques to accurately model these radiative effects and improve the precision of gravitational wave observations.
