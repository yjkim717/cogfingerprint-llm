**Abstract:** Recent developments in scattering amplitudes have highlighted the potential for novel computational frameworks that transcend the traditional reliance on Feynman diagrams. This work explores a combinatorial approach to calculating scattering amplitudes, leveraging integral formulas derived from a discrete counting problem. We demonstrate that this formalism naturally encodes a topological 't Hooft expansion, providing a systematic framework for loop scattering calculations. Crucially, our methodology avoids explicit diagrammatic constructions, suggesting the possibility of emergent spacetime and quantum mechanical principles arising from underlying mathematical structures within kinematic space. These findings offer a promising avenue for deepening our understanding of fundamental interactions and potentially reveal a more foundational description of quantum field theory, moving beyond the perturbative regime and toward a non-perturbative understanding of spacetime emergence.
