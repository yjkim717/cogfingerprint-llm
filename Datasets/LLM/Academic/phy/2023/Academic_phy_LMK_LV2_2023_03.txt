"In this study, we examine a quantum mechanical framework for describing black holes utilizing interacting oscillators and Majorana fermions. By deriving an effective Hamiltonian, we demonstrate the emergence of Einstein equations. We then map this system to a qubit representation, revealing novel insights into the quantum structure of black holes. Our results provide a concise and instructive model for understanding the intricate relationships between quantum mechanics and gravity, 2023."
