**Abstract**

The escalating demand for robust and accessible cryptographic solutions necessitates innovative approaches to optical encryption. This paper presents a significant advancement in this domain: meta-optics-empowered vector visual cryptography (MOVVC). Leveraging the unique properties of metasurfaces, MOVVC achieves a compelling balance between security, real-time performance, and device miniaturization.  Traditional visual cryptography schemes often suffer from limitations in decryption speed and key distribution complexity.  Our methodology employs a metasurface-engineered optical system to generate and distribute visual shares, facilitating rapid and secure decryption via intuitive visual reconstruction.  Specifically, we demonstrate the feasibility of real-time decryption with a compact optical apparatus, a critical advantage for practical applications.  The inherent randomness introduced by metasurface fabrication and the vector nature of the visual shares contribute to enhanced resistance against conventional cryptanalysis.  Preliminary experimental results indicate MOVVCâ€™s potential for secure data transmission and protection, marking a crucial step toward deployable, high-performance optical encryption technologies. Further research will focus on optimizing metasurface design and exploring integration with advanced key management protocols.
