**Abstract**

Precise distance measurements are critical for characterizing stellar populations and cosmological models. This research investigates the calibration of absolute magnitudes for carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (c-AGB) stars, leveraging near-infrared J-band photometric observations and geometric distance determinations. Utilizing the well-established distances to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) as calibrators, we establish a robust photometric-distance relationship suitable for extragalactic studies. Applying this relationship, we determine a distance modulus for NGC 253, yielding a refined distance estimate of 3.40 ± 0.06 megaparsecs.  This work contributes to improved spectroscopic parallax techniques and validates the utility of J-band photometry in probing stellar distances within the Local Group, with implications for accurate distance measurements to fainter stellar populations. Further research will explore the potential for incorporating LMC/SMC data to refine the calibration across a broader range of stellar types.
