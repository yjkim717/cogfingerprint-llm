**Title:** γ-LCSVO: A Novel Zero-Strain Anode Material for Enhanced Electrochemical Li+ Storage in Lithium-Ion Batteries

**Abstract:**

The development of high-performance anode materials is crucial for advancing lithium-ion battery technology. In this study, we report on the synthesis and characterization of γ-LCSVO, a novel zero-strain anode compound that exhibits superior electrochemical Li+ storage properties. Our results demonstrate that γ-LCSVO undergoes negligible volume changes during Li+ intercalation and de-intercalation, thereby ensuring excellent cycling stability and mitigating the degradation associated with conventional anode materials. The electrochemical performance of γ-LCSVO was evaluated using a combination of galvanostatic charge-discharge measurements, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results reveal that γ-LCSVO delivers a high reversible capacity and maintains a stable discharge capacity over extended cycling. The zero-strain characteristic of γ-LCSVO is attributed to its unique crystal structure, which enables the accommodation of Li+ ions without significant lattice distortions. Our findings suggest that γ-LCSVO is a promising anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, offering enhanced energy storage capabilities and improved durability. The superior electrochemical Li+ storage properties of γ-LCSVO make it an attractive candidate for applications in electric vehicles, renewable energy systems, and other emerging technologies that rely on high-performance energy storage solutions.
