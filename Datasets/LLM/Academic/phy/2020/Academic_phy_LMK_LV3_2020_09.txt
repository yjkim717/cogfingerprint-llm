By analyzing Lyman-alpha forest data, we establish a stringent lower bound on ultralight axion dark matter mass, constraining it to >10^-21 eV, thereby strongly disfavoring the canonical ultralight axion model as a viable alternative to cold dark matter in the string axiverse paradigm, as presented at the 2020 cosmology conference.
