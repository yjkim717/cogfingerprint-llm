**Abstract: Linear Stability Analysis of Black Resonators and Geons in Anti-de Sitter Spacetime**

The exploration of exotic compact objects as potential alternatives to the classical black hole paradigm has spurred significant interest in their stability properties. This work presents a linear stability analysis of black resonators and geons residing within Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, employing a perturbative approach based on gauge theory considerations. Black resonators, characterized by dynamically generated horizons and possessing a distinct structure compared to standard black holes, are found to exhibit a pervasive superradiant instability. This instability arises from the interaction of scalar fields with the ergoregion surrounding the resonator, leading to exponential growth of perturbations and ultimately, their disintegration.  Crucially, our analysis reveals a surprising resilience in many geon configurations.  Unlike their resonator counterparts, geons, formed from localized, topologically non-trivial scalar field profiles, frequently demonstrate a robust stability against linear perturbations.  This stability appears linked to the specific topological constraints imposed by the geonâ€™s structure and its inherent resistance to extracting rotational energy.  The results suggest a significant divergence in the dynamical behavior of these two classes of compact objects, with implications for their viability as astrophysical remnants and potential probes of quantum gravity effects in strongly curved spacetimes.  Further investigation into nonlinear dynamics and the role of higher-order perturbations remains a crucial direction for future research.

**Notes & Potential Modifications (Important for Submission):**

*   **Specific Gauge Theory:** The abstract mentions "gauge theory considerations." This is quite broad. If the paper utilizes a *specific* gauge theory (e.g., N=4 Super Yang-Mills, D=5 Maxwell theory), it *must* be named explicitly here and throughout the paper. This is vital for clarity and indexing.
*   **Scalar Field Detail:** Similarly, the type of scalar field used (massive, massless, self-interacting) should be indicated.
*   **Perturbation Details:**  Mentioning the specific type of perturbation used (e.g., axial vector perturbations) would strengthen the abstract.
*   **AdS Dimensionality:** Explicitly state the dimensionality of AdS space (e.g., AdS<sub>5</sub>).
*   **Stability Criterion:** Briefly allude to the mathematical criterion used to determine stability (e.g., the absence of real frequencies in the dispersion relation).
*   **Journal Target:** Tailor the language and emphasis to the target journal. A journal specializing in numerical relativity might require more detail on the numerical methods used (if any were involved). A more theoretical journal might require a more detailed explanation of the theoretical framework.
*   **Citations:** This abstract is not intended to include citations.



I hope this is a good starting point! Let me know if you'd like me to refine it further based on specific details of the research.
