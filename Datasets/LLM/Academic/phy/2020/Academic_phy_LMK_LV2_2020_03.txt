Here is a formal academic-style abstract:

"In the context of the Standard Model, we investigate magnetically charged black holes, examining the restoration of electroweak symmetry and its implications on Hawking radiation. Focusing on massless fermions, our analysis reveals novel effects on black hole evaporation, shedding light on the intricate interplay between gravity, gauge symmetries, and particle physics in 2020 theoretical frameworks."
