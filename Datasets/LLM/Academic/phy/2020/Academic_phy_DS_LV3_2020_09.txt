In this study, we leverage high-resolution Lyman-alpha forest observations and state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations to constrain the mass of ultralight axion dark matter. Our analysis yields a robust 95% confidence lower limit of m_a > 2Ã—10^{-20} eV, which significantly strengthens previous bounds by an order of magnitude. This result strongly disfavors the canonical mass range for such axions, imposing stringent new constraints on their role in suppressing cosmic structure growth at small scales and reshaping the viable parameter space for fuzzy dark matter models.
