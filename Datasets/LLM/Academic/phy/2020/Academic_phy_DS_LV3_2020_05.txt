In this study, we present a novel calibration of the J-band luminosity for carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (C-AGB) stars, leveraging high-precision geometric distances from detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud. The DEB distances provide a robust anchor, enabling a calibration with minimal systematic uncertainties. Our methodology involves constructing a period-luminosity relation in the near-infrared J-band, where C-AGB stars exhibit reduced sensitivity to circumstellar extinction compared to optical bands. This calibration yields a tight relation with a dispersion of σμ ≈ 0.05 mag, establishing C-AGB stars as reliable standard candles for extragalactic distance measurements.

We apply this newly calibrated J-band luminosity function to a population of C-AGB stars identified in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 253. High-resolution photometry from archival VLT/HAWK-I observations is utilized to derive mean magnitudes and periods for the target stars. The resulting distance modulus for NGC 253 is determined to be 27.66 ± 0.04 mag, corresponding to a metric distance of 3.40 ± 0.06 Mpc. This result is consistent with, but significantly more precise than, previous estimates based on Cepheid variables and the tip of the red giant branch. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of C-AGB stars as precise distance indicators, particularly in dust-obscured environments, and provide a critical benchmark for the cosmological distance ladder. This work underscores the value of multi-wavelength calibrations for advancing extragalactic astronomy.
