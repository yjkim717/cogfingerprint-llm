Here is a formal academic-style abstract inspired by the given summary and keywords:

"Employing the post-Minkowskian approach, we investigate the radiative effects on classical gravitational scattering. At the third order in G, we demonstrate that radiation-reaction significantly modifies the conservative scattering angle. Our results, consistent with the principles of general relativity, highlight the crucial role of gravitational waves in shaping the scattering process, thereby refining our understanding of gravitational interactions in 2020's gravitational physics landscape."
