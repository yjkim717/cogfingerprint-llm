**Abstract**

This work presents a novel investigation into the asymptotic structure of the Rarita-Schwinger theory within the context of four-dimensional spacetime. Utilizing a Hamiltonian formalism, we explore the emergent behavior of canonical generators, revealing a significant enhancement driven by the incorporation of infinite-dimensional fermionic symmetries. Specifically, these symmetries are shown to generate an extended super-Poincaré algebra, fundamentally altering the theory’s representation of spin multiplets.  Our analysis demonstrates that the asymptotic expansion of the Hamiltonian reveals a logarithmic enhancement of the associated generators, a direct consequence of the underlying fermionic symmetry group.  This expansion provides a precise framework for understanding the behavior of relativistic spinors at high energies. The implications extend to supersymmetric generalizations, where the super-Poincaré algebra dictates a richer and more complex asymptotic structure.  Further investigation into the operator product expansion within this framework is warranted, promising deeper insights into the dynamics of Rarita-Schwinger fields.
