**Abstract**

The computational demands of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT), particularly the evaluation of the exchange-correlation (XC) potential, present a significant bottleneck for large-scale electronic structure calculations. While algorithmic improvements have been explored, the parallel architecture of modern graphics processing units (GPUs) offers a transformative pathway for acceleration. This work details the design and implementation of a highly optimized, GPU-accelerated computational kernel for the numerical integration of the XC potential within the QUICK quantum chemistry package. Our implementation employs a novel dynamic grid-point partitioning scheme that maximizes thread occupancy and minimizes memory latency on the GPU. Benchmark calculations on a representative set of molecular systems demonstrate a remarkable speedup of 60 to 780 times compared to conventional, serial CPU-based evaluations, while preserving chemical accuracy to within 0.1 kcal/mol. These results, achieved in 2020, underscore the profound potential of GPU-centric algorithm redesign to overcome longstanding scalability challenges in quantum mechanical simulations.
