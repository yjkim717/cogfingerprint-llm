**Abstract**

A longstanding question in theoretical physics concerns the conditions under which the unitary evolution of a quantum system can be considered fundamentally deterministic. This work establishes a rigorous mathematical framework demonstrating that a broad class of non-relativistic quantum systems are isomorphic to deterministic classical systems. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the Hamiltonian, requiring strict locality and specific forms of interaction, under which the Schr√∂dinger equation can be recast as a set of classical evolution laws for an ensemble of definite configurations. Crucially, this equivalence is achieved without recourse to gravitational effects, thereby extending the domain of deterministic interpretations beyond existing paradigms. Our results suggest that the apparent indeterminism of quantum mechanics is not an intrinsic feature but emerges from an incomplete description of the underlying deterministic dynamics, offering a novel perspective on the quantum-classical correspondence.
