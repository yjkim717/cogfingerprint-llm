**Abstract**

The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase represents a critical period of stellar evolution, yet the calibration of extragalactic distances to stellar populations remains a persistent challenge. This study leverages the unique properties of carbon-rich AGB stars to establish a robust, standardized candle for distance measurement. We demonstrate that the peak J-band luminosity of these stars exhibits remarkably low intrinsic dispersion, providing a stable benchmark. Our methodology is anchored by a precise geometric distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), derived from detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs), which serves as our fundamental calibrator. By applying this calibrated J-band luminosity function to a sample of carbon stars in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 253, we independently determine its distance modulus. The resulting measurement is in excellent agreement with values obtained from other established methods, thereby validating the reliability of our approach. This technique provides a powerful and complementary tool for the extragalactic distance scale, particularly valuable for resolving discrepancies and probing stellar populations in galaxies beyond the Local Group where other standard candles may be scarce or difficult to resolve. Our findings confirm carbon-rich AGB stars as potent astrophysical tools for precision cosmology.
