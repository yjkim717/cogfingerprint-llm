**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) increasingly demands robust crosstalk mitigation strategies to enable complex functionality. This work introduces a novel approach leveraging nonuniform subwavelength strip structures to substantially diminish crosstalk between integrated optical waveguides. Traditional methods often struggle to achieve significant reduction across a broad spectral range. Our investigation employs a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to meticulously design the geometry of these subwavelength strips, tailoring their refractive index modulation for enhanced crosstalk suppression. Preliminary simulations demonstrate a demonstrable reduction in cross-talk, attributed to the controlled interference effects generated by the non-uniform strip pattern.  These findings suggest a promising pathway toward higher-density and more reliable PICs, particularly relevant for applications requiring sophisticated optical signal processing. Further research will focus on experimental validation and broader parameter space exploration.
