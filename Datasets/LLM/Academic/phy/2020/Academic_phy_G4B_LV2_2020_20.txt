**Abstract**

We report a novel, Lorentz-invariant construction of scattering amplitudes for electric and magnetic dipole interactions, employing a rigorously defined pairwise helicity formalism alongside spinor-helicity variables. This approach, developed within the framework of on-shell methods, offers a systematic and manifestly invariant procedure for calculating scattering processes. Central to this work is the introduction of “pairwise helicity,” a geometric quantity characterizing the relative orientation of spin vectors within the incident and outgoing fermion propagators.  This allows for a compact and intuitive representation of the spin correlations crucial for accurate amplitude computation. 

The utilization of spinor-helicity variables significantly simplifies the kinematic manipulations inherent in S-matrix theory, facilitating the derivation of manifestly Lorentz-invariant expressions.  Furthermore, the inherent structure of the resulting helicity formalism aligns with the principles of the little group, suggesting potential connections to underlying symmetries within the scattering process.  The presented method provides a robust foundation for exploring higher-order corrections and investigating the dynamics of particle interactions, with implications for both theoretical phenomenology and precision tests of the Standard Model.  This work was completed in 2020.
