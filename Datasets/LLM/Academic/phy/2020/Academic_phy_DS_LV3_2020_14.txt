**Abstract**

The recent formulation of a consistent four-dimensional theory for Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity has revitalized interest in testing its novel predictions against astrophysical observations. This investigation employs the **Newman-Janis algorithm** to derive a stationary, axisymmetric solution, characterizing a **rotating black hole** within this modified gravitational framework. A central focus of our work is the systematic analysis of the **shadow** cast by such a black hole, with particular emphasis on the role of the fundamental **metric parameter**, α, which encodes the strength of the quadratic Gauss-Bonnet correction. Through rigorous numerical simulations, we demonstrate that α exerts a profound influence on both the apparent size and the degree of distortion of the shadow. Notably, we find that negative values of α, which correspond to a scenario with potential **negative energy** densities in the underlying theory, produce a shadow morphology that is in superior agreement with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the supermassive black hole in **M87***. This presents a significant theoretical tension: while a negative α is empirically favored by the current shadow data, its physical interpretation remains challenging. Our results, situated in the context of 2020, underscore the power of black hole imaging as a direct probe of strong-field gravity and highlight a critical constraint for future theoretical efforts aimed at reconciling the phenomenological success of such solutions with their microphysical consistency.
