Title: Deterministic Embeddings of Quantum Systems: A Hamiltonian Perspective

Abstract:
We establish a rigorous framework for deterministically embedding quantum systems within classical evolution laws, leveraging the Hamiltonian formalism. By deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for equivalence between deterministic and quantum dynamics, we provide a systematic procedure for identifying such embeddings. Our analysis, grounded in the principles of locality and deterministic quantum mechanics, yields novel insights into the interplay between classical and quantum systems. Illustrative examples demonstrate the applicability of our results, shedding light on the boundaries between quantum and deterministic descriptions (2020).
