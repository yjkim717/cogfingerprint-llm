**Abstract**

This study investigates the theoretical implications of magnetically charged black holes within the framework of the Standard Model. Utilizing a near-horizon analysis, we propose a scenario wherein electroweak symmetry is dynamically restored, resulting in a macroscopic phase transition. This restoration profoundly impacts the black holeâ€™s quantum properties, specifically enhancing Hawking radiation. The presence of massless fermions, arising from the restored symmetry, significantly alters the radiation spectrum. Our findings suggest a potential avenue for observing deviations from standard Hawking radiation predictions, opening new avenues for probing fundamental physics and quantum gravity effects in extreme astrophysical environments.
