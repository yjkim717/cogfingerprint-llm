In this work, we demonstrate that the apparent tension between Euclidean wormholes and the holographic principle in quantum gravity is resolved by enforcing a consistent swampland criterion: the Hilbert space of baby universes must be one-dimensional. This condition emerges as a non-negotiable consequence of demanding a unitary holographic dictionary between the gravitational bulk and a boundary conformal field theory. We show that proposals involving ensemble-averaged duals are rendered unnecessary, as the restriction to a single state for the baby universe sector naturally suppresses pathological wormhole amplitudes that would otherwise violate factorization. Our analysis establishes this unique baby universe state as a foundational principle for any consistent theory of quantum gravity, thereby reconciling semi-classical gravitational topology change with the exact unitarity required by holography.
