In the context of the Standard Model, we investigate the phenomenon of electroweak symmetry restoration in the vicinity of magnetically charged black holes. Our analysis reveals that Hawking radiation effects significantly influence the symmetry restoration process. Focusing on the 2020 understanding of black hole physics, we derive novel constraints on the magnetic charge of black holes, providing new insights into the interplay between gravity, particle physics, and the electroweak force.
