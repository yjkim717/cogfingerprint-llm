The development of accurate computational methods for modeling electrocatalytic interfaces remains a central challenge in physical chemistry, as conventional quantum mechanical (QM) approaches are computationally prohibitive for large-scale solvent-inclusive systems. We introduce the RexPoN-embedded QM (ReQM) framework, which synergistically integrates high-level quantum mechanics with the RexPoN reactive force field to transcend these limitations. This hybrid methodology enables atomistically precise simulations of electrocatalytic processes—including reaction pathways and interfacial charge transfer—within explicit solvation environments comprising thousands to millions of atoms. By preserving quantum-level accuracy while achieving unprecedented system sizes, ReQM provides mechanistic insights into solvent–electrode interactions and potential-dependent kinetics that were previously inaccessible. Benchmark calculations on prototypical electrocatalytic reactions confirm that ReQM reproduces experimental activation barriers and solvation effects with high fidelity. This approach establishes a new paradigm for predictive modeling in electrocatalysis, bridging the gap between electronic structure theory and mesoscale phenomena.
