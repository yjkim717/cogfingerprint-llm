**Abstract**

The integration of quantum-mechanical (QM) accuracy with the scalability of reactive force fields (ReaxFF) presents a promising pathway for simulating complex electrocatalytic interfaces. While density functional theory (DFT) provides an essential electronic-structure foundation, its computational cost prohibits the explicit treatment of large-scale solvent dynamics and long-timescale processes critical to electrocatalysis. This work introduces a hybrid QM/ReaxFF methodology that partitions the system into a QM-treated reactive core and an explicitly solvated environment modeled with a polarizable ReaxFF. This approach enables nanosecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations of electrocatalytic reactions, such as the oxygen reduction reaction, at metallic interfaces with full solvent representation. Benchmarking against pure DFT confirms the fidelity of the force field for describing bond-breaking and formation events within the electrochemical double layer. The method successfully captures the dynamic role of water networks in modulating reaction pathways and overpotentials, offering a powerful tool for the *in silico* design of next-generation electrocatalysts.
