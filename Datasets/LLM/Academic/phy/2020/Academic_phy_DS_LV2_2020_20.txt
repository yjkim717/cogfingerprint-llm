**Abstract**

The theoretical description of scattering processes involving magnetically charged particles has long presented a significant challenge due to the inherent non-locality of the electromagnetic interaction between electric and magnetic sources. Traditional quantum field theoretic frameworks, reliant on a single local gauge potential, are ill-suited for constructing a manifestly Lorentz-invariant S-matrix for such electric-magnetic scattering. This work overcomes this fundamental obstacle by introducing a novel on-shell formalism that rigorously constructs Lorentz-invariant scattering amplitudes for processes involving Dirac monopoles. The cornerstone of our approach is the systematic incorporation of the concept of *pairwise helicity*â€”a quantum number characterizing the angular momentum stored in the long-range electromagnetic field of a charge-monopole pair. To operationalize this, we define new spinor-helicity variables that are specifically adapted to capture the topological intricacies of the charge-monopole system. These variables provide a natural and powerful language for expressing amplitudes that are on-shell from their inception, thereby bypassing the need for a Lagrangian description. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework by explicitly computing and analyzing the \(2 \rightarrow 2\) elastic scattering amplitude for a spin-\(1/2\) Dirac fermion and a spin-\(0\) monopole. The resulting amplitude exhibits the expected analytic structure and, in the non-relativistic limit, correctly reproduces the classical scattering angle for a charge-monopole system, thereby validating our construction. This methodology establishes a robust, first-principles foundation for applying modern amplitude techniques to a wide range of phenomena in theories with magnetic matter.
