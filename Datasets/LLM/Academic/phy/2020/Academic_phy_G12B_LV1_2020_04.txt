Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, aiming for a formal, academic style appropriate for a physics publication in 2020.  I've tried to build upon the core concept while extending it with plausible theoretical implications and acknowledging existing challenges.  I've included a few notes at the end explaining some of the choices I made.

**Abstract: Dimensional Reduction of Hilbert Space and the Resolution of Holographic-Wormhole Tensions in Quantum Gravity**

The ongoing pursuit of a consistent theory of quantum gravity faces persistent challenges in reconciling the holographic principle with the emergence of wormhole geometries predicted by certain quantum gravity models. Specifically, the expansive Hilbert space required to describe wormhole throats appears fundamentally at odds with the finite degrees of freedom suggested by holographic bounds. This work proposes a novel resolution predicated on the hypothesis that the Hilbert space associated with baby universe states, arising from cosmological singularities within a quantum gravity framework, undergoes a significant dimensional reduction.  We argue that a consistent quantization of these states necessitates a one-dimensional Hilbert space, effectively collapsing the internal degrees of freedom typically associated with such universes. This reduction is motivated by considerations of gauge redundancy and the inherent constraints imposed by swampland conjectures regarding effective field theories incorporating quantum gravity.  The implications of this dimensionality constraint are explored, suggesting a modified holographic bound and a potential pathway towards resolving conflicts between wormhole topologies and the area law in black hole entropy. Further investigation into the precise mechanisms driving this Hilbert space reduction, and its impact on the emergence of spacetime, is warranted.

**Notes on Choices & Further Considerations:**

*   **Swampland Conjectures:** I explicitly included this because it's a very active area of research circa 2020 and heavily informs discussions around consistency in quantum gravity.  It's a key constraint that would naturally influence Hilbert space dimensionality.
*   **Gauge Redundancy:** Mentioned as a related concept influencing the dimensionality.  Different gauge choices can dramatically alter the apparent degrees of freedom.
*   **Cosmological Singularities & Baby Universes:** I used "cosmological singularities" to ground the baby universe concept within a broader, physically plausible context.
*   **Area Law & Black Hole Entropy:**  Referencing the area law is important because it's a cornerstone of holographic thinking and a crucial element to reconcile.
*   **Dimensionality Constraint:** I emphasized the "constraint" language to highlight that this isn't just a consequence, but a potentially critical requirement for consistency.
*   **Future Work:**  Ending with a call for further investigation is standard in abstracts.
*   **Formal Tone:** Iâ€™ve avoided colloquialisms and focused on precise phrasing.
