**Abstract**

The escalating demand for high-density photonic integrated circuits (PICs) necessitates mitigating detrimental crosstalk between adjacent optical waveguides. This paper presents a novel approach to crosstalk reduction in PICs leveraging the strategic implementation of nonuniform subwavelength grating profiles and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. We demonstrate that carefully tailored variations in the subwavelength strip dimensions along the propagation direction can effectively manipulate the modal confinement and reduce the evanescent field overlap between neighboring waveguides, thereby suppressing unwanted modal coupling.  A PSO algorithm is employed to determine optimal strip profiles, allowing for efficient exploration of the design space and facilitating the achievement of substantial crosstalk reduction.  Simulations, performed using finite-difference time-domain methods, validate the efficacy of the proposed technique, showcasing a significant improvement over conventional uniform grating designs.  This work contributes to the ongoing effort to enhance PIC performance and scalability, addressing a critical challenge for advanced optical communication and signal processing systems within the rapidly evolving landscape of integrated photonics (2020).
