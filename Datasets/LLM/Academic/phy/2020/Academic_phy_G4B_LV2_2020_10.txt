**Abstract**

Accurate modeling of electrocatalytic processes necessitates addressing the complexities of solvation environments, a significant limitation of conventional Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. This work presents a novel methodology integrating quantum mechanical principles with a reactive force field (ReaxFF) to facilitate the simulation of electrocatalysis within large solvent systems. Employing a hybrid approach, we leverage the accuracy of quantum mechanics for describing electronic structure while retaining the computational efficiency of ReaxFF for capturing chemical bond formation and cleavage. Critically, the simulations were performed using the ReQM force field, tailored for aqueous electrolytes, offering enhanced predictive capability.  This strategy circumvents the size-domain restrictions inherent in traditional DFT, enabling the investigation of reaction mechanisms and adsorption phenomena with greater fidelity.  The resultant simulations provide a crucial advancement towards understanding and optimizing electrocatalytic materials, representing a significant step beyond existing theoretical approaches.  These findings, reported in 2020, underscore the potential of combined quantum and force-field techniques for complex electrochemical studies.
