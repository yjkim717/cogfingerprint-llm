**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in scattering theory necessitate a refined approach to constructing Lorentz-invariant S-matrices, particularly for processes involving charged particles and magnetic monopoles. This work introduces a novel framework predicated on ‘pairwise helicity,’ defined as the quantized product of charge and helicity vectors.  Employing a revised multi-particle representation, we demonstrate that this formalism provides a systematic route to calculating scattering amplitudes, offering a more intuitive connection between spin-helicity techniques and the dynamics of fermion-monopole interactions.  Crucially, our construction ensures Lorentz invariance, a fundamental requirement for consistent quantum field theory. Preliminary results suggest this approach offers improved precision in predicting scattering cross-sections and provides a valuable tool for exploring the subtle effects arising from monopole interactions within the broader context of electric and magnetic scattering. Further investigation into the implications of pairwise helicity is warranted.
