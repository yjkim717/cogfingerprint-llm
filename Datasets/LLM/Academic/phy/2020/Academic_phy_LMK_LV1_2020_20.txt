Title: On-Shell Construction of the Lorentz-Invariant S-Matrix for Dyonic Particles

Abstract:

The formulation of a Lorentz-invariant S-matrix for particles carrying both electric and magnetic charges has long been a challenging problem in theoretical physics. Recent advances in on-shell methods have provided a novel framework for addressing this issue. In this work, we leverage the power of spinor-helicity variables and the little group to construct a Lorentz-invariant S-matrix for dyonic particles. 

Our approach revolves around the introduction of pairwise helicity, a concept that naturally arises when considering the little group transformations of particles with both electric and magnetic charges. By incorporating pairwise helicity into the spinor-helicity formalism, we derive a set of on-shell building blocks that can be used to construct scattering amplitudes involving dyonic particles. 

The S-matrix is then constructed by ensuring that it transforms covariantly under the Poincar√© group, thereby guaranteeing Lorentz invariance. We demonstrate that our construction is consistent with the expected properties of the S-matrix, including unitarity and analyticity. 

Furthermore, we show that the pairwise helicity plays a crucial role in ensuring that the S-matrix is invariant under the little group, thereby providing a non-perturbative definition of the scattering amplitudes. Our results provide a significant step forward in the understanding of scattering amplitudes involving dyonic particles and have important implications for the study of monopole physics and electromagnetic duality. 

The on-shell methods employed in this work provide a powerful framework for exploring the properties of dyonic particles and pave the way for further research into the phenomenology of magnetically charged particles in high-energy physics.
