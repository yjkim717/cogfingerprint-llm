In 2020, Ashtekarâ€™s seminal framework re-examined black hole evaporation by unifying loop quantum gravity with semi-classical gravity approximations. This approach circumvents the space-time singularity problem intrinsic to classical general relativity, proposing instead a non-singular dynamical evolution of the black hole interior. Crucially, the model posits a quantum-corrected event horizon that undergoes gradual decay, altering conventional evaporation timelines and information purification dynamics. By integrating insights from simplified polymer quantization models, the work demonstrates how pre-Hawking radiation may encode information, addressing long-standing paradoxes. These findings challenge the strict causality of event horizons in semi-classical treatments and suggest observable signatures in future gravitational wave astronomy, marking a pivotal step toward a consistent quantum theory of gravity.
