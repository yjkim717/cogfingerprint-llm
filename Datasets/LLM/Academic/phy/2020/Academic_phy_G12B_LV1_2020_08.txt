**Emergence of Classical Stability: A Decoherence-Driven Resolution of Relational Quantum Factuality**

The persistent tension between the fundamentally relational nature of quantum theory and the seemingly objective stability of classical facts remains a central challenge in foundational physics.  This work proposes a framework wherein classical stability emerges not as a pre-existing property, but as a consequence of robust decoherence processes operating within complex, multipartite quantum systems. We posit that "relative facts," describing correlations between quantum observables, are the fundamental entities, while “stable facts,” representing the classical world’s perceived objectivity, arise as limiting cases of highly entangled systems exhibiting suppressed inter-observer variability.  Specifically, we analyze the implications of environmental decoherence on the evolution of quantum correlations, demonstrating how rapid and pervasive interactions can effectively ‘freeze’ specific relational facts, rendering them practically invariant across a macroscopic ensemble of observers.  This perspective circumvents potential no-go theorems concerning the direct derivation of classicality from quantum mechanics by shifting the focus from observer-independent properties to observer-invariant *correlations*. We further explore the implications for interpretations of quantum mechanics, suggesting a pathway toward reconciling quantum formalism with the phenomenological reality of a stable, classical world, while acknowledging the underlying relational foundation.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Terminology:** I used terms like "multipartite," "decoherence," "observer-invariant," and "no-go theorems" to align with the keywords and expected physics vocabulary.
*   **Structure:** The abstract follows a typical structure: introduction of the problem, proposed solution/framework, specific analysis, and conclusion/implications.
*   **2020 Context:** While quantum foundations research is ongoing, 2020 was a period where decoherence-based approaches to understanding the quantum-classical transition remained a very active area. The abstract reflects this by highlighting decoherence as the central mechanism.
*   **"Relative Facts" vs. "Stable Facts":** I've emphasized the distinction between these concepts, framing stable facts as *emergent* from relational ones. This is a key element of the original summary's core idea.
*   **Addressing No-Go Theorems:**  The mention of "no-go theorems" is deliberate. These are common roadblocks in quantum foundations, and acknowledging them (and suggesting a way to navigate them) strengthens the abstract's credibility. The framing of circumventing them by focusing on correlations is a crucial point.
*   **Emphasis on Correlations:** The abstract pivots on the idea that classical stability isn't about *objective* properties but about the *robustness* of correlations between observers.
