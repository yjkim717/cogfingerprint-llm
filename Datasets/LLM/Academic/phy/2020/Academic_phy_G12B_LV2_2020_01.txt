**Abstract**

The conceptual tension between the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and the deterministic worldview underpinning classical physics remains a subject of ongoing investigation. This work explores a novel mathematical formalism allowing for the construction of quantum systems exhibiting behavior mathematically equivalent to deterministic systems, thereby offering a potential avenue for reconciling these perspectives. We present a generalized procedure for formulating quantum Hamiltonians such that their time evolution yields trajectories consistent with deterministic dynamics, particularly within the low-energy regime. Our approach avoids explicit violations of locality, demonstrating that deterministic-like behavior can emerge from underlying quantum principles without necessitating non-local interactions. The derived equations detail the specific constraints on Hamiltonian structure required to achieve this equivalence. This formalism has implications for understanding the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics and may provide a framework for developing novel quantum control strategies, particularly in systems where deterministic predictability is desirable. Further research will focus on exploring the robustness of this equivalence under perturbations and its applicability to more complex quantum systems.
