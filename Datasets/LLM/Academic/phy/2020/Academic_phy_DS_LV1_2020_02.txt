We investigate the geometry of effective field theory (EFT) parameter spaces, introducing a novel convex region—the EFT-hedron—whose boundaries encode fundamental constraints from causality and unitarity on Wilson coefficients. By formulating dispersion relations for scattering amplitudes and employing positivity bounds derived from the optical theorem, we demonstrate that the allowed EFT coefficients inhabit a convex space defined by an infinite set of linear inequalities. This geometric formulation provides a systematic procedure to derive optimal, theory-agnostic constraints on low-energy physics. Our findings establish a direct link between the analytic structure of the S-matrix and the geometry of EFTs, offering a powerful framework to chart the landscape of physically viable ultraviolet completions within the modern bootstrap program.
