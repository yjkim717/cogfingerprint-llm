**Abstract:**

The fundamental energetic cost associated with quantum information processing remains a critical challenge for realizing practical quantum technologies. While Landauerâ€™s principle dictates a minimum energy dissipation for erasing one bit of classical information, the energetic implications of quantum gate operations, the building blocks of quantum computation, are less thoroughly understood, particularly concerning the role of fluctuation phenomena. This work presents an experimental investigation into the energetic cost of implementing a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate on a two-qubit system comprised of superconducting transmon qubits. We demonstrate a direct correlation between the energy dissipated during gate execution and the magnitude of energy and entropy fluctuations observed in the circuit's thermal environment. Through detailed analysis of these fluctuations, we quantify the energetic overhead beyond the theoretical Landauer bound, revealing a significant contribution from the non-unitary nature of the gate operation and the inherent limitations imposed by finite bath temperatures. These findings provide valuable insights into the thermodynamic constraints governing quantum gate performance and offer a pathway towards minimizing energy expenditure in future quantum processors.
