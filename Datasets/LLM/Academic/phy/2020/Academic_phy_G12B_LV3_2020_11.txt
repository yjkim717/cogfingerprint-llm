 Here's a formal academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided summary and keywords, suitable for a physics publication (circa 2020):

**Abstract**

This work examines the linear stability properties of black resonators and geons residing within global Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Utilizing linear stability analysis and exploring the superradiant instability inherent to black resonators, we present a contrasting finding: a significant subset of geon configurations exhibit unexpected linear stability. This observation carries implications for the holographic duality, suggesting the potential existence of remarkably long-lived, low-energy states in corresponding dual gauge theories. While a specific parameter regime induces instability in certain geon solutions, we introduce novel, non-spinning oscillating geon configurations demonstrating robustness against linear perturbations. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of gravitational solitons in AdS, and their connection to emergent phenomena in strongly coupled field theories.



I aimed for a tone and structure fitting a physics research abstract, incorporating the keywords naturally and presenting a clear argument about the findings and their significance.
