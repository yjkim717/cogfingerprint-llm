Title: Relating Quantum Theory to Classical Reality: The Role of Relative and Stable Facts

Abstract:
This paper examines the intersection of quantum theory and classical ontology through the lens of relative and stable facts. By analyzing the decoherence process, we elucidate how relative facts, contextual and observer-dependent, give rise to stable facts, which are robust and effectively observer-independent. Our analysis bridges the quantum-classical divide, providing insight into the emergence of classical reality. We argue that the stability of facts is crucial for understanding the ontology of quantum theory, shedding light on the nature of reality in 2020's advancing quantum discourse.
