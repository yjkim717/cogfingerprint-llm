This study investigates the theoretical interplay between magnetic charge, electroweak symmetry, and Hawking radiation in the context of black hole physics. We explore the consequences of introducing magnetic monopoles into the black hole geometry, specifically examining magnetically charged black hole solutions within general relativity. Our analysis suggests that the presence of significant magnetic charge can induce a restoration of electroweak symmetry near the black hole horizon, leading to the emergence of massless, chiral fermions. This restoration, in turn, significantly alters the Hawking radiation spectrum.  We demonstrate, through a perturbative approach, that the presence of these massless fermions enhances the Hawking emission rate, deviating substantially from the standard thermal spectrum predicted for Schwarzschild or Reissner-Nordstr√∂m black holes.  Furthermore, we examine the implications for particle production and potential observational signatures, considering the constraints imposed by current astrophysical observations and theoretical bounds on magnetic charge. This work provides a novel perspective on the connection between fundamental symmetries and quantum gravity effects in extreme spacetime environments.
