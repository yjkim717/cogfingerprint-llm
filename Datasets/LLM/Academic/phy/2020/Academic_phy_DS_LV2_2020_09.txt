We present a novel analysis of the Lyman-alpha forest flux power spectrum utilizing high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations to constrain the mass of ultralight axion dark matter. Our method probes suppressed cosmic structure growth on small scales, a key signature of such fuzzy dark matter candidates. The results establish a robust lower limit of m_a ≥ 2 × 10^{-20} eV/c² at the 95% confidence level, strengthening previous cosmological bounds by approximately an order of magnitude. This significantly restricts the parameter space for ultralight axions as a viable dark matter component, underscoring the power of Lyman-alpha data in discriminating between dark matter models.
