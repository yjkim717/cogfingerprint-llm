This study presents a GPU-accelerated implementation of density functional theory (DFT) within the QUICK quantum chemistry package, addressing computational bottlenecks in electronic structure calculations. We demonstrate that by reformulating exchange-correlation functional evaluations and optimizing memory access patterns, our implementation achieves unprecedented parallel efficiency on GPU architectures. Systematic benchmarking across molecular systems reveals 60-780× speedup relative to conventional CPU-based computations while maintaining chemical accuracy within 0.1 kcal/mol for thermochemical properties. The algorithm preserves formal O(N³) scaling but reduces the prefactor through massive parallelization of integral computations and density matrix operations. These developments enable previously intractable ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and property calculations for systems exceeding 500 atoms, establishing new frontiers for computational materials discovery and biochemical modeling.
