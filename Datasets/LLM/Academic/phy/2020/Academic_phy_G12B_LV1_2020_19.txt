Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a physics publication, and reflecting a 2020 timeframe. I've aimed for precision and a structured argument.

**Abstract**

Dielectric metasurfaces offer a compelling platform for manipulating and sensing electromagnetic fields, yet their potential for real-time polarization state detection remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a theoretical and numerical investigation demonstrating the design of high-sensitivity dielectric metasurfaces capable of detecting minute deviations from a target polarization state. By strategically engineering the resonant properties of these all-dielectric structures, we achieve enhanced field localization and increased sensitivity to polarization changes. This approach enables single-shot detection of polarization errors, circumventing the need for time-integrating techniques. Our findings suggest a pathway towards compact, high-performance polarization sensors with applications in optical communications and imaging systems.

**Notes on Choices & Considerations:**

*   **Formal Tone:** I used phrases like "we present," "investigation," "demonstrating," and avoided conversational language.
*   **Precise Terminology:** Included terms like "electromagnetic fields," "resonant properties," "field localization," and "polarization state."
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: Problem/Motivation -> Proposed Solution -> Results/Findings -> Implications/Applications.
*   **2020 Context:**  The focus is on demonstrating potential and a pathway, which aligns with the research landscape around that time. Metasurfaces were a rapidly developing area, and showcasing a specific application like polarization detection was a relevant contribution.
*   **Word Count:** Aimed for approximately 113 words.
