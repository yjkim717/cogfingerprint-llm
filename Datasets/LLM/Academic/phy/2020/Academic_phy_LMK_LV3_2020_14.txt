"Abstract: The recent observation of the shadow cast by M87* provides a novel probe for testing gravity theories beyond general relativity. In this study, we investigate the shadow of rotating black holes in Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a higher-curvature extension of Einstein's theory. By deriving the null geodesic equations in the rotating Gauss-Bonnet background, we analyze the shadow's shape and size as a function of the black hole's spin and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter. Our results show that the Gauss-Bonnet term significantly affects the shadow's morphology, leading to deviations from the Kerr prediction. Using the Event Horizon Telescope's M87* observations, we constrain the Gauss-Bonnet parameter, demonstrating the potential of shadow observations to test alternative gravity theories. Our findings contribute to the ongoing effort to refine our understanding of gravity in the strong-field regime."
