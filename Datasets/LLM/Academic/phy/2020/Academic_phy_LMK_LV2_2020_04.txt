Title: Constraints on Baby Universe States from Swampland Conditions in Quantum Gravity

Abstract:
The consistency of a theory of quantum gravity is scrutinized through the lens of Swampland conditions, with a particular focus on the implications for baby universe states. By invoking holographic principles and examining the role of Euclidean wormholes, we derive a constraint on the dimensionality of the Hilbert space of baby universe states. It is demonstrated that, under the assumptions of a consistent theory of quantum gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universe states must be one-dimensional. This result stems from the interplay between Swampland conditions, holography, and the gravitational path integral, which collectively enforce a trivial structure on the space of baby universe states. The findings presented herein have significant implications for our understanding of the quantum gravitational framework, particularly in regards to the cosmological implications of baby universes and the role of wormholes in the gravitational path integral.
