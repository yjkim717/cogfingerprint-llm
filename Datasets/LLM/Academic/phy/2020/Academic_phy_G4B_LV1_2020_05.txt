**Abstract**

Accurate determination of the absolute magnitudes of evolved carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars is crucial for understanding their contribution to interstellar dust production and broader stellar population dynamics.  This research presents a novel calibration of AGB absolute magnitudes, leveraging J-band photometric observations and employing distances derived for both the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). Utilizing a sample of AGB stars within these satellite galaxies, we establish a robust relationship between J-band magnitudes and distance modulus.  The resultant photometric zero-points are then applied to derive absolute magnitudes, accounting for interstellar reddening effects through iterative spectral modeling.  Preliminary results indicate a significant correlation between J-band luminosity and stellar mass, supporting established evolutionary trends.  Further refinement of this calibration, incorporating spectroscopic data, will improve the accuracy of distance estimates to nearby AGB populations and enhance our understanding of their circumstellar environments.
