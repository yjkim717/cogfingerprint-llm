**Constraining Ultralight Axion Dark Matter Properties via Lyman-α Forest Analysis**

The nature of dark matter remains a central enigma in cosmology. Ultralight axions represent a compelling candidate, necessitating stringent constraints on their mass scale. This work presents a novel analysis of Lyman-α forest spectra, leveraging a high-resolution emulator developed to efficiently model the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and its impact on the intergalactic medium. We derive a substantially tighter lower limit on the mass of ultralight axions, specifically placing a constraint of *m<sub>a</sub>* ≥ 10<sup>-22</sup> eV. This constraint is achieved through a Bayesian statistical framework, incorporating uncertainties in both the Lyman-α data and the emulator predictions. The improved precision in parameter estimation provides crucial guidance for future axion detection experiments and offers a refined benchmark for cosmological simulations exploring the formation of cosmic structure.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Precise Terminology:** I’ve used terms like “Lyman-α forest spectra,” “integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect,” “Bayesian statistical framework,” and “emulator” to align with standard physics vocabulary.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: introducing the problem, outlining the method, stating the result (the tighter lower limit), and discussing the implications.
*   **Year Context (2020):** The language and level of detail are consistent with the kind of research that would be expected in 2020 within this field.
*   **Word Count:** The abstract is approximately 142 words.

Would you like me to refine this abstract further, perhaps by adding a specific citation or focusing on a particular aspect of the research?
