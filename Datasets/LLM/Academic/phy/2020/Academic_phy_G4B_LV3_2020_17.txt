**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) necessitates strategies to mitigate signal degradation, particularly crosstalk, to facilitate increased device integration. This study presents a novel approach employing nonuniform subwavelength strip gratings within PIC waveguides, demonstrating a marked improvement in crosstalk reduction. Utilizing particle swarm optimization (PSO), we systematically tailored the strip geometry to minimize cross-talk effects, achieving a demonstrable enhancement in signal fidelity.  Furthermore, the optimized design architecture directly contributes to a substantial increase in integrated circuit density – a critical metric for future PIC performance.  Experimental results, validated in 2020, indicate a [Insert Quantitative Result - e.g., ‘3dB’] reduction in crosstalk compared to conventional designs.  These findings underscore the potential of PSO-guided metamaterial design for realizing higher-performance, more compact photonic integrated systems.
