**Abstract**

Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations remain computationally intensive, particularly for complex systems, necessitating the development of accelerated methodologies. This work presents a novel GPU implementation of the QUICK program, a widely utilized DFT code, designed to significantly enhance computational efficiency. The core of the optimization lies in a refined Quantum Interaction Kernel (QIK) coupled with an octree grid data structure for efficient representation of the electron density. Specifically, the implementation leverages the parallel processing capabilities of modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate the calculation of exchange-correlation functionals. Preliminary benchmarking demonstrates substantial speedups – approximately 3.2 to 5.8 times – compared to equivalent CPU-based computations for systems of moderate size.  These improvements facilitate more rapid exploration of chemical space and enable the investigation of larger, more realistic molecular systems. Further development focuses on optimizing the QIK for diverse exchange-correlation functionals and exploring integration with advanced GPU architectures.
