Title: Investigating Non-Equilibrium Dynamics in Quantum Many-Body Systems

Abstract:

The study of non-equilibrium dynamics in quantum many-body systems has garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by advances in experimental techniques and theoretical frameworks. This research aims to explore the complex phenomena arising from the interplay between quantum coherence and many-body interactions. Utilizing a combination of numerical simulations and analytical methods, we examine the relaxation dynamics of a one-dimensional quantum Ising model subject to a sudden quench. Our results demonstrate the emergence of a prethermalized regime, characterized by a distinct separation of timescales between local and global relaxation processes. We further investigate the role of integrability-breaking perturbations on the long-time behavior of the system, observing a crossover from a non-thermal to a thermalized state. Our findings provide insight into the intricate mechanisms governing non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with implications for the understanding of quantum phase transitions and the development of novel quantum technologies. The results are contextualized within the broader framework of quantum statistical mechanics, highlighting the relevance of this research to ongoing investigations in the field, as of 2020.
