 Here's an abstract inspired by the provided summary and keywords, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a physics/astrophysics context:

"Freedman et al. (2020) present a novel distance determination technique leveraging the characteristic infrared luminosity of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (C-AGB) stars. Employing *J*-band photometry within the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), this method establishes a robust calibration of the C-AGB luminosity function. Results demonstrate a high degree of consistency with established distance estimates derived from the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method in NGC 253 and the LMC, validating the C-AGB approach as a complementary tool for refining astrophysical distance scales and improving the precision of the distance modulus."
