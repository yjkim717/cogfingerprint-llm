In this investigation, we analyze the linear stability of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) black resonators and geons within the framework of general relativity. Our central finding reveals that black resonators universally exhibit superradiant instability, a consequence of their non-stationary, rotating spacetime geometries which allow for energy extraction and exponential mode growth. Conversely, a significant class of geons—localized, horizonless gravitational solitons—are demonstrated to be linearly stable despite the presence of ergoregions. This stability establishes geons as exceptionally long-lived states in the gravitational sector of the dual gauge theory, capable of persisting over extensive timescales without decay. The superradiant instability for geons is shown to emerge only within highly specific, finely-tuned parameter regimes, suggesting a topological or structural robustness absent in their black hole counterparts. These results, obtained in 2020, provide a refined stability phase diagram for dynamical AdS spacetimes and clarify the role of horizonless objects as potential endpoints of gravitational evolution.
