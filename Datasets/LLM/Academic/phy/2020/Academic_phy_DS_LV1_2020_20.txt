**Abstract**

The long-standing challenge of formulating a consistent, local, and Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory for electric-magnetic scattering has been hindered by the topological intricacies of the Dirac quantization condition and the associated Dirac string singularity. This work presents a novel, first-principles construction of the S-matrix for the scattering of electrically and magnetically charged point particles, circumventing these foundational obstacles. We achieve this by leveraging modern on-shell methods, which focus exclusively on gauge-invariant asymptotic observables, thereby obviating the need for a singular Lagrangian description or the introduction of an auxiliary Dirac string. The key innovation is the systematic incorporation of the concept of *pairwise helicity*—a quantum number characterizing the angular momentum stored in the electromagnetic field of a charge-monopole pair—directly into the on-shell data and little group transformations. By imposing Lorentz invariance, locality, and unitarity at the level of the S-matrix elements, we derive a new family of scattering amplitudes for relativistic monopole-dyon and dyon-dyon processes. These amplitudes are shown to exhibit the expected non-analyticity in the center-of-mass momentum, a hallmark of long-range interactions mediated by massless photons, and correctly reproduce the classical scattering angle in the semi-classical limit. Our results provide a purely on-shell framework for electric-magnetic scattering, offering a robust foundation for future calculations of quantum loop corrections and the exploration of dualities in a manifestly Lorentz-covariant manner.
