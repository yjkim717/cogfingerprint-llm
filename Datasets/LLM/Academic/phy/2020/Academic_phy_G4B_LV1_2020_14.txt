**Abstract**

The accurate characterization of black hole shadows represents a pivotal test of general relativistic predictions and offers a unique probe of spacetime geometry. This study examines the influence of a dynamically adjustable metric parameter on the emergent shadow morphology of rotating Gauss–Bonnet black holes, contrasting this behavior with that observed in the Schwarzschild-Kerr spacetime model. Utilizing numerical relativity simulations incorporating the Gauss–Bonnet Lagrangian, we explore how modifications to the black hole’s metric, specifically parameterized by the choice of *μ*, affect the size, shape, and intensity profile of the resulting shadow. 

Our findings demonstrate that introducing this metric parameter can significantly alter the shadow’s angular diameter and asymmetry, deviating from the relatively simple, axisymmetric nature predicted by the Kerr metric.  These deviations are particularly pronounced for rotating black holes with specific values of *μ*.  We conclude that the sensitivity of the shadow to such metric modifications warrants further investigation, potentially revealing subtle differences in the spacetime structure surrounding these exotic black hole solutions.  Future work should focus on exploring the parameter space and examining the implications for observational constraints in the context of the M87* black hole.
