**Abstract**

This work investigates the construction of Lorentz-invariant scattering amplitudes for processes involving both electrically and magnetically charged particles, employing contemporary on-shell methods. Departing from conventional approaches, we develop a novel S-matrix formulation that explicitly incorporates the interplay between electric and magnetic charges. A key finding is the emergence of a pairwise helicity relation, intrinsically linked to the cross product of the constituent charges, thereby revealing a geometric structure underlying electric-magnetic interactions. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce a new spinor-helicity variable specifically tailored to the complexities of these amplitudes. This variable allows for a more streamlined and insightful representation of the scattering process. The methodology presented offers a potential pathway toward a deeper understanding of gauge theories beyond the standard model and provides a valuable extension of on-shell techniques to encompass multi-charge scattering phenomena, a topic of increasing relevance in contemporary theoretical physics.
