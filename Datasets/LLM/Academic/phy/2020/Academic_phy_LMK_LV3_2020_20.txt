Title: Lorentz-Invariant Formulation of Electromagnetic Scattering Amplitudes with Monopoles

Abstract:
In 2020, the theoretical understanding of scattering amplitudes involving electrically and magnetically charged particles underwent significant advancement. This paper presents a novel, Lorentz-invariant S-matrix construction for the scattering of dyons, leveraging the Poincar√© group's representation theory. By introducing pairwise helicity variables, we establish a framework that accommodates the electromagnetic field's duality symmetry. Utilizing spinor-helicity variables, we derive compact expressions for scattering amplitudes, elucidating the intricate interplay between electric and magnetic charges. Our formulation respects the Lorentz invariance and unitarity of the S-matrix, providing a robust foundation for phenomenological applications. The results have far-reaching implications for the study of high-energy collisions involving monopoles, shedding new light on the underlying symmetries governing electromagnetic interactions. This work paves the way for further exploration of the rich physics associated with dyon scattering.
