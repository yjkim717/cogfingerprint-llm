Title: Advancing Electrocatalysis Simulations through the Integration of Quantum Mechanics and Reactive Force Fields: A ReQM Methodology

Abstract:
Accurate simulations of electrocatalytic processes remain a significant challenge due to the complex interplay between electronic and atomistic dynamics. To address this, we introduce ReQM, a novel methodology that seamlessly integrates quantum mechanics (QM) with reactive force fields (ReaxFF). By leveraging the strengths of density functional theory (DFT) for electronic structure calculations and ReaxFF for atomistic interactions, ReQM enables the simulation of electrocatalytic reactions with enhanced accuracy and scalability. Our approach employs a rexpon-based framework to dynamically couple QM and ReaxFF regions, facilitating a smooth transition between the two regimes. Benchmarked against conventional QM and ReaxFF methods, ReQM demonstrates improved predictive capabilities for electrocatalytic reactions, as exemplified by its application to a model oxygen evolution reaction. The ReQM methodology offers a powerful tool for elucidating complex electrocatalytic mechanisms, with far-reaching implications for the design of high-performance electrocatalysts. (2020)
