**Accelerated Density Functional Theory Calculations via GPU Implementation of QUICK**

Density Functional Theory (DFT) remains a cornerstone of computational materials science, yet its computational demands frequently limit the scope of accessible simulations. This work presents a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of the QUICK DFT code, designed to substantially enhance the efficiency of electronic structure calculations. Leveraging the massively parallel architecture of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), we demonstrate a marked improvement in computational throughput, specifically targeting the exchange-correlation energy component.  The implementation incorporates a refined numerical grid strategy, optimized for GPU vectorization, and facilitates efficient treatment of quantum interactions.  Benchmarking results reveal a significant speedup – approximately [Insert specific speedup percentage or factor here, e.g., 3.5x] – compared to conventional CPU-based calculations for [Specify system type, e.g., small organic molecules].  This accelerated workflow expands the feasibility of exploring larger and more complex molecular systems within reasonable timescales, contributing to advancements in areas such as catalysis and materials design.
