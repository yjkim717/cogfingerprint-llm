Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a physics publication, and aiming for a word count around 178 words, framed within a 2020 context.  I've focused on expanding on the implications of a geometric approach to EFTs.

**A Geometric Framework for Constraining Effective Field Theories via Positive Geometry**

Effective field theory (EFT) provides a powerful framework for describing physics beyond the Standard Model, but the vast space of possible higher-dimension operators poses a significant challenge for model building and phenomenology. We present a novel geometric approach, building upon recent developments in positive geometry, to systematically constrain this operator space. Our methodology, inspired by the EFT-hedron construction, leverages the inherent positivity constraints arising from unitarity and causality to identify allowed configurations of operators. This approach moves beyond traditional symmetry-based constraints, revealing hitherto unexplored relationships between operators and imposing non-trivial geometric restrictions on their coefficients.  We demonstrate how this geometric perspective can be used to identify maximal, unitarity-preserving operator bases and to explore the landscape of EFT models with improved theoretical control. Furthermore, we discuss implications for the calculation of scattering amplitudes within these constrained EFTs, suggesting a pathway toward robust and predictive phenomenological models, particularly relevant for precision tests of the Standard Model and searches for new physics at the LHC and future colliders. This work establishes a new avenue for exploring the structure of EFTs, linking algebraic constraints to geometric insights.

**Notes on the Abstract:**

*   **Formal Language:** Uses precise terminology common in high-energy physics (e.g., "higher-dimension operators," "unitarity," "phenomenology," "scattering amplitudes").
*   **Structured Reasoning:**  Clearly outlines the problem, the proposed solution (geometric approach), the methodology (positive geometry/EFT-hedron), and the potential benefits/implications.
*   **2020 Context:** Mentions the LHC and future colliders, reflecting the ongoing experimental landscape. The reference to recent developments in positive geometry also situates it within a contemporary research trend.
*   **Expansion:** It expands on the core idea of the original summary, fleshing out the benefits of the geometric approach.
*   **Word Count:**  Approximately 178 words.
