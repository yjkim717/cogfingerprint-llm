We present novel constraints on ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter derived from high-resolution Lyman-alpha forest data. Employing a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that self-consistently model the intergalactic medium's thermal history and the suppression of small-scale structure from ULA dark matter, we perform a Bayesian inference analysis. Our results robustly exclude ULA masses below 2Ã—10^{-20} eV at high statistical confidence, as these models produce insufficient small-scale power to match the observed Lyman-alpha flux power spectrum. This finding imposes a stringent lower bound on the axion mass, effectively ruling out a significant portion of the canonical parameter space for fuzzy dark matter models and reinforcing the cold dark matter paradigm on cosmological scales.
