"In the framework of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, we examine the implications of Swampland conjectures on the Hilbert space of baby universes. By enforcing consistency conditions on quantum gravity, we demonstrate that the dimensionality of this Hilbert space is constrained to unity. Leveraging holographic principles, our analysis reveals that a one-dimensional baby universe state space is a necessary condition for a UV-complete theory of quantum gravity. This result has significant implications for our understanding of the gravitational path integral and the role of baby universes in the multiverse, as discussed in recent literature (2020)."
