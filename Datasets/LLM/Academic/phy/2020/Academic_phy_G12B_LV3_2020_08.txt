**Abstract**

The persistent tension between the formalism of quantum theory and the seemingly definite nature of macroscopic reality remains a central challenge in contemporary physics. This work explores the conceptual framework proposed by Rovelli, which posits that objective facts do not exist at a fundamental level, but rather emerge from a relational perspective wherein properties are defined by relationships between systems. We examine how this relational approach potentially circumvents the paradoxes arising from the foundational challenges to quantum epistemology, specifically those highlighted by the Frauchiger and Renner no-go theorem concerning the consistency of multiple consistent accounts of the same quantum event. By grounding reality in a network of interdependent relational facts, Rovelliâ€™s approach offers a pathway towards understanding the emergence of stable, observer-independent facts through the process of decoherence, thereby providing a novel perspective on the measurement problem and the reconciliation of quantum mechanics with classical experience.
