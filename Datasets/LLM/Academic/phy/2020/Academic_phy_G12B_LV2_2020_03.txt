**Abstract**

This study investigates the theoretical implications of magnetically charged black holes within the framework of the Standard Model. We explore the hypothesis that the presence of magnetic charge induces a restoration of electroweak symmetry near the black hole horizon. This restoration, in turn, is predicted to significantly impact Hawking radiation, particularly through the emergence of massless fermionic modes. Our analysis suggests an enhancement of the Hawking power spectrum due to these massless particles, potentially offering a novel avenue for probing quantum gravity effects and the interplay between electromagnetism and the electroweak sector in extreme gravitational environments. Further investigation is warranted to fully characterize these phenomena.
