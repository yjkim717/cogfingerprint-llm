**Abstract**

The construction of consistent low-energy effective field theories (EFTs) necessitates careful consideration of constraints imposed by fundamental physical principles. This work introduces the EFT-hedron, a novel geometric framework that systematically encodes the allowed structures of higher-dimensional operators within an EFT, respecting both causality and unitarity. Utilizing the spin-statistics theorem and the Adler-Bardeen theorem as foundational pillars, we demonstrate how these constraints manifest as facets and vertices in a complex polytope. The EFT-hedron provides a powerful tool for visualizing and classifying the permissible operator spectra, thereby guiding model building and simplifying the analysis of scattering amplitudes. Crucially, this geometric approach offers a unified perspective on previously disparate constraints, revealing deep connections between causality, unitarity, and the operator organization of EFTs. We anticipate that this framework will prove invaluable for future investigations into the systematic exploration of EFT landscapes and the identification of theoretically consistent models beyond the Standard Model.
