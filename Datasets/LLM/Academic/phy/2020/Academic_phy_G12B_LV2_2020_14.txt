**Abstract**

The investigation of black hole shadows provides a compelling observational window into the strong-field regime of gravity, offering a means to test alternative theories beyond general relativity. This work explores the implications of Gauss-Bonnet gravity for the observable characteristics of rotating black hole shadows. Employing the Newman-Janis algorithm, we generate stationary, axisymmetric black hole solutions within a framework incorporating higher-order curvature invariants—specifically, the Gauss-Bonnet term—and analyze the resulting shadow morphologies. Our analysis centers on the metric parameter α, which quantifies the strength of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling, and its influence on both the shadow's radius and its associated distortion.

We demonstrate that the shadow size exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on α, diverging from the predictions of general relativity as the Gauss-Bonnet coupling becomes increasingly significant. Furthermore, we observe a substantial modification of the shadow's shape, characterized by asymmetries and deviations from the circular profile expected in the Kerr spacetime. The degree of distortion is directly correlated with the magnitude of α, indicating a sensitive relationship between the gravitational dynamics and the projected shadow image.

Quantitative measurements of the shadow radius and ellipticity are presented as functions of α and black hole spin, allowing for a direct comparison with potential future observations from Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)-like interferometers.  The results highlight the potential for utilizing black hole shadow observations to constrain the parameter space of Gauss-Bonnet gravity, offering a crucial avenue for probing modifications to Einstein’s theory in extreme gravitational environments. While our analysis focuses on static background spacetimes, these findings provide a valuable foundation for further research incorporating time-dependent perturbations and accretion disk effects, essential for a comprehensive understanding of black hole shadow phenomenology in modified gravity theories.

**Notes on Choices and Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Tone & Vocabulary:** I used language common in physics abstracts (e.g., "investigation," "implications," "morphologies," "quantifies," "non-monotonic," "deviations," "parameter space," "perturbations").
*   **Structured Argument:**
    *   **Context & Motivation:** I started by explaining *why* this research is important (black hole shadows as a probe of strong gravity, testing beyond GR).
    *   **Methods:** I explicitly mentioned the Newman-Janis algorithm, demonstrating the technical approach.
    *   **Results:**  I clearly stated the key findings – the non-monotonic shadow size, shadow distortion, and the relationship to α.
    *   **Comparison & Implications:**  I linked the findings to potential observational tests (EHT) and the ability to constrain the theory.
    *   **Future Work:** I briefly pointed toward limitations and areas for expansion (time-dependent effects).
*   **Keywords Integration:**  All keywords were naturally incorporated into the narrative.
*   **Year Context (2020):** The phrasing and references to the EHT are consistent with research trends around that time.  The EHT's first image of M87* had just been released, making black hole shadow
