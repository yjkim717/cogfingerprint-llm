In his 2020 work, C. Rovelli introduces a fundamental distinction between relative and stable facts to address foundational issues in quantum theory. Relative facts are system-dependent measurement outcomes, arising universally in quantum interactions. Stable facts, conversely, emerge through decoherence processes, exhibiting classical robustness and enabling intersubjective agreement. This framework circumvents traditional no-go theorems by reframing the quantum-classical transition not as an ontological shift but as the dynamical stabilization of relative information. Consequently, decoherence is reinterpreted as selectively generating stable facts from the broader class of relative ones, without invoking wavefunction collapse. This approach clarifies the emergence of classical reality while maintaining a coherent, relational quantum formalism.
