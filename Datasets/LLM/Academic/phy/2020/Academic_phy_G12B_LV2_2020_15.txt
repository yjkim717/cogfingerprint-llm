**Abstract**

The pursuit of high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates the development of anode materials capable of accommodating significant lithium-ion intercalation while mitigating volumetric expansion-induced mechanical degradation. This work investigates γ-Lanthanum Corthophospho Oxide (γ-LCSVO, La<sub>x</sub>Sr<sub>1-x</sub>VO<sub>4</sub>) as a promising zero-strain anode candidate for next-generation LIBs. Unlike conventional anode materials exhibiting substantial volume changes during lithiation, γ-LCSVO possesses a unique crystal structure that inherently limits lattice distortion, approaching a state of zero-strain operation.  Through comprehensive electrochemical characterization, including galvanostatic cycling and cyclic voltammetry, we demonstrate that γ-LCSVO delivers exceptional cycling stability over extended durations, retaining a high capacity retention even after hundreds of cycles.  Specifically, [Insert a specific capacity value and cycle number - e.g., "85% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles at a current density of X mA/g"].  The observed stability is attributed to the material’s structural integrity, preventing pulverization and electrode cracking often associated with large volume fluctuations in other anode materials like silicon or tin oxide. Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy reveals a stable electrode/electrolyte interface, indicating robust lithium-ion transport kinetics. These findings suggest that γ-LCSVO represents a significant advancement in anode material design, offering a pathway toward LIBs with enhanced cycle life, improved safety, and potentially higher energy density by circumventing the limitations imposed by volume expansion. Future research will focus on optimizing the material’s electronic conductivity and exploring its performance in full-cell configurations.
