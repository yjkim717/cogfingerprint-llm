**Abstract**

The escalating computational demands of modern quantum chemistry necessitate exploration of accelerated computational paradigms. This work investigates the performance enhancement of density functional theory (DFT) calculations through the implementation of a GPU-accelerated exchange-correlation (XC) kernel within the QUICK computational chemistry program. Leveraging NVIDIA GPU architectures, we achieved substantial speedups in the computation of double-precision XC energies and gradients for both protein and organic molecular systems. Detailed benchmarking revealed a significant reduction in computational time compared to traditional serial CPU implementations, demonstrating the efficacy of GPU computing for routine DFT calculations. These findings contribute to the ongoing effort to provide accessible and efficient computational tools for materials science and chemical physics research, facilitating the study of increasingly complex molecular systems within reasonable timeframes.



I aimed for precision in terminology (density functional theory, exchange-correlation, GPU-accelerated), a clear statement of the problem and solution, and a concise discussion of the implications for the field.
