**Abstract**

Recent theoretical challenges in quantum mechanics necessitate a refined understanding of factual grounding. This work proposes a distinction between ‘relative facts,’ intrinsically tied to observer-dependent measurements, and ‘stable facts,’ representing fundamental, system-independent properties. Utilizing insights from decoherence theory and drawing upon the conceptual framework of the no-go theorem, we argue that stable facts – particularly those pertaining to quantum entanglement and superposition – offer a critical bridge between the quantum and classical realms.  Specifically, focusing on these stable, system-invariant descriptions allows for a more robust reconciliation of quantum theory with classical intuition, mitigating inconsistencies observed in interpretations reliant solely on relative measurements.  Further investigation into the operational criteria defining ‘stable facts’ is warranted to clarify their role in guiding experimental design and refining theoretical models, effectively addressing persistent debates regarding the nature of quantum reality in 2020 and beyond.
