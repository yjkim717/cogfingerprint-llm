"In this 2020 study, we investigate magnetically charged black holes within the Standard Model framework. Near the horizon, electroweak symmetry restoration is triggered, amplifying Hawking radiation. Consequently, massless fermions significantly contribute to the black hole's evaporation rate, yielding novel insights into the interplay between gravity, particle physics, and black hole thermodynamics."
