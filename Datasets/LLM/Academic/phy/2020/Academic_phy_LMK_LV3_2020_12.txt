"Accelerating Density Functional Theory Calculations with GPU-Enabled Exchange-Correlation Schemes"

Abstract:

This study presents a parallel implementation of density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the QUICK program, leveraging GPU acceleration to enhance computational efficiency. By integrating a GPU-enabled exchange-correlation scheme, we achieve significant speedup in DFT calculations, mitigating the computational bottleneck associated with traditional CPU-based architectures. Our results demonstrate a substantial reduction in computational time, facilitating the application of DFT to complex systems. This development marks a crucial step towards harnessing the potential of quantum computing and high-performance computing in materials science research, as of 2020.
