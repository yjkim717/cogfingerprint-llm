**Abstract**

The efficient computation of exchange-correlation (XC) energies and gradients remains a critical bottleneck in density functional theory (DFT) calculations, particularly for large molecular systems. This work presents a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of the QUICK DFT code, designed to overcome these limitations and facilitate rapid simulations. Leveraging the massively parallel architecture of modern GPUs, the optimized QUICK program demonstrates substantial speed enhancements in both XC energy and gradient evaluations. Specifically, we report a factor of 3-5 reduction in computational time compared to traditional CPU-based implementations for systems of up to 500 atoms. The parallelization strategy effectively distributes the computationally intensive matrix inversions inherent to DFT, significantly accelerating the overall simulation workflow. These findings highlight the potential of GPU computing to unlock the computational feasibility of DFT for increasingly complex molecular and protein studies, driving advancements across materials science and chemical physics research.
