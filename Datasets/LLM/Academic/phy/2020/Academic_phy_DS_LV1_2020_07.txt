**Abstract**

Within the framework of the post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion of general relativity, the interplay between conservative dynamics and dissipative radiation-reaction effects in the two-body problem remains a subject of intense investigation. This work demonstrates that the inclusion of the full gravitational wave tail-of-the-tails and non-linear memory contributions at the third PM order (O(G^3)) is essential for obtaining a finite, well-defined scattering angle in the high-energy (ultra-relativistic) limit. We show that these radiation-reaction processes precisely cancel the previously identified divergences in the conservative sector, yielding a result that is consistent with the analytic continuation of the corresponding quantum eikonal amplitude. This resolution of the high-energy behavior provides a robust, classical confirmation of the quantum amplitude's structure and establishes a unified picture of gravitational scattering that seamlessly connects the conservative and dissipative domains. Our findings underscore the critical role of radiation reaction in high-velocity encounters and validate the PM framework as a powerful tool for precision gravity.
