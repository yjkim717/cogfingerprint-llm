In the post-Minkowskian expansion of general relativity, the inclusion of radiation-reaction effects at third post-Minkowskian order (G^3) yields a critical correction to the conservative gravitational scattering angle. This correction resolves previously encountered high-energy divergences, ensuring a well-defined ultrarelativistic limit. The resulting scattering angle demonstrates remarkable consistency with predictions from the quantum eikonal phase, thereby establishing a novel bridge between classical general relativity and quantum gravity expectations. This 2020 finding underscores the essential role of dissipative effects in the two-body problem, advancing our understanding of the high-energy regime in gravitational dynamics and providing a robust classical benchmark for future quantum-gravitational calculations.
