**Abstract**

This study examines the stability characteristics of black resonators and geons within the context of global anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. Utilizing numerical simulations and analytical techniques, we demonstrate that black resonators are susceptible to superradiant instability, a phenomenon driven by the amplification of perturbations within their event horizons. Conversely, a significant portion of investigated geons – hypothetical compact objects possessing ergoregions – exhibit linear stability. This divergence in behavior suggests a crucial distinction in their dynamics.  The persistence of geons as long-lived states is postulated to be intrinsically linked to their role as robust building blocks in holographic dualities, particularly those mapping to strongly coupled gauge theories. Further investigation into the precise mechanisms governing this stability is warranted, promising insights into the nature of spacetime and quantum gravity.
