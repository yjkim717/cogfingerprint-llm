**Abstract**

Recent advancements in theoretical astrophysics have revived interest in Gauss–Bonnet gravity as a modification of Einstein’s general relativity. This study examines the influence of a novel metric parameter, α, on the emergent shadow morphology of rotating Gauss–Bonnet black holes, employing observational constraints derived from the M87* black hole event. Utilizing numerical simulations, we demonstrate a strong correlation between negative α values and the observed characteristics of the M87* black hole shadow, specifically its size and shape.  Our analysis reveals that incorporating negative α effectively mitigates discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical data.  These findings suggest that the Gauss–Bonnet theory, parameterized by α, offers a compelling alternative framework for describing extreme gravitational phenomena.  Furthermore, this research extends the scope of Gauss–Bonnet gravity, providing a tangible connection to observational cosmology and motivating further investigation into its potential role in black hole physics.
