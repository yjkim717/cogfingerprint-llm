**Abstract:**

Recent theoretical efforts to reconcile quantum theory with classical phenomenology have increasingly highlighted the conceptual challenge of establishing robust connections between the two realms. This work introduces the distinction between ‘relative facts’ – those dependent on specific measurement contexts – and ‘stable facts’ – possessing intrinsic, observer-independent validity. We argue that the latter represent a critical prerequisite for successfully bridging the quantum and classical divides. Specifically, the inherent indeterminacy of quantum mechanics, particularly as manifested through decoherence, generates a proliferation of relative facts. However, a consistent, macroscopic reality necessitates the existence of stable facts, providing a foundational framework for interpreting quantum measurements. Drawing upon considerations relevant to the no-go theorem, we posit that the absence of such stable factual grounding ultimately undermines the viability of many proposed interpretations, necessitating a renewed focus on identifying and characterizing these fundamental, observer-independent truths.
