**Abstract**

The nature of dark matter remains a fundamental unsolved problem in cosmology. Ultralight axions, hypothetical particles with exceedingly small masses, represent a compelling candidate. This work presents a novel analysis of Lyman-α forest data, leveraging its sensitivity to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect modulated by dark matter density fluctuations, to derive a tighter lower limit on the mass scale of ultralight axions. We demonstrate that current Lyman-α forest observations, particularly those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, impose a stringent constraint on the axion mass, effectively reducing the viable parameter space for this dark matter candidate.  Specifically, we find a lower bound of approximately [Insert plausible mass range, e.g., 10⁻¹³ to 10⁻¹⁰ eV], significantly narrowing the region where axion self-interaction cross-sections are consistent with observed structure formation and the axiverse hypothesis. This refined constraint offers valuable guidance for future axion detection experiments.
