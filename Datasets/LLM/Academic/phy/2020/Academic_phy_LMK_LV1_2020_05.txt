Title: Calibrating the Luminosity of Carbon-Rich Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars using Near-Infrared Photometry in the Magellanic Clouds

Abstract:
We present a calibration of the absolute magnitude of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars using near-infrared JK photometry in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC). By leveraging the precise distance moduli of these galaxies, we derive the luminosity function of carbon-rich AGB stars in the near-infrared regime. Our analysis is based on a sample of spectroscopically confirmed carbon stars in the LMC and SMC, for which we obtain JK photometry from archival data. We find that the absolute magnitude of carbon-rich AGB stars at K-band is strongly correlated with their (J-K) color, indicating a potential use as a standard candle for distance measurements. Our calibration provides a robust framework for estimating distances to galaxies in the Local Group and beyond, with implications for studies of galaxy evolution and cosmology. The results are consistent with theoretical models of AGB evolution and provide new insights into the properties of these luminous stars.
