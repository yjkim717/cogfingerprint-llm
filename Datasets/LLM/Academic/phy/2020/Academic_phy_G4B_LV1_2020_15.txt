**Abstract**

The inherent volume expansion and contraction during lithium intercalation/deintercalation represent a significant impediment to the longevity and performance of lithium-ion batteries. Addressing this challenge necessitates anode materials exhibiting minimal dimensional change. This work reports the synthesis and characterization of γ-LCSVO, a novel anode material predicated on a layered transition metal oxide structure, demonstrating a markedly reduced volume strain response during electrochemical cycling. Utilizing a controlled hydrothermal method, γ-LCSVO was fabricated and subjected to rigorous electrochemical testing within a lithium-ion battery cell utilizing a standard lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) electrolyte.

Results demonstrate a compelling correlation between the material’s structural characteristics and its performance. Specifically, γ-LCSVO exhibited exceptional cycle stability, retaining 92% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles at a current density of 1 mA/cm². Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy revealed a minimal increase in charge transfer resistance with cycling, indicative of improved interfacial stability.  These findings suggest that γ-LCSVO presents a viable pathway toward mitigating volume-related degradation in lithium-ion battery anodes. Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms driving its superior performance, including advanced microscopy and diffraction techniques, is warranted to fully elucidate its potential for next-generation energy storage devices.
