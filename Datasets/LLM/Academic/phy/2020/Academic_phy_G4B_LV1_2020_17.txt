**Abstract**

The increasing demand for integrated photonic circuits (PICs) necessitates strategies to mitigate crosstalk, a critical limitation on circuit density and performance. This study investigates a novel approach utilizing nonuniform subwavelength strip gratings to achieve substantial crosstalk reduction within integrated optical waveguides. Employing a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, we systematically designed and characterized the geometry of these strips, demonstrating a significant suppression of cross-talk phenomena. Specifically, the tailored strip profiles introduce localized scattering effects, effectively preventing modal coupling between adjacent waveguides. Simulation results, validated through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) modeling, indicate a reduction in crosstalk exceeding 30 dB at 1.55 Î¼m.  These findings highlight the potential of this technique to enable denser and more robust photonic integrated circuits, fostering advancements in applications such as high-speed optical communication and advanced sensing systems.  Further research will explore manufacturability and integration within complex PIC architectures.
