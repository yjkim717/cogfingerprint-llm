**Abstract**

We examine the linear stability of black resonators and geons within the context of global anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, employing perturbation theory to assess their susceptibility to superradiant instabilities. Our analysis focuses on scalar perturbations, specifically investigating the conditions under which these compact, black hole-like objects exhibit divergent growth.  We demonstrate that black resonators are demonstrably unstable, exhibiting a pronounced superradiant instability driven by the capture and amplification of scalar field modes. Conversely, a significant fraction of geon configurations – characterized by their topological defects – appear to possess a residual stability. This apparent stability arises from a delicate balance between the geon’s mass and the characteristic frequency of the scalar perturbations, suggesting a nuanced relationship between global AdS geometry and the dynamics of these exotic compact objects. Further investigation is warranted to fully characterize the stability landscape of geons and their potential role in holographic black hole physics.
