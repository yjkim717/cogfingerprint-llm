We demonstrate that dielectric metasurfaces can execute non-Hermitian transformations to monitor deviations from target polarizations. By leveraging this property, we propose a novel polarization detection framework, enhancing the sensitivity of polarization monitoring systems in 2020's photonics landscape.
