In 2020, the persistent challenge of inter-channel crosstalk in densely packed photonic integrated circuits (PICs) necessitated innovative solutions for signal integrity. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing nonuniform subwavelength silicon strips, whose geometries are deterministically optimized via a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The PSO algorithm efficiently navigates the complex parameter space to tailor the strips' effective refractive index profile, thereby inducing a controlled phase mismatch between adjacent waveguides. Our experimental and simulation results demonstrate that this configuration substantially enhances crosstalk reduction by increasing the inter-waveguide coupling length by over two orders of magnitude compared to conventional designs. This breakthrough in integrated optical waveguides paves the way for higher-density, more reliable PICs, directly addressing the scalability demands of next-generation optical computing and communication systems.
