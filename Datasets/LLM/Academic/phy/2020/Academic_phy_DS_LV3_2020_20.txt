**A Lorentz-Invariant S-Matrix for Electric-Magnetic Scattering**

**Abstract**

The theoretical description of scattering processes involving both electric and magnetic charges has long been hindered by the inherent limitations of conventional Lagrangian formulations, which struggle to maintain manifest Lorentz and gauge invariance simultaneously in the presence of Dirac monopoles. This paper circumvents these foundational obstacles by introducing a novel, first-principles S-matrix framework for electric-magnetic scattering that is explicitly Lorentz-invariant from its inception. Our approach is built upon the pivotal concept of *pairwise helicity*, a quantum number that generalizes the standard notion of helicity to account for the unique angular momentum carried by the electromagnetic fields of relativistically moving charge-monopole pairs. By integrating this construct with the powerful machinery of *on-shell methods* and *spinor-helicity variables*, we formulate scattering amplitudes that are independent of any off-shell data or intermediary field definitions. This methodology allows for the direct construction of gauge-invariant observables, ensuring that the fundamental principles of quantum field theory are upheld throughout. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework by computing non-trivial scattering amplitudes for processes involving spin-0 and spin-1/2 dyons, recovering known semi-classical results in appropriate limits and predicting new, finite higher-loop contributions. The formalism naturally incorporates the topological intricacies of the charge-monopole system, such as the Dirac quantization condition, as inherent properties of the amplitude's analytic structure. This work establishes a robust, computationally tractable foundation for a modern bootstrap program aimed at determining the exact S-matrix for theories with fundamental magnetic charges, opening a new pathway for exploring strong-weak coupling duality directly at the amplitude level.
