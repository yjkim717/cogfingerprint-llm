**Abstract:**

Recent developments in effective field theory (EFT) calculations for high-energy particle physics necessitate robust methods for constraining scattering amplitudes. This work introduces the ‘EFT-hedron,’ a geometrically defined structure providing a novel framework for imposing constraints on four-particle scattering amplitudes within a given EFT expansion. The EFT-hedron’s construction leverages principles of causality and unitarity, explicitly mapping out the permissible region of amplitude space.  We demonstrate that this geometric representation yields a set of inequalities, rigorously limiting the contributions of higher-dimensional operators and ensuring consistency with known experimental data.  These constraints are particularly valuable in scenarios where precise renormalization group flow is computationally prohibitive.  Further investigation into the EFT-hedron’s properties promises to refine EFT analysis and offer new insights into the underlying dynamics governing scattering processes, particularly as we approach the energy scales of potential new physics.
