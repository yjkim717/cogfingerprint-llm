"In a 2020 study, we investigated the linear mode stability of black resonators and geons under various perturbations. Our analysis revealed that black resonators exhibit superradiant instability due to the presence of an ergoregion, leading to amplified perturbations. In contrast, geons demonstrated conditional stability, contingent upon specific boundary conditions. The findings underscore the distinct stability properties of these gravitational entities, shedding light on the intricate dynamics governing their behavior. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between superradiant instability and ergoregion physics in black resonators and geons."
