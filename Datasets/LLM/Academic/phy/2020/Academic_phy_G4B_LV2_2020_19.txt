**Abstract**

This study investigates the application of dielectric metasurfaces for enhanced polarization sensitivity. Utilizing non-hermitian transformation optics, we engineered a metasurface architecture capable of dynamically controlling light polarization. Specifically, the fabricated device enables precise monitoring of polarization deviations, facilitating rapid and accurate vertical-to-horizontal ratio (V/H) detection.  Crucially, our approach achieves single-shot detection, eliminating the need for sequential measurements. These findings represent a significant advancement in metasurface technology, offering a compact and efficient route toward sophisticated polarization control and sensing. Experimental results demonstrate the deviceâ€™s performance, validating its potential for applications in advanced optical communication and imaging.
