**Abstract**

The increasing density of optical components within photonic integrated circuits (PICs) necessitates improved crosstalk management to maintain signal integrity and device performance. This work presents a novel design methodology for mitigating inter-waveguide crosstalk in silicon-based PICs, leveraging the unique properties of nonuniform subwavelength grating structures. Specifically, we demonstrate the efficacy of employing spatially varying silicon strip widths, implemented via subwavelength patterning, to enhance the effective coupling length between adjacent optical waveguides. To optimize the grating profiles, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is implemented, enabling efficient exploration of the design space and yielding substantial improvements over conventional uniform strip designs. Experimental validation, conducted in 2020, confirms a significant reduction in crosstalk power and a concurrent increase in coupling length, demonstrating the potential of this approach for high-density PIC architectures. These findings contribute to the advancement of compact, high-performance photonic devices critical for applications in optical communications and integrated sensing platforms.
