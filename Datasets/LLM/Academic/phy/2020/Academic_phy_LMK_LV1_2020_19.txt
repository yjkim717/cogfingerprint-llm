In 2020, a novel dielectric metasurface platform was proposed to facilitate single-shot polarization monitoring. By harnessing non-Hermitian transformations, these metasurfaces enable sensitive detection of deviations from target elliptical polarizations, thereby advancing the field of polarization metrology and paving the way for compact, high-precision optical characterization tools.
