In this study, we investigate the linear stability of asymptotically anti–de Sitter black resonators and geons within the framework of Einstein–Klein–Gordon theory in four dimensions. Through numerical analysis of linear perturbations, we demonstrate that black resonators exhibit a superradiant instability driven by their ergoregion, leading to exponential growth of certain field modes. This instability arises due to the negative energy states associated with the ergoregion, which facilitate energy extraction from the rotating spacetime. In contrast, geonic solutions—solitonic objects without horizons—are found to be linearly stable against such perturbations for a broad range of parameter space. The absence of an event horizon in geons precludes superradiant amplification, allowing them to persist as long-lived, coherent structures. These results, obtained in 2020, highlight a fundamental dynamical distinction between horizon–bearing and horizon–free solutions in gravitational theories and suggest that geons may serve as stable, non–linear gravitational wavepackets, with implications for the AdS/CFT correspondence and the stability of spacetime geometries.
