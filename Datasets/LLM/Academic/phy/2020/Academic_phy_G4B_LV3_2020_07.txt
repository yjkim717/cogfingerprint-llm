“Recent advancements in post-Minkowskian calculations of gravitational scattering necessitate a refined understanding of radiation reaction effects. This work presents a rigorous analysis demonstrating that incorporating radiation reaction during the scattering of two point masses fundamentally alters the resulting scattering angle. Specifically, our post-Minkowskian treatment, utilizing a perturbative approach, corrects a previously established third-post-Minkowskian approximation.  Crucially, these results exhibit strong qualitative agreement with eikonal-phase quantum calculations, highlighting the importance of relativistic corrections within the framework of general relativity.  Further investigation into the implications of this modification promises to enhance the predictive power of gravitational wave phenomenology.”
