In magnetically charged black hole solutions within the Standard Model, electroweak symmetry is restored in the near-horizon region. This symmetry restoration enables the prolific production of massless fermions, which dominate the Hawking radiation spectrum. Consequently, the black hole evaporation rate is significantly amplified compared to scenarios without such topological defects. This 2020 theoretical framework suggests observable astrophysical signatures and profound implications for early universe cosmology and beyond-Standard Model physics.
