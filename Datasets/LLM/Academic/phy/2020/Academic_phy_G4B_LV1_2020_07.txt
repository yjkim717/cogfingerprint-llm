**Abstract**

The inherent radiative contribution to gravitational interactions presents a significant challenge to classical post-Minkowskian approximations of scattering phenomena. This work investigates the perturbative modification of gravitational scattering angles due to the inclusion of radiation-reaction effects, specifically examining the emergence of a third-order post-Minkowskian term. Utilizing a novel perturbative expansion, we demonstrate that the standard Newtonian treatment fails to capture the subtle angular shift introduced by the recoil momentum imparted to the scattering body via photon emission.  Our analysis reveals a logarithmic divergence within this higher-order term, indicative of the limitations of perturbative expansions in accurately describing strong-field gravitational dynamics.  These findings underscore the necessity of incorporating non-perturbative techniques to fully characterize the radiative influence on scattering processes and highlight the potential for significant deviations from classical predictions.
