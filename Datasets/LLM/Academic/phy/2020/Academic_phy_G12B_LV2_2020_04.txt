## Abstract: Dimensional Reduction of Baby Universe Hilbert Spaces in Quantum Gravity

The persistent challenge of reconciling wormhole geometries with holographic principles within a framework of quantum gravity motivates a re-examination of baby universe Hilbert spaces. This paper investigates the implications of a consistent quantum gravity theory for the structure of these spaces, positing a fundamental dimensionality reduction to one dimension. We argue that this simplification arises naturally from considerations of gauge redundancy and the inherent constraints imposed by holographic duality. Specifically, the conventional multi-dimensional Hilbert space associated with baby universes, which has historically led to inconsistencies concerning spacetime topology and causality, is shown to be an artifact of incomplete gauge fixing. By adopting a refined gauge-invariant perspective, we demonstrate that the effective degrees of freedom are dramatically constrained, necessitating a one-dimensional Hilbert space representation. This resolution mitigates tensions between wormhole dynamics and the holographic principle, offering a potential pathway towards a more consistent description of quantum spacetime. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of this dimensionality reduction for the emergence of spacetime and the nature of quantum fluctuations in swampland conditions.
