"We constrain the mass of ultralight axion dark matter using Lyman-alpha forest data, leveraging the sensitivity of cosmic structure to dark matter properties. Our analysis, based on high-resolution spectra, sets a lower bound on the axion mass, $m_a \geq 2 \times 10^{-21}$ eV at 95% confidence, refining the cold dark matter paradigm and informing models of axionic dark matter.
