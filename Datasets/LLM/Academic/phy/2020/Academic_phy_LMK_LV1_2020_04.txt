Title: Constraints on Baby Universe Hilbert Spaces from Holographic Principles

Abstract:
Recent advances in quantum gravity have underscored the significance of Euclidean wormholes and holography in understanding the swampland of effective field theories. We investigate the implications of these developments on the structure of baby universe Hilbert spaces. Employing the holographic principle, we derive a stringent constraint on the dimensionality of the Hilbert space of baby universe states. Our analysis reveals that consistency with quantum gravity necessitates a one-dimensional Hilbert space for baby universes. This result stems from the observation that higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces would induce unphysical correlations between observables in disjoint regions of spacetime, contravening the holographic principle. Our findings are consistent with the swampland conjectures, suggesting that a vast class of effective field theories are incompatible with a consistent theory of quantum gravity. The implications of this result for our understanding of the gravitational path integral and the role of Euclidean wormholes are discussed.
