"In 2020, the longstanding dichotomy between quantum theory and classical reality was addressed through the introduction of relative and stable facts. By integrating decoherence into the ontological framework, this novel approach reconciles the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics with the determinism of classical observations, thereby resolving longstanding inconsistencies and experimental paradoxes, and providing a more coherent understanding of the transition from quantum to classical facts."
