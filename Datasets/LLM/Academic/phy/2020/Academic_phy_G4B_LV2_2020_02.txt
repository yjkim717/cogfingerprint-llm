**Abstract:**

Recent developments in effective field theory (EFT) have highlighted the critical role of unitarity and causality in shaping observable low-energy physics. This work introduces the ‘EFT-hedron,’ a novel geometric framework elucidating the constraints imposed upon four-particle scattering amplitudes within an EFT. Derived from the requirement of unitary scattering and adherence to the principle of causality – specifically, that future times cannot influence past times – the EFT-hedron represents a hypersurface in a higher-dimensional space.  Each point on this hypersurface corresponds to a unique, valid set of EFT amplitudes, dictated by the inclusion of increasingly higher-dimensional operators.  The EFT-hedron provides a tangible visualization of the renormalization group flow and offers a potentially powerful tool for systematically exploring the structure of EFTs and predicting scattering observables, particularly in scenarios demanding rigorous adherence to fundamental quantum constraints.  Further investigation into the topological properties of the EFT-hedron is warranted.
