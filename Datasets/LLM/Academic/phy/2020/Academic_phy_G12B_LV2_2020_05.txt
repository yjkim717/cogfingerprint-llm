**Abstract**

Accurate distance measurements to nearby galaxies are fundamental for calibrating the cosmic distance ladder and constraining cosmological parameters. This work presents a novel method for determining galactic distances utilizing the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar population, specifically employing C-AGB stars observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as a benchmark. Leveraging high-precision *J*-band photometry, we establish a robust relationship between the observed C-AGB luminosity and the inferred distance modulus. The methodâ€™s efficacy is demonstrated by applying it to NGC 253, a galaxy previously well-characterized through its red giant branch (RGB) tip luminosity. Our results reveal a strong consistency between the distance modulus derived using the C-AGB luminosity calibration and that obtained from established TRGB distance indicators. This finding validates the C-AGB method as a promising, independent distance indicator, particularly valuable in environments where RGB stars are obscured or difficult to identify. Further refinement and application to a wider sample of galaxies are planned to improve the precision and reliability of this technique for extragalactic distance measurements, contributing to ongoing efforts to resolve discrepancies in the Hubble constant.
