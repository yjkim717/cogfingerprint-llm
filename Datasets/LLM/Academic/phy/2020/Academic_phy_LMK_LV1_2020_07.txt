"In the post-Minkowskian framework, we investigate the impact of radiation-reaction on the gravitational scattering of two point masses. Employing a perturbative approach to general relativity, we derive the correction to the conservative scattering angle due to gravitational wave emission. Our results indicate a significant modification to the scattering angle at high energies, demonstrating the importance of radiation-reaction effects in the strong-field regime, as observed in 2020 gravitational wave detections."
