This study investigates classical radiation reaction effects in the scattering of two point masses, employing a post-Minkowskian approximation to general relativity. Our analysis reveals a $G^3$-order correction to the scattering angle, demonstrating a novel high-energy logarithmic divergence. This divergence, previously unaccounted for in classical calculations, presents a significant departure from established post-Newtonian results. Notably, the observed behavior is consistent with theoretical predictions derived from quantum eikonal phases, suggesting a potential bridge between classical and quantum gravitational phenomena in scattering processes. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of gravitational wave emission and its impact on classical dynamics.
