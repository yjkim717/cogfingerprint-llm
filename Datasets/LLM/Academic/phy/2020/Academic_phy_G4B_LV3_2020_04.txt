**Abstract**

Recent developments in quantum gravity necessitate novel approaches to understanding spacetime and black hole thermodynamics. This work proposes a revised holographic framework predicated on ‘swampland conditions’ – specifically, the restriction of baby universe states to a one-dimensional Hilbert space.  We introduce a novel concept, tentatively termed ‘Gauss’s law for entropy,’ derived from this constrained state space, offering a potential reconciliation between previously disparate wormhole geometries and holographic interpretations of black hole entropy.  Crucially, this model acknowledges inherent limitations; exceptions to the one-dimensional constraint are hypothesized in lower spatial dimensions, and the prevailing ensemble-based holographic theories are considered incomplete representations of reality.  Furthermore, the argument underscores the potential for a fundamentally discrete structure underlying spacetime at the Planck scale.  The proposed holographic dictionary, built upon this constrained Hilbert space, provides a framework for quantifying information flow across holographic boundaries.  Further research will focus on elucidating the precise mapping between this reduced state space and observable gravitational phenomena, with the aim of resolving outstanding tensions within current quantum gravity theories.
