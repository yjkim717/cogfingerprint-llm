Title: Asymptotic Structure and Hamiltonian Formalism of Rarita-Schwinger Theory: A Supersymmetric Perspective

Abstract:

In this study, we investigate the asymptotic structure of the Rarita-Schwinger theory, a theoretical framework describing the dynamics of spin-3/2 fields. By employing the Hamiltonian formalism, we reveal the presence of infinite-dimensional fermionic symmetries, which play a crucial role in shaping the theory's asymptotic behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that these symmetries are associated with the canonical realization of the super-Poincaré algebra, a fundamental concept in supersymmetric theories.

Within the context of the Rarita-Schwinger theory, we derive the asymptotic form of the fermionic generators, which are shown to satisfy the super-Poincaré algebra. This result is achieved by carefully examining the theory's constraints and applying the Dirac bracket formalism to obtain a consistent Hamiltonian formulation. The supersymmetric multiplets are constructed, and their transformation properties under the super-Poincaré algebra are analyzed.

Our findings indicate that the Rarita-Schwinger theory exhibits a rich asymptotic structure, characterized by an infinite-dimensional fermionic symmetry group. This symmetry is shown to be intimately connected with the theory's supersymmetric properties, providing a deeper understanding of the interplay between supersymmetry and the asymptotic behavior of spin-3/2 fields. The results presented in this study contribute to the ongoing efforts to elucidate the properties of supersymmetric theories and their potential applications in modern physics.

By shedding light on the asymptotic structure and Hamiltonian formalism of the Rarita-Schwinger theory, this research provides new insights into the theoretical foundations of supersymmetric models, with implications for our understanding of the behavior of particles with spin-3/2 in various physical contexts.
