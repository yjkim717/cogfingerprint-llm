**Abstract**

The study of black hole shadows offers a compelling avenue for testing general relativistic theories and probing the nature of spacetime singularities. This work examines the influence of a novel metric parameter – introduced to modify the Gauss-Bonnet gravity framework – on the emergent shadow morphology of rotating black holes. Specifically, we compare the shadow profiles generated by these modified Gauss-Bonnet black holes to those predicted by the standard Kerr metric, utilizing numerical relativity simulations. 

Our analysis reveals significant deviations in the shadow’s shape and size, particularly in the outer regions, attributable to the metric parameter’s effect on the spacetime geometry. These alterations demonstrate a sensitivity of the black hole shadow to deviations from the Kerr solution, highlighting the potential for observational constraints to differentiate between various modified gravity theories. 

Furthermore, the results are presented in the context of the ongoing M87* Event Horizon Telescope observations, providing a framework for interpreting potential discrepancies.  We conclude by advocating for continued investigation into the role of metric parameters within Gauss-Bonnet gravity and its implications for characterizing black hole shadows, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of strong-field gravity.
