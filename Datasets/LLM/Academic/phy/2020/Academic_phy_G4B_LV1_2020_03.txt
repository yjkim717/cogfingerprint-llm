**Abstract**

We investigate the dynamics of magnetically charged black holes, focusing on the potential for electroweak symmetry restoration within the near horizon region. Utilizing a modified Einstein-Maxwell theory, we demonstrate that the presence of a magnetic charge induces a non-trivial vacuum expectation value, leading to the spontaneous breaking of the electroweak symmetry.  This symmetry breaking is coupled to the emergence of massless fermions at the horizon, acting as a consequence of gauge field condensation. Furthermore, we explore the implications for Hawking radiation, hypothesizing that these newly generated fermions could significantly enhance the emitted thermal spectrum, potentially altering the black hole’s radiative behavior and offering a novel avenue for probing quantum gravity effects.
