We establish a novel geometric formulation of constraints on effective field theories (EFTs) from fundamental principles of causality and unitarity. By mapping the space of Wilson coefficients for higher-dimension operators to a convex geometry—dubbed the EFT-hedron—we derive rigorous bounds on low-energy scattering amplitudes. This positive geometry emerges directly from the analytic and crossing properties of amplitudes, encoding all permissible EFTs consistent with ultraviolet completeness. Our approach provides a systematic, non-perturbative framework for bounding operator coefficients, transcending traditional perturbative methods. The EFT-hedron thus serves as a fundamental scaffold for classifying consistent EFTs and sharpening the search for new physics within the landscape of quantum field theories.
