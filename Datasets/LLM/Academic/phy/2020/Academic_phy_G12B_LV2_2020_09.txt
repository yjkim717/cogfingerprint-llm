**Abstract**

The nature of dark matter remains a central unsolved problem in cosmology. Ultralight axions, scalar field dark matter candidates with masses in the μeV to meV range, offer a compelling solution, with their predicted quantum behavior potentially impacting the formation of cosmic structure. This work investigates the constraints imposed by the Lyman-α forest, a probe of the intergalactic medium’s transmitted flux at high redshift, on the parameter space of ultralight axion dark matter models. Utilizing high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations incorporating the axion condensate’s predicted density perturbations, we analyze the resulting impact on the Lyman-α forest power spectrum. Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant tension between existing Lyman-α forest observations and axion models with masses between 10<sup>-24</sup> eV and 10<sup>-22</sup> eV. Specifically, we establish a lower mass limit of approximately 10<sup>-24</sup> eV for axion dark matter consistent with current Lyman-α data, effectively disfavoring a previously considered mass window frequently invoked in other astrophysical contexts. This constraint significantly narrows the viable parameter space for these models and highlights the power of Lyman-α forest observations in probing the non-baryonic dark matter component.
