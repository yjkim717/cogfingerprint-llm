**Abstract**

Accurate simulation of electrocatalytic processes necessitates bridging the gap between computationally tractable models and fundamental quantum mechanical descriptions. This work presents a novel methodology integrating a reactive force field (ReFF) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to facilitate large-scale solvent simulations within the context of electrocatalysis. Employing the ReFF allows for the efficient representation of electronic structure and reaction energetics, while DFT provides the requisite quantum chemical precision.  We demonstrate the application of this combined approach, termed ‘rexpon,’ to investigate mechanistic details of a model electrochemical reaction.  Solvent effects, traditionally challenging to capture with purely quantum mechanical methods, are now accessible through ReFF-guided solvent simulations.  The resultant data offers enhanced predictive capability for catalyst design and optimization, representing a significant advance in understanding complex interfacial phenomena in electrocatalytic systems. Future work will focus on validating this approach against experimental observations.
