"This work presents a novel approach to ultrafast polarization control leveraging the unique properties of dielectric metasurfaces. We demonstrate, experimentally, the ability to manipulate the temporal evolution of the polarization state within a single, broadband near-infrared femtosecond pulse. Employing a carefully designed dielectric metasurface, we achieve reshaping of the pulse's polarization with large bandwidth, enabling unprecedented temporal control. This technique offers a pathway towards advanced ultrafast optics applications, including high-precision pulse shaping and nonlinear microscopy, and represents a significant advancement in manipulating light-matter interactions at ultrafast timescales."
