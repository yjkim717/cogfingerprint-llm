**Abstract**

This work investigates the novel dynamics of magnetically charged black holes, examining the potential for electroweak symmetry restoration within their near-horizon region. Utilizing theoretical frameworks incorporating massless fermions, we propose that the magnetic charge induces significant alterations to the black holeâ€™s spacetime geometry, leading to macroscopic effects and a concomitant enhancement of Hawking radiation. Specifically, we hypothesize that the interplay between magnetic fields and the Higgs mechanism results in a non-trivial phase transition near the event horizon, fundamentally modifying the emitted thermal spectrum.  These findings suggest a previously unexplored avenue for understanding black hole thermodynamics and offer a compelling link between strong gravitational phenomena and the fundamental symmetries governing particle physics, a subject of ongoing investigation in 2020.
