**Abstract**

Accurate distance measurements are paramount for understanding the extragalactic stellar population and cosmological distances. This research presents a novel approach to determining the distance to the dwarf galaxy NGC 253, leveraging J-band photometric observations of carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (C-AGB) stars within the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC).  We employed a rigorous calibration of absolute magnitude for C-AGB stars, relying solely on J-band photometry to mitigate the uncertainties inherent in traditional distance moduli derived from broader spectral ranges.  The observed J-band luminosities of these evolved stars, characterized by their distinct spectral signatures, were meticulously compared to established evolutionary models. The resultant magnitude calibrations provide a robust independent constraint on the distances to the LMC and SMC.  Consequently, a refined distance modulus for NGC 253 was derived, offering a valuable benchmark for future distance measurements utilizing independent methods.  These findings contribute to a more precise assessment of the Local Group’s structure and overall galactic dynamics, particularly concerning the relationship between dwarf galaxies and the Milky Way.
