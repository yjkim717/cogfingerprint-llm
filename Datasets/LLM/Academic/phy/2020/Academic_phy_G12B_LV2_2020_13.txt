**Abstract**

The fundamental energetic cost of quantum computation remains a critical area of investigation, particularly concerning the interplay between information processing and thermodynamics. This work presents an experimental exploration of the energetic consequences associated with the implementation of a two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, a cornerstone operation in universal quantum circuits. We directly measure both energy and entropy fluctuations arising during gate execution within a superconducting qubit system, providing a novel empirical link between quantum logic and thermodynamic behavior. Our results demonstrate a quantifiable energetic overhead beyond the theoretical minimum predicted by Landauer's principle, attributable to the non-ideal nature of the control pulses and qubit decoherence. Furthermore, analysis of the observed fluctuations reveals a correlation between the magnitude of entropy generation and the fidelity of the gate operation. This investigation contributes to a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic limits of quantum computation and highlights the need for improved control techniques to minimize energy dissipation and enhance the efficiency of quantum processors.
