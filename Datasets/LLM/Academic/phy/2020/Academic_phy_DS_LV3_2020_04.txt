In the context of resolving long-standing tensions between Euclidean wormhole contributions and holographic principles, this work demonstrates that the Hilbert space of baby universe states must be one-dimensional in any consistent theory of quantum gravity. This conclusion is rigorously derived from fundamental Swampland conditions, which serve to delineate effective field theories that can be consistently coupled to quantum gravity from those that cannot. The analysis reveals that a non-trivial baby universe state space is incompatible with these conditions, thereby obviating the perceived necessity for an ensemble of theories to reconcile semiclassical gravitational path integrals with a unitary holographic description. This result provides a non-perturbative constraint on the architecture of quantum gravity, strongly suggesting that the resolution to the factorization problem lies not in averaging over an ensemble but in the intrinsic consistency requirements of a single, underlying quantum theory. Consequently, the framework solidifies the connection between holography and the Swampland program, offering a unified perspective on non-perturbative quantum gravitational phenomena.
