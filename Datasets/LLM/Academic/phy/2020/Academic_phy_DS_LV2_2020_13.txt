We experimentally investigate energy and entropy fluctuations in a two-qubit quantum logic gate, establishing their fundamental connection to gate fidelity and thermodynamic irreversibility. Our measurements directly validate Landauer's principle at the quantum scale, demonstrating that irreversible logical operations incur a minimal entropy cost. These results provide a thermodynamic framework for assessing quantum gate performance, highlighting how intrinsic fluctuations impose fundamental limits on the energetic efficiency of quantum information processing. This work bridges quantum thermodynamics with practical quantum computing benchmarks.
