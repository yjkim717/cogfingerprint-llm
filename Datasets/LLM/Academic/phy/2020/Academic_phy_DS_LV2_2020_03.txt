This study investigates magnetically charged black holes exhibiting electroweak symmetry restoration in near-horizon regions. We demonstrate that fermion interactions significantly amplify Hawking radiation emission rates. Through analytical modeling of magnetic field line configurations within the Standard Model framework, we quantify enhanced radiation spectra and discuss observational implications for primordial black hole signatures. Our results indicate modified decay channels that could inform future gravitational wave and particle astrophysics observations.
