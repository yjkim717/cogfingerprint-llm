Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, aiming for precision, structured reasoning, and appropriate terminology for a physics audience, consistent with a 2020 publication timeframe, based on the provided summary.  I've aimed for approximately 178 words.  Following the abstract, I'll include notes on the choices I made and potential areas for refinement if you have more details about the original paper.

**Abstract**

The persistent conceptual tension between the fundamentally relational nature of quantum theory and the seemingly objective existence of classical facts presents a longstanding challenge in foundational physics. This work investigates the emergence of *stable facts* – those robust and observer-independent properties characteristic of classical systems – from the underlying *relative facts* described by quantum mechanics. We demonstrate a formal framework wherein decoherence, typically understood as a mechanism for suppressing interference, plays a crucial role not merely in apparent classicality, but in the ontological grounding of stable facts.  Specifically, we address potential inconsistencies arising from interpretations of quantum measurement and circumvent limitations imposed by certain no-go theorems concerning the relational nature of quantum states. Our analysis reveals that the stability of facts is not intrinsic to quantum mechanics *per se*, but emerges as a consequence of specific environmental interactions and the resulting coarse-graining of quantum information. These findings offer a refined understanding of the connection between quantum dynamics and the classical world, contributing to a more consistent and physically grounded interpretation of decoherence within the broader context of quantum theory.

**Notes on Choices and Potential Refinements:**

*   **Terminology:** I used terms like "ontological grounding," "coarse-graining," and "no-go theorems" to signal a level of sophistication expected in a physics abstract.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: problem statement, proposed approach, key findings, and concluding significance.
*   **Emphasis on Decoherence's Role:** The abstract highlights decoherence's importance beyond just suppression of interference, aligning with the summary's claim of clarification.
*   **Addressing Inconsistencies/No-Go Theorems:** Mentioning this directly strengthens the abstract’s claim of resolving theoretical issues.
*   **Year Context (2020):**  The language and framing are consistent with the type of discussions and approaches prevalent in physics around 2020, focusing on foundational questions and interpretations.
*   **Potential Refinements (If you have more information):**
    *   **Specificity of No-Go Theorems:** If the paper addresses a *particular* no-go theorem, naming it would significantly strengthen the abstract.
    *   **Mathematical Framework:** If the paper introduces a novel mathematical formalism, briefly mentioning it would be beneficial.
    *   **Specific Environmental Interactions:** Describing the *type* of environmental interactions considered (e.g., Markovian, non-Markovian) would add detail.
    *   **Definition of "Relative Facts" & "Stable Facts":** While I've used them, briefly defining these terms within the abstract would improve clarity if they are central to the paper's innovation.



To help me refine this further, could you tell me:

1.  Does the paper focus on a specific type of quantum system or measurement scenario?
2.  Are there any key mathematical tools or formalisms used?
3.  Can you elaborate
