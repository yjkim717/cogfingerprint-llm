Title: Superradiant Instability and Stability Analysis of Black Resonators and Geons in Global AdS

Abstract:
We investigate the stability properties of black resonators and geons in global Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime under various perturbations. Our analysis reveals that black resonators are susceptible to superradiant instability due to the presence of an ergoregion, which enables the extraction of energy from the rotating black hole. In contrast, geons, being horizonless and asymptotically AdS, exhibit conditional stability under certain perturbation modes. By employing a perturbative approach, we demonstrate that the stability of geons is contingent upon the satisfaction of specific boundary conditions at the AdS boundary. Our findings highlight the distinct stability characteristics of these two classes of spacetimes, shedding light on the intricate interplay between superradiance and ergoregion physics in global AdS. The results have significant implications for our understanding of gravitational physics in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. (2020)
