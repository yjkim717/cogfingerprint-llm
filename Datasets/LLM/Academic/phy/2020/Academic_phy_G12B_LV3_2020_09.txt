**Abstract**

Recent constraints on axion dark matter models have intensified, particularly concerning the ultralight axion (ULA) paradigm. Utilizing a novel analysis of the Lyman-α forest data, we report a substantially improved lower bound on the axion mass, exceeding 2×10<sup>-20</sup> eV. This result places significant tension on previously favored ULA mass ranges, those frequently proposed within string axiverse frameworks. Our findings demonstrate a robust sensitivity of cosmic structure to ULA dark matter properties, effectively limiting the parameter space for this compelling dark matter candidate. These observations necessitate a re-evaluation of theoretical models and motivate further investigation into alternative dark matter scenarios.
