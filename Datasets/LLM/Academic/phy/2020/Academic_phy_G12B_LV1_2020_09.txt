Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a physics publication, and reflecting a 2020 context.  I've aimed for precision and a logical structure.  Following the abstract, I've included a few notes on choices made and potential areas for expansion if more detail were available.

**Constraining Ultralight Axion Dark Matter through Lyman-α Forest Observations and Hydrodynamical Refinement**

Abstract:

The nature of dark matter remains a fundamental open question in cosmology. Ultralight axions (m ~ 10<sup>-22</sup> – 10<sup>-16</sup> eV) represent a compelling dark matter candidate, predicted by extensions to the Standard Model. These axions, if sufficiently light, can form a classical condensate exhibiting a wave-like behavior, leading to observable imprints on the cosmic structure. We present a refined constraint on the mass of ultralight axion dark matter (aDM) utilizing recent, high-resolution quasar absorption spectra from the Lyman-α forest.  Our analysis incorporates updated hydrodynamical simulations of structure formation, accounting for baryonic feedback processes (e.g., active galactic nuclei) that can significantly alter the small-scale power spectrum.  Previous analyses, neglecting these baryonic effects, suggested a mass window for aDM consistent with observations. However, our improved simulations demonstrate that baryonic suppression preferentially attenuates the expected Lyman-α forest signal at lower redshifts, leading to a stronger upper bound on the axion mass. Specifically, we disfavor axion masses below ~10<sup>-21</sup> eV at a 95% confidence level, significantly tightening existing constraints and impacting theoretical model building for axion aDM.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Expansion:**

*   **Specific Mass Range:** I’ve included a typical mass range for ultralight axions (10<sup>-22</sup> – 10<sup>-16</sup> eV) to provide context.
*   **Baryonic Feedback:**  Highlighting baryonic feedback as a critical factor is key to reflecting the advancement implied by the summary. I’ve mentioned AGN feedback as an example.
*   **Power Spectrum:** Referencing the "small-scale power spectrum" is standard terminology in this field.
*   **Confidence Level:** Including a confidence level (95%) adds rigor.
*   **Theoretical Implications:**  Mentioning the implications for "theoretical model building" positions the work within the broader research landscape.
*   **Future Directions (if more information was available):**  If the original paper discussed *how* the simulations were improved, that could be mentioned briefly (e.g., "through improved subgrid models for star formation"). If the paper explored specific theoretical models affected by the constraint, those could be named.  The specific quasar surveys used (e.g., SDSS, DESI) could also be added.
