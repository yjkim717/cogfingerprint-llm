>Okay, here's a formal academic abstract, written in the style of a physics researcher, based on your provided summary and the specified context (2020). I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and appropriate terminology.  I've also included a few potential avenues for expansion, indicated by bracketed notes at the end, should you want to refine it further.

**Abstract:**

The long-standing theoretical challenge of black hole evaporation, as predicted by Hawkingâ€™s semi-classical calculations, remains a critical testbed for quantum gravity theories. This work explores the implications of loop quantum gravity (LQG) for the late-time evolution of black holes and the fate of their singularities. We challenge conventional interpretations of both the event horizon and the singularity within the framework of LQG, arguing that the inherent non-singular nature of the theory fundamentally alters the evaporation process. Specifically, we investigate how the granular structure of spacetime, predicted by LQG, modifies the near-horizon geometry, potentially preventing the formation of a true singularity and the associated runaway production of Hawking radiation. Our analysis suggests that the event horizon, rather than representing a sharp boundary, may transition into a region of extreme spacetime curvature but ultimately avoids the infinite density characteristic of classical general relativity. This perspective implies a modified evaporation scenario, wherein the black hole's mass is released over a protracted timescale via a process intrinsically tied to quantum gravitational effects. Further investigation into the backreaction of this modified radiation on the evolving spacetime is warranted.

[Potential expansions: Could add a sentence mentioning specific LQG techniques used (e.g., spin networks, loop variables). Could briefly mention the connection to the information paradox. Could specify the type of black hole considered (e.g., Schwarzschild, Kerr).]
