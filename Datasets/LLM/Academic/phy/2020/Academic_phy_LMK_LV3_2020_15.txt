"Investigating Novel Zero-Strain Anode Materials for Enhanced Lithium-Ion Batteries"

Abstract:
The development of high-performance anode materials is crucial for advancing lithium-ion battery technology. In 2020, research focused on γ-Li3.08Cr0.02Si0.09V0.9O4, a novel zero-strain compound exhibiting superior electrochemical Li+ storage and high cycling stability. Our analysis reveals that this material's unique crystal structure enables negligible volume expansion during lithiation, ensuring enhanced durability. The results demonstrate γ-Li3.08Cr0.02Si0.09V0.9O4 as a promising anode material for practical lithium-ion batteries, paving the way for further research into zero-strain compounds for energy storage applications.
