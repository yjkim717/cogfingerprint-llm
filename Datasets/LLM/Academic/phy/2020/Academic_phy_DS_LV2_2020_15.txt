**Abstract**

The persistent challenge of capacity degradation in high-performance anode materials, driven by substantial volumetric changes during lithium insertion and extraction, remains a critical bottleneck for the advancement of next-generation lithium-ion batteries. This work addresses this issue through the design and electrochemical evaluation of a novel zero-strain anode material, gamma-phase LiCrSiO₄VO₄ (γ-LCSVO). The investigation leverages a combination of X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to confirm the material's unique crystallographic structure, which is engineered to exhibit minimal lattice strain during cycling. Galvanostatic charge-discharge testing conducted at a rate of C/2 reveals a high specific capacity of approximately 285 mAh g⁻¹, which is retained with 98.5% capacity retention after 500 cycles. This exceptional cycling stability is attributed directly to the zero-strain characteristic of γ-LCSVO, which effectively mitigates pulverization and preserves the integrity of the electrode-electrolyte interface, as corroborated by post-cycling scanning electron microscopy analysis. Furthermore, the material demonstrates favorable rate capability, maintaining a capacity of 210 mAh g⁻¹ at a 2C rate. These findings, situated within the 2020 research landscape focused on durable energy storage, substantiate that the strategic development of zero-strain materials like γ-LCSVO provides a viable pathway to overcoming the cyclical fatigue of conventional anodes, thereby paving the way for long-lasting and high-capacity lithium-ion batteries.
