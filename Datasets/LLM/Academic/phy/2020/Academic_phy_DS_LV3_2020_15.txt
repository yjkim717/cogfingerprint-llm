**Abstract**

The persistent challenge of significant volume variation in high-capacity anode materials during electrochemical cycling remains a primary bottleneck for the development of next-generation lithium-ion batteries with extended longevity. This volumetric instability induces substantial mechanical stress, leading to particle pulverization, loss of electrical contact, and the continuous degradation of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), which collectively manifest as rapid capacity fade and poor cycling stability. Herein, we report the synthesis and electrochemical characterization of a novel vanadium-based anode material, γ-Li₃.₀₈Cr₀.₀₂Si₀.₀₉V₀.₉O₄, engineered to exhibit near-zero strain behavior. Through *in situ* X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we quantitatively demonstrate an exceptionally minimal unit cell volume change of less than 0.5% upon lithiation and delithiation. This intrinsic zero-strain property is the foundational mechanism underpinning the material's exceptional performance. The anode delivers a high reversible capacity of 280 mAh g⁻¹ and, critically, demonstrates unparalleled cycling stability, retaining 95% of its initial capacity after 2,000 cycles at a 1C rate. The invariant crystal structure effectively mitigates the chronic issues of electrode degradation, resulting in an exceptionally stable and thin SEI layer, as confirmed by post-cycling electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These findings establish cation-substituted γ-Li₃VO₄ as a paradigm for zero-strain anodes, offering a decisive pathway toward overcoming the fundamental limitations of volume variation and enabling the realization of durable, high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries for advanced applications in electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage.
