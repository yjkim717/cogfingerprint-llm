In 2020, a novel geometric framework, termed the EFT-hedron, was discovered to underlie the low-energy expansion of effective field theories. By re-examining constraints imposed by causality and unitarity on scattering amplitudes, a hidden 'totally positive' structure was revealed. This EFT-hedron geometry provides a rigorous bound on the coefficients of effective operators, reshaping our understanding of the theoretical landscape and informing the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.
