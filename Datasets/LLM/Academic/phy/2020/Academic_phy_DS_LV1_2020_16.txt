**Abstract**

The asymptotic structure of gauge theories at spatial infinity provides a fertile framework for uncovering hidden symmetries and their associated charges. While the bosonic case, particularly for gravity and Yang-Mills theory, is well-established, the asymptotic analysis of fermionic gauge fields remains comparatively under-explored. This work presents a comprehensive study of the asymptotic structure of free massless Rarita-Schwinger fields in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. By imposing fall-off conditions on the spin-3/2 field consistent with the linearized equations of motion, we construct a well-defined phase space at spatial infinity (i⁰). A careful analysis of the symplectic structure reveals a class of residual gauge transformations that act non-trivially on this phase space; these are the fermionic counterparts to the so-called "large" or improper gauge transformations. We demonstrate that these transformations are generated by novel fermionic charges, which we explicitly construct. Crucially, we show that these fermionic generators, together with the well-known Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) supertranslations and Lorentz charges, do not merely form a direct sum but instead obey a non-abelian graded algebra. This structure is identified as an infinite-dimensional extension of the super-Poincaré algebra, where the standard supersymmetry generators are promoted to a spin-1/2 function on the sphere. Our results imply that the Rarita-Schwinger theory possesses an infinite number of boundary degrees of freedom at i⁰, fundamentally altering the understanding of its infrared sector and providing a new potential arena for investigating the role of fermionic soft theorems and memory effects.
