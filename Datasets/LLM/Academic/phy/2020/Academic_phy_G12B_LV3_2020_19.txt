 Here's an abstract inspired by the provided summary and keywords, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a physics publication (and reflecting a 2020 timeframe):

"Recent advances in metamaterial engineering have facilitated the creation of artificial structures exhibiting tailored electromagnetic responses. This work explores the application of dielectric metasurfaces to achieve sensitive polarization state monitoring. By exploiting non-Hermitian transformations within the metasurface design, we demonstrate the ability to amplify polarization-dependent ratios, enabling robust single-shot detection of deviations from target polarization. This approach offers a pathway towards compact and highly responsive optical sensors with potential applications in polarization imaging and optical communications."
