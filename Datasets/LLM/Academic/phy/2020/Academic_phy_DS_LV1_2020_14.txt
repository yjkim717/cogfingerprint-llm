**Abstract**

We investigate the observational signatures of rotating black holes in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity, a promising extension to General Relativity. Using the Newman-Janis algorithm, we derive a rotating black hole solution characterized by the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, α. The primary focus is on calculating the characteristic shadow cast by these black holes when illuminated by an optically thin, radiating accretion flow. Our analysis reveals a critical dependence of the shadow morphology on the sign of α. A positive α, which can be interpreted as a string-theoretic correction, systematically reduces the shadow radius compared to the Kerr vacuum solution. Conversely, a negative α, whose fundamental origin remains an open question, produces a perceptible enlargement of the shadow. By comparing our theoretical shadow profiles with the first Event Horizon Telescope observations of M87*, we perform a preliminary constraint on the parameter space. The observed shadow size is inconsistent with large positive values of α and instead suggests a slight preference for negative coupling constants, providing a potential observational window into higher-curvature gravitational physics. This work underscores the power of black hole imaging as a direct testbed for modified gravity theories.
