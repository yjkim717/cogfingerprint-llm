**Abstract**

We investigate the linear stability of black resonators and geons residing within Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, employing a perturbative analysis informed by gauge theory considerations. Black resonators, specifically those formed from scalar fields exhibiting a condensate, are demonstrated to be generically susceptible to a superradiant instability. This instability arises due to the extraction of energy from the black hole’s ergosphere, a phenomenon intimately linked to the black hole’s angular momentum and the surrounding spacetime geometry.  In stark contrast, our analysis reveals that a significant subset of geons – non-topological solitons sustained by scalar fields – exhibit unexpectedly robust stability against this same superradiant mechanism. This stability is not a universal feature of all geon configurations, but emerges from specific relationships between the geon’s structure, the scalar field potential, and the AdS background. These findings offer novel insights into the interplay between gravity, quantum fields, and the formation of localized structures in asymptotically AdS spacetimes, with potential ramifications for holographic correspondence and the study of strongly coupled field theories.
