**Abstract: Towards a Lorentz-Invariant S-Matrix for Electric-Magnetic Scattering via On-Shell Recursion and Little Group Representations**

The construction of a manifestly Lorentz-invariant S-matrix remains a significant challenge in theoretical physics, particularly when considering interactions involving electric and magnetic charges. Traditional approaches often suffer from complications arising from the representation theory of the Poincaré group and the intricacies of handling gauge invariance. This work explores a novel approach to this problem, leveraging on-shell recursion relations and a refined understanding of multi-particle representations within the context of the little group.

We propose a framework for constructing the S-matrix for electric-magnetic scattering by explicitly exploiting the kinematic constraints enforced by the on-shell conditions. This methodology, inspired by recent advances in scattering amplitude calculations, allows us to bypass the need for explicit propagators and Feynman diagrams, inherently promoting Lorentz invariance. A crucial element of our approach is the systematic incorporation of little group representations associated with the momenta of the scattered particles.  The little group, being the subgroup of the Poincaré group that leaves a particle’s four-momentum fixed up to a Lorentz transformation, provides a natural framework for classifying the possible final states and ensuring the correct kinematical behavior under Lorentz transformations. 

Specifically, we investigate how to decompose the scattering amplitudes into components labeled by helicity, a quantity that is invariant under boosts and rotations within the little group. By utilizing this decomposition and employing recursion relations, we aim to build up the S-matrix from simpler building blocks.  This approach is expected to offer a more streamlined and conceptually clear route to a Lorentz-invariant description of electric-magnetic interactions, potentially shedding light on the underlying structure of these fundamental processes and offering a new perspective on the relationship between symmetries and scattering phenomena. Further work will focus on incorporating gauge invariance and extending the formalism to higher-order scattering processes.
