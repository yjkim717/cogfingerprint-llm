**Gravitational Wave Emission and Angular Deflection in Classical Scattering: Resolving Logarithmic Divergences via Post-Minkowskian Analysis**

We investigate the impact of gravitational wave emission on the classical scattering of massive particles by a static, spherically symmetric source. Utilizing a post-Minkowskian approach, we demonstrate that the emitted gravitational wave flux fundamentally alters the final scattering angle beyond the standard Newtonian and post-Newtonian predictions. Our analysis reveals a novel $G^3$ correction to the deflection angle, arising from the radiative backreaction on the scattering particle. This correction is shown to resolve a previously identified logarithmic divergence that plagues calculations of the scattering angle in the presence of gravitational radiation. The derivation relies on an eikonal-phase formalism, allowing for a consistent treatment of both the gravitational field and the particle trajectories.  These results provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between gravitational dynamics and wave emission in strong-field scattering scenarios, with potential implications for tests of general relativity and the study of astrophysical systems involving compact object interactions.
