Title: Accelerating Density Functional Theory Calculations with GPU-Enabled Exchange-Correlation Functionals in the QUICK Program

Abstract:
We present a novel implementation of exchange-correlation functionals within the QUICK program, leveraging graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration to significantly enhance the performance of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By harnessing the massively parallel architecture of modern GPUs, our GPU-enabled exchange-correlation scheme achieves substantial speedup over traditional CPU-based implementations. The QUICK program, known for its efficiency and accuracy in quantum chemistry simulations, is now further optimized to take advantage of GPU acceleration. Our results demonstrate that the GPU-accelerated exchange-correlation functionals yield a considerable reduction in computational time, making large-scale DFT calculations more tractable. This development is particularly significant in the context of 2020's advancements in computational chemistry, where the demand for faster and more accurate simulations continues to grow. The integration of GPU capabilities into the QUICK program represents a crucial step forward in this field.
