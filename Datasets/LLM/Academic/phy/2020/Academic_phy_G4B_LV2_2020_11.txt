**Abstract**

We examine the linear stability of black resonators and geons within the context of global anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime, employing techniques relevant to 2020 theoretical investigations. Our analysis focuses on identifying potential instabilities arising from superradiant phenomena. Specifically, we demonstrate the presence of a superradiant instability for black resonators, driven by the resonant amplification of perturbations within the ergoregion. Conversely, we find evidence suggesting apparent stability for geons – scalarized black holes – when considering linearized equations in global AdS. This stability, however, is contingent upon specific parameter regimes and neglects potential non-linear effects.  The observed instability in resonators highlights the sensitivity of black hole dynamics to subtle geometric configurations, while the geon’s apparent stability provides a valuable benchmark for further theoretical exploration.  Further research is warranted to fully characterize the geon’s stability and to investigate the influence of higher-order corrections.
