"In a 2020 study, we experimentally investigated the thermodynamic implications of a two-qubit quantum gate, quantifying the energetic costs associated with quantum information processing. By analyzing energy and entropy fluctuations, our results demonstrate a clear link between gate performance and Landauer's principle, shedding light on the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum circuits and informing the development of more efficient quantum computing architectures."
