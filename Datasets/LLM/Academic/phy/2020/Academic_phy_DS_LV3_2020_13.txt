In this 2020 study, we experimentally quantify thermodynamic constraints in superconducting quantum circuits by implementing a controlled two-qubit gate. Through high-precision calorimetry, we measure energy fluctuations during gate operations and verify their agreement with Landauer's principle. Our results demonstrate that quantum information processing necessitates fundamental energy dissipation, with measured entropy changes matching theoretical predictions within 5% uncertainty. These findings establish rigorous thermodynamic bounds for scalable quantum computation, revealing how quantum coherence modulates energy transfer at the nanoscale.
