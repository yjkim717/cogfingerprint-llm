We investigate the Hawking emission spectrum of magnetically charged black holes within the Standard Model. Our analysis demonstrates that electroweak symmetry is restored in the high-curvature near-horizon region. This symmetry restoration dramatically enhances the production rate of massless two-dimensional fermions via Hawking radiation, fundamentally altering the black hole's evaporation channel. We compute the modified emission spectrum, showing that these effects dominate the late-stage evaporation dynamics. This provides a novel signature for primordial black holes and imposes new constraints on their role as dark matter candidates.
