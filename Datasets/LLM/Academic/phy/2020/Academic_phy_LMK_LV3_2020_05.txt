Abstract:
This study presents a novel calibration of the J-band luminosity for carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, leveraging observations from the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds to establish a robust distance scale. By applying this calibration to NGC 253, we derive a distance modulus of 27.66 ± 0.01 (statistical) ± 0.04 (systematic) mag, consistent with recent estimates. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of carbon-rich AGB stars as reliable distance indicators, offering a valuable tool for extragalactic astronomy and enhancing our understanding of galaxy distances in the local universe (2020).
