**Abstract**

The pursuit of high-performance anode materials remains a critical challenge in the advancement of lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology. This work investigates γ-Li₃.₀₈Cr₀.₀₂Si₀.₀₉V₀.₉O₄ (γ-LCSVO) as a promising candidate to address limitations associated with conventional anode materials. Through rigorous electrochemical testing, we demonstrate that γ-LCSVO exhibits exceptional cycling stability and a high reversible capacity, exceeding previously reported values for comparable compositions. A key finding is the material’s inherently low volume change during repeated lithium insertion and extraction, attributable to its specific crystal structure and compositional engineering. This characteristic contributes to the observed enhanced stability and mitigates the formation of detrimental solid electrolyte interphases. Furthermore, γ-LCSVO displays a safe operating potential, reducing the risk of thermal runaway—a significant safety concern in LIBs. These results highlight γ-LCSVO as a zero-strain anode material with substantial potential for improving the performance and safety of electrochemical energy storage devices.
