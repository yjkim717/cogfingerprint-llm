**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in quantum circuit design necessitate a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic constraints governing quantum gate operations. This study presents experimental evidence quantifying the energetic footprint associated with two-qubit quantum gates in 2020. Analyzing entropy fluctuations during gate execution reveals a direct correlation between performance metrics and energetic dissipation.  These findings establish a tangible link between quantum gate fidelity and Landauer’s principle, demonstrating a fundamental relationship between information processing and energy expenditure at the single-qubit level.  Further investigation into these energetic dynamics is crucial for optimizing quantum computing architectures and mitigating decoherence effects, ultimately advancing the feasibility of scalable quantum technologies.
