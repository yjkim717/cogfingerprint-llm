We constrain the ultralight axion (ULA) dark matter mass using Lyman-alpha forest data from high-redshift quasars. By analyzing the one-dimensional flux power spectrum, we derive a lower bound on the ULA mass, $m_a > 2 \times 10^{-21}$ eV at 95% confidence level. Our results demonstrate that Lyman-alpha forest observations are a powerful probe of ULA dark matter, complementary to cosmic structure growth and cold dark matter paradigms, and provide new insights into the dark matter sector (2020).
