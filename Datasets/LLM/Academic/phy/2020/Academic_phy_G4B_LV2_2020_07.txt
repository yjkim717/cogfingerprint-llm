**Abstract**

This work investigates the impact of radiative reaction on the dynamics of gravitational scattering between classical point masses, extending beyond standard post-Minkowskian approximations. Utilizing a perturbative framework, we demonstrate that incorporating radiative reaction fundamentally alters the scattering angle, exhibiting a qualitative shift observed in eikonal-phase calculations. Specifically, the presence of emitted radiation introduces a corrective term to the classical impulse approximation, leading to a measurable alignment of the final scattering angle with the predicted eikonal phase. These findings suggest a significant modification to the scattering process when considering the instantaneous recoil of massive objects. The results underscore the importance of accounting for radiative effects in accurately modeling strong gravitational interactions and represent a step towards a more complete post-Minkowskian description of gravitational scattering, published in 2020.
