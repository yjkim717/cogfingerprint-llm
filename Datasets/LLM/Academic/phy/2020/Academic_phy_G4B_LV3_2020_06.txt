**Abstract:**

Recent theoretical investigations into black hole evaporation necessitate a reconciliation of general relativity with quantum mechanics. This paper explores a novel approach, drawing upon the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG) and semi-classical quantum general relativity, as articulated in Ashtekar’s 2020 work. Specifically, the analysis challenges the prevailing notion of singularities residing within black hole event horizons. Utilizing simplified models, the research proposes that subtle modifications to purification processes, informed by LQG’s discrete spacetime structure, may mitigate the formation of true singularities.  The study suggests that the observed Hawking radiation is not merely a consequence of quantum fluctuations near the event horizon, but rather a manifestation of spacetime decoherence at Planck scales.  Further, the work advocates for a revised understanding of the event horizon itself, potentially characterized by a ‘fuzzy’ interface rather than a sharp boundary.  These findings contribute to a nascent paradigm integrating quantum gravity and black hole physics.
