**Asymptotic Structure and Canonical Formulation of the Rarita-Schwinger Theory in Four Dimensions**

The Rarita-Schwinger theory, describing a spin-3/2 field, presents significant challenges in achieving a consistent and manifestly Lorentz-invariant canonical formulation. This work investigates the asymptotic behavior of the theory, focusing on the imposition of appropriate boundary conditions and the exploitation of inherent fermionic symmetries to construct a robust framework. We introduce a novel gauge transformation scheme designed to eliminate spurious degrees of freedom arising from the non-compactness of the spinorial representations. 

Employing an asymptotic structure analysis, we demonstrate how carefully chosen boundary conditions, specifically those reflecting a localized, finite-volume spacetime, effectively constrain the field’s behavior at infinity. This constraint is intrinsically linked to the preservation of fermionic symmetries – specifically, the invariance under transformations reflecting local fermion number conservation.  Furthermore, we establish a symplectic structure, rigorously defining the canonical variables and their associated constraints.  This symplectic structure is shown to be crucial for maintaining unitarity and ensures the theory’s compatibility with standard quantum field theory principles.  Our results provide a foundational step towards a fully renormalized and physically viable description of the Rarita-Schwinger theory, offering insights pertinent to investigations in areas such as neutrino physics and beyond-standard-model phenomenology.
