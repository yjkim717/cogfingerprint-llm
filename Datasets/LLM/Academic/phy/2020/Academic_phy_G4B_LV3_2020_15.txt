**Abstract**

Recent advancements in lithium-ion battery technology necessitate innovative anode materials capable of sustained performance and enhanced safety profiles. This research details the synthesis and characterization of γ‐LCSVO, a lithium-coordinated silicon oxyvide (LCSVO) compound with a stoichiometric composition of Li₃.08Cr₀.₀₂Si₀.₀⁹V₀.⁹O₄, demonstrating promising attributes for next-generation energy storage. Utilizing a unique fabrication methodology minimizing mechanical strain during cycling, γ‐LCSVO exhibits ‘zero-strain’ behavior, mitigating volume expansion and associated degradation. Electrochemical testing reveals exceptional reversible capacity retention and prolonged cycling stability – critical factors for practical applications. Furthermore, initial potential cycling suggests a safer operating window compared to conventional graphite anodes. These findings highlight γ‐LCSVO as a viable candidate for improving lithium-ion battery performance and durability.
