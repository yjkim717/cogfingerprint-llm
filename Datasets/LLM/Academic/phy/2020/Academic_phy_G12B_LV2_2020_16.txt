Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a physics publication, based on the provided keywords and summary, and framed within a 2020 context. I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and appropriate terminology.  Following the abstract, I'll include some notes on the choices I made and potential avenues for expansion if more information were available.

**Abstract:**

The investigation of asymptotic symmetries in quantum field theories offers a powerful lens through which to understand conserved quantities and potential ultraviolet (UV) completion scenarios. This work presents a detailed analysis of the asymptotic structure of the Rarita-Schwinger (RS) theory, a spin-3/2 relativistic fermion model, employing techniques rooted in symplectic geometry and Lie algebra cohomology.  Building upon recent advances in the characterization of infinite-dimensional symmetries in gauge theories and Dirac-like systems, we demonstrate the existence of an unexpectedly rich and intricate landscape of fermionic symmetries associated with the RS action in the infinite-momentum limit.

Our analysis leverages the underlying symplectic structure of the RS phase space to construct a cohomology classification of asymptotic generators.  This procedure reveals a tower of infinite-dimensional fermionic symmetry operators, extending beyond the standard super-Poincaré algebra typically associated with relativistic spinorial theories.  Specifically, we identify non-trivial elements in the Lie algebra cohomology, indicating that the symmetry algebra undergoes a significant enhancement.  The resulting enlarged symmetry algebra encompasses the super-Poincaré algebra as a subalgebra, but incorporates additional fermionic generators arising from the specific form of the RS interaction.

The implications of this enhanced symmetry are manifold. Firstly, it suggests a deeper underlying structure within the RS theory, potentially hinting at a UV-complete description involving more fundamental degrees of freedom. Secondly, the identification of these asymptotic fermionic symmetries provides a powerful tool for constructing conserved charges and exploring the scattering amplitudes of RS particles, offering a pathway towards regularization and renormalization.  Finally, our findings contribute to the broader understanding of fermionic symmetry enhancement in relativistic quantum field theories and its connection to underlying geometric structures. These results align with the ongoing effort to explore non-local symmetries and their role in resolving divergences and defining consistent quantum theories. The symmetries identified here could provide new constraints on possible extensions of the Standard Model involving spin-3/2 particles.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Expansion:**

*   **Contextualization (2020):** I included references to recent advances in asymptotic symmetry analysis (gauge theories, Dirac systems) to position the work within the contemporary research landscape. The mention of non-local symmetries also reflects a growing area of interest in the field around that time.
*   **Terminology:** I used precise terms like "symplectic geometry," "Lie algebra cohomology," "infinite-momentum limit," "UV completion," and "renormalization" to establish the technical rigor appropriate for a physics publication.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: (1) Introduction/Motivation, (2) Methodology, (3) Key Results, (4) Implications/Future Directions.
*   **Specificity:** While the original summary was brief, I expanded on the *type* of fermionic symmetries found (beyond super-Poincaré) and alluded to their potential role in scattering amplitudes and UV completion.
*   **Potential Expansion (if more information were available):**
    *   **Specifics of the Algebra:** If the paper detailed the exact
