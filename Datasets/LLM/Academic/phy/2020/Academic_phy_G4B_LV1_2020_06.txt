**Abstract: Reconciling Black Hole Evaporation with Loop Quantum Gravitational Frameworks**

Recent theoretical investigations into black hole evaporation necessitate a nuanced understanding of the interplay between general relativity and quantum mechanics at extreme gravitational regimes. This work proposes a novel semi-classical quantum gravity framework, drawing upon principles of loop quantum gravity, to re-evaluate the conventional characterization of black hole horizons and singularities. Utilizing a modified Wheeler-DeWitt equation incorporating loop quantum corrections, we explore the potential for a gradual, rather than abrupt, transition from classical spacetime to quantum foam near the event horizon. 

Our analysis suggests that the singularity predicted by standard general relativity may be mitigated by discrete spacetime geometry, effectively smoothing the breakdown of predictability. Furthermore, we hypothesize that black hole evaporation proceeds through a process of quantum tunneling and information decoherence, circumventing the information paradox. This framework, presented in 2020, offers a preliminary step toward a consistent description of black hole thermodynamics and its quantum origins.
