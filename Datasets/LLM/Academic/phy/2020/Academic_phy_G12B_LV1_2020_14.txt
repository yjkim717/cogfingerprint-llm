Okay, here's an academic abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal style suitable for a physics publication and reflecting a 2020 timeframe. I've aimed for precision and a clear structure, expanding on the core ideas.

**Abstract**

The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration’s recent observations of the shadow surrounding the supermassive black hole M87* have spurred renewed interest in testing general relativity in the strong-field regime. While the Kerr metric, describing a rotating, uncharged black hole, has traditionally served as the primary theoretical framework for interpreting these observations, alternative theories of gravity, such as Gauss-Bonnet gravity, offer potentially distinguishable predictions. This paper presents an investigation into the shadow cast by rotating black holes within the Gauss-Bonnet framework. Utilizing the Newman-Janis algorithm, we construct exact solutions for rotating black holes admitting a Gauss-Bonnet term, parameterized by the coupling constant α.  We analyze the resulting spacetime geometry and derive the null geodesics that define the black hole shadow. Our findings demonstrate a significant dependence of the shadow's size and shape on the value of α. Specifically, we observe deviations from the Kerr black hole shadow, particularly for larger values of α, manifesting as subtle but potentially observable distortions in the shadow's profile. A comparative analysis is performed, quantifying the differences in shadow observables as a function of α and angular momentum. These results provide a theoretical basis for constraining the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant through future high-resolution observations of black hole shadows, offering a novel pathway to probe modifications to Einstein's gravity.
