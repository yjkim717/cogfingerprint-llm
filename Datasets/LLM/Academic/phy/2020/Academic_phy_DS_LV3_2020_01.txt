In recent theoretical developments, 't Hooft's foundational work on deterministic quantum mechanics has catalyzed significant advances in understanding quantum-classical correspondence. This research rigorously demonstrates that quantum Hamiltonians can emerge from deterministic systems governed by classical evolution laws, provided they satisfy stringent locality constraints. Crucially, these deterministic underpinnings maintain quantum coherence while operating through strictly local interactions, thereby reconciling quantum phenomena with classical determinism. The framework notably achieves this unification without invoking gravitational forces, distinguishing it from quantum gravity approaches. By establishing precise mathematical conditions for such equivalence, this work provides a robust platform for investigating quantum measurement problems and foundational aspects of quantum theory. The implications extend to quantum computing and emergent spacetime models, offering novel pathways to address long-standing conceptual challenges in theoretical physics through deterministic interpretations of quantum evolution.
