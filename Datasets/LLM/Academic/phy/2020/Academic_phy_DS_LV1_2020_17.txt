**Abstract**

The dense integration of optical waveguides in photonic integrated circuits (PICs) is fundamentally limited by inter-channel crosstalk, which degrades signal integrity. This work introduces a deterministic strategy for crosstalk suppression by engineering the evanescent coupling region between adjacent silicon-on-insulator waveguides. We propose and numerically validate a design comprising non-uniform, subwavelength silicon strips, whose geometry is optimized using a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The PSO routine minimizes the overlap of the supermodes' fields while maintaining low propagation loss over the C-band. Full-wave 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrate a crosstalk reduction exceeding 25 dB compared to conventional strip waveguides at a 500 nm edge-to-edge separation, with a negligible insertion penalty of <0.5 dB over a 100 Âµm interaction length. This approach provides a robust pathway for realizing ultra-dense, high-performance PICs for optical interconnects and quantum information processing.
