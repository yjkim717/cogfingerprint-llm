We investigate the gravitational two-body scattering problem within the post-Minkowskian framework, focusing on the interplay between conservative dynamics and radiation-reaction effects. Our analysis demonstrates that the inclusion of the gravitational-wave tail contribution at third post-Minkowskian order (G³) is essential for obtaining a physically consistent, finite scattering angle. This radiation-reaction correction precisely cancels the previously identified high-energy divergence present in the purely conservative sector. The resulting total scattering angle at O(G³) is shown to be finite in the high-energy limit and exhibits a complete agreement with the corresponding quantum eikonal exponentiation. This concordance provides a robust confirmation of the subtle connection between radiative dissipation in classical general relativity and high-energy quantum gravitational scattering amplitudes.
