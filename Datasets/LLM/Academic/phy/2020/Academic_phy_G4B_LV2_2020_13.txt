**Abstract**

Recent advancements in quantum computing necessitate a rigorous understanding of energy dissipation within quantum circuits. This research presents experimental evidence quantifying the energy expenditure associated with two-qubit quantum gate operations, employing a novel approach to correlate energy fluctuations with gate fidelity. Specifically, we observed a direct relationship between thermal noise and gate performance degradation, indicative of significant quantum fluctuations within the system. These findings are framed within the context of Landauerâ€™s principle, suggesting a fundamental thermodynamic limit on information erasure and its implications for quantum information processing.  The observed energy costs underscore the critical need for robust error correction strategies and optimized qubit architectures to realize scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computation.  This work, conducted in 2020, contributes to the burgeoning field of quantum thermodynamics.
