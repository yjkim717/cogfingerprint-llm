Title: Revisiting Black Hole Evaporation through the Lens of Loop Quantum Gravity: A Semi-Classical Perspective

Abstract:
The phenomenon of black hole evaporation remains a longstanding puzzle at the intersection of general relativity and quantum mechanics. In this work, we revisit the problem using the framework of loop quantum gravity (LQG), which provides a background-independent quantization of spacetime. By employing a semi-classical approximation, we derive a modified evaporation scenario that resolves the black hole singularity. Our analysis reveals that the LQG corrections to the semi-classical Einstein field equations lead to a non-singular spacetime geometry, effectively replacing the classical singularity with a bounce. We discuss the implications of this result for our understanding of black hole evaporation and the information paradox. Our findings suggest that LQG provides a viable framework for resolving the long-standing singularity problem, shedding new light on the interplay between gravity, spacetime, and quantum mechanics.
