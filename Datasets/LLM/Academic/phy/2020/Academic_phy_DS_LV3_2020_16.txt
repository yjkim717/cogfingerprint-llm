**Abstract**

The Hamiltonian formulation of the free Rarita-Schwinger theory in four-dimensional Minkowski space reveals a non-trivial asymptotic structure at spatial infinity, necessitating a refined treatment of its symmetry algebra. A canonical analysis demonstrates that the standard framework, devoid of boundary contributions, fails to yield well-defined generators for the full Poincaré group, thereby jeopardizing Lorentz invariance. This work establishes that the resolution lies in the inclusion of dynamical boundary degrees of freedom, which are essential for a consistent implementation of the asymptotic symmetry transformations. These boundary terms render the canonical generators for spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations finite and functionally differentiable, securing the invariance of the theory under the super-Poincaré algebra.

Furthermore, the analysis uncovers an infinite-dimensional extension of the fermionic gauge symmetry, whose generators are also well-defined only with the prescribed boundary contributions. The structure of these **improper gauge symmetries** mirrors that of their bosonic counterparts in gauge theories and gravity, highlighting a universal feature of field theories with gauge freedom. The extension to supersymmetric multiplets reinforces this construction, demonstrating that the boundary degrees of freedom are indispensable for preserving the super-Poincaré algebra off-shell. This work, therefore, provides a consistent Hamiltonian description of the Rarita-Schwinger field, clarifying its role as the fundamental building block for supergravity and other supersymmetric models in four dimensions.
