**Abstract:**

Recent developments in quantum gravity necessitate a re-evaluation of the informational constraints governing spacetime geometry. This work proposes a novel framework wherein the fundamental degrees of freedom of quantum gravity are realized within a one-dimensional Hilbert space, analogous to the constraints imposed by Gauss’s law for thermodynamic entropy. We posit that the emergence of observable, three-dimensional spacetime arises from the inherent ‘swampland conditions’ – a maximal entanglement landscape – characteristic of these minimal Hilbert spaces. Critically, this model leverages a holographic dictionary, mapping bulk spacetime correlations to correlations within this reduced Hilbert space. 

Specifically, gauge redundancies, often problematic in conventional quantum gravity approaches, are recast as inherent symmetries within the one-dimensional system, promoting a more robust and predictive framework.  This configuration offers a potential resolution to persistent tensions observed in holographic theories, suggesting a direct link between quantum gravity’s fundamental structure and the holographic principle. Further investigation into the implications of this reduced dimensionality for black hole entropy and the early universe is warranted. (2020)
