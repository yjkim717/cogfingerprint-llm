Title: Asymptotic Fermionic Symmetries in Free Rarita-Schwinger Theory

Abstract:
This study examines the asymptotic structure of the free Rarita-Schwinger theory in four-dimensional spacetime, revealing an infinite-dimensional fermionic algebra that underlies the theory's supersymmetric multiplets. By employing the Hamiltonian formalism, we demonstrate a canonical realization of the super-Poincaré algebra, thereby establishing a precise connection between the asymptotic symmetries and the supersymmetric structure of the theory. Our analysis, conducted within the framework of 2020 advancements in theoretical physics, shows that the Rarita-Schwinger theory's asymptotic fermionic symmetries are isomorphic to the super-Poincaré algebra, providing a novel insight into the interplay between supersymmetry and asymptotic structure. The results presented here contribute to a deeper understanding of the theoretical foundations of supersymmetric theories and their implications for modern physics. The canonical realization of the super-Poincaré algebra is achieved through a detailed examination of the theory's fermionic charges and their asymptotic behavior.
