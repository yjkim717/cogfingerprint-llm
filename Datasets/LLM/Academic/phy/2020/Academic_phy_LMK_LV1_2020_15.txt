Title: Unveiling the Potential of γ-LCSVO as a Zero-Strain Anode Material for Enhanced Lithium-Ion Batteries

Abstract:

The burgeoning demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries has sparked intense research into novel electrode materials that can deliver superior electrochemical Li+ storage and cycling stability. In this context, the discovery of zero-strain compounds has garnered significant attention, owing to their ability to mitigate the structural degradation associated with Li+ intercalation. Herein, we present a comprehensive investigation into the electrochemical properties of γ-Li2Cu0.5V0.5SnO4 (γ-LCSVO), a hitherto unexplored anode material. Our results demonstrate that γ-LCSVO exhibits a negligible volume change (< 0.5%) upon Li+ insertion, thereby substantiating its zero-strain characteristics. Moreover, γ-LCSVO delivers a reversible capacity of 420 mAh g-1 at a current density of 0.1 A g-1, with a remarkable capacity retention of 95% over 500 cycles. The superior electrochemical performance of γ-LCSVO can be attributed to its robust crystal structure, which is retained even after prolonged cycling, as confirmed by ex situ X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy analyses. Furthermore, our density functional theory calculations reveal that the Li+ storage mechanism in γ-LCSVO involves a reversible intercalation process, with minimal lattice distortion. The present study underscores the potential of γ-LCSVO as a promising zero-strain anode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, offering a viable pathway towards achieving enhanced energy density and prolonged cycle life. The findings of this work are expected to stimulate further research into the development of γ-LCSVO-based lithium-ion batteries for a wide range of applications.
