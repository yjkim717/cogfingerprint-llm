## Abstract: Dynamic Polarization Control of Femtosecond Pulses via Dielectric Metasurface Engineering

The manipulation of ultrafast optical pulses remains a cornerstone of diverse fields, from spectroscopy to optical communications. Here, we present a novel approach to dynamically shaping the polarization state of near-infrared femtosecond pulses employing engineered dielectric metasurfaces. Our design leverages the broadband, low-loss properties of high-refractive-index dielectrics to achieve complex polarization transformations within a compact footprint. Experimental validation demonstrates precise control over the Stokes and anti-Stokes polarization components following interaction with the metasurface, opening avenues for advanced pulse shaping techniques. This work represents a significant step towards realizing all-dielectric, high-speed polarization control elements for temporal optics applications.
