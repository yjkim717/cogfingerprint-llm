“This study investigates the application of dielectric metasurfaces for dynamic control of ultrafast near-infrared pulses. Utilizing a broadband metasurface, we achieved manipulation of the temporal polarization profile within femtosecond pulses. Specifically, the fabricated structure enabled precise shaping of the pulse’s time-domain characteristics, demonstrating a novel technique for generating tailored temporal polarization states. Further research will explore the scalability and potential applications of this method.”
