Title: Accelerating Density Functional Theory Calculations with GPU-Enabled Exchange Correlation Scheme

Abstract:
In this work, we present a novel implementation of a GPU-capable exchange correlation scheme within the QUICK program, significantly enhancing the efficiency of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. By leveraging the parallel computational capabilities of modern graphics processing units (GPUs), our approach accelerates the quantum interaction computational kernel, a critical component of DFT. The integration of the GPU-enabled exchange correlation scheme enables the QUICK program to harness the power of parallel computation, resulting in substantial speedup compared to traditional CPU-based calculations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of this hybrid CPU-GPU architecture, achieving a considerable reduction in computational time while maintaining the accuracy of the exchange correlation scheme. This advancement has far-reaching implications for the field of quantum chemistry and materials science, enabling faster and more accurate simulations. (2020)
