**Abstract: Emergent Infinite-Dimensional Symmetries and Modified Symplectic Geometry in Asymptotic Rarita-Schwinger Theory**

We investigate the asymptotic structure of the Rarita-Schwinger (RS) theory, a relativistic fermionic gauge theory, with a focus on its behavior at spatial infinity. Building upon recent developments in asymptotic symmetries and boundary conformal field theory, we demonstrate the emergence of an infinite-dimensional symmetry algebra acting on the space of physical states at null infinity.  This symmetry enhancement arises from a careful analysis of the constraints of the RS action and the associated phase space.  Specifically, we derive a family of conserved charges, parameterized by elements of a central extension of the super-Poincaré algebra, revealing a deeper connection between the RS theory and supersymmetric quantum field theories.

Our analysis necessitates a re-evaluation of the symplectic structure governing the dynamics of the RS field at spatial infinity.  We find that the standard symplectic form, inherited from the bulk action, is fundamentally modified. This modification is not merely a coordinate transformation artifact, but reflects a genuine change in the phase space geometry.  The resulting asymptotic symplectic structure exhibits a non-trivial dependence on the fermionic degrees of freedom, implying a novel interplay between bosonic and fermionic symmetries at large distances.

Furthermore, we explore the implications of this modified symplectic structure for the scattering amplitudes of RS theory.  The emergence of infinite-dimensional symmetries suggests a potential framework for constructing an asymptotic AdS dual, allowing for a holographic description of the theory.  While a complete holographic realization remains an open problem, our findings provide strong evidence for the existence of a rich and unexplored asymptotic symmetry structure in fermionic gauge theories, potentially offering insights into the broader landscape of quantum field theory and its connections to gravity. This work utilizes techniques from covariant quantization and considers the challenges posed by the fermionic nature of the RS fields in the context of asymptotic analysis.
