In integrated photonics, crosstalk between densely packed optical waveguides remains a critical bottleneck for scaling photonic circuits. This paper introduces a novel approach utilizing nonuniform subwavelength silicon strips, engineered via particle swarm optimization (PSO), to achieve significant inter-waveguide crosstalk suppression. The PSO algorithm deterministically tailors the geometry of each strip to create a tailored effective refractive index profile, effectively suppressing evanescent field coupling. Experimental validation with silicon-on-insulator platforms demonstrates a crosstalk reduction exceeding 15 dB compared to conventional uniform strips, while maintaining low insertion loss below 1 dB across the C-band. This method provides a robust pathway for realizing ultra-compact, high-density photonic integrated circuits, essential for next-generation optical interconnects and quantum information processing systems.
