**Abstract**

The accurate simulation of electrochemical interfaces remains a central challenge in computational physics and materials science, as it requires a quantum-mechanical description of bond breaking and formation while simultaneously capturing the long-range electrostatic effects and dynamic structure of the solvent environment. Conventional approaches, such as pure Density Functional Theory (DFT), become computationally intractable for the requisite system sizes. This work presents a hybrid quantum mechanics and reactive force field (QM/ReaxFF) methodology that overcomes this limitation. By coupling an explicit DFT-level description of the electrocatalytic active site with a ReaxFF potential for the surrounding solvent molecules, our approach enables large-scale, atomistically detailed simulations of electrocatalytic processes in liquid electrolytes. We demonstrate that this scheme accurately reproduces key interfacial properties, including solvent reorganization energies and proton transfer barriers, which are critical for predicting catalytic activity and selectivity. This methodological advance provides a physically rigorous and computationally efficient framework for modeling complex electrocatalytic systems, thereby bridging the gap between electronic structure calculations and mesoscale phenomena.
