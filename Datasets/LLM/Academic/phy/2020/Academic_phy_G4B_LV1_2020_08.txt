**Abstract**

The persistent challenge of reconciling quantum theory with established classical physics necessitates a refined understanding of factual grounding. This work introduces the concepts of ‘relative facts’ – those inherently dependent on measurement and observer influence – and ‘stable facts’ – demonstrable, invariant properties irrespective of observation. We posit that stable facts, particularly those concerning fundamental constants and spacetime geometry, constitute a crucial bridge between the quantum and classical realms.  The observed phenomenon of decoherence, often interpreted solely through wavefunction collapse, is presented as a consequence of information transfer driven by interactions with stable, external realities.  Specifically, decoherence’s rapid propagation reflects the entropic alignment of the quantum system with these robust, local facts.  Further investigation is required to fully elucidate the mechanism by which quantum states gradually ‘forget’ their relative, probabilistic nature in favor of the stability offered by a broader, classical framework.
