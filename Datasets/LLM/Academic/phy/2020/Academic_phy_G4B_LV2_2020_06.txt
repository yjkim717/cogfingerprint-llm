**Abstract**

The persistent enigma of black hole evaporation necessitates a re-evaluation of established theoretical frameworks. This work explores a novel approach to understanding Hawking radiation, leveraging the principles of loop quantum gravity (LQG) and its associated semi-classical gravity extensions to general relativity. We posit that the conventional understanding of black hole singularities – frequently invoked as points of breakdown within classical general relativity – may be fundamentally altered by quantum gravitational effects. Specifically, LQG’s discrete spacetime structure offers a potential mechanism to circumvent the formation of true singularities, instead proposing a ‘quantum fuzziness’ at the event horizon.  

This perspective suggests that black hole evaporation isn’t solely a consequence of particle creation near a singular point, but rather a manifestation of spacetime itself undergoing a gradual, quantum decoherence.  Preliminary calculations, informed by semi-classical approximations, indicate observable deviations from the standard Hawking temperature profile, potentially offering a testable prediction for future observational efforts.  Further investigation is required to fully elucidate the implications of this model.
