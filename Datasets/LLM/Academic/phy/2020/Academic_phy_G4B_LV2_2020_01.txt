**Abstract**

Recent investigations into the foundations of quantum mechanics have increasingly explored connections with classical, deterministic systems. This work demonstrates a hitherto largely unexamined mathematical correspondence between quantum mechanical evolution and analogous deterministic dynamics, predicated on a Hamiltonian formalism. Specifically, we derive equations exhibiting formal equivalence, valid for general point-particle interactions, while intentionally excluding the influence of gravitational fields. This approach allows for a rigorous examination of the underlying principles governing both regimes, revealing a surprising degree of structural similarity.  The derivation hinges on representing quantum observables as deterministic variables evolving according to modified Hamiltonian constraints.  Crucially, this analysis reinforces the principle of locality within the quantum framework, suggesting that seemingly disparate behaviors may arise from fundamentally similar deterministic processes.  Further research will investigate the implications of this equivalence for interpreting wavefunction collapse and the measurement problem.
