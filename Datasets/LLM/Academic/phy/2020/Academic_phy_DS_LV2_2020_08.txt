This paper introduces a rigorous distinction between relative facts—observer-dependent measurement outcomes emerging through decoherence—and stable facts, which exhibit classical objectivity across reference frames. We demonstrate that treating quantum states as encoding relative facts resolves foundational paradoxes while maintaining consistency with relativistic causality. A no-go theorem is established, proving that universal stable facts cannot exist within unitary quantum mechanics. Through decoherence models, we show how systems dynamically acquire stability under specific conditions, bridging the quantum-classical divide. This framework refutes claims of quantum incompleteness and provides a principled explanation for the emergence of classical reality without modifying quantum theory’s foundational principles, offering a resolution to long-standing interpretational challenges.
