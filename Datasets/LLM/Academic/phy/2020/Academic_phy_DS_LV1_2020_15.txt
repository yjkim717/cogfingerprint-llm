**Abstract**

The development of high-capacity anode materials that can withstand prolonged electrochemical cycling remains a pivotal challenge in advancing lithium-ion battery (LIB) technology. A primary failure mechanism is the structural degradation and pulverization of the anode due to the significant volumetric strain induced by repeated Li+ insertion and extraction processes. This work introduces a novel zero-strain anode material, LiₓM₈O₁₆ (M = transition metal), specifically engineered to exhibit a near-negligible unit cell volume change (< 0.5%) during lithiation and delithiation. Through a combination of *in situ* X-ray diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, we quantitatively demonstrate the material's exceptional structural integrity over extended cycling. Electrochemical evaluation reveals a high reversible capacity of 320 mAh g⁻¹ at 0.2C and, critically, a capacity retention of 99.2% after 1000 cycles at a 1C rate, substantially outperforming conventional graphite and alloy-based anodes. The material's three-dimensional interstitial channels facilitate rapid and stable Li+ storage, contributing to its superior rate capability. We posit that the invariant host structure not only prevents mechanical fatigue but also promotes the formation of a stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI), a key factor in its unprecedented cycling stability. These findings establish this zero-strain framework as a transformative paradigm for designing next-generation, long-lasting LIB anodes, with direct implications for applications in electric vehicles and grid-scale energy storage.
