Title: Integrating Quantum Mechanics and Reactive Force Fields for Enhanced Electrocatalysis Simulations

Abstract:
Accurate simulations of electrocatalytic processes are crucial for understanding nanoparticle interactions at the atomic scale. In 2020, we developed the Reactive Quantum Mechanics (ReQM) method, which seamlessly integrates quantum mechanics (QM) with reactive force fields (ReFF) to simulate electrocatalytic reactions in solvent environments. By combining the strengths of QM and ReFF, ReQM enables accurate descriptions of bond breaking and forming events, while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach leverages the accuracy of QM for reactive regions and the speed of ReFF for the surrounding environment, allowing for large-scale simulations of nanoparticles in explicit solvents. ReQM demonstrates improved predictive capabilities for electrocatalytic reactions, offering a powerful tool for the design of novel nanostructured catalysts. This hybrid methodology has far-reaching implications for the field of electrocatalysis, enabling researchers to explore complex reaction mechanisms with unprecedented accuracy.
