This study investigates telehealth utilization and perceptions among rural populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period that accelerated digital health adoption. A cross-sectional survey of 200 rural residents was conducted in 2022 to assess experiences with and attitudes toward telehealth services. Quantitative analysis revealed predominantly positive user experiences and a strong expressed interest in continued telehealth utilization. A significant correlation was identified, indicating that younger demographic cohorts and individuals reporting substantial geographical and infrastructural barriers to in-person healthcare access demonstrated the highest levels of engagement and satisfaction. These findings suggest that telehealth serves as a viable modality for mitigating health disparities in underserved rural communities. The results underscore the importance of sustaining and expanding digital health infrastructure to improve equitable healthcare access beyond the acute phase of the pandemic.
