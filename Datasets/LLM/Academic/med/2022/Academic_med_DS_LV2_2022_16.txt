**Abstract**

The identification of blood-based biomarkers reflecting early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathological change is a critical objective for enabling scalable screening and clinical trial enrichment. This study investigated the performance of novel plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, p-tau231 and p-tau217, in detecting cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology during the preclinical phase of AD. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of cognitively unimpaired individuals from a prospective cohort, who underwent Aβ-PET imaging to define Aβ status (Aβ+ or Aβ-). Plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 concentrations were measured using validated immunoassays. Our results demonstrate that both plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 accurately differentiate Aβ+ from Aβ- individuals, with p-tau217 showing superior discriminative accuracy. These biomarkers exhibited strong correlations with global Aβ-PET burden, even at the earliest stages of Aβ accumulation. The findings indicate that plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 are sensitive and accessible tools for identifying preclinical AD, highlighting their significant potential for enriching clinical trials targeting the earliest phases of the AD continuum.
