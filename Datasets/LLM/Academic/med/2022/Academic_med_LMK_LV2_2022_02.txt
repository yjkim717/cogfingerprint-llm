Title: Plasma Phospho-Tau231 and Phospho-Tau217 as Biomarkers for Early Amyloid-β Pathology in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease

Abstract:

The identification of reliable biomarkers for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of plasma phospho-tau (p-tau) species as indicators of amyloid-β pathology. This study investigates the utility of plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 in detecting early amyloid-β changes in preclinical AD. Using a cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals, we evaluated the association between plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 levels and amyloid-β pathology assessed by positron emission tomography (PET). Our results demonstrate that both plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 are significantly correlated with amyloid-β burden, suggesting their potential as blood-based biomarkers for preclinical AD. Notably, the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers was comparable to established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers. These findings support the use of plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 as promising tools for detecting early amyloid-β pathology in preclinical AD, facilitating timely intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes.
