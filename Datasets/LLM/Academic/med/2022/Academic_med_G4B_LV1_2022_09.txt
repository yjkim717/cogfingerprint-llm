**Mendelian Randomization Evidence Linking Insomnia to Suicidal Behavior: A Genetic Perspective**

**Abstract:**  Growing epidemiological evidence implicates insomnia as a potential risk factor for adverse mental health outcomes, including suicidal behavior. However, establishing causality remains challenging. This study utilized Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate a potential causal relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation, leveraging genetic data to mitigate confounding bias.  We employed a two-stage MR framework, incorporating both allele-based and genetic summary statistics, to assess the direction of causality. Results indicated a significant, inverse causal effect of insomnia on suicidal behavior (p=0.02), suggesting that reduced sleep duration may be protective. Notably, restless leg syndrome (RLS) did not demonstrate a significant association with suicidal behavior in the MR analysis.  These findings are further strengthened by genetic association studies, revealing consistent correlations between insomnia genetic risk scores and suicidal behavior phenotypes.  Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms mediating this potential causal pathway and to explore the role of RLS as a potential confounder or modifier.
