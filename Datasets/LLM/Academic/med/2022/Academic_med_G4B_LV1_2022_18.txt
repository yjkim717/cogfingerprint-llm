**Abstract**

Contemporary management of breast cancer necessitates adherence to evidence-based guidelines, particularly those established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). This study examines the evolving role of NCCN guidelines in optimizing locoregional treatment strategies for diverse breast cancer subtypes.  Specifically, we address the nuanced approaches to carcinoma in situ (CIS) and early-stage invasive breast cancer, reflecting the increasing complexity of treatment regimens.  The document synthesizes current recommendations regarding surgical techniques, radiation therapy, and systemic therapies, emphasizing patient-specific factors and disease characteristics.  Consistent application of NCCN guidelines is crucial for ensuring standardized clinical practice and improved patient outcomes.  Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these evolving protocols, particularly concerning targeted therapies and personalized medicine approaches within the broader context of locoregional control.
