**Abstract**

The growing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) necessitates the development of reliable biomarkers for early detection and risk stratification. This study investigates the utility of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) isoforms, specifically p-tau231 and p-tau217, as indicators of preclinical AD pathology. Leveraging data from 2022, we observed a robust correlation between elevated levels of these p-tau biomarkers in plasma and demonstrable amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition within the cerebral cortex, as assessed via established neuroimaging techniques.  Notably, individuals exhibiting higher p-tau231 and p-tau217 concentrations demonstrated a significantly increased likelihood of harboring preclinical AD, effectively enriching diagnostic cohorts. 

These findings highlight the potential of plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 as sensitive and specific markers for identifying individuals at risk before the onset of clinical symptoms.  Further research is warranted to refine diagnostic thresholds and explore the dynamic relationship between these biomarkers and evolving Aβ pathology.  Ultimately, the integration of plasma p-tau analysis with existing clinical and neuroimaging modalities may substantially improve early AD detection and facilitate the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
