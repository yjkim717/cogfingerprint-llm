**Assessing the Utility of Plasma Biomarkers for Early and Differential Diagnosis of Alzheimer’s Disease: A Multi-Stage Longitudinal Analysis**

**Background:** The timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical challenge in clinical practice and research. Traditional diagnostic criteria rely heavily on amyloid positron emission tomography (Amyloid-PET) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, which are resource-intensive and may present logistical barriers to widespread clinical implementation.  Plasma biomarkers offer a potentially transformative alternative, but their diagnostic accuracy and ability to reflect disease stage across the AD spectrum require rigorous evaluation. This study aimed to comprehensively assess the performance of readily accessible plasma biomarkers – amyloid-β ratio (Aβ42/40), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181) – in relation to Amyloid-PET positivity and disease stage in a longitudinal cohort.

**Methods:** A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from [mention a hypothetical cohort, e.g., the longitudinal AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort or a similar large-scale study], including individuals spanning the clinical spectrum of AD: cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD dementia. Amyloid-PET scans were utilized as the gold standard for detecting amyloid pathology. Plasma biomarker levels were measured using standardized assays. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each biomarker and biomarker combinations for detecting Amyloid-PET positivity. Furthermore, linear mixed-effects models were employed to examine the longitudinal associations between plasma biomarker trajectories and disease stage, accounting for individual variability and potential confounding factors.  The impact of incorporating GFAP and p-tau181 alongside the Aβ42/40 ratio on diagnostic accuracy and disease staging was also investigated.

**Results:**  Aβ42/40 ratio demonstrated moderate discriminatory power for detecting Amyloid-PET positivity.  Importantly, GFAP and p-tau181 exhibited significantly improved performance, particularly in identifying individuals with preclinical AD (Amyloid-PET positive, cognitively normal).  Combining Aβ42/40 with GFAP and p-tau181 resulted in a substantial increase in diagnostic accuracy and enhanced differentiation between CN, MCI, and AD dementia stages. Longitudinal analyses revealed that elevated GFAP and p-tau181 levels correlated with accelerated cognitive decline, independent of amyloid burden.

**Conclusions:** Our findings support the clinical utility of plasma Aβ42/40, GFAP, and p-tau181 as a minimally invasive and robust panel for detecting amyloid pathology and staging Alzheimer's disease. The enhanced performance observed with the combined biomarker approach underscores the importance of incorporating neuroinflammatory markers (GFAP) and tau pathology markers (p-tau181) alongside amyloid measures for improved diagnostic precision and monitoring of disease progression. Future research should focus on validating these findings in diverse populations and exploring the potential of these biomarkers for therapeutic monitoring.
