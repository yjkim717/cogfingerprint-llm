**Abstract: Contemporary Management Strategies for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: An Analysis Informed by NCCN Guidelines (2022)**

The evolving landscape of breast cancer treatment necessitates regularly updated clinical practice guidelines. This analysis examines contemporary approaches to managing early-stage breast cancer, specifically focusing on ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early-stage invasive breast cancer, drawing heavily on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as of 2022. We explore the nuanced recommendations regarding surgical options (lumpectomy versus mastectomy), adjuvant therapies (endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapies), and radiation therapy, considering factors such as tumor stage, grade, receptor status (ER, PR, HER2), and patient-specific characteristics.  Furthermore, the abstract highlights the increasing emphasis on genomic assays and personalized risk assessment in guiding treatment decisions.  Adherence to NCCN guidelines aims to optimize patient outcomes, minimize treatment-related morbidity, and ensure the delivery of evidence-based care within a multidisciplinary setting. This review underscores the importance of ongoing guideline adaptation in response to emerging research and advancements in breast cancer therapeutics.
