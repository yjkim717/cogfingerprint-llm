The 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for rectal cancer introduce pivotal modifications to the management paradigm for stage II and III disease. This update formally integrates total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) as a cornerstone of treatment, consolidating chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery to enhance pathological complete response (pCR) rates. A significant emphasis is placed on short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) as an efficacious component of TNT regimens. Furthermore, the guidelines provide a structured framework for nonoperative, "watch-and-wait" management in patients achieving a clinical complete response, aiming to mitigate surgical morbidity. These evidence-based refinements prioritize organ preservation and represent a substantive shift towards personalized, response-adaptive treatment algorithms in locally advanced rectal cancer.
