**Abstract:**

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, Version 3.2022, represent a pivotal resource for contemporary breast cancer management. This document meticulously details evidence-based recommendations spanning the spectrum of disease, with particular emphasis on the evolving therapeutic landscape of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early-stage invasive breast cancer. The guidelines address critical decision points, encompassing surgical approaches, adjuvant therapies (endocrine and chemotherapy), and radiation oncology protocols. Furthermore, they incorporate refinements in risk stratification and personalized treatment strategies, reflecting advancements in molecular profiling and prognostic markers. Adherence to these guidelines is anticipated to optimize patient outcomes and standardize care within oncology practices.
