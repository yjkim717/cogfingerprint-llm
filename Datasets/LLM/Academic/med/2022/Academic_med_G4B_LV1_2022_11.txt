**Abstract**

The increasing recognition of the tumor microenvironment’s role in lung cancer progression has spurred investigation into adoptive cell therapies. Specifically, harnessing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) represents a compelling, albeit complex, strategy. This review synthesizes recent advances and identifies critical considerations for the clinical translation of TIL-based immunotherapy. While TILs demonstrate enhanced anti-tumor reactivity compared to peripheral blood lymphocytes, challenges remain regarding patient selection, robust ex vivo expansion protocols, and maintaining TIL functionality post-infusion. Recent clinical trials evaluating TILs, often augmented with immune checkpoint inhibitors, have yielded mixed results, emphasizing the need for standardized methodologies. Future research should prioritize optimizing TIL expansion techniques, elucidating predictive biomarkers for response, and designing combination immunotherapies to overcome immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment.  Continued investigation is vital to fully realize the therapeutic potential of TILs in lung cancer treatment by 2023.
