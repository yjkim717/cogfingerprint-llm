**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of plasticizers, particularly phthalates, within food contact materials (FCMs) presents a growing concern regarding potential human exposure and subsequent adverse health effects. This study undertakes a preliminary risk assessment framework focusing on the prioritization of specific plasticizers for detailed toxicological investigation. Utilizing a tiered approach, we identified a subset of commonly utilized phthalates – encompassing both di- and mono-substituted varieties – exhibiting the highest potential for migration into FCMs based on established physicochemical properties and current regulatory classifications.  Evidence increasingly suggests these compounds can act as endocrine disruptors, potentially interfering with hormonal signaling pathways.  

Given the documented associations between phthalate exposure and reproductive and developmental outcomes, alongside emerging data linking them to metabolic dysfunction, a targeted risk assessment is warranted. This assessment should incorporate quantitative exposure modelling alongside robust *in vitro* and *in vivo* studies evaluating specific mechanisms of action.  Recommendations for enhanced FCM material selection and stricter regulatory oversight of plasticizer usage are proposed to mitigate potential public health risks, particularly for vulnerable populations. Further research in 2023 will focus on refining exposure estimates and elucidating dose-response relationships.

**Note:** I've aimed for a tone and style appropriate for a medical or biomedical research context. I’ve included relevant terminology (e.g., “endocrine disruptors,” “physicochemical properties,” “exposure modelling”) and structured the reasoning logically. Would you like me to adjust the abstract in any way (e.g., focus on a specific aspect, change the tone, or alter the length)?
