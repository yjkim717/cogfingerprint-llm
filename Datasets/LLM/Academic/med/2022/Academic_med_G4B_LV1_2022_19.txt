**Abstract**

Recent revisions to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the management of stage II rectal cancer reflect a growing emphasis on neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) as a cornerstone of treatment. This update acknowledges the increasing evidence supporting CRT’s impact on local disease control, sphincter preservation rates, and subsequent surgical outcomes. Specifically, the document details refined recommendations for patient selection and dosing regimens, incorporating novel molecular markers to potentially predict response. Furthermore, the inclusion of “watch-and-wait” strategies for select stage II patients demonstrates a shift toward a more individualized approach, prioritizing patient preference and minimizing overtreatment.  Continued monitoring and prospective trials are warranted to fully elucidate the optimal sequencing and intensity of neoadjuvant therapy, ultimately aiming to improve patient survival and quality of life within this challenging disease subset.
