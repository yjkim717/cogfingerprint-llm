## Abstract: Telehealth Adoption and the Mitigation of Rural Healthcare Disparities During and Post-Pandemic Conditions

**Background:** The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid adoption of telehealth services, highlighting existing vulnerabilities in rural healthcare delivery and exacerbating pre-existing disparities in access. This study investigates the potential of telehealth to serve as a sustained solution for mitigating these disparities in rural communities. **Methods:** Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including a survey of rural residents (n=350) and qualitative interviews (n=25), we assessed perceptions, experiences, and barriers to telehealth utilization in a geographically diverse sample of rural locations within the United States. Data were collected between June and August 2022. **Results:** Findings indicate a generally positive perception of telehealth among rural residents, with a particularly strong endorsement from younger demographics (18-35 years). Reported benefits included increased convenience, reduced travel time and associated costs, and improved access to specialist care. However, digital literacy, broadband access limitations, and concerns regarding data privacy remained significant barriers. **Conclusion:** Telehealth holds considerable promise in bridging rural healthcare gaps, but targeted interventions addressing digital infrastructure and digital literacy are crucial to ensuring equitable access and maximizing its potential to reduce longstanding health disparities. Further research should focus on long-term impact and integration within existing rural healthcare systems.
