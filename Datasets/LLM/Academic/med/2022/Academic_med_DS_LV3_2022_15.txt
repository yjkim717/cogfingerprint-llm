The COVID-19 pandemic served as a critical catalyst for the rapid integration of telehealth into mainstream healthcare delivery, fundamentally altering care paradigms. This transformation has proven particularly consequential for addressing persistent rural health disparities, where geographic isolation and provider shortages have historically constrained healthcare access. By leveraging digital health technologies, telehealth platforms have demonstrated significant potential in bridging these equity gaps through remote consultations, diagnostic services, and chronic disease management. The sustained adoption beyond initial pandemic exigencies suggests telehealth's viability as a durable framework for equitable healthcare delivery. However, its long-term efficacy in mitigating rural health disparities remains contingent upon resolving infrastructural limitations in broadband connectivity, ensuring digital literacy among vulnerable populations, and establishing reimbursement structures that support sustainable implementation. This analysis contends that when strategically deployed with complementary policy supports, telehealth represents not merely a temporary solution but a transformative modality for achieving health equity across geographically disparate populations.
