**Prevalence of Dental Extractions and Caries in Syrian Refugee Populations: An Observational Study**

**Abstract:**  The displacement and resettlement of Syrian refugees present unique challenges to oral health globally. This observational study, conducted in 2022, examined the incidence of dental extractions and associated caries prevalence among a cohort of Syrian refugee children and adolescents.  Our findings indicate that significant dental extractions were frequently observed, primarily driven by extensive caries lesions and resultant pulpal pathologies.  Analysis revealed a strong correlation between socioeconomic status (SES) and both extraction rates and caries experience; refugee children/adolescents reporting lower SES demonstrated markedly elevated rates of tooth loss and caries.  Specifically, reduced access to preventative dental care, compounded by nutritional deficiencies and suboptimal oral hygiene practices within refugee settings, appears to be a key contributing factor.  The high prevalence of primary tooth extractions suggests a critical need for targeted oral health interventions within this vulnerable population. Further research is warranted to delineate specific risk factors and evaluate the efficacy of culturally adapted preventive programs designed to mitigate the detrimental effects of dental disease and extraction on overall health and well-being.
