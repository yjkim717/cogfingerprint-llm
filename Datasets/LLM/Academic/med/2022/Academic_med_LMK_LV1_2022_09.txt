Title: Exploring the Causal Link between Insomnia Symptoms and Suicidal Behavior: A Mendelian Randomization Study

Abstract:

Insomnia symptoms are a prevalent complaint among individuals with psychiatric disorders, particularly major depressive disorder (MDD). Recent observational studies have suggested a positive correlation between insomnia symptoms and increased risk of suicidal behavior. However, the causal nature of this association remains unclear due to the presence of confounding variables and reverse causality. To address this knowledge gap, we employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal relationship between insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior, leveraging genetic evidence to inform our analysis.

Using summary-level data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we selected genetic variants associated with insomnia symptoms as instrumental variables (IVs) to predict the risk of suicidal behavior. Our analysis included 462,341 individuals of European ancestry, with 133,010 cases of insomnia symptoms and 3,474 cases of suicidal behavior. We applied a two-sample MR design, utilizing the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as our primary analysis, and conducted sensitivity analyses using MR-Egger regression and weighted median estimation to assess the robustness of our findings.

Our results provide strong evidence for a causal relationship between genetically predicted insomnia symptoms and increased risk of suicidal behavior (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.42-2.11, P = 2.35 × 10^(-7)). Notably, the causal effect remained significant after adjusting for the potential mediating effect of MDD (OR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.17-1.80, P = 6.45 × 10^(-4)). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of our findings, with no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity.

Our study provides genetic evidence supporting a potentially causal relationship between insomnia symptoms and increased risk of suicidal behavior, independent of MDD. These findings have significant implications for the prevention and treatment of suicidal behavior, highlighting the importance of addressing insomnia symptoms as a modifiable risk factor. Clinicians and healthcare policymakers should prioritize the development of targeted interventions aimed at alleviating insomnia symptoms, particularly among high-risk populations. Furthermore, future research should focus on elucidating the underlying biological mechanisms linking insomnia symptoms to suicidal behavior, with the ultimate goal of informing the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

In conclusion, our MR study demonstrates a causal link between insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior, underscoring the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing sleep disturbances in psychiatric care. By leveraging genetic evidence, we can better understand the complex relationships between insomnia symptoms, MDD, and suicidal behavior, ultimately informing the development of more effective prevention and treatment strategies.
