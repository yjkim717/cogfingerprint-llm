This 2022 NCCN Guideline update presents evidence-based recommendations for locoregional management of ductal carcinoma in situ and early-stage invasive breast cancer. Through systematic literature review and multidisciplinary expert consensus, we establish standardized protocols for surgical margins, axillary staging, and radiation therapy sequencing. Key revisions address the expanding role of breast-conserving surgery with contemporary radiotherapy techniques and refined sentinel lymph node biopsy indications. These comprehensive algorithms aim to optimize local disease control while minimizing treatment morbidity, providing clinicians with current, actionable guidance for personalized therapeutic decision-making in routine practice.
