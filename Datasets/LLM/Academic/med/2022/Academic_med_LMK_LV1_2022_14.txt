Title: Assessing the Prevalence and Determinants of Dental Extraction among Syrian Refugee Children in Zaatari Camp, Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study

Abstract:

Background: Dental caries remains a pervasive oral health issue among refugee populations, particularly in children. The Zaatari camp in Jordan, hosting a significant number of Syrian refugees, presents a unique setting to investigate the oral health status of this vulnerable group.

Objectives: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of dental extraction and its associated sociodemographic factors among Syrian refugee children residing in Zaatari camp.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2022 among 322 Syrian refugee children aged 6-12 years. A structured questionnaire was administered to gather information on sociodemographic characteristics, oral hygiene practices, and dental history. Clinical examinations were performed to assess the presence of dental caries and evidence of dental extraction. Toothbrushing frequency and other oral hygiene habits were also recorded.

Results: The study revealed a high prevalence of dental caries (87.3%) and dental extraction (43.2%) among the participants. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified significant associations between dental extraction and older age (OR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.7), lower socioeconomic status (OR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.1-3.1), infrequent toothbrushing (OR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.4-4.4), and previous dental pain experience (OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.8-5.6).

Conclusion: The findings underscore the need for targeted oral health interventions and accessible dental care services for Syrian refugee children in Zaatari camp. Emphasis should be placed on promoting regular toothbrushing practices, improving socioeconomic conditions, and providing timely dental treatment to prevent unnecessary dental extractions. The results have implications for informing oral health policies and programs for refugee populations.
