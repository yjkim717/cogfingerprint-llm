## Plasma Biomarkers for Amyloid Pathology Detection in Alzheimer's Disease: A Comparative Analysis of GFAP and p-tau181 Stability

**Abstract**

The timely and accurate detection of amyloid pathology is crucial for early diagnosis and potential therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While amyloid PET imaging remains the gold standard for *in vivo* assessment, its accessibility and cost pose significant limitations. Consequently, there is considerable interest in developing reliable and accessible blood-based biomarkers. This study, conducted in 2022, investigated the accuracy and robustness of several plasma biomarkers in reflecting amyloid burden in a cohort of individuals at varying stages of AD, comparing the performance of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181) with established amyloid-specific markers.  We hypothesized that GFAP and p-tau181, reflecting neuroinflammation and tau pathology respectively, would demonstrate greater stability and reduced inter-assay variability compared to direct amyloid measures in plasma.

Utilizing a longitudinal cohort of cognitively normal individuals, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients diagnosed with AD, we analyzed plasma samples for amyloid-β42/40 ratio, GFAP, and p-tau181, alongside concurrent amyloid PET imaging data. Statistical analyses, including Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients, were employed to assess the agreement and variability between plasma biomarkers and PET tracers. Our findings reveal a significant correlation between plasma amyloid-β42/40 ratio and amyloid PET SUVR, confirming its utility as a surrogate marker. However, we observed notable inter-assay variability in amyloid-β measurements.  In contrast, GFAP and p-tau181 demonstrated remarkably improved stability and lower variability across different assay platforms. These observations suggest that while amyloid-β ratio provides valuable information, the added robustness of GFAP and p-tau181 may enhance the overall diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of plasma biomarkers in AD, particularly for longitudinal monitoring and clinical trial recruitment. Further research is warranted to validate these findings in larger and more diverse populations and to explore their combined predictive power in relation to disease progression.
