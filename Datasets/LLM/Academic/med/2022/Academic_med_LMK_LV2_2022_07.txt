This article presents a corrigendum to the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of diffuse gliomas in adults. The correction aims to rectify inaccuracies in the original publication, ensuring the dissemination of accurate information for the management of adulthood gliomas. By revisiting the established protocols for glioma treatment, this correction enhances the reliability of EANO guidelines, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes in the context of diffuse glioma care.
