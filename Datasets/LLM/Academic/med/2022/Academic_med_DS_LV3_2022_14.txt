**Title:** Socioeconomic Determinants and Etiological Factors in Dental Extractions Among Syrian Refugee Children in Jordan: A 2022 Observational Analysis

**Introduction:** The oral health of displaced populations represents a critical yet understudied dimension of global public health. This 2022 observational study investigates the primary indications for dental extraction and their association with socioeconomic and behavioral factors among Syrian refugee children residing in Jordan.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on a cohort of 322 pediatric refugees. Data were collected through clinical examinations and structured interviews to document extraction indications, socioeconomic status (SES), and oral hygiene practices. Indications were categorized as dental caries, pulpal/periapical diseases, trauma, or other pathologies.

**Results:** The analysis identified dental caries and its sequelae, specifically pulpal necrosis and periapical periodontitis, as the predominant etiological factors, accounting for 78% of all extractions. The high prevalence of untreated carious lesions highlights a significant failure in early intervention and access to restorative care. Multivariate regression revealed a strong, statistically significant correlation (p<0.01) between lower socioeconomic status—measured by parental education, household income, and overcrowding—and increased extraction rates. Furthermore, poor oral hygiene, characterized by infrequent brushing and no reported dental visits in the preceding year, was independently associated with a 2.3-fold higher risk of requiring an extraction compared to children with moderate-to-good hygiene practices. This suggests that behavioral factors compound the structural barriers imposed by poverty.

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate that for this vulnerable cohort, tooth loss is not merely a biological endpoint of disease but a direct consequence of intersecting socioeconomic deprivation and inadequate preventive care. The high extraction rate from preventable conditions like caries underscores an urgent need for targeted public health interventions. These should integrate community-based preventive programs, such as topical fluoride applications and oral health education, with efforts to improve economic stability and healthcare access, thereby mitigating a key driver of health inequality in refugee settings.
