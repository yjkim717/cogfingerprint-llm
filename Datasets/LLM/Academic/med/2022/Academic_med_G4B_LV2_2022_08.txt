**Abstract**

The management of advanced gastric cancer continues to evolve, necessitating adherence to updated clinical guidelines. This analysis synthesizes the 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for patients with unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma. The core of these recommendations centers on integrating systemic therapy, primarily utilizing targeted agents, within a multidisciplinary approach.  Critically, the guidelines underscore the increasing importance of biomarker testing – specifically, PD-L1 expression and RAS/MAPK pathway alterations – to inform treatment selection.  Prioritization of first-line systemic therapy, often incorporating platinum-based chemotherapy alongside targeted agents, is strongly advocated, contingent upon individual patient characteristics and biomarker profiles.  The document details specific considerations for patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors, highlighting the potential benefits of immune checkpoint inhibitors.  Ultimately, these 2022 NCCN guidelines represent a shift toward personalized medicine, emphasizing tailored systemic regimens guided by robust molecular profiling to optimize patient outcomes in this challenging disease subset.
