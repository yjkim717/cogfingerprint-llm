**Abstract: Personalized Systemic Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer â€“ The Expanding Role of Biomarker Identification**

The evolving landscape of metastatic breast cancer treatment necessitates a shift towards personalized medicine. Recent advancements in systemic therapies demand robust predictive biomarkers to optimize patient selection and maximize treatment efficacy. This analysis synthesizes findings from the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline update, emphasizing the critical role of biomarker testing in guiding therapeutic decisions. 

Specifically, the guideline highlights the increasing importance of evaluating for *PIK3CA* mutations, frequently associated with response to PI3K inhibitors, and *BRCA1/2* mutations, predictive of sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. Furthermore, the identification of *NTRK* gene fusions is now routinely recommended, as these patients demonstrate significant benefit from tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitors. 

The rationale underpinning these recommendations stems from the growing understanding of the heterogeneous molecular profiles within metastatic breast cancer. Integrating comprehensive biomarker panels allows clinicians to stratify patients based on their likelihood of responding to targeted therapies, minimizing unnecessary exposure to ineffective treatments and associated toxicities.  Future research should focus on expanding biomarker panels and validating their clinical utility across diverse patient populations and treatment regimens, ultimately driving improved patient outcomes in this challenging disease.
