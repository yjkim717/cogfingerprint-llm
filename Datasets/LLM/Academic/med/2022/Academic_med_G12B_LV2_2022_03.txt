**Abstract**

**Assessing the Analytical Robustness and Clinical Utility of Plasma Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease: A Comparative Evaluation of Aβ42/40 Ratio, GFAP, and p-Tau181**

**Background:** Accurate and reliable detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology using minimally invasive methods is crucial for early diagnosis, patient stratification, and monitoring disease progression, particularly in the context of emerging therapeutic interventions. Plasma-based biomarkers offer a promising alternative to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis for assessing AD-related pathology, but their analytical variability across different assay platforms remains a significant challenge. This study aimed to evaluate the analytical robustness and comparative performance of three key plasma biomarkers – the amyloid-β 42/40 ratio (Aβ42/40), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-Tau181) – across multiple assay methodologies.

**Methods:**  Plasma samples from a cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals with AD dementia were analyzed using standardized protocols on three distinct immunoassay platforms.  Coefficient of variation (CV) analysis was performed to assess inter-assay variability.  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each biomarker and their combinations for differentiating between control and AD groups.  Furthermore, longitudinal data was examined to assess the stability of each biomarker over time.

**Results:** Our findings demonstrate significant inter-assay variability for the Aβ42/40 ratio, with substantially higher CVs compared to GFAP and p-Tau181 (p < 0.001).  GFAP and p-Tau181 exhibited significantly improved analytical robustness, demonstrating greater consistency across different assay platforms.  Diagnostic accuracy, as measured by area under the ROC curve (AUC), was highest for p-Tau181 (AUC = 0.92), followed by GFAP (AUC = 0.88), and Aβ42/40 (AUC = 0.75).  Longitudinal analysis revealed that changes in GFAP and p-Tau181 correlated more strongly with disease progression compared to fluctuations in the Aβ42/40 ratio.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the critical importance of analytical standardization when utilizing plasma biomarkers for AD diagnosis and monitoring.  The observed superior stability and diagnostic accuracy of GFAP and p-Tau181 suggest their potential as more reliable biomarkers for AD assessment, particularly within routine clinical practice. Future research should focus on harmonizing assays globally and validating these findings in larger, more diverse cohorts to facilitate widespread clinical implementation and enable more precise patient management in the context of emerging AD therapies.
