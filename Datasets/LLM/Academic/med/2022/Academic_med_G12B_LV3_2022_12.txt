**Abstract**

This longitudinal observational cohort study, conducted in 2022, investigated the long-term efficacy of metabolic surgery compared to conventional medical therapy and lifestyle interventions in the management of type 2 diabetes. Utilizing data aggregated from multiple preceding randomized controlled trials, we assessed outcomes at three years post-intervention. Findings demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful advantage for metabolic surgery in achieving and maintaining diabetes remission, defined as HbA1c <6.5% without pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, patients undergoing metabolic surgery exhibited superior glycemic control, substantial and sustained weight reduction, and improvements in key metabolic biomarkers, including insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles. These results reinforce the growing evidence supporting metabolic surgery as a highly effective therapeutic strategy for select individuals with type 2 diabetes, potentially offering a durable solution beyond the limitations of conventional medical management. Further research should focus on identifying optimal patient selection criteria to maximize the benefits of this approach.
