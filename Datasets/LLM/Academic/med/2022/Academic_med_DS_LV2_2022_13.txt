**Abstract**

The pervasive use of phthalates as plasticisers in food contact materials (FCMs) constitutes a significant and ongoing public health concern due to their well-documented role as endocrine disruptors. Human exposure occurs primarily through the ingestion of contaminated food and beverages, leading to ubiquitous internal exposure. In response to mounting toxicological evidence, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has undertaken a systematic re-evaluation of the risks associated with these compounds. This review synthesises the methodology and key findings of EFSAâ€™s 2022 prioritisation exercise for plasticisers in FCMs. The agency employed a structured, tiered approach, initially screening substances based on their regulatory authorisation status for use in FCMs within the European Union. Subsequently, a rigorous hazard-based prioritisation was conducted, leveraging established classification systems such as the CLP Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008. This process focused on compounds with evidence of carcinogenic, mutagenic, reprotoxic (CMR), or endocrine-disrupting properties. The outcome was a refined list of high-priority phthalates and related substances slated for comprehensive risk assessment. This prioritisation is critical for directing finite resources towards the most hazardous compounds, thereby enabling targeted risk management decisions. The findings underscore the imperative for evidence-based regulatory policies to mitigate population-wide exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals from dietary sources. Future research must continue to elucidate the long-term health implications of chronic low-dose exposure, particularly during vulnerable developmental windows.
