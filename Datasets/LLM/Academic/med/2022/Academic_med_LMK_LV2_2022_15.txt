Title: Leveraging Telehealth to Mitigate Rural Healthcare Disparities: A Pathway to Enhanced Healthcare Equity

Abstract:
Rural populations continue to face significant barriers to accessing healthcare services, exacerbating rural healthcare disparities. The advent of telehealth has emerged as a promising strategy to bridge this gap. As of 2022, the integration of telehealth technologies has demonstrated potential in enhancing healthcare access and equity for rural communities. By facilitating remote consultations and monitoring, telehealth can mitigate geographical and socio-economic constraints that hinder healthcare utilization. This abstract posits that telehealth can play a pivotal role in reducing rural healthcare disparities by improving access to specialized care, chronic disease management, and preventive services. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature and empirical evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that telehealth can be a critical component in achieving healthcare equity for rural populations, thereby informing policy and practice initiatives aimed at addressing the complex healthcare needs of these underserved communities.
