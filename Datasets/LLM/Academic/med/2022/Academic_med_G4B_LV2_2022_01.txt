**Abstract**

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing healthcare disparities, particularly within rural communities, highlighting critical limitations in healthcare access. This study investigates the role of telehealth as a potential intervention to mitigate these rural health disparities. Utilizing survey data collected in 2022, we examined the perceived utility and acceptability of telehealth services among rural dwellers. Preliminary findings suggest a strong correlation between telehealth implementation and improved healthcare access for this underserved population. Specifically, respondents reported increased convenience, reduced travel burdens, and enhanced engagement with healthcare providers via virtual platforms. 

However, challenges remain, including digital literacy barriers and infrastructural limitations impacting consistent connectivity.  Further research is warranted to assess the long-term efficacy of telehealth in achieving equitable healthcare outcomes and to develop targeted strategies addressing these systemic obstacles.  Ultimately, this work underscores telehealthâ€™s potential, contingent upon equitable access and supportive policy frameworks, to contribute towards reducing rural health disparities.
