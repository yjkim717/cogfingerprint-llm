## Abstract: Evolving Management Strategies for Localized Rectal Cancer: An Assessment of Contemporary NCCN Guidelines and Emerging Watch-and-Wait Approaches

**Background:** The management of localized rectal cancer has undergone substantial evolution, driven by advancements in surgical techniques and a growing emphasis on minimizing treatment-related morbidity. This analysis examines the key updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for rectal cancer, specifically focusing on the revised recommendations for malignant polyps and resectable disease, as of 2022.

**Methods:** A comprehensive review of the 2022 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Rectal Cancer was conducted, analyzing alterations in treatment algorithms, particularly concerning the integration of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNAT) and short-course radiation therapy (SCRT). Furthermore, we investigated the increasing adoption of non-operative management strategies, specifically the “watch-and-wait” approach for select patients demonstrating clinical complete response following neoadjuvant treatment.

**Results & Conclusion:** The updated guidelines emphasize TNAT as a preferred approach for many resectable rectal cancers, reflecting emerging evidence supporting improved local control and survival.  SCRT remains a viable option, particularly in specific clinical contexts.  Crucially, the expanded criteria for patient selection in watch-and-wait protocols represent a paradigm shift, potentially avoiding surgery and its associated complications in appropriately selected individuals.  Further prospective studies are warranted to refine patient selection and long-term outcomes within these evolving treatment landscapes.
