**Abstract**

The emergence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy represents a pivotal advancement in the therapeutic landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly for patients with disease progression on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). While ICI-refractory NSCLC portends a poor prognosis, adoptive cell transfer utilizing autologous TILs leverages the inherent diversity of the endogenous T-cell repertoire to target patient-specific neoantigens. Recent clinical trials in 2022 have substantiated the potent anti-tumor activity and durable response rates of TIL therapy in this challenging cohort, offering a mechanism to overcome primary and acquired resistance pathways. However, the clinical scalability of this personalized modality is significantly hampered by substantial logistical complexities. These include the necessity for invasive tumor resection to harvest lymphocytes, the technically demanding and time-intensive process of ex vivo TIL expansion and activation, and the requirement for lymphodepleting preconditioning regimens prior to reinfusion. Consequently, while TIL therapy holds considerable promise as a salvage intervention, its widespread implementation necessitates innovations in manufacturing automation and biomarker-driven patient selection to mitigate existing operational bottlenecks and fully realize its potential in thoracic oncology.
