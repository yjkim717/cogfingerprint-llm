**Abstract**

The evolving landscape of breast cancer management necessitates robust, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. This study examines the application of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines in 2022 for the strategic locoregional management of breast cancer. Specifically, we analyze recommendations pertaining to early-stage invasive breast cancers and carcinoma in situ (CIS), recognizing these as distinct entities requiring tailored therapeutic approaches.  Adherence to NCCN guidelines facilitates standardized patient care, optimizing outcomes through multidisciplinary collaboration.  The document details considerations for surgical resection, adjuvant therapies, and monitoring strategies, emphasizing the importance of individualized treatment plans.  Further research is warranted to assess the impact of these guidelines on patient survival and quality of life, particularly concerning emerging biomarkers and targeted therapies influencing locoregional disease control.
