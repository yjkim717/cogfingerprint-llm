**Abstract**

The early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for effective therapeutic intervention and disease management. This study, conducted in 2022, evaluated the clinical utility of circulating plasma biomarkers – amyloid-beta ratio (Aβ42/40), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and phosphorylated tau at position 181 (p-tau181) – in identifying amyloid pathology across the AD spectrum. Utilizing a cohort of participants with varying degrees of cognitive impairment and amyloid positivity as confirmed by amyloid PET imaging, we assessed the diagnostic accuracy of each biomarker individually and in combination. Furthermore, we simulated inter-assay variability to evaluate the robustness of these biomarkers in a clinical setting characterized by potential analytical variation. Results demonstrated that p-tau181 exhibited the strongest correlation with amyloid PET positivity, particularly in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). While Aβ42/40 showed discriminatory power, its performance was enhanced when combined with GFAP, indicating a potential role for GFAP in reflecting neuroinflammatory processes associated with amyloid deposition.  Multi-biomarker panels incorporating p-tau181 and either Aβ42/40 or GFAP yielded significantly improved diagnostic accuracy compared to single biomarkers. These findings suggest that readily accessible plasma biomarkers, particularly p-tau181, hold substantial promise for facilitating early AD diagnosis and informing patient stratification in clinical trials, although further validation in larger, diverse cohorts is warranted.
