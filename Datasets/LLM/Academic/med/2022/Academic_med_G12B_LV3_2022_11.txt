**Abstract**

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy represents a promising, albeit complex, therapeutic approach for lung cancer, particularly in the context of escalating immunotherapy resistance observed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This review, conducted in 2022, synthesizes current evidence regarding the clinical efficacy of TIL therapy within this challenging patient population. While initial clinical trials have demonstrated encouraging response rates and durable remissions in select NSCLC subtypes, significant hurdles remain in optimizing TIL product generation, expansion, and adoptive transfer protocols.  Variability in TIL composition and functionality across patients contributes to heterogeneous treatment outcomes. Furthermore, strategies to overcome immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and enhance TIL persistence *in vivo* are crucial areas of ongoing investigation. Recent advancements in TIL engineering, including genetic modification to improve targeting and cytokine secretion, hold potential for augmenting therapeutic efficacy.  This review explores these advancements alongside a critical evaluation of ongoing clinical trials assessing TIL therapy in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors and other modalities. Ultimately, refining patient selection criteria and standardizing TIL manufacturing processes are essential for realizing the full potential of TIL therapy as a personalized and effective treatment option for lung cancer.
