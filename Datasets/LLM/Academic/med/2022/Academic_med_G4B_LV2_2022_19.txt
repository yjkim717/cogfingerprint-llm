**Abstract**

The 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines represent a significant evolution in the management of locally advanced rectal cancer. This update emphasizes the increasing role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy as a cornerstone of treatment strategy, particularly for patients with stage II and III disease. Prior to definitive surgical resection, neoadjuvant therapy aims to reduce tumor burden, improve pathologic complete response rates, and ultimately enhance long-term outcomes.  Furthermore, the guidelines delineate a growing acceptance of a “watch-and-wait” approach – also known as active surveillance – for select patients with early-stage, low-risk rectal cancers, minimizing immediate intervention.  Careful patient selection based on factors such as tumor characteristics and risk stratification remains crucial.  These revisions reflect a shift towards more aggressive, individualized treatment paradigms, reflecting ongoing research demonstrating the efficacy of neoadjuvant strategies and the potential benefits of delaying definitive treatment in carefully chosen patients.
