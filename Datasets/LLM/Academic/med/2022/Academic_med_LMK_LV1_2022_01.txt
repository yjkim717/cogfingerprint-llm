Title: Evaluating Telehealth as a Sustainable Solution to Mitigate Rural Healthcare Disparities

Abstract:

Rural healthcare disparities persist as a pressing concern, exacerbated by geographical and socioeconomic factors. Telehealth has emerged as a promising strategy to address these inequities. A cross-sectional survey conducted in 2022 among rural dwellers (n = 1,200) assessed their experiences with telehealth services. The results indicate a significant proportion of respondents reported positive experiences, with younger individuals (18-44 years) exhibiting higher satisfaction rates (85.3%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that telehealth utilization was associated with reduced travel time (Î² = -0.23, p < 0.01) and increased access to specialist care (OR = 2.15, 95% CI: 1.43-3.23). The findings suggest that telehealth can be a viable, long-term solution to bridge the rural healthcare gap, promoting equitable healthcare access and outcomes. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, integrating telehealth into rural healthcare infrastructure is crucial to addressing the persistent disparities and ensuring sustainable, patient-centered care.
