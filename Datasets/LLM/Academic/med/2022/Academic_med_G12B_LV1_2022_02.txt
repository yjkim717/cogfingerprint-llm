**Plasma Phosphorylated Tau Biomarkers (p-Tau231 and p-Tau217) as Predictive Indicators of Early Amyloid-β Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease: Implications for Preclinical Trial Design**

**Abstract**

The development of effective therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) necessitates early intervention, ideally before the onset of significant clinical symptoms.  Current diagnostic and trial entry criteria often rely on established amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathologies, yet identifying individuals in the preclinical stages of AD remains a critical challenge. This study investigates the utility of plasma phosphorylated tau isoforms, specifically p-tau231 and p-tau217, as biomarkers reflecting the presence and progression of underlying cerebral Aβ pathology. Leveraging data from longitudinal cohort studies, we evaluated the correlation between plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 levels and subsequent Aβ burden as assessed by amyloid PET imaging. Our findings demonstrate a robust and significant association between elevated plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 concentrations and increased Aβ deposition in specific brain regions, even in individuals exhibiting no overt cognitive decline. Critically, p-tau217 showed a particularly strong predictive capacity.  These results suggest that plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 represent valuable, minimally invasive tools for identifying individuals at increased risk of developing AD and potentially for enriching participant pools in preclinical AD clinical trials focused on disease-modifying therapies. Further research is warranted to determine optimal cut-off values and to assess the prognostic accuracy of these biomarkers in diverse populations. The potential for early identification enabled by these biomarkers could substantially improve the efficiency and success rate of future AD therapeutic interventions.
