Title: Enhancing Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation with Deep Learning and Multi-Parametric MRI

Abstract:
Accurate segmentation of pediatric brain tumors is crucial for effective treatment planning and outcome prediction. Leveraging advancements in deep learning and multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), this study presents a novel automated segmentation framework. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of pediatric brain tumor cases, our deep learning-based approach integrates information from multiple MRI sequences to delineate tumor subregions with high precision. The proposed method achieved superior performance in distinguishing distinct tumor subregions, including the enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, and necrotic core. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated significant improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to conventional methods. By harnessing the strengths of deep learning and multi-parametric MRI, our framework offers a promising tool for enhancing diagnostic precision and informing clinical decision-making in pediatric neuro-oncology, as evidenced by our results from 2022 data.
