Adhering to the 2022 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines, the clinical management of breast cancer emphasizes tailored approaches for distinct histological subtypes. Ductal carcinoma in situ, a noninvasive precursor, requires careful monitoring, whereas invasive ductal carcinoma necessitates comprehensive treatment strategies. This guideline-informed paradigm ensures optimal patient outcomes by integrating evidence-based recommendations for varied breast cancer presentations, thereby standardizing care for improved efficacy.
