**Abstract**

The persistent challenge of healthcare access disparities in rural communities necessitates innovative solutions. This study, conducted in 2022, examines the efficacy of telehealth interventions in mitigating these inequalities. Utilizing survey data and qualitative interviews, our research investigates resident experiences with telehealth services and assesses shifts in attitudes toward remote care delivery. Findings indicate a notable increase in telehealth adoption and positive perceptions, particularly among younger demographics within rural populations. These results suggest that telehealth holds considerable promise as a strategy to enhance healthcare access and promote health equity in geographically isolated areas. Further research is warranted to explore sustainable implementation models, address digital literacy barriers, and evaluate the long-term impact of telehealth on health outcomes and overall well-being within rural communities, especially in the context of ongoing public health crises like COVID-19.
