**Abstract**

The 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Rectal Cancer represent a significant evolution in treatment paradigms for localized disease.  Specifically, the guidelines prioritize a shift towards neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy, particularly total neoadjuvant therapy, for patients with stage II and stage III rectal cancer.  This strategic approach aims to enhance local control rates and improve pathological downstaging.  Furthermore, the updated recommendations incorporate advancements in radiation oncology techniques, including intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and expanded consideration of ‘watch-and-wait’ strategies – also known as active surveillance – for select patients with lower-risk malignant polyps.  Adherence to these revised NCCN guidelines is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes.  Continued research evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of these intensified neoadjuvant regimens is warranted, alongside robust standardization of ‘watch-and-wait’ protocols to ensure consistent application across diverse clinical settings.
