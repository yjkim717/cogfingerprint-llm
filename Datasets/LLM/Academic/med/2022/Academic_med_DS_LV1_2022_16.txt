**Title:** Comparative Performance of Plasma Phosphorylated Tau231 and Tau217 as Early Detectors of Amyloid-β Pathology in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease

**Abstract**

The identification of blood-based biomarkers capable of detecting Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its preclinical phase is a critical objective for enabling early intervention. This study directly compared the performance of two promising plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, p-tau231 and p-tau217, in identifying underlying amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology in cognitively unimpaired older adults. We hypothesized that both biomarkers would demonstrate high accuracy, with p-tau217 potentially offering superior discriminative power. A cohort of 300 participants underwent positron emission tomography (PET) for Aβ, serving as the reference standard, and contemporaneous blood sampling for p-tau analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses revealed that both plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 significantly differentiated Aβ-PET positive from Aβ-PET negative individuals (areas under the curve [AUCs] >0.90). Notably, plasma p-tau217 exhibited a significantly higher AUC compared to p-tau231 (p<0.01) and showed stronger correlations with global Aβ-PET burden. These findings, generated in 2022, substantiate that plasma p-tau species are sensitive early indicators of AD-related pathological change. We conclude that while plasma p-tau231 is a robust biomarker, p-tau217 demonstrates superior performance for detecting incipient Aβ pathology in the preclinical stage, enhancing its potential utility in clinical trials and future screening paradigms.
