**Abstract**

This observational study, conducted in 2022, examined the prevalence and determinants of dental extractions among 322 Syrian refugee children and adolescents residing in the Zaatari refugee camp, Jordan. The study aimed to identify key factors influencing the need for irreversible dental procedures within this vulnerable population. Results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the number of dental extractions and lower levels of parental education (p<0.05). Furthermore, toothbrushing frequency emerged as a crucial mediating factor, with less frequent oral hygiene practices associated with a higher likelihood of extractions. Dental caries and pulpal diseases were identified as the predominant underlying pathologies necessitating surgical intervention. These findings underscore the critical need for targeted oral health interventions, including preventative programs and health education initiatives focused on improving parental awareness and promoting consistent toothbrushing habits to mitigate the burden of dental extractions within Syrian refugee communities.
