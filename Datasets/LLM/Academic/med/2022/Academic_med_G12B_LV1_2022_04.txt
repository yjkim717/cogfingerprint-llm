**Abstract**

**Contemporary Management Strategies for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: An Evidence-Based Review Informed by NCCN Guidelines (2022)**

The optimal management of early-stage breast cancer, encompassing ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early invasive disease, remains a complex and evolving area of oncology. This review synthesizes current evidence and examines recommendations delineated within the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, updated through 2022.  We explore contemporary approaches to risk stratification, including genomic assays for DCIS, and their impact on surgical decision-making (lumpectomy versus mastectomy).  Furthermore, we address adjuvant therapies – endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted agents – considering factors such as tumor stage, grade, lymph node involvement, and biomarker status (ER, PR, HER2).  The abstract highlights the increasing emphasis on personalized medicine and de-escalation strategies, aiming to maximize patient outcomes while minimizing treatment-related toxicities.  Finally, we discuss ongoing research investigating novel therapeutic targets and refining prognostic models to further improve clinical management of this heterogeneous disease.
