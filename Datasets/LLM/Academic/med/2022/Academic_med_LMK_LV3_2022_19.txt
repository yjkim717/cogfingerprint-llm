The 2022 NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer have incorporated recent evidence to recommend total neoadjuvant therapy as a standard treatment approach. For patients achieving a complete clinical response to neoadjuvant therapy, nonoperative management is now considered a viable alternative. This paradigm shift in clinical practice reflects a more personalized treatment strategy, prioritizing organ preservation and minimizing morbidity. The updated guidelines underscore the evolving landscape of rectal cancer management, emphasizing the need for multidisciplinary care and rigorous patient selection criteria to optimize outcomes.
