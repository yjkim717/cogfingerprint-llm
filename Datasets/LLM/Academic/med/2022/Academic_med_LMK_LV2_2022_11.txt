Title: Evaluating Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Efficacy, Challenges, and Future Directions

Abstract:
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic approach for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. This review aims to assess the efficacy and challenges associated with TIL therapy in NSCLC, contextualizing its potential within the current landscape of cancer treatment. By examining recent clinical trials and comparative studies with immune checkpoint inhibitors, we elucidate the therapeutic benefits and limitations of TIL therapy. Our analysis reveals that while TIL therapy demonstrates significant promise, particularly in patients refractory to conventional treatments, its widespread adoption is hindered by manufacturing complexities, tumor heterogeneity, and the need for personalized treatment protocols. This review underscores the necessity for continued research into optimizing TIL therapy, highlighting its potential to augment existing treatment paradigms for NSCLC and improve patient outcomes.
