Title: Assessing the Reliability of Plasma Biomarkers in Detecting Alzheimer's Disease Pathology Across Disease Stages and Assay Variability

Abstract:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, among other hallmarks. Recent advances in the field have highlighted the potential of plasma biomarkers in detecting AD pathology, offering a minimally invasive and cost-effective alternative to traditional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and neuroimaging modalities. However, the robustness of plasma biomarkers across different disease stages and their susceptibility to inter-assay variability remain understudied. This study aimed to investigate the reliability of plasma biomarkers in detecting Aβ pathology across the AD continuum and to evaluate the impact of assay variability on biomarker performance.

We analyzed plasma samples from a cohort of 250 participants, comprising individuals with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and AD dementia, as well as age-matched controls. We measured plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) using three different immunoassay platforms. The results were compared to Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) scans, considered the gold standard for detecting Aβ pathology.

Our findings indicate that plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, NfL, and GFAP are significantly associated with Aβ PET status, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) values ranging from 0.75 to 0.85, depending on the assay platform used. Notably, the performance of these biomarkers varied across disease stages, with the plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio showing higher accuracy in detecting Aβ pathology in early-stage AD. Furthermore, our analysis revealed significant inter-assay variability in biomarker measurements, with coefficients of variation ranging from 10% to 25%. This variability substantially impacted the classification accuracy of biomarker models, with AUC-ROC values decreasing by up to 0.15 when using assay platforms with higher variability.

Our study underscores the potential of plasma biomarkers in detecting AD pathology, particularly in early disease stages. However, it also highlights the critical need for standardization and validation of assay platforms to minimize inter-assay variability. By developing and implementing robust biomarker models that account for assay variability, we can improve the accuracy and reliability of plasma biomarkers in AD diagnosis and monitoring, ultimately facilitating their integration into clinical practice.
