Title: Deep Learning-Based Automated Segmentation of Pediatric Brain Tumors using Multi-Parametric MRI

Abstract:

Pediatric brain tumors remain a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Accurate segmentation of tumor subregions is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome prediction. Manual segmentation, however, is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and prone to errors. This study presents a deep learning-based method for automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and trained on a dataset of multi-parametric MRI scans, comprising T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences. The network was optimized to segment tumor subregions, including the enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, and edema. The performance of the CNN was evaluated on an independent test dataset using metrics such as Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed method achieved a mean DSC of 0.85 ± 0.05, 0.78 ± 0.08, and 0.82 ± 0.06 for the enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, and edema, respectively. The results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the deep learning-based method for automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors. The proposed approach has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric brain tumors by providing accurate and reproducible tumor subregion segmentation, thereby facilitating personalized medicine and outcome prediction. This study highlights the potential of deep learning techniques in medical imaging analysis and paves the way for future research in this field.
