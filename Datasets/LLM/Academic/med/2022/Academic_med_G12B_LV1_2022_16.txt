Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a medical journal, and contextualized for 2022. I've aimed for precision and a structured argument, roughly around the 231-word target.  I've included some hypothetical data points to make it more concrete (though these would need to be replaced with actual findings in a real paper).

**Plasma Phosphorylation-Tau Biomarkers as Indicators of Early Amyloid-β Deposition in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease**

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by a protracted preclinical phase marked by the insidious accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and subsequent tau neurofibrillary tangles. The identification of reliable biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of disease progression is crucial for the success of therapeutic interventions targeting Aβ pathology. This study investigates the utility of plasma phosphorylated tau isoforms, specifically p-tau231 and p-tau217, as indicators of early Aβ deposition in individuals at risk for AD. A longitudinal cohort (n=150) comprising cognitively normal individuals with and without familial history of AD was assessed utilizing plasma biomarker analysis and amyloid-PET imaging. Results demonstrate a statistically significant correlation (r = 0.78, p < 0.001) between plasma p-tau231 levels and standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in the precuneus region on amyloid-PET scans.  Similarly, p-tau217 showed a robust correlation (r = 0.72, p < 0.001).  Furthermore, individuals exhibiting elevated p-tau231/p-tau217 ratios (above the 90th percentile of the cognitively normal cohort) demonstrated a 68% increased likelihood of amyloid positivity on PET imaging. These findings suggest that plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 offer a non-invasive and readily accessible approach to identify individuals in the preclinical stages of AD, holding significant promise for inclusion criteria in future clinical trials aimed at preventing or delaying the onset of dementia. Further validation in larger, more diverse cohorts is warranted.
