**Abstract**

The accurate and reliable detection of amyloid pathology remains a critical challenge in the early diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease. This study evaluated the robustness of plasma biomarkers – Amyloid-beta 42/40 ratio (Aβ42/40), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and phosphorylated tau at residue 181 (p-tau181) – in predicting amyloid burden as assessed by amyloid PET imaging.  Results demonstrate significant inter-assay variability impacting the Aβ42/40 ratio, highlighting its limited stability. Notably, GFAP and p-tau181 exhibited superior consistency across multiple assays, suggesting enhanced robustness in reflecting underlying amyloid pathology. These findings underscore the potential of GFAP and p-tau181 as more dependable plasma markers for longitudinal monitoring and potentially, as surrogates for amyloid PET in clinical research. Further investigation into the mechanisms driving the differential stability of these biomarkers is warranted to optimize their clinical utility and refine diagnostic strategies for Alzheimer’s disease.
