Title: Advancements and Challenges in Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Review of Current Clinical Trials

Abstract:
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy has emerged as a promising immunotherapeutic approach for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. This review aims to summarize the current state of TIL therapy in NSCLC, focusing on its efficacy, challenges, and potential synergies with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that ex vivo expanded TILs can induce durable responses in a subset of NSCLC patients, particularly those who have failed prior ICI therapy. However, the therapeutic efficacy of TIL therapy is hindered by factors such as tumor heterogeneity, TIL exhaustion, and manufacturing complexities. Ongoing research is investigating strategies to enhance TIL persistence and antitumor activity. This review highlights the need for further investigation into the optimal application of TIL therapy in NSCLC, including its potential integration with ICIs and other immunotherapies.
