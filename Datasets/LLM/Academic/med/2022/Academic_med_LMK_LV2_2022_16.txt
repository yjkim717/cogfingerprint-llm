Title: Plasma Phospho-Tau231 as a Potential Biomarker for Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease: Detecting Early Amyloid-β Pathology

Abstract:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, which precedes clinical symptoms by decades. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of plasma biomarkers in identifying preclinical AD. This study investigates the utility of plasma phospho-tau231 (p-tau231) in detecting early Aβ changes. We evaluated the performance of p-tau231 and p-tau217 in detecting Aβ pathology in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals. Our results demonstrate that both p-tau231 and p-tau217 are strongly associated with Aβ burden and can detect early Aβ changes with high accuracy. Notably, p-tau231 showed a robust correlation with Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) measures. These findings suggest that plasma p-tau231 is a promising biomarker for preclinical AD, enabling early detection and potential intervention. The use of p-tau231 as a biomarker may revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of AD, facilitating timely therapeutic interventions.
