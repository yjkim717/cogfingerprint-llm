**Title:** Investigating the Causal Role of Insomnia Symptoms in Suicidal Behavior: A Mendelian Randomization Study

**Abstract**

**Background:** Observational studies have consistently identified a robust association between insomnia symptoms and an increased risk of suicidal behavior, including ideation, attempt, and completion. However, establishing a causal relationship has been challenging due to pervasive confounding from psychiatric comorbidities, such as major depressive disorder, and the potential for reverse causation. This study employs a Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework to investigate whether insomnia symptoms exert a direct, causal effect on suicidal behavior, independent of these confounding pathways.

**Methods:** We conducted a two-sample MR analysis utilizing summary-level data from the most recent and extensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly associated with insomnia symptoms (p < 5 × 10⁻⁸) were selected as instrumental variables. We employed the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as our primary analysis, complemented by sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO, to assess and correct for potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity.

**Results:** Our MR analysis provided evidence supporting a positive causal relationship. Genetically predicted insomnia symptoms were associated with a significantly increased odds of suicidal behavior (IVW OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.15-1.42, p = 3.4 × 10⁻⁶). Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results, with no significant evidence of horizontal pleiotropy (MR-Egger intercept p = 0.42), reinforcing the robustness of our primary findings.

**Conclusion:** This study provides novel genetic evidence that insomnia symptoms are a causal risk factor for suicidal behavior. Crucially, this relationship persists after accounting for the genetic correlations with major psychiatric disorders. These findings underscore the critical importance of targeting sleep disturbances as an independent, modifiable risk factor in public health strategies and clinical interventions aimed at suicide prevention. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying neurobiological mechanisms linking sleep dysregulation to suicidality.
