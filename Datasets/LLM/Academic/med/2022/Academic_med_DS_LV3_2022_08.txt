In the contemporary management of advanced gastric adenocarcinoma, the integration of comprehensive biomarker testing has fundamentally reshaped therapeutic paradigms. The 2022 iteration of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines underscores a pivotal shift towards biomarker-driven targeted therapies for patients with unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease. This precision oncology approach mandates rigorous molecular profiling—including assessment for HER2, MSI, PD-L1, and NTRK—to identify actionable targets and direct the use of corresponding agents, thereby optimizing clinical outcomes and survival. Concurrently, the guidelines reinforce the indispensable role of early, multidisciplinary palliative management, which is systematically integrated alongside anti-neoplastic treatments to proactively address symptoms and preserve quality of life. This dual-strategy framework, combining molecularly-informed therapeutics with holistic supportive care, represents the current standard for enhancing both the efficacy and tolerability of treatment in this challenging patient population.
