This 2022 update to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology provides a comprehensive, evidence-based framework for the locoregional management of non-invasive and early-stage invasive breast malignancies. The recommendations specifically address the diagnostic workup, surgical intervention, and radiation therapy strategies for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and Paget disease of the breast. A multidisciplinary approach is emphasized to optimize oncologic outcomes while considering breast conservation. The guidelines integrate recent clinical trial data to refine criteria for sentinel lymph node biopsy and adjuvant radiotherapy, aiming to standardize care and mitigate the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence. This structured guidance is intended to support clinical decision-making for these complex patient populations.
