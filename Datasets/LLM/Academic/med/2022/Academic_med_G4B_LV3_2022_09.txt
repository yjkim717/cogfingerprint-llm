**Abstract**

Emerging evidence implicates sleep disturbances in the pathogenesis of severe mental health conditions; however, the bi-directional relationship between insomnia and suicidal ideation remains incompletely understood. This study investigated a potential causal association utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Leveraging genome-wide association data, we explored whether genetic variants associated with insomnia symptoms predict an elevated risk of suicidal behavior, controlling for established risk factors such as mood and anxiety disorders. Results indicated a statistically significant, suggestive causal effect, wherein genetic predisposition to insomnia was associated with a heightened likelihood of suicidal behavior (p<0.05).  These findings, while preliminary, provide novel evidence for a potential causal pathway between chronic insomnia and increased suicidal vulnerability.  Further prospective longitudinal studies and mechanistic investigations are warranted to validate this association and inform targeted preventative interventions within clinical practice.
