**Abstract**

The accurate and timely segmentation of pediatric brain tumors from multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring response. However, manual segmentation is a time-consuming and subjective process, often limiting clinical workflow. This study investigates the development and validation of a deep learning model designed to automate mpMRI tumor segmentation in pediatric patients. Utilizing a dataset of [Specify Number] mpMRI scans encompassing diverse tumor types and imaging protocols, we trained a convolutional neural network architecture leveraging radiomic features alongside anatomical information. The model’s performance was rigorously assessed using Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics against expert-annotated ground truth. 

Preliminary results demonstrate a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy compared to traditional methods, achieving a Dice coefficient of [Insert Specific Value – e.g., 0.87] across the tested dataset.  Furthermore, the deep learning approach exhibited notable robustness to variations in image quality and patient demographics. This automated segmentation tool holds substantial potential for streamlining clinical workflows, reducing inter-observer variability, and facilitating more efficient clinical decision-making regarding pediatric brain tumor management. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset and exploring the model’s generalizability across different MRI vendors and clinical settings.
