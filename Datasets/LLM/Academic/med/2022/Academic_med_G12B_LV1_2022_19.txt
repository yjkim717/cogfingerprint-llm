## Evolving Management Strategies in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer: A Review of Emerging Trends and the 2022 NCCN Guideline Updates

**Abstract:** The management of locally advanced rectal cancer (stage II and III) has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years, driven by accumulating evidence supporting non-operative strategies and refined neoadjuvant therapeutic approaches. This review examines contemporary trends in rectal cancer treatment, contextualized within the framework of the updated 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Traditionally, total mesorectal excision (TME) formed the cornerstone of treatment. However, the “watch-and-wait” approach, following neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy (CRT) and complete clinical response, is gaining traction as a potentially sphincter-sparing option, particularly for select patients. The 2022 NCCN guidelines provide updated recommendations regarding patient selection criteria for watch-and-wait, emphasizing rigorous surveillance protocols and multidisciplinary assessment. Furthermore, the role of short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) as a neoadjuvant strategy continues to be refined, with consideration given to its impact on tumor downstaging and subsequent surgical outcomes. This review will explore the rationale, evidence base, and practical implications of these evolving strategies, highlighting the importance of individualized treatment planning and adherence to evidence-based guidelines to optimize patient outcomes and quality of life. Future research should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers to further personalize treatment decisions.
