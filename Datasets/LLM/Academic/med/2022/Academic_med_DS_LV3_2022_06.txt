**Abstract**

The 2022 update to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) represents a pivotal advancement in the molecular stratification of the disease, underscoring a paradigm shift towards biomarker-directed therapeutic strategies. This guideline systematically evaluates the evidentiary basis for the clinical utility of specific genomic and immunologic biomarkers to inform the selection of targeted and immunomodulatory agents. A cornerstone of this framework is the recommendation for routine testing for activating *PIK3CA* mutations in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative MBC, which identifies a patient cohort eligible for treatment with alpelisib, a PI3KÎ±-specific inhibitor, in combination with endocrine therapy. Concurrently, germline and somatic testing for *BRCA1/2* pathogenic variants remains critical, as it delineates patients who derive substantial benefit from poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, leveraging the principle of synthetic lethality in tumors with homologous recombination deficiency.

Furthermore, the guideline incorporates the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), primarily by endorsing the assessment of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in triple-negative MBC. The combination of PD-L1 inhibitors with chemotherapy has demonstrated improved survival outcomes in this aggressive subtype, establishing a new standard of care for patients with positive biomarker status. While microsatellite instability (MSI) testing is acknowledged, its utility in MBC is recognized as limited to rare, hypermutated cases, reflecting its pan-cancer application rather than a breast cancer-specific indication. The guideline also highlights the emerging, yet still investigational, role of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for dynamic biomarker assessment and monitoring of therapeutic response, identifying it as an area requiring further validation before routine clinical implementation. In conclusion, the 2022 ASCO guideline provides a structured, evidence-based roadmap for biomarker integration in MBC, while explicitly demarcating the boundaries of current knowledge and prioritizing critical research avenues to address existing evidence gaps, particularly concerning the predictive power of complex biomarker signatures and novel analytes like ctDNA.
