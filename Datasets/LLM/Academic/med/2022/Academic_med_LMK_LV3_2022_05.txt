In 2022, the NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer underwent significant revisions, incorporating emerging evidence to inform clinical practice. Notably, the updated guidelines endorse total neoadjuvant therapy and nonoperative management for select patient cohorts. This paradigm shift reflects a nuanced understanding of rectal cancer treatment, prioritizing personalized approaches and improved patient outcomes. By integrating total neoadjuvant therapy and nonoperative management into clinical practice, healthcare providers can optimize treatment strategies, enhancing the quality of care for rectal cancer patients. These revisions underscore the evolving landscape of rectal cancer management.
