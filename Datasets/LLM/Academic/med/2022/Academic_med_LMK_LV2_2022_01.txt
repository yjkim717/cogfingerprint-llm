Title: Evaluating Telehealth as a Mitigator of Rural Healthcare Disparities: A Review of User Experiences and Outcomes

Abstract:

Rural healthcare disparities persist as a pressing concern globally, with geographical isolation and limited access to healthcare services exacerbating health inequities. Telehealth, a rapidly evolving field leveraging telecommunications technology to deliver remote healthcare, has emerged as a potential solution to address these disparities. As of 2022, an increasing body of research suggests that rural dwellers exhibit a growing interest in telehealth services, reporting positive experiences and satisfactory outcomes. This review synthesizes existing literature on telehealth adoption and utilization in rural contexts, examining the efficacy of telehealth in enhancing healthcare access and equity. The analysis highlights the benefits and challenges associated with telehealth implementation in rural areas, providing insights into its potential to mitigate healthcare disparities and promote health equity among rural populations. The findings underscore the need for continued research and investment in telehealth infrastructure to optimize its impact on rural healthcare outcomes.
