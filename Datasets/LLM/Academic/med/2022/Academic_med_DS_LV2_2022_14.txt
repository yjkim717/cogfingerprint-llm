**Abstract**

**Objective:** To investigate the primary etiologies and patterns of dental extractions in a pediatric population of Syrian refugees, with a specific focus on identifying the most frequently affected teeth and underlying oral health conditions. The protracted displacement and associated barriers to consistent dental care render this demographic particularly vulnerable to severe dental morbidity.

**Methods:** A retrospective clinical analysis was conducted on dental extraction records from a designated refugee healthcare facility during the 2022 calendar year. Data were systematically collected for all patients under the age of 18, including the extracted tooth, its anatomical position, and the primary diagnosis necessitating the procedure. Diagnoses were categorized according to established clinical criteria, with a primary distinction between dental caries and its sequelae (e.g., pulpal necrosis, periapical pathology) and other causes such as trauma or orthodontic indication.

**Results:** The analysis revealed that the overwhelming majority of extractions were necessitated by advanced dental caries and its associated pulpal pathologies. The lower primary molars, specifically the first and second molars, were identified as the most prevalent site for extraction, demonstrating a significantly higher incidence of severe decay compared to anterior teeth and other posterior segments. This pattern underscores a pronounced susceptibility in these specific dentition units.

**Conclusion:** The findings indicate a critical oral health crisis among Syrian refugee children, characterized by a high prevalence of untreated dental caries progressing to irreversible pulpal disease, culminating in the extraction of primary molars. This pattern highlights significant deficits in preventive care and access to early intervention. The study underscores the urgent need for targeted public health initiatives, including enhanced preventive programs and improved access to restorative services, to mitigate the long-term sequelae of early tooth loss in this vulnerable population.
