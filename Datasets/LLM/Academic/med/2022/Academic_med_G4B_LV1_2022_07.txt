**Abstract**

The accurate delineation of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for adult diffuse gliomas remains a significant challenge. This study addresses a crucial correction to previously published guidelines, specifically clarifying author attribution within a document outlining the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) recommendations.  Established in 2022, the EANO guidelines represent a cornerstone for multidisciplinary management of these neoplasms.  We detail the revisions implemented to ensure precise scholarly credit and maintain the integrity of the diagnostic algorithm.  Further investigation is warranted to assess the impact of these corrections on clinical implementation and patient outcomes, emphasizing the importance of meticulous record-keeping within evolving neuro-oncological practice, particularly concerning guideline authorship and dissemination.
