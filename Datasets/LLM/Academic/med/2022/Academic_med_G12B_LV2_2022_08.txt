**Abstract**

The management of advanced gastric cancer (AGC) has undergone significant evolution, driven by advancements in molecular profiling and the emergence of targeted therapies. This review summarizes key updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for AGC, reflecting the state of clinical knowledge as of 2022. A central tenet of the revised guidelines is the imperative for comprehensive biomarker testing in all patients with advanced disease. Specifically, assessment for *HER2* amplification, microsatellite instability (MSI-high), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression are now strongly recommended to guide therapeutic selection. Patients with *HER2*-positive disease benefit from trastuzumab-based regimens, while MSI-high tumors are candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitors. Further, the guidelines address the evolving landscape of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions and other potential therapeutic targets. This update underscores a shift towards precision oncology in AGC, advocating for individualized treatment strategies based on biomarker status to maximize efficacy and improve patient survival. Continued research investigating novel biomarkers and targeted agents remains crucial for further optimizing outcomes in this challenging malignancy.
