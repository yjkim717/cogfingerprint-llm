**Abstract**

Accurate and efficient segmentation of pediatric brain tumors is crucial for treatment planning and monitoring disease progression. Manual segmentation, however, is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability. This study, conducted in 2022, investigates the application of deep learning techniques to automate this process, leveraging the rich information contained within multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture specifically adapted for segmenting complex pediatric brain tumor morphologies. The model was trained and validated on a retrospective dataset of multi-parametric MRI scans, incorporating T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and contrast-enhanced sequences. Results demonstrate a high degree of accuracy, particularly in the segmentation of the whole tumor volume, exhibiting improved performance compared to traditional manual delineation. These findings suggest that deep learning-based automated segmentation, utilizing multi-parametric MRI, holds substantial potential to reduce segmentation time, improve consistency, and ultimately enhance clinical decision-making in the management of pediatric brain tumors. Further research will focus on refining the model's ability to delineate tumor sub-regions and its generalizability across diverse patient populations.
