Title: Investigating the Causal Relationship between Insomnia Symptoms and Suicidal Behavior using Mendelian Randomization Analysis

Abstract:

Insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior are significant public health concerns, with a considerable body of evidence suggesting a positive correlation between the two. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear, with observational studies being susceptible to confounding variables and reverse causality. To address this knowledge gap, this study employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine the causal relationship between insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior.

Using summary-level data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in 2022, we identified genetic variants associated with insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior. The GWAS datasets comprised individuals of European ancestry, with 462,341 participants for insomnia symptoms and 512,904 participants for suicidal behavior. We applied a series of MR methods, including inverse-variance weighted (IVW), weighted median, and MR-Egger regression, to estimate the causal effect of insomnia symptoms on suicidal behavior.

Our results provide robust genetic evidence supporting a potentially causal relationship between insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior. The IVW analysis revealed a significant positive causal effect of insomnia symptoms on suicidal behavior (odds ratio [OR] = 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42-2.11, P = 4.32 × 10^(-7)). The weighted median and MR-Egger regression analyses yielded consistent results, with ORs of 1.65 (95% CI = 1.29-2.11, P = 1.13 × 10^(-4)) and 1.81 (95% CI = 1.38-2.38, P = 2.51 × 10^(-5)), respectively. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the absence of significant heterogeneity and pleiotropy, suggesting that the observed causal effect was not driven by biased genetic instruments.

Our findings have important implications for the prevention and treatment of suicidal behavior. The identification of a causal link between insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior highlights the need for early intervention and targeted treatment of insomnia symptoms in individuals at risk of suicidal behavior. Furthermore, the study underscores the utility of MR analysis in investigating the causal relationships between complex traits and disorders, providing a valuable framework for future research.

In conclusion, this study provides genetic evidence supporting a potentially causal relationship between insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior. The findings emphasize the importance of addressing insomnia symptoms as a modifiable risk factor for suicidal behavior, with potential implications for public health policy and clinical practice.
