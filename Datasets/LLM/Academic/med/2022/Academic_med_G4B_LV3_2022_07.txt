**Abstract**

Contemporary management of adult gliomas necessitates robust diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The 2022 publication by van den Bent et al. addresses critical refinements to the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) guidelines for diffuse gliomas. This author correction clarifies authorship attribution within the original publication, highlighting a necessary step for maintaining transparency and reproducibility in clinical guidelines.  Specifically, the updated EANO recommendations underscore the evolving understanding of diffuse glioma heterogeneity, impacting both diagnostic criteria – incorporating advanced imaging techniques – and treatment pathways.  Further research is warranted to fully implement these revisions and optimize patient outcomes within the context of established neuro-oncology practice, aligning with current EANO standards.
