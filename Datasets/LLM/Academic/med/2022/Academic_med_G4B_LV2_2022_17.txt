**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) necessitates the development of readily accessible biomarkers for early detection and longitudinal monitoring.  Peripheral biomarkers, particularly those derived from plasma, offer a potentially non-invasive alternative to traditional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. This study investigated the reliability of several plasma biomarkers – glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), phosphorylated total tau (p-tau181), and the amyloid-beta ratio (Aβ42/Aβ40) – in discriminating individuals with AD based on established amyloid pathology. Utilizing data from a cohort of [Insert Number] participants, we assessed the impact of inter-assay variability on biomarker performance. 

Our findings reveal a notable discrepancy in the robustness of these biomarkers. While GFAP and p-tau181 exhibited consistent discriminatory performance across multiple assays, demonstrating a relative insensitivity to inter-assay variability, the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio demonstrated significantly reduced accuracy. Specifically, alterations in assay protocols resulted in substantial shifts in biomarker quantification, compromising its ability to reliably differentiate between individuals with and without evidence of amyloid deposition.  These results suggest that GFAP and p-tau181 represent more dependable plasma biomarkers for identifying AD patients, warranting further investigation into their potential for clinical utility.  Future research should focus on standardized assay methodologies and exploring combinations of biomarkers to mitigate inter-assay variability and enhance the overall discriminative power of plasma-based diagnostics in AD.
