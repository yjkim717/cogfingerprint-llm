"Management of Advanced Gastric Cancer: A Paradigm Shift towards Targeted Therapies"

Gastric cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Gastric Cancer (2022) provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of unresectable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease. Systemic therapy is the cornerstone of palliative management, with a growing emphasis on biomarker testing to inform treatment decisions. Targeted therapies have emerged as a promising approach, offering improved outcomes for select patient populations. This abstract reviews the current landscape of gastric cancer management, highlighting the role of systemic therapy and targeted treatments in the palliative setting. We discuss the importance of biomarker testing in guiding treatment selection and the evolving paradigm of care for advanced gastric cancer. By integrating emerging data and guideline recommendations, we provide a comprehensive overview of the current management strategies for this complex disease.
