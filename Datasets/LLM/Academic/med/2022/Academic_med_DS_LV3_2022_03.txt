**Title:** Comparative Analytical and Clinical Validation of Plasma Biomarkers for the Detection of Cerebral Amyloid-β Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease

**Abstract:**

The advent of blood-based biomarkers represents a transformative advancement for the diagnostic and prognostic assessment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), promising greater accessibility and scalability over cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. This study undertook a comprehensive comparative analysis of the leading plasma biomarkers—amyloid-β 42/40 (Aβ42/40), phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)—for their ability to detect cerebral amyloid-β pathology, as defined by amyloid PET positivity. We specifically evaluated their predictive performance across the AD continuum, from the preclinical to the dementia stages, and critically assessed the impact of pre-analytical and analytical factors on their real-world applicability. Our cohort consisted of 450 participants, including cognitively unimpaired individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia, all with confirmed amyloid PET status. The results demonstrate that the plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, quantified using immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS), exhibits exceptional diagnostic accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 for identifying amyloid PET positivity. However, a pivotal finding was its pronounced susceptibility to inter-assay variability; comparative analyses revealed significant discrepancies in absolute values and performance metrics when measured across different IP-MS platforms and sample handling protocols. In contrast, plasma p-tau181 and GFAP demonstrated superior analytical robustness with minimal inter-assay variability, while maintaining high predictive performance (AUCs of 0.92 and 0.88, respectively). We conclude that while plasma Aβ42/40 by IP-MS is a highly sensitive biomarker for amyloid pathology, its clinical translation is critically dependent on stringent standardization to mitigate pre-analytical and analytical variance. The inherent robustness of p-tau181 and GFAP positions them as more reliable candidates for immediate implementation in multi-modal biomarker algorithms and large-scale screening initiatives.
