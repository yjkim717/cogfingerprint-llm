**Abstract**

**Genetic Evidence for a Causal Association Between Insomnia Symptoms and Suicidal Behavior: A Mendelian Randomization Study**

**Background:** The complex relationship between sleep disturbances and suicidal ideation and behavior (SIB) remains incompletely understood. While observational studies have consistently demonstrated associations, establishing causality has been challenging due to potential confounding and reverse causation. This study aimed to investigate the potential causal effect of insomnia symptoms on SIB using a robust, genetically informed approach.

**Methods:** We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) data. Instrumental variables (IVs) were derived from a large-scale GWAS of insomnia symptoms (n = 411,636) and outcomes data from a separate GWAS of SIB (n = 137,734).  A primary MR analysis utilizing inverse-variance weighted (IVW) regression was performed to estimate the causal effect of genetically predicted insomnia symptoms on SIB.  Sensitivity analyses, including weighted median MR and MR-Egger regression, were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings and to detect potential pleiotropic bias.  We further explored the potential mediating role of major depressive disorder (MDD) and restless leg syndrome (RLS) by examining their genetic associations with both insomnia and SIB.

**Results:** The IVW analysis revealed a statistically significant positive causal effect of insomnia symptoms on SIB (β = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.19, *p* = 0.002).  Weighted median MR analysis yielded consistent results (β = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.18, *p* = 0.004), suggesting robustness to potential pleiotropy.  MR-Egger regression did not detect evidence of directional pleiotropy.  Genetic correlations were observed between insomnia and both MDD (r = 0.45, *p* < 0.001) and RLS (r = 0.38, *p* < 0.001), indicating potential shared genetic pathways.

**Conclusion:** This Mendelian randomization study provides compelling genetic evidence supporting a causal link between insomnia symptoms and an increased risk of SIB. These findings highlight the importance of addressing insomnia symptoms as a potential target for suicide prevention strategies. Further research is warranted to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms and to explore the potential mediating roles of MDD and RLS in this relationship.  Clinical interventions targeting insomnia may represent a valuable avenue for reducing SIB risk.
