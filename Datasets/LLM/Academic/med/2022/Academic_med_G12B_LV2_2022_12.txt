**Title: Durable Remission of Type 2 Diabetes Following Metabolic Surgery Compared to Lifestyle Interventions: A Three-Year Longitudinal Analysis**

**Abstract**

**Background:** Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a significant global health challenge, with escalating prevalence and associated morbidity. While lifestyle modifications remain a cornerstone of initial management, their long-term efficacy in achieving and maintaining diabetes remission is frequently limited. Metabolic surgery, encompassing various bariatric procedures, has emerged as a potentially transformative intervention for T2DM, but robust, long-term comparative data against intensive lifestyle interventions remain crucial.

**Objective:** This study aimed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and durability of metabolic surgery versus comprehensive lifestyle interventions in achieving and sustaining diabetes remission over a three-year period in adult patients with T2DM.

**Methods:** A prospective, observational study was conducted involving [Assume a cohort size, e.g., n=200] participants with T2DM, stratified into two groups: those undergoing metabolic surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, or adjustable gastric banding; n=[Assume number, e.g., 100]) and those receiving intensive, medically supervised lifestyle interventions including dietary modifications, exercise programs, and behavioral therapy (n=[Assume number, e.g., 100]). The primary outcome measure was diabetes remission, defined as HbA1c < 5.7% without pharmacological intervention for at least three months, assessed at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months, and 36 months post-intervention. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, glycemic control (fasting plasma glucose), lipid profiles, and medication usage. Statistical analysis employed intention-to-treat principles and included time-to-event analysis for remission and repeated measures ANOVA for continuous variables.

**Results:**  At 36 months, metabolic surgery demonstrated significantly superior rates of diabetes remission compared to lifestyle interventions ( [Assume a percentage, e.g., 65%] vs. [Assume a percentage, e.g., 15%]; p < 0.001).  Furthermore, patients in the surgical group exhibited greater reductions in body weight (mean [Assume value, e.g., -25%] vs. [Assume value, e.g., -5%]; p < 0.001) and improvements in HbA1c, fasting glucose, and lipid profiles.  Medication requirements were substantially reduced in the surgical cohort.  Adverse events related to surgery were managed effectively, with no significant long-term complications impacting overall patient well-being.

**Conclusion:**  This three-year longitudinal study provides compelling evidence that metabolic surgery is a more effective and durable intervention than intensive lifestyle modifications for achieving and maintaining diabetes remission in individuals with T2DM. These findings support consideration of metabolic surgery as a viable therapeutic option for carefully selected patients who have not achieved adequate glycemic control or remission with conventional approaches. Further research should focus on identifying optimal patient selection criteria and long-term safety outcomes.
