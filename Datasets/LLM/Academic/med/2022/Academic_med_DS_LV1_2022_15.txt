**Title:** Evaluating Telehealth as an Intervention for Rural Healthcare Disparities: An Analysis of Access and Patient Experience

The persistent challenge of healthcare inequity is acutely manifested in rural populations, who face significant barriers to accessing medical services. This study investigates the efficacy of telehealth modalities in mitigating these disparities by enhancing healthcare access and promoting equity. Conducted in 2022, our mixed-methods analysis surveyed rural residents who utilized telehealth services. Quantitative and qualitative data revealed a significant positive correlation between telehealth implementation and improved perceived access to care. Notably, regression analysis identified age as a critical moderating variable, with younger demographics (18-45 years) reporting markedly higher satisfaction and a greater willingness for continued use compared to older cohorts. These findings suggest that while telehealth presents a viable strategy for addressing rural health inequities, its successful integration requires a nuanced, demographically-tailored approach to implementation and patient education to ensure broad, equitable adoption across all population segments.
