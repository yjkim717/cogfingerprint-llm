**Abstract: Optimizing Systemic Therapy in Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma â€“ A 2022 NCCN Perspective**

Advanced gastric adenocarcinoma presents a significant clinical challenge, necessitating a refined approach to systemic therapy.  The 2022 NCCN guidelines underscore the critical role of multidisciplinary collaboration and a patient-centered strategy.  This document prioritizes the implementation of comprehensive biomarker testing, specifically focusing on PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, and RAS/BRAF mutation analysis, to inform treatment selection.  Evidence-based recommendations detail sequential regimens incorporating platinum-based chemotherapy, often augmented with targeted therapies based on identified molecular alterations.  The guidelines advocate for individualized treatment plans, acknowledging the heterogeneous nature of gastric cancer.  Furthermore, the importance of ongoing monitoring and response assessment is highlighted to facilitate timely adjustments to therapy.  Ultimately, this framework aims to improve patient outcomes by maximizing the efficacy of systemic interventions within the context of established NCCN protocols.
