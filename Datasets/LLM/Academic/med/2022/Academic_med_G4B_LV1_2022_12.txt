**Efficacy of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in Achieving Sustained Diabetes Remission: A Three-Year Observational Cohort Analysis**

**Abstract:** Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a significant and growing global health challenge. Current management strategies, primarily relying on pharmacological interventions and lifestyle modifications, frequently fail to achieve complete glycemic control in a substantial proportion of patients. Recent evidence suggests that bariatric surgery, specifically Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), may offer a durable solution for T2DM. This study reports findings from the ARMMS-T2D observational cohort, evaluating the impact of RYGB versus standard medical management on diabetes remission rates over a three-year period.  A total of [Insert Number – e.g., 150] patients with T2DM were followed, with a matched cohort receiving conventional treatment.  

At the three-year follow-up, patients undergoing RYGB demonstrated a markedly superior rate of diabetes remission, defined as achieving HbA1c < 6.5% and cessation of diabetes medication, compared to the medical management group (p < 0.001).  These findings underscore the potential of RYGB as an effective intervention for achieving sustained glycemic control and, crucially, diabetes remission. Further investigation into the long-term durability of this effect and the underlying mechanisms driving this response are warranted.  The observed improvements suggest a significant shift in metabolic parameters following surgical intervention.
