**Abstract**

Recent research has highlighted a concerning association between insomnia and suicidal behavior; however, disentangling the directionality of this relationship remains a challenge. This 2022 study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the potential causal effect of insomnia symptoms on suicidal behavior, accounting for the confounding influence of mood and psychotic disorders. Utilizing publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we leveraged genetic variants associated with insomnia as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect on suicidal ideation and attempts. Our findings provide genetic evidence supporting a potentially causal link between increased insomnia symptom burden and elevated risk of suicidal behavior, independent of major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. These results underscore the importance of addressing insomnia symptoms as a potential modifiable risk factor for suicide prevention strategies, warranting further investigation into underlying biological mechanisms and targeted interventions.
