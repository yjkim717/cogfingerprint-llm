The 2022 NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer represent a paradigm shift in clinical management, emphasizing **total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT)** as a primary strategy. This approach integrates intensified chemotherapy and **radiation therapy** prior to surgery, aiming to enhance pathological complete response rates. Consequently, the guidelines formally endorse a **watch-and-wait** strategy for patients achieving a clinical complete response, offering organ preservation and avoiding surgical morbidity. These updated **clinical guidelines** are underpinned by robust evidence demonstrating equivalent oncological outcomes for nonoperative management in select cohorts. This evolution marks a critical advancement toward personalized, multimodal care, fundamentally altering the therapeutic landscape for locally advanced **rectal cancer** by prioritizing response-adapted treatment de-escalation.
