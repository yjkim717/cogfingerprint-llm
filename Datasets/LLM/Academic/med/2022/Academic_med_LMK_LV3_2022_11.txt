Title: Advancements in Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocyte Therapy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Overcoming Resistance to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors

Abstract:
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains a challenging malignancy to treat, particularly in cases resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Recent advancements in tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy have shown promise in addressing this unmet need. By harnessing the patient's own immune cells, TIL therapy offers a personalized approach to cancer treatment. As of 2022, emerging evidence suggests that TIL therapy can induce durable responses in NSCLC patients, including those who have failed ICI therapy. This review examines the current state of TIL therapy for NSCLC, discussing its mechanistic rationale, clinical efficacy, and potential strategies to overcome existing limitations. By elucidating the role of TIL therapy in NSCLC treatment, this analysis aims to inform future research directions and clinical applications, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in this difficult-to-treat population.
