Title: Adherence to NCCN Guidelines in Managing Invasive Ductal Carcinoma: A Critical Review

Abstract:
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer provide evidence-based recommendations for managing noninvasive and invasive breast cancer. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), a prevalent subtype, necessitates accurate diagnosis and treatment. This review examines adherence to NCCN guidelines in IDC management, focusing on diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic interventions. A systematic analysis of recent studies (2020-2022) reveals variability in guideline adherence, influencing patient outcomes. Standardized implementation of NCCN guidelines is crucial to optimize IDC management and improve survival rates. This review highlights the need for continued education and quality improvement initiatives to ensure best practices in IDC care.
