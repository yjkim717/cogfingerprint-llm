**Abstract**

Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy represents a promising frontier in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly for patients who progress on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). While ICIs have revolutionized care, a significant proportion of patients develop resistance, underscoring the need for novel immunotherapeutic strategies. This review critically examines the emerging clinical evidence for the efficacy of TIL therapy in lung cancer, synthesizing data from recent phase I/II trials that demonstrate durable objective responses in heavily pre-treated cohorts. We systematically analyze the principal challenges impeding broader clinical implementation, including the technical complexities of TIL manufacturing, the hostile tumor microenvironment, and the logistical hurdles of patient-specific cell products. Furthermore, this article explores future treatment paradigms, proposing rational combinatorial approaches with ICIs or targeted agents to overcome immunosuppressive mechanisms. The integration of TIL therapy into the NSCLC armamentarium holds significant potential to improve long-term outcomes, necessitating continued investigation in larger, randomized clinical trials.
