**Abstract**

**Background:** Geographic isolation and limited infrastructure contribute significantly to persistent healthcare access disparities experienced by rural populations. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing measures further exacerbated these challenges, prompting accelerated exploration of telehealth as a potential mitigation strategy. This study investigates the feasibility and acceptability of telehealth within rural communities to address existing healthcare inequities.

**Methods:** A mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating quantitative surveys assessing telehealth utilization and perceived benefits, alongside qualitative interviews exploring rural residentsâ€™ experiences and attitudes. Data were collected between [Start Date] and [End Date] from a sample of [Sample Size] adult rural dwellers across [Geographic Region].

**Results:** Findings demonstrate a generally positive reception of telehealth among rural participants. Reported benefits centered on improved access to specialists, reduced transportation burdens, and enhanced convenience. Qualitative data highlighted a willingness to adopt telehealth modalities, contingent on ensuring technological accessibility and maintaining a sense of personal connection with healthcare providers.

**Conclusion:** Telehealth demonstrates considerable promise in bridging rural healthcare disparities, particularly concerning access and transportation limitations. Further research should focus on strategies to overcome digital literacy barriers and ensure equitable implementation to maximize the potential of telehealth in improving health outcomes for rural populations.
