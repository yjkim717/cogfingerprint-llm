**Abstract**

The 2022 revisions to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for rectal cancer represent a significant paradigm shift in treatment strategies, particularly for patients with localized disease.  These updates prioritize a more aggressive, yet tailored, approach, focusing heavily on neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy as the standard of care across both Stage II and Stage III rectal cancers.  Revised staging algorithms, incorporating advanced imaging techniques, facilitate more precise risk stratification and treatment planning. Crucially, the guidelines now strongly recommend total neoadjuvant therapy – encompassing both chemotherapy and radiation – irrespective of initial tumor characteristics. Furthermore, patients demonstrating complete pathological response following neoadjuvant treatment are increasingly considered for a ‘watch-and-wait’ strategy, minimizing overtreatment and potentially improving long-term outcomes.  This evolving approach underscores a move towards individualized rectal cancer management, demanding careful patient selection and robust monitoring protocols.
