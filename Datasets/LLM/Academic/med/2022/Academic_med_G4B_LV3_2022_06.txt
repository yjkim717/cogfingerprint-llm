**Abstract**

Contemporary management of metastatic breast cancer increasingly relies on personalized therapeutic strategies predicated upon comprehensive biomarker profiling. Recent updates to ASCO guidelines underscore the pivotal role of targeted molecular testing, specifically focusing on *PIK3CA* and *BRCA1/2* mutations, to inform systemic treatment decisions. These mutations represent significant predictive factors for response to specific therapies, notably those targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and PARP inhibitors, respectively.  Furthermore, the guideline acknowledges the expanding utility of immune cell marker assessment to stratify patients for immunotherapy.  Despite these advancements, the ASCO recommendations recognize the paucity of robust clinical data supporting routine testing for other potential biomarkers, such as those evaluating NTRK fusions.  Consequently, ongoing research is critical to validate and refine biomarker panels, optimizing patient stratification and maximizing the efficacy of systemic therapies within this complex disease landscape.  Future investigations should prioritize the development of standardized assays and clinical interpretation guidelines to facilitate wider implementation of these personalized approaches in 2022 and beyond.
