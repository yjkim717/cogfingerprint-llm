**Abstract**

**Background:** The therapeutic landscape for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is increasingly defined by molecular subtyping and the identification of targetable genomic alterations. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has consequently updated its clinical practice guidelines to standardize biomarker-driven treatment selection, emphasizing a paradigm shift from empiric chemotherapy towards precision oncology.

**Methods:** This review synthesizes the 2022 ASCO guideline recommendations for comprehensive biomarker testing in MBC. The analysis focuses on the evidentiary basis from pivotal clinical trials that informed these updates, particularly those validating the efficacy of targeted agents in genomically selected patient populations.

**Results:** The guidelines mandate specific biomarker assessments to guide systemic therapy. For patients with hormone receptorâ€“positive (HR+), HER2-negative MBC, testing for *PIK3CA* mutations is recommended; those harboring these mutations are candidates for alpelisib in combination with endocrine therapy. In HER2-negative MBC with germline *BRCA1/2* mutations, the use of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, such as olaparib or talazoparib, is endorsed. Furthermore, routine assessment of PD-L1 status in triple-negative MBC is advised to identify patients eligible for immune checkpoint inhibitors combined with chemotherapy. For all subtypes, testing for ESR1 mutations is recommended in HR+ MBC following progression on endocrine therapy to inform subsequent line treatment. The guidelines underscore that the absence of these biomarkers should preclude the use of the corresponding targeted therapies, thereby optimizing resource allocation and preventing unnecessary toxicity.

**Conclusion:** The 2022 ASCO guidelines provide a critical framework for the rational application of biomarker testing in MBC. Their systematic implementation is essential for personalizing treatment, improving clinical outcomes, and ensuring the cost-effective integration of novel targeted therapies into standard care pathways.
