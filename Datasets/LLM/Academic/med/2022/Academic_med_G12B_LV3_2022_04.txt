**Abstract**

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, Version 3.2022, represent a critical resource for evidence-based management of breast malignancies. These guidelines offer detailed recommendations spanning the spectrum of disease, with specific emphasis on the evolving approaches to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early-stage invasive breast cancer. The updated framework addresses contemporary challenges in risk stratification, surgical techniques, adjuvant therapies, and survivorship care. This document serves as a valuable tool for multidisciplinary teams, facilitating standardized, high-quality care and promoting optimal patient outcomes in the management of breast cancer, while acknowledging ongoing research and advancements within the field.
