The 2022 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer establish a comprehensive framework for the locoregional management of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early-stage invasive breast carcinoma. These evidence-based recommendations systematically address diagnostic workup, surgical intervention, and radiation oncology strategies. A critical focus is placed on de-escalating therapy for low-risk DCIS while optimizing multimodal approaches for invasive disease to improve oncologic outcomes and quality of life. The guidelines underscore the necessity of a multidisciplinary tumor board for complex cases, integrating advances in genomic profiling to personalize treatment. This structured paradigm ensures standardized, high-quality care, directly influencing clinical decision-making and patient survival rates.
