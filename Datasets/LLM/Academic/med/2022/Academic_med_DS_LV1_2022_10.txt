**Abstract**

**Title:** A Deep Learning Framework for Automated Segmentation of Pediatric Brain Tumors from Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging

**Introduction:** The precise segmentation of brain tumors in pediatric patients is a critical prerequisite for diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Manual delineation by radiologists is time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. While deep learning has shown promise in automated segmentation for adult gliomas, its application to the more heterogeneous and rarer pediatric brain tumors remains underexplored. This study aims to develop and validate a convolutional neural network (CNN) model specifically optimized for the automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors using multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI).

**Methods:** We curated a retrospective dataset of 125 pediatric patients with histologically confirmed brain tumors, comprising mp-MRI sequences (T1-weighted, post-contrast T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR). A 3D U-Net architecture was implemented and trained using a composite loss function combining Dice and cross-entropy to handle class imbalance. The model was designed to segment the whole tumor (WT) region. Performance was evaluated on a held-out test set (n=25) using the Dice Similarity Score (DSC) as the primary metric, with Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and sensitivity providing secondary analysis.

**Results:** The proposed model achieved a mean DSC of 0.87 Â± 0.06 for whole tumor segmentation on the test set, demonstrating robust performance across diverse tumor morphologies. The mean HD95 was 5.94 mm, indicating accurate boundary delineation. Qualitative assessment confirmed the model's efficacy in capturing complex tumor geometries and differentiating pathologic tissue from surrounding edema.

**Conclusion:** Our deep learning framework provides a highly accurate and automated tool for segmenting pediatric brain tumors from mp-MRI. The strong performance suggests its potential for integration into clinical workflows to augment radiological assessment, thereby improving efficiency and standardization in the management of these challenging oncological conditions.
