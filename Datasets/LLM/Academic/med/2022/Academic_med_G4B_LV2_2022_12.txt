**Abstract: Efficacy of Metabolic Surgery Versus Medical Management in Achieving Diabetes Remission â€“ A Three-Year Longitudinal Study**

**Background:** Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a significant global health challenge, frequently necessitating intensive pharmacological interventions. Recent evidence suggests that bariatric metabolic surgery (BMS), specifically Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), can induce substantial improvements in glycemic control, potentially leading to diabetes remission. This study investigates the comparative efficacy of BMS versus conventional medical management in achieving sustained diabetes remission over a three-year follow-up period. 

**Methods:** We conducted a retrospective analysis of patient data from the ARMMS-T2D registry, focusing on individuals undergoing RYGB and a matched cohort receiving standard medical therapy for T2DM. Primary outcome measures included HbA1c levels below 6.5% at 12, 24, and 36 months, indicative of diabetes remission. Secondary outcomes assessed weight loss, improvements in metabolic parameters (e.g., lipid profiles, blood pressure), and patient-reported quality of life. Statistical analysis included Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression. 

**Results:**  Data analysis revealed a significantly higher proportion of patients in the BMS group achieving diabetes remission compared to the medical management group at all time points (p < 0.001). Specifically, at three years, 68% of patients undergoing RYGB achieved remission, contrasted with only 22% in the medical management cohort. These findings underscore the potential of BMS as a transformative intervention for T2DM. 

**Conclusion:** BMS, represented by RYGB, demonstrates superior efficacy in inducing and maintaining diabetes remission compared to conventional medical management. Further research is warranted to optimize surgical protocols and identify patient populations most likely to benefit from this approach.
