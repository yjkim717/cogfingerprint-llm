**Abstract:**

Contemporary management of gastric cancer, as detailed in the 2022 NCCN guidelines, increasingly prioritizes personalized therapeutic approaches predicated on comprehensive biomarker testing.  Specifically, adenocarcinoma subtypes demonstrate varying responses to conventional chemotherapy, necessitating stratification based on molecular profiles.  This paradigm shift underscores the critical role of biomarker analysis – including PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB) – in guiding the selection of targeted therapies.  These agents, designed to modulate specific oncogenic pathways, offer improved efficacy and potentially reduced toxicity compared to traditional regimens for select patient populations.  Furthermore, the guidelines advocate for a multidisciplinary team-based approach, integrating oncology, surgical, and palliative care specialists to optimize patient outcomes.  The integration of these advancements reflects a move towards precision medicine, aiming to tailor gastric cancer treatment to the individual patient’s unique disease characteristics and predicted response.
