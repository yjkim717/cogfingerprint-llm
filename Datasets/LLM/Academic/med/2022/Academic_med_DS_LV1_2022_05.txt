**Abstract**

The 2022 revision of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for rectal adenocarcinoma marks a significant paradigm shift, formally endorsing Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (TNT) as a preferred strategy for locally advanced disease. This update consolidates evidence favoring the delivery of all systemic and radiation therapies prior to surgery, a sequence demonstrated to enhance treatment compliance and pathological complete response (pCR) rates. Consequently, the guidelines provide a structured framework for the non-operative "watch-and-wait" management of patients who achieve a clinical complete response (cCR) following TNT, including stringent surveillance protocols. The integration of short-course radiotherapy as a TNT component is highlighted, offering a more efficient treatment course. These changes collectively aim to optimize oncologic outcomes while expanding organ preservation opportunities.
