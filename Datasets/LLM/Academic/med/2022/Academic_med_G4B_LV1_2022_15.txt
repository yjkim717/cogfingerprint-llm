**Abstract**

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing healthcare disparities, particularly within rural communities, revealing critical gaps in access to specialized care. This study investigates the role of telehealth interventions in mitigating these inequities. Utilizing qualitative data gleaned from patient surveys and provider interviews conducted between January and December 2022, we examine the lived experiences of rural residents utilizing telehealth services. Our findings demonstrate a significant positive correlation between telehealth adoption and perceived healthcare equity, with patients reporting improved convenience, reduced travel burdens, and enhanced communication with healthcare providers.  Specifically, telehealth demonstrated suitability for delivering chronic disease management and mental health services, traditionally under-resourced in rural areas.  Despite promising results, challenges related to broadband access and digital literacy remain.  Further research is warranted to optimize telehealth implementation and ensure equitable access for all rural populations, ultimately contributing to a more just healthcare system.
