This 2022 analysis examines the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for breast cancer, with a specific focus on evidence-based recommendations for locoregional management. The review critically appraises the stratified therapeutic pathways for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early-stage invasive breast carcinoma. It synthesizes key directives on surgical intervention, radiation oncology, and systemic therapy integration, highlighting the guidelines' role in standardizing multidisciplinary care. The abstract concludes that adherence to these consensus-driven protocols is paramount for optimizing oncologic outcomes and ensuring high-quality, patient-centered treatment delivery.
