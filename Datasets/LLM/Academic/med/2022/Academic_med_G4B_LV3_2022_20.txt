**Abstract**

Contemporary management of metastatic breast cancer increasingly relies on personalized treatment strategies guided by comprehensive biomarker profiling. The 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline update underscores the importance of utilizing molecular testing to inform systemic therapy selection. Specifically, assessment of *PIK3CA* and *BRCA1/2* mutations remains a cornerstone, reflecting their established predictive roles in response to targeted agents. While *PALB2* and PD-L1 expression are routinely incorporated, the guideline acknowledges limited evidentiary support for testing ESR1, homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) assessment, TROP2, or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) monitoring at this time.  Further research is warranted to validate the clinical utility of these alternative biomarkers. Integrating these data points allows clinicians to stratify patients, optimizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing unnecessary exposure to costly or ineffective treatments. Continued refinement of biomarker testing protocols is crucial for advancing precision oncology in this challenging disease landscape.
