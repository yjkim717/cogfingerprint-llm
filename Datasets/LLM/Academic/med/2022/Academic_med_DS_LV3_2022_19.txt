The 2022 iteration of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for rectal cancer represents a paradigm shift in therapeutic sequencing and patient selection. A cornerstone update is the formal endorsement of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), consolidating systemic chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery to enhance pathological complete response (pCR) rates. This approach integrates both long-course chemoradiation and short-course radiation protocols, offering flexibility based on tumor characteristics. Crucially, the guidelines now provide a structured framework for a nonoperative "watch-and-wait" strategy in patients achieving a clinical complete response after TNT, aiming to preserve organ function without compromising oncologic safety for carefully selected individuals. These evidence-based refinements signify a move towards more personalized, multimodal management, fundamentally altering the standard of care for locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma.
