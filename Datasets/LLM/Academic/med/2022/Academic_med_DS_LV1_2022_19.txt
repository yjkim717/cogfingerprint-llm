This 2022 update to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Rectal Cancer provides a comprehensive framework for managing malignant polyps and resectable nonmetastatic disease. A principal advancement is the formal integration of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), which administers both chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery, as a standard-of-care option. This paradigm aims to enhance pathological complete response rates, thereby facilitating organ preservation. The guidelines further elaborate on nonoperative management, or the "watch-and-wait" approach, for patients achieving a clinical complete response following neoadjuvant treatment, including short-course radiation therapy. These refined recommendations underscore a strategic shift towards personalized, multimodal treatment sequencing to optimize oncologic and functional outcomes, while delineating stringent surveillance protocols for patients forgoing immediate resection.
