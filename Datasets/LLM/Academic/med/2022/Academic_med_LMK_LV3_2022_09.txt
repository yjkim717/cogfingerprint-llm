Title: Investigating the Causal Link between Insomnia and Suicidal Behavior: A Mendelian Randomization Study

Abstract:

Insomnia and suicidal behavior are complex psychiatric phenomena that have been linked in observational studies. However, the causal nature of this association remains unclear due to confounding variables and reverse causation. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to examine the causal relationship between insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior, leveraging genetic evidence to inform the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Using summary-level data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in 2022, we identified 208 independent genetic variants associated with insomnia symptoms as instrumental variables. We then applied a two-sample MR design to estimate the causal effect of insomnia on suicidal behavior, using GWAS data on suicidal ideation and attempts. Our results indicate that genetically predicted insomnia symptoms are significantly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behavior (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.45-2.06, P = 2.4 × 10^−8). The causal effect remained robust after adjusting for potential confounding factors, including depression and anxiety disorders. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a dose-response relationship between the genetic liability to insomnia and the risk of suicidal behavior. These findings provide strong genetic evidence supporting a causal link between insomnia symptoms and increased risk of suicidal behavior, underscoring the importance of addressing sleep disturbances as a potential modifiable risk factor for suicidal behavior. Our study contributes to the growing body of evidence highlighting the complex interplay between sleep, mental health, and suicidal behavior, and has significant implications for the development of targeted interventions aimed at mitigating the risk of suicidal behavior in individuals with insomnia. By elucidating the causal mechanisms underlying this association, our research informs the development of evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies for psychiatric disorders, ultimately contributing to improved mental health outcomes.
