This study examines the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer, focusing on their application in managing invasive breast cancer and ductal carcinoma. As of 2022, these guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer, including carcinoma in situ and early-stage invasive breast cancer. By synthesizing current research and clinical expertise, the NCCN guidelines aim to standardize and improve breast cancer care, thereby enhancing patient outcomes and informing clinical decision-making. The guidelines' relevance to contemporary clinical practice is assessed.
