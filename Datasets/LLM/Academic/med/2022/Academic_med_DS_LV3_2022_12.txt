**Abstract**

**Background:** The escalating global burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) necessitates the evaluation of therapeutic strategies that extend beyond conventional glycemic management to achieve sustained disease remission. While intensive medical and lifestyle interventions (MLI) form the cornerstone of standard care, metabolic (bariatric) surgery has emerged as a potent intervention, with mounting evidence suggesting profound effects on the pathophysiology of T2DM. The comparative long-term efficacy of these divergent approaches, however, requires rigorous validation through randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

**Objective:** To assess the three-year comparative effectiveness of metabolic surgery versus state-of-the-art medical/lifestyle intervention in achieving diabetes remission and superior glycemic control, as measured by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, within a large, multi-center consortium.

**Methods:** We analyzed pooled data from the Alliance of Randomized trials of Medicine versus Metabolic Surgery in Type 2 Diabetes (ARMMS-T2D) consortium, comprising several RCTs. Adults with T2DM and obesity were randomized to either metabolic surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy) or intensive MLI. The primary outcome was diabetes remission, defined as HbA1c <6.5% (<48 mmol/mol) without active pharmacologic therapy. Secondary outcomes included absolute HbA1c levels and the proportion of participants maintaining glycemic targets.

**Results:** At the 36-month follow-up, metabolic surgery resulted in a significantly higher rate of diabetes remission compared to MLI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 8.4, 95% CI 5.3-13.2; p<0.001). Participants in the surgical cohort also demonstrated markedly lower mean HbA1c levels (surgery: 6.3% [45 mmol/mol] vs. MLI: 7.8% [62 mmol/mol]; p<0.001) and a substantially greater proportion achieved an HbA1c <7.0% (p<0.001).

**Conclusion:** In 2022, the ARMMS-T2D consortium findings provide definitive evidence that metabolic surgery is a superior therapeutic modality for selected patients with T2DM and obesity, yielding significantly higher rates of durable diabetes remission and enhanced glycemic control over a three-year period compared to intensive medical/lifestyle management alone. These results underscore the need to reconsider the positioning of metabolic surgery within T2DM treatment algorithms.
