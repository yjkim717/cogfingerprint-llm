**Title:** Etiology and Patterns of Tooth Extraction in a Paediatric Syrian Refugee Population: A Cross-Sectional Analysis

**Abstract**

**Background:** The displacement and disruption of healthcare systems profoundly affect the oral health of refugee populations, particularly children. While dental caries is a global concern, its specific presentation and sequelae within displaced Syrian refugee cohorts remain inadequately characterized. This study aims to identify the primary etiologies and anatomical patterns of tooth extraction in a paediatric Syrian refugee population, with a specific focus on the association with oral hygiene behaviours.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional analysis was conducted in 2022 on clinical records of 412 Syrian refugee children (aged 5-12 years) who received dental care at a dedicated humanitarian clinic in a host nation. Data extracted included the reason for extraction, the specific tooth extracted, and caregiver-reported toothbrushing frequency. Descriptive statistics were computed, and chi-square tests were employed to assess associations between categorical variables.

**Results:** Dental caries and its sequelae, primarily irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis, constituted the leading cause of tooth extraction, accounting for 88.7% of all cases. The primary mandibular first and second molars were the most frequently extracted teeth, representing 41.2% of all extractions. A statistically significant inverse correlation (p < 0.01) was observed between reported toothbrushing frequency and the likelihood of extraction due to caries. Children brushing less than once daily had a 3.4-fold higher odds ratio for extraction compared to those brushing at least twice daily.

**Conclusion:** This investigation highlights a significant burden of untreated dental caries among Syrian refugee children, culminating in the premature loss of primary molarsâ€”a critical finding given the role of these teeth in arch space maintenance and development. The results underscore the urgent need for targeted, culturally competent preventive oral health interventions within refugee assistance programs to mitigate this preventable disease burden and its long-term functional and occlusal consequences.
