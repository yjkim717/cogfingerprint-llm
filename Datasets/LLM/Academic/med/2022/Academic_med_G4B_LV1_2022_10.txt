**Automated Segmentation of Pediatric Brain Tumors via Deep Learning and Multi-Parametric MRI**

The accurate and timely delineation of pediatric brain tumors from multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is critical for precise treatment planning and monitoring. Manual segmentation is a time-consuming and potentially error-prone process, necessitating the development of efficient automated methods. This study presents a novel deep learning framework designed to automatically segment pediatric brain tumors from mpMRI scans. Utilizing a convolutional neural network architecture, the model was trained on a curated dataset of pediatric mpMRI images with expert-validated segmentations. Specifically, the model integrated data from T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences to enhance tumor characterization. 

Performance was evaluated using standard metrics including Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance. Results demonstrated a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy compared to traditional manual methods. The deep learning model achieved an average Dice coefficient of [Insert realistic value, e.g., 0.88] across the dataset, indicating robust and reliable tumor boundary identification.  This automated approach holds the potential to streamline clinical workflows, reduce inter-observer variability, and ultimately contribute to improved patient outcomes in the management of pediatric brain tumors. Further validation with larger, multi-institutional datasets is warranted.
