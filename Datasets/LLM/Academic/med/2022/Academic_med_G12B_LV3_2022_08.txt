**Abstract**

Contemporary management of gastric cancer, particularly in advanced stages, is undergoing a paradigm shift underscored by the 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. This evolving approach prioritizes biomarker testing to identify patients who may benefit from targeted therapies, reflecting a move towards precision oncology in this challenging malignancy. Adenocarcinoma, the predominant histological subtype, necessitates careful consideration of molecular profiling to guide treatment selection. The guidelines advocate for multidisciplinary care, integrating surgical, medical, and radiation oncology alongside supportive services. While targeted therapies demonstrate promise in select patient populations, palliative management remains a cornerstone of care for individuals with unresectable disease, focusing on symptom control and enhanced quality of life. Ultimately, the NCCN recommendations emphasize a patient-centered framework balancing aggressive therapeutic interventions with compassionate palliative support to optimize outcomes in gastric cancer.
