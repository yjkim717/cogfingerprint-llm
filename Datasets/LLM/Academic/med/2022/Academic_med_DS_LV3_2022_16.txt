In the evolving landscape of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnostics, the identification of robust blood-based biomarkers for the preclinical phase is paramount for advancing clinical trial design and early intervention strategies. This study investigates the comparative performance of plasma phosphorylated tau biomarkers—specifically p-tau231 and p-tau217—in detecting incipient amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. Utilizing data from a prospective cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals, we assessed biomarker sensitivity and specificity against amyloid-PET status. Our findings indicate that both p-tau231 and p-tau217 exhibit superior sensitivity to early Aβ accumulation compared to established biomarkers, with p-tau217 demonstrating marginally enhanced performance in identifying amyloid positivity. These results underscore the potential of these plasma p-tau variants to serve as optimal, minimally invasive tools for enriching preclinical AD populations in clinical trials. The integration of such biomarkers could significantly streamline participant selection, reduce screening costs, and accelerate the development of disease-modifying therapies, thereby addressing a critical need in the AD therapeutic pipeline as of 2022.
