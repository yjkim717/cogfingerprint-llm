Title: Evolving Paradigms in Rectal Cancer Management: An Update on Total Neoadjuvant Therapy and Nonoperative Approaches

Abstract:

The management of nonmetastatic rectal cancer has undergone significant paradigm shifts with the advent of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) and nonoperative management (NOM) strategies. As reflected in the updated 2022 NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer, TNT has emerged as a preferred approach, leveraging the benefits of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiation to optimize local control and improve patient outcomes. Concurrently, NOM has gained traction as a viable option for select patients achieving a clinical complete response following TNT. This abstract reviews the evidence underpinning these developments, highlighting the rationale and implications of these evolving treatment paradigms. By synthesizing current data and guideline recommendations, we provide a nuanced understanding of the contemporary management of rectal cancer, underscoring the need for continued research and multidisciplinary collaboration to refine treatment algorithms and optimize patient care.
