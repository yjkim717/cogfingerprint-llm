Title: Revisiting the EANO Guidelines for Diffuse Gliomas in Adults: An Update on Diagnosis and Treatment Paradigms

Abstract (96 words):
In 2022, the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) guidelines for diffuse gliomas in adults underwent a critical revision. This update reaffirms the importance of integrating molecular diagnostics into clinical practice, alongside histopathological evaluation. The revised guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for the diagnosis and treatment of adulthood gliomas, incorporating recent advances in glioma biology and therapeutic strategies. This article summarizes the key revisions and their implications for optimizing glioma treatment, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach to managing these complex tumours.
