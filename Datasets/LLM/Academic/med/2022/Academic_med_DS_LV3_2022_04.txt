The 2022 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer establish evidence-based, multidisciplinary standards for locoregional management of ductal carcinoma in situ and early-stage invasive breast carcinoma. These comprehensive recommendations address surgical margins, axillary staging, and radiation therapy, integrating tumor biology with contemporary diagnostic modalities. By standardizing care pathways through structured algorithms, the guidelines enhance prognostic stratification and therapeutic precision. This systematic framework facilitates individualized treatment planning while optimizing oncologic outcomes and quality of life metrics across diverse patient populations, reflecting ongoing evolution in breast oncology practice.
