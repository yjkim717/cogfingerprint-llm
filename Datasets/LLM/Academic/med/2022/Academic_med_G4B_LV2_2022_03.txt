**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) necessitates the development of accessible and reliable diagnostic tools.  Peripheral biomarkers offer a promising avenue for early detection and longitudinal monitoring, yet challenges related to inter-assay variability remain a significant impediment to their clinical utility. This study investigated the robustness of several plasma biomarkers – glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), phosphorylated total tau (p-tau181), and the amyloid-beta ratio (Aβ42/40) – in differentiating individuals with AD from healthy controls, focusing on their discriminative performance across varying assay platforms. 

Data were extracted from a cohort of [Insert Number] participants, utilizing measurements obtained from [Specify Assay Platforms Used]. Analysis revealed a notable disparity in biomarker performance. While GFAP and p-tau181 demonstrated consistently high accuracy and retained their discriminatory capacity despite substantial inter-assay variability, the Aβ42/40 ratio exhibited a marked sensitivity to platform differences. Specifically, changes in assay protocols resulted in a significant decline in the ability of this biomarker to effectively distinguish between AD and cognitively normal subjects. 

These findings underscore the critical need for rigorous standardization and quality control procedures when employing plasma biomarkers for AD research and potential clinical applications.  Future research should prioritize the validation of robust, assay-independent biomarkers, potentially incorporating a multi-marker approach to mitigate the limitations associated with individual analyte variability and enhance the overall diagnostic accuracy in the detection of amyloid pathology.
