**Abstract**

**Genetic Evidence for a Causal Association Between Insomnia Symptoms and Suicidal Behavior: A Mendelian Randomization Study**

**Background:** Suicidal behavior represents a significant global public health challenge, with complex etiologies involving both environmental and genetic factors. While associations between insomnia and suicidal ideation/attempts have been consistently observed, establishing causality remains challenging. Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a known risk factor for both insomnia and suicidal behavior, potentially confounding observed relationships.

**Methods:** Utilizing publicly available genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for insomnia symptoms (N=1,688,798) and suicidal behavior (N=660,734), we employed Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the potential causal effect of insomnia symptoms on suicidal behavior.  Instrumental variables (IVs) were derived from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with insomnia, selected based on stringent clumping and linkage disequilibrium (LD) thresholds (r² < 0.001).  We implemented a series of MR analyses, including inverse variance weighted (IVW) regression, weighted median, MR-Egger regression, and MR-PRESSO, to assess causal inference and address potential pleiotropic effects.  Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of findings to varying IV assumptions and potential horizontal pleiotropy.  Furthermore, we explored the potential mediating role of MDD by conducting MR analyses examining the relationship between insomnia and suicidal behavior, adjusted for genetic predisposition to MDD as determined by established GWAS data. Analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.2.1) with appropriate MR packages (TwoSampleMR, MendelianRandomization).

**Results:** MR analyses revealed a significant positive causal effect of insomnia symptoms on suicidal behavior (IVW: β = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.08-0.16, p = 0.001).  Weighted median and MR-PRESSO analyses yielded consistent estimates, suggesting robustness to pleiotropy.  MR-Egger regression indicated directional pleiotropy, which was accounted for in the IVW model with robust standard errors.  After accounting for genetic liability to MDD, the causal effect remained statistically significant, albeit slightly attenuated (β = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.05-0.13, p = 0.004), suggesting a partial mediating role for MDD.

**Conclusion:** This study provides robust genetic evidence supporting a causal link between insomnia symptoms and suicidal behavior, independent of, and partially mediated by, genetic predisposition to MDD. These findings underscore the importance of screening for and treating insomnia in individuals at risk of suicidal behavior and warrant further clinical investigation into targeted interventions.
