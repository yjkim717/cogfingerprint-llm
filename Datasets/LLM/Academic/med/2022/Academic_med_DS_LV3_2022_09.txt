A 2022 Mendelian randomization investigation provides compelling genetic evidence for a potentially independent causal pathway linking insomnia symptomatology to an elevated risk of suicidal behavior. This study, leveraging large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, employed a two-sample MR framework to infer causality while minimizing confounding and reverse causation biases inherent in observational epidemiology. Instrumental variables, comprising single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly associated with insomnia symptoms, were utilized to estimate the causal effect on suicidal ideation, attempt, and completion. The analysis revealed a significant positive causal estimate, suggesting that genetic predisposition to insomnia confers a direct increase in susceptibility to suicidal outcomes. This relationship persisted after rigorous sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression and weighted median approaches, which tested for and largely excluded pleiotropic effects. Conversely, the study found no statistically significant genetic evidence supporting a causal role for restless leg syndrome in suicidal behavior, indicating a degree of specificity for insomnia-related sleep disturbances within the psychiatric pathophysiology of suicide. These findings underscore the critical importance of insomnia as an independent, modifiable risk factor, rather than a mere epiphenomenon of comorbid psychiatric conditions. They advocate for the prioritization of targeted sleep-focused interventions in public health strategies aimed at suicide prevention, suggesting that ameliorating insomnia could yield significant reductions in population-level suicide risk. This research substantially advances the etiological understanding of suicidal behavior by delineating a specific, genetically-informed causal mechanism.
