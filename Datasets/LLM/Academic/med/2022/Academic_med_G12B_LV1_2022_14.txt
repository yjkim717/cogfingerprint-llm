**Abstract**

**Prevalence of Restorative Needs and Socio-Dental Risk Factors Among Syrian Refugee Children in Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Analysis**

**Background:** The protracted Syrian refugee crisis has resulted in significant population displacement, with Jordan hosting a substantial number of refugee families.  Limited access to preventative dental care and potential disruptions in established oral hygiene practices within refugee settings raise concerns regarding the oral health status of children. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of dental extractions and associated etiological factors among Syrian refugee children residing in Jordan in 2022.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted among a convenience sample of 300 Syrian refugee children (ages 5-12) attending primary schools in Amman, Jordan.  Oral health examinations were performed by trained dental professionals, recording data on extracted teeth, caries experience (using the decayed, missing, and filled teeth – DMFT – index), and pulpal pathologies.  Parental questionnaires collected data on socio-demographic factors, including education level, household income, and reported oral hygiene behaviors (frequency of toothbrushing and access to dental care).  Statistical analysis, including Chi-square tests and logistic regression, was used to explore associations between extraction rates, caries prevalence, pulpal disease, and parental factors.

**Results:** The prevalence of dental extractions was 28.3%. Dental caries (DMFT ≥ 1) was observed in 65.7% of children, with pulpal diseases contributing significantly to extraction needs.  A statistically significant association was found between lower parental education levels (≤ secondary education) and increased odds of both caries experience (OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.21-2.82) and extraction rates (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.35-3.28).  Infrequent toothbrushing (<twice daily) was also independently associated with elevated caries prevalence (OR = 2.55, 95% CI: 1.78-3.67).

**Conclusion:** This study highlights a considerable burden of restorative dental needs among Syrian refugee children in Jordan.  Parental education and consistent toothbrushing practices emerged as key modifiable risk factors. Targeted public health interventions, including oral health education programs for parents and accessible dental services for children, are crucial to mitigate the adverse oral health outcomes experienced by this vulnerable population.

**Notes on Choices & Considerations:**

*   **Formal Language & Terminology:** I used terms like "etiological factors," "cross-sectional analysis," "DMFT index," "odds ratio (OR)," and "confidence intervals (CI)" to establish a formal, medical tone.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a standard IMRaD format (Introduction/Background, Methods, Results, and Conclusion). Each section clearly states its purpose.
*   **Contextualization (2022):** I explicitly included "in 2022" to
