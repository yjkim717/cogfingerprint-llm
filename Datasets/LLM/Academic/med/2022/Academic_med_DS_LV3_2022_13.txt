**Systematic Risk-Based Prioritization of Phthalates and Substitute Plasticisers from Food Contact Materials for Urgent Biomedical Evaluation**

The pervasive use of synthetic plasticisers in food contact materials (FCMs) constitutes a significant and continuous source of human exposure, raising profound concerns for public health due to their endocrine-disrupting properties. In response to escalating evidence linking specific phthalates to adverse developmental, metabolic, and reproductive outcomes, this study establishes a systematic, risk-based framework for the prioritization of plasticisers requiring urgent biomedical evaluation. Leveraging the latest hazard classifications from authoritative bodies (e.g., ECHA, IARC) and critical assessment of toxicological dossiers up to 2022, we developed a multi-criteria decision-analysis model. This model integrates parameters of intrinsic hazard—including carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive toxicity (CMR), and endocrine disruption potency—with estimated human exposure levels derived from biomonitoring data and FCM migration models.

The application of this framework resulted in the stratification of 47 high-production-volume plasticisers into four distinct tiers: exclusion (substances with severe, unmanageable risks), high-priority, medium-priority, and low-priority. Our analysis confirms the placement of several high-molecular-weight phthalates, such as DEHP and DBP, into the exclusion category, validating recent regulatory restrictions. Crucially, it identifies specific substitute plasticisers, including DINCH and DEHT, as high-priority due to significant data gaps concerning their long-term metabolic effects and potential contributions to the pathogenesis of cardiometabolic syndromes. This structured prioritization directly informs targeted biomonitoring initiatives and guides the strategic allocation of resources for longitudinal epidemiological studies, thereby enabling a more proactive and evidence-based approach to mitigating the population-level health risks associated with dietary exposure to plasticisers.
