**Abstract**

The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated a rapid expansion of telehealth services, presenting a potential paradigm shift for addressing persistent healthcare access disparities in rural populations. This study investigates the patient-perceived efficacy of these services through a 2022 survey of rural residents. Our findings indicate a strongly positive reception of telehealth encounters, with high levels of reported satisfaction regarding convenience, communication, and overall care quality. These empirical results substantiate the hypothesis that telehealth modalities can effectively mitigate traditional barriers to care, such as geographic isolation and transportation limitations. We conclude that the strategic integration of telehealth into rural healthcare delivery systems holds significant promise for reducing health inequities. Future policy and implementation efforts should focus on ensuring technological infrastructure and digital literacy to sustain and optimize these gains post-pandemic.
