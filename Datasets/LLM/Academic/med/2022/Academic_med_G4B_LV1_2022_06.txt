**Abstract**

The evolving landscape of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) necessitates personalized treatment strategies. Recent advancements in genomic profiling and biomarker identification are increasingly informing therapeutic decisions. This study examines the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline update regarding biomarker-driven systemic therapy in MBC patients.  The guideline emphasizes the utility of comprehensive molecular testing, specifically focusing on actionable mutations within *PIK3CA*, *BRCA1/2*, and *NTRK*, alongside broader genomic analyses.  

Rationale for this shift stems from the recognition that patients with MBC demonstrate significant heterogeneity in their underlying tumor biology. Identification of these biomarkers allows for stratification, facilitating the selection of targeted pharmaceutical therapies – including PI3K inhibitors and PARP inhibitors – with increased probability of clinical benefit.  Furthermore, genetic testing can predict response to certain systemic regimens, potentially minimizing unnecessary exposure to ineffective treatments and associated toxicity.  Implementation of these biomarker-guided approaches represents a critical step toward optimizing therapeutic outcomes and improving the quality of life for individuals diagnosed with MBC. Future research should focus on expanding the panel of tested biomarkers and validating their predictive value across diverse patient populations.
