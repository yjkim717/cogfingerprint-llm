The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has revised its guidelines for the management of rectal cancer, incorporating recent evidence on total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) and nonoperative management (NOM) strategies. For patients with nonmetastatic rectal cancer, TNT has emerged as a viable approach, demonstrating improved treatment outcomes and reduced toxicity. The updated NCCN Guidelines reflect this paradigm shift, recommending TNT as a preferred treatment option for select patients. Furthermore, the guidelines acknowledge the growing role of NOM, including watch-and-wait (WW) strategies, in carefully selected patients who achieve a clinical complete response (cCR) following neoadjuvant therapy. As of 2022, these updates underscore the evolving landscape of rectal cancer treatment, emphasizing personalized, multidisciplinary approaches to optimize patient outcomes. The revised guidelines provide a framework for clinicians to integrate these advancements into practice.
