**Abstract**

**Assessing the Utility of Plasma Biomarkers for Amyloid Pathology Detection in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Focus on GFAP and p-Tau181 Stability**

**Background:** Accurate and accessible biomarkers for early detection of amyloid pathology are crucial for advancing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis and therapeutic intervention. While amyloid positron emission tomography (Amyloid-PET) remains the gold standard for *in vivo* amyloid assessment, its cost and limited availability necessitate the development of reliable and readily obtainable peripheral biomarkers. Recent research has focused on plasma-based biomarkers, but concerns regarding their stability and inter-individual variability remain a significant barrier to clinical implementation.

**Methods:** This study investigated the robustness of several plasma biomarkers – including amyloid-β (Aβ) isoforms, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and phosphorylated tau at residue 181 (p-tau181) – in relation to Amyloid-PET scan results in a cohort of [Specify Number] participants undergoing evaluation for cognitive impairment.  Data were collected between [Start Date] and [End Date] (2022).  Statistical analyses included correlation analyses to assess biomarker-Amyloid-PET relationships, and mixed-effects models to evaluate inter-subject variability and longitudinal stability of each biomarker.  Special attention was paid to the temporal profiles of GFAP and p-tau181, given their reported association with neuroinflammation and tau pathology, respectively.

**Results:**  Our findings demonstrate a moderate correlation between plasma Aβ ratios (Aβ42/Aβ40) and Amyloid-PET SUVR (Standardized Uptake Value Ratio) in [Specific Brain Region, e.g., precuneus]. However, we observed significantly increased inter-subject variability in plasma Aβ measurements compared to GFAP and p-tau181.  Notably, GFAP and p-tau181 exhibited greater stability over the observation period, although with inherently higher baseline variability.  Further analysis revealed that the variability in GFAP and p-tau181 levels was positively associated with markers of systemic inflammation [Mention potential markers if applicable, e.g., CRP, IL-6], suggesting a potential confounding factor.

**Conclusion:** While plasma Aβ ratios show promise for amyloid detection, the pronounced variability observed in this study highlights the need for improved standardization and harmonization of assays.  Our results suggest that GFAP and p-tau181, despite their inherent variability, may offer a more robust assessment of underlying neurodegenerative processes in AD due to their greater stability. Future research should focus on refining analytical methodologies, investigating the influence of systemic inflammation on plasma biomarker profiles, and exploring combination biomarker panels that integrate GFAP, p-tau181, and Aβ measures to enhance diagnostic accuracy and prognostic utility.
