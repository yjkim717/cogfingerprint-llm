In the evolving landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostics, plasma biomarkers have emerged as promising non-invasive tools for detecting cerebral amyloidosis, traditionally assessed via amyloid PET. This study, conducted in 2022, systematically evaluates the performance of key plasma biomarkers—specifically amyloid-β 42/40 (Aβ42/40) measured by immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau181)—across the AD continuum. Our findings confirm that IP-MS-based Aβ42/40 exhibits high diagnostic accuracy in identifying amyloid PET positivity, from preclinical to dementia stages, underscoring its potential for large-scale screening. However, a critical limitation arises from substantial inter-assay variability, which compromises the robustness and generalizability of Aβ42/40 measurements across different platforms and cohorts. In contrast, GFAP and p-tau181 demonstrate consistent performance with minimal variability, enhancing their reliability as ancillary biomarkers in diverse clinical settings. Multivariate predictive models integrating these biomarkers reveal that while Aβ42/40 contributes significant discriminatory power, its utility is constrained by pre-analytical and analytical inconsistencies. These results advocate for standardized assay protocols to mitigate variability and highlight the complementary roles of GFAP and p-tau181 in refining AD risk stratification. This research underscores the imperative of addressing methodological heterogeneity to realize the full potential of plasma-based biomarkers in revolutionizing AD diagnosis and monitoring.
