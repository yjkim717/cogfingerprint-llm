**Abstract**

The evolving landscape of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) necessitates robust biomarkers for early detection and stratification of preclinical stages. This study investigates the utility of plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, specifically p-tau231 and p-tau217, in predicting early amyloid pathology and longitudinal retention observed via positron emission tomography (PET). Analyses conducted in 2022 reveal significant positive correlations between plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 levels and quantifiable amyloid-beta deposition, as evidenced by both amyloid PET imaging and established plasma amyloid biomarkers.  Notably, these p-tau markers exhibited a stronger predictive capacity than conventional amyloid measures alone. These findings suggest that incorporating plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 into clinical trials targeting preclinical AD represents a promising strategy for enriching participant pools and improving diagnostic accuracy.  Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the dynamic relationship between these biomarkers and disease progression, ultimately facilitating earlier intervention and improved therapeutic outcomes.
