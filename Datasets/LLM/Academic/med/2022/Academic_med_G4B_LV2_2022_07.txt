**Abstract**

Adult diffuse gliomas represent a significant challenge in neuro-oncology, necessitating standardized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This study addresses a critical clarification regarding the authorship attribution of a foundational document detailing the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) guidelines for the management of these tumors. Specifically, we report a correction to the acknowledged contributors, rectifying an initial misrepresentation that has potentially impacted the dissemination and interpretation of established clinical recommendations.  The EANO guidelines, developed to standardize care, are pivotal for optimizing patient outcomes in diffuse gliomas.  Accurate attribution of authorship is paramount for maintaining scientific integrity and facilitating future research endeavors.  This correction underscores the importance of meticulous documentation within the development of clinical guidelines and serves as a cautionary example for ensuring transparency in collaborative medical literature. Further investigation into the broader impact of this authorship correction is warranted to fully assess its implications for clinical practice in 2022 and beyond.
