**Abstract**

Recent revisions to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines reflect evolving paradigms in the management of localized, resectable rectal cancer and malignant polyps. This update, released in 2022, emphasizes the increasing applicability of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) as a standard treatment strategy. TNT, encompassing a multimodal approach typically involving chemotherapy and radiation therapy administered prior to surgical resection, is proposed to optimize tumor downstaging and potentially improve long-term oncologic outcomes. Furthermore, the guidelines address the growing evidence supporting short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) regimens, particularly within the context of a “watch-and-wait” strategy for clinically stage I–II rectal cancer. The update provides detailed recommendations regarding patient selection criteria, treatment sequencing, and monitoring protocols for these approaches. This document serves as a critical resource for multidisciplinary teams involved in rectal cancer care, facilitating evidence-based decision-making and promoting individualized treatment plans aimed at maximizing patient survival and quality of life.
