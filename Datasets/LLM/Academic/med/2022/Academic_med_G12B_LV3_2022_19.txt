**Abstract**

Recent revisions to the 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for rectal cancer reflect a paradigm shift in treatment strategies, driven by accumulating clinical evidence. A notable update emphasizes the growing role of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), incorporating both chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgical resection, demonstrating improved pathological complete response rates and potentially impacting long-term outcomes. Furthermore, the guidelines acknowledge the expanded applicability of short-course radiation therapy (SCRT) regimens, refining techniques to optimize tumor downstaging while minimizing treatment-related toxicities. Critically, the 2022 NCCN guidelines formally incorporate a non-operative 'watch-and-wait' approach for select patients exhibiting complete clinical and radiological responses following neoadjuvant treatment. This innovative strategy holds the promise of avoiding unnecessary surgery and its associated morbidity in carefully selected individuals, representing a significant advance in rectal cancer management.
