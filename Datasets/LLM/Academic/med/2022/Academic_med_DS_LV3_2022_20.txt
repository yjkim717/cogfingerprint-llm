**Abstract**

The 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline update represents a pivotal advancement in the molecular stratification of metastatic breast cancer (MBC), systematically integrating biomarker-driven therapeutics into clinical practice. This evidence-based framework underscores the critical role of comprehensive genomic profiling to guide the application of targeted and immunotherapeutic agents. A cornerstone of this approach is the identification of *PIK3CA* mutations in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative disease, which predicts sensitivity to alpelisib, a PI3KÎ±-specific inhibitor, in combination with endocrine therapy. Concurrently, the detection of germline or somatic *BRCA1/2* mutations remains a key indication for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy, leveraging synthetic lethality to induce tumor cell death in homologous recombination-deficient cancers.

Furthermore, the guideline delineates the utility of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemical testing in triple-negative MBC, establishing it as a prerequisite for first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) use in combination with chemotherapy. The assessment of mismatch repair (MMR) status or tumor mutational burden is also endorsed to identify a rare but clinically significant population that may derive profound benefit from ICIs, irrespective of breast cancer subtype. However, the update judiciously identifies areas with insufficient evidence for routine recommendation, highlighting the need for further research on novel biomarkers and combinations. The evolving role of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for dynamic biomarker assessment and monitoring of therapeutic resistance is acknowledged as a promising, yet not yet standardized, tool. In conclusion, the 2022 ASCO guidelines provide a structured, molecularly-defined roadmap for personalizing MBC management, while simultaneously charting a course for future investigative priorities to address existing evidence gaps and refine therapeutic algorithms.
