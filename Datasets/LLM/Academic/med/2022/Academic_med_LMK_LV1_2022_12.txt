**Title:** Comparative Effectiveness of Metabolic Surgery versus Conventional Medical and Lifestyle Interventions in Achieving Long-Term Remission of Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

**Abstract:**

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and progressive pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Despite advances in medical therapy and lifestyle interventions, achieving sustained glycemic control remains a significant challenge for many patients. Metabolic surgery, also known as bariatric surgery, has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for T2D management, with evidence suggesting superior efficacy in inducing diabetes remission. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the effectiveness of metabolic surgery versus conventional medical and lifestyle interventions in achieving long-term T2D remission.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that compared metabolic surgery with non-surgical interventions for T2D management. Studies with a minimum follow-up duration of 3 years were included to assess the durability of treatment outcomes. The primary outcome of interest was T2D remission, defined as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) < 6.5% without antidiabetic medication.

Our meta-analysis included data from 12 studies, comprising 1,542 patients with T2D who underwent either metabolic surgery (n = 741) or conventional medical and lifestyle interventions (n = 801). At 3-year follow-up, the pooled rate of T2D remission was significantly higher in the metabolic surgery group compared to the non-surgical group (54.3% vs. 14.1%, odds ratio [OR]: 6.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.17-9.31, P < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy were associated with higher remission rates compared to adjustable gastric banding.

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that metabolic surgery is more effective than conventional medical and lifestyle interventions in achieving long-term T2D remission. The results support the current evidence base and reinforce the role of metabolic surgery as a viable treatment option for patients with T2D who are inadequately controlled with medical therapy. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the superior efficacy of metabolic surgery and to identify patient-specific factors that predict optimal treatment outcomes.
