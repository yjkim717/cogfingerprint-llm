## Abstract: Harnessing Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes for Lung Cancer: Current Status and Future Directions

Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with a significant proportion of patients exhibiting resistance to conventional therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This review, conducted in 2022, synthesizes current understanding of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapy as a promising therapeutic modality for this challenging patient population. TILs, naturally occurring lymphocytes that infiltrate the tumor microenvironment, demonstrate inherent anti-tumor activity, which can be ex vivo expanded and re-infused to enhance immune responses. We analyze recent clinical trial data evaluating TIL therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), highlighting responses observed in patients refractory to ICIs.  Furthermore, we discuss the complexities inherent in TIL-based immunotherapy, including patient selection, TIL manufacturing variability, and the potential for immune-related adverse events.  Finally, we explore future research directions aimed at optimizing TIL therapy, such as combination strategies with ICIs or targeted therapies, engineering TILs to enhance their efficacy, and developing predictive biomarkers to identify patients most likely to benefit from this personalized immunotherapeutic approach, ultimately striving to improve outcomes in advanced lung cancer.
