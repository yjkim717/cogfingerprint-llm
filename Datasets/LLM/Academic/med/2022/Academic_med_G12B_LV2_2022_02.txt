**Plasma Phospho-Tau Biomarkers (p-Tau231 and p-Tau217) as Indicators of Early Amyloid Deposition in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease**

**Abstract**

The identification of reliable biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression remains a critical challenge in therapeutic development. This study, conducted in 2022, investigates the utility of circulating phosphorylated tau isoforms, specifically plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217, as indicators of early amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, a hallmark of AD. Utilizing a cohort undergoing amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we assessed the correlation between plasma p-tau levels and Aβ deposition patterns. Our findings demonstrate a robust and statistically significant correlation between both p-tau231 and p-tau217 concentrations and the presence and extent of Aβ accumulation as quantified by PET imaging. Importantly, this association was observed even in individuals exhibiting no overt clinical symptoms, suggesting potential utility in identifying preclinical AD. While both isoforms showed strong correlation, p-tau217 exhibited a slightly enhanced sensitivity in detecting early amyloid changes. These results provide compelling evidence supporting the clinical validation of plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 as promising biomarkers for inclusion in preclinical AD trials, facilitating the selection of participants at an early stage of disease progression. Further research is warranted to evaluate the prognostic value of these biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline and to elucidate the relationship between tau phosphorylation and Aβ-induced neurodegeneration, ultimately contributing to the development of targeted disease-modifying therapies.
