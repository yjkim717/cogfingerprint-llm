Title: Plasma Phosphorylated Tau as a Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Biomarker: Emerging Evidence

Abstract:
The preclinical detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for early intervention and disease modification. Recent advancements in plasma biomarker research have identified phosphorylated tau (p-tau) as a promising indicator of amyloid-β pathology. Specifically, plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 have been shown to correlate with early amyloid-β changes, offering a potential avenue for non-invasive diagnosis. Studies conducted in 2022 have further elucidated the role of these biomarkers in detecting preclinical AD, demonstrating their capacity to distinguish between individuals with and without amyloid-β pathology. The integration of plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 into clinical practice may enable the early identification of individuals at risk of AD, facilitating timely therapeutic intervention and potentially improving patient outcomes. This review synthesizes current evidence on the utility of plasma p-tau biomarkers in preclinical AD detection, highlighting their potential to revolutionize AD diagnosis and treatment.
