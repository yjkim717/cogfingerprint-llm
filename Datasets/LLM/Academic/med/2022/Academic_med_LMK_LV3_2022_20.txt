Title: Integrating Biomarkers into Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer: An Update on Precision Medicine Approaches

Abstract:
The management of metastatic breast cancer has been revolutionized by the integration of biomarker-driven systemic therapy, as underscored by the updated ASCO guideline in 2022. This paradigm shift towards precision medicine is facilitated by the identification of actionable molecular alterations, including PIK3CA mutations, germline BRCA1/2 mutations, and PD-L1 expression. Biomarker testing is now recommended to guide therapeutic decision-making, enabling targeted interventions and optimizing patient outcomes. The incorporation of these biomarkers into clinical practice has expanded treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer, highlighting the importance of molecular profiling in contemporary oncology. As the landscape of precision medicine continues to evolve, ongoing research is poised to uncover novel biomarkers and refine existing therapeutic strategies, further transforming the care of patients with advanced breast cancer.
