Title: Plasma Phospho-Tau Variants as Blood Biomarkers for Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease: A Comparative Analysis

Abstract:

The identification of reliable blood biomarkers for preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of plasma phospho-tau (p-tau) variants in detecting amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. This study compares the diagnostic performance of plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 in identifying early Aβ changes in preclinical AD. Using a cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals, we measured plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 levels and assessed their association with Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) status. Both p-tau variants were significantly elevated in Aβ-positive individuals and demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for detecting Aβ pathology. Plasma p-tau217 exhibited a slightly higher area under the curve (AUC) compared to p-tau231 (0.92 vs. 0.89, p = 0.07). Our findings suggest that both plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 are promising blood biomarkers for preclinical AD, with p-tau217 showing marginally superior performance. These results have implications for the development of cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic tools for early AD detection.
