This 2022 update to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines provides critical recommendations for managing localized rectal cancer. It emphasizes a paradigm shift towards total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), integrating systemic chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery to enhance pathological complete response rates. The guidelines offer refined stratification for managing malignant polyps, detailing criteria for transanal excision versus radical resection based on histopathological risk factors. Furthermore, the update formally endorses nonoperative, watch-and-wait management for patients achieving a clinical complete response following neoadjuvant treatment, underscoring the importance of rigorous surveillance protocols. These evidence-based refinements aim to optimize oncologic outcomes while expanding organ preservation strategies for select patient cohorts.
