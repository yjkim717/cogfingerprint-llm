**Abstract**

**Background:** Rural populations consistently experience significant healthcare access disparities compared to their urban counterparts, exacerbated by geographic isolation, limited provider availability, and socioeconomic factors. The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social distancing measures underscored the urgent need for innovative solutions to bridge this gap. Telehealth has emerged as a potentially transformative modality, yet its implementation and resident acceptance in rural settings require rigorous evaluation.

**Objective:** This study investigates the feasibility and resident perceptions of telehealth interventions designed to mitigate rural healthcare access barriers. 

**Methods:** A mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating quantitative analysis of telehealth utilization data and qualitative data gathered from resident surveys and interviews conducted between January and December 2022. Participants included rural dwellers accessing telehealth services for primary and specialist care.

**Results:** Findings demonstrate a positive correlation between telehealth availability and healthcare utilization among rural residents. Qualitative data revealed overwhelmingly favorable resident experiences, citing convenience, reduced travel time, and improved access to specialist consultations as key benefits. 

**Conclusion:** Telehealth holds considerable promise for addressing rural health disparities and enhancing healthcare equity. Further research should focus on optimizing telehealth infrastructure, ensuring digital literacy, and addressing reimbursement models to facilitate sustainable implementation and maximize impact within rural communities.
