**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of plasticisers – specifically phthalates – within consumer goods necessitates rigorous risk assessment strategies.  In 2022, a comprehensive evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel addressed the potential hazards associated with these substances utilized in food contact materials. This assessment employed a tiered approach, prioritizing substances based on projected human exposure levels derived from collaborative data analysis with the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The methodology incorporated established hazard classifications, considering both acute and chronic toxicity profiles.  Findings suggest a need for heightened vigilance regarding potential endocrine disruption and developmental effects linked to specific phthalate exposures.  Further research is warranted to refine exposure modelling and establish robust, science-based regulatory limits, ultimately safeguarding public health from the downstream effects of widespread plasticiser migration into the food chain.
