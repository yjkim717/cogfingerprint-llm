**Abstract: Prioritization of Phthalate Plasticizers for Endocrine Disruption Risk Assessment in Food Contact Materials â€“ A 2022 Review**

The widespread utilization of plasticizers, notably phthalates, within food contact materials (FCMs) presents a potential public health concern, particularly given their demonstrated endocrine disrupting properties. This review synthesizes current knowledge to propose a prioritized framework for risk assessment concerning phthalate migration from FCMs, reflecting critical developments within the field in 2022.  Traditional risk assessment methodologies often struggle to adequately address the complex interplay of exposure pathways and individual susceptibility, necessitating a refined approach. 

We argue for a tiered prioritization system based on a combination of factors: (1) documented endocrine activity *in vitro* and *in vivo*; (2) potential for significant migration rates from prevalent FCM types; and (3) vulnerable population groups (e.g., infants, pregnant women) exhibiting heightened sensitivity.  Specifically, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and diisononyl phthalate (DINP) remain central to this assessment, alongside emerging concerns regarding alternative phthalates and non-phthalate plasticizers.  Further research is urgently needed to quantify migration rates under diverse processing and storage conditions, alongside robust toxicokinetic modelling.  This prioritized approach aims to facilitate more targeted regulatory action and ultimately mitigate potential adverse health outcomes associated with phthalate exposure via the food chain.
