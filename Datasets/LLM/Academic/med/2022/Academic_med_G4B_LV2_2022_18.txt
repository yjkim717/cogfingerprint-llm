**Abstract**

The 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines represent a critical update to locoregional management strategies for breast cancer, encompassing both early-stage invasive carcinoma and carcinoma in situ (CIS). This document synthesizes current evidence to inform clinical decision-making, prioritizing patient-centered care and optimizing treatment outcomes. Specifically, the guidelines delineate preferred surgical approaches, including lumpectomy versus mastectomy, tailored to tumor characteristics and patient factors. Furthermore, they address adjuvant therapies, such as radiation therapy and systemic treatments, with nuanced recommendations based on risk stratification. Consideration is given to the unique challenges posed by CIS, emphasizing meticulous local excision and potential for sentinel lymph node biopsy.  Adherence to these NCCN recommendations is essential for ensuring consistent and evidence-based clinical practice within the breast cancer specialty.
