Title: Biomarker-Guided Systemic Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer: An Update on Personalized Medicine Approaches


#### Abstract

Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains a significant clinical challenge, necessitating the development of effective, tailored therapeutic strategies. The integration of biomarker testing into clinical practice has revolutionized the management of MBC, enabling healthcare providers to deliver personalized systemic therapy. In 2022, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) updated its guidelines for biomarker testing in MBC, underscoring the critical role of genetic testing in informing treatment decisions. This review aims to summarize the ASCO guideline update and its implications for clinical practice.


The updated guidelines emphasize the importance of testing for key biomarkers, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), as well as genetic mutations such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. The recommendations highlight the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and other advanced genetic testing methodologies in identifying actionable mutations and guiding targeted therapy. Furthermore, the guidelines address the role of liquid biopsies and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis in monitoring treatment response and detecting emerging resistance.

By integrating biomarker testing into clinical decision-making, healthcare providers can optimize systemic therapy for patients with MBC, improving treatment outcomes and quality of life. The ASCO guideline update provides a framework for clinicians to navigate the complex landscape of personalized medicine in MBC, underscoring the need for continued research into novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. As the field continues to evolve, the incorporation of emerging biomarkers and technologies is expected to further refine treatment strategies, ultimately enhancing patient care.
