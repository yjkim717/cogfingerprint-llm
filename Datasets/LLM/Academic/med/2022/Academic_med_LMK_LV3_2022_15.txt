Title: Enhancing Healthcare Equity in Rural Settings through Telehealth: A COVID-19 Era Paradigm Shift

Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of telehealth services, presenting a unique opportunity to address longstanding healthcare disparities in rural areas. As of 2022, evidence suggests that telehealth has been instrumental in improving healthcare access among rural populations, particularly among younger demographics. By leveraging digital technologies, telehealth has bridged geographical and socio-economic barriers, fostering greater healthcare equity. This paradigm shift has significant implications for rural health policy, highlighting the need for sustained investment in telehealth infrastructure and targeted interventions to address the unique needs of rural communities. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, further research is necessary to fully elucidate the impact of telehealth on healthcare outcomes in rural settings and inform evidence-based practice.
