Title: Mitigating Rural Healthcare Disparities through Telehealth: A Promising Avenue for Enhanced Access and Equity

Abstract:

Rural populations continue to face pronounced healthcare disparities, stemming from geographical isolation, limited provider availability, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. Telehealth, a rapidly evolving paradigm, has emerged as a viable strategy to address these inequities. By leveraging telecommunications technology, telehealth facilitates remote consultations, monitoring, and education, effectively bridging the distance between rural communities and healthcare services. This systematic review examines the efficacy of telehealth interventions in mitigating rural healthcare disparities, with a focus on access, quality, and health outcomes. Our analysis reveals that telehealth initiatives have shown promise in improving healthcare utilization, reducing hospitalization rates, and enhancing patient satisfaction among rural populations. As the healthcare landscape continues to evolve, telehealth is poised to play an increasingly pivotal role in promoting health equity and reducing disparities in rural areas, aligning with global efforts to achieve universal health coverage by 2030.
