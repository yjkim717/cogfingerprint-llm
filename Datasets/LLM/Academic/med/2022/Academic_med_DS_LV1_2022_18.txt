This 2022 review synthesizes the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for the locoregional management of non-invasive and early-stage breast malignancies. It critically examines the stratified therapeutic algorithms for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Paget disease, and early invasive carcinoma. The analysis delineates evidence-based recommendations for surgical intervention, radiation oncology, and systemic therapy, emphasizing risk-adapted strategies to optimize oncologic outcomes while mitigating overtreatment. The guidelines provide a standardized framework to support multidisciplinary clinical decision-making, aiming to harmonize care delivery and improve prognostic indicators for these patient cohorts.
