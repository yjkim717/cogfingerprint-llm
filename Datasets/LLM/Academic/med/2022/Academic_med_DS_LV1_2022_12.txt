**Comparative Efficacy of Metabolic Surgery versus Intensive Medical and Lifestyle Therapy for Type 2 Diabetes Remission: A Three-Year Follow-Up Analysis**

**Abstract**

**Background:** The escalating global burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) necessitates a critical re-evaluation of therapeutic strategies beyond conventional glycemic control. While intensive medical and lifestyle intervention (IMLI) remains the cornerstone of management, metabolic (bariatric) surgery has emerged as a potent intervention, demonstrating profound effects on glucose homeostasis. However, long-term, head-to-head comparative data on durable diabetes remission remain pivotal for informing clinical guidelines and patient selection.

**Objective:** To compare the efficacy of metabolic surgery versus IMLI in achieving durable remission of T2D over a three-year follow-up period.

**Methods:** In this prospective, matched-cohort study, 150 adults with obesity and inadequately controlled T2D (HbA1c >7.5%) were allocated to either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy (Metabolic Surgery Group, n=100) or a structured IMLI protocol (IMLI Group, n=50). The IMLI protocol comprised pharmacotherapy intensification according to standard algorithms, supervised physical activity, and medical nutrition therapy. The primary outcome was diabetes remission, defined as HbA1c <6.5% without glucose-lowering medications for at least three months. Secondary outcomes included changes in weight, cardiometabolic risk factors, and medication burden.

**Results:** At the 36-month endpoint, the metabolic surgery group demonstrated a significantly higher rate of diabetes remission compared to the IMLI group (65% vs. 12%; p<0.001). Participants undergoing surgery also exhibited superior outcomes in terms of mean percentage total body weight loss (-25.3% ± 6.1% vs. -5.2% ± 3.8%; p<0.001), improvements in systolic blood pressure, lipid profiles, and a marked reduction in the use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents. No mortality was reported in either group, with surgical adverse events being manageable and consistent with established safety profiles.

**Conclusion:** In patients with obesity and T2D, metabolic surgery is a significantly more effective intervention than IMLI for achieving sustained diabetes remission and multi-system metabolic improvement over three years. These findings, current for 2022, underscore the need to consider metabolic surgery not as a last resort but as a primary treatment option for appropriate candidates, potentially altering the disease trajectory and reducing long-term micro- and macrovascular complications.
