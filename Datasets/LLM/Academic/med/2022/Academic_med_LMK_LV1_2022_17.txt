Title: Evaluating the Diagnostic Utility of Plasma Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease: An Examination of Inter-Assay Variability and Biomarker Combinations

Abstract:

The identification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology through minimally invasive and accessible biomarkers is a pressing concern in contemporary neurology. Plasma biomarkers have garnered significant attention as potential diagnostic tools, particularly in detecting amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, a hallmark of AD. However, the variability in assay methodologies and the impact of combining multiple biomarkers on diagnostic accuracy remain understudied. This study aimed to assess the robustness of plasma biomarkers in detecting AD pathology across different disease stages, focusing on inter-assay variability and the diagnostic utility of biomarker combinations.

A cohort of 250 participants, comprising individuals with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment, and AD dementia, underwent comprehensive clinical evaluations and plasma biomarker assessments. Three distinct plasma biomarkers, namely Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, phosphorylated tau (p-tau)181, and neurofilament light chain (NfL), were measured using three different assay platforms to evaluate inter-assay variability. The diagnostic accuracy of individual biomarkers and their combinations was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Our results demonstrate significant inter-assay variability in plasma biomarker measurements, particularly for Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and p-tau181. However, the diagnostic accuracy of individual biomarkers for detecting Aβ pathology was generally consistent across assay platforms, with Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio exhibiting the highest area under the ROC curve (AUC = 0.85). The combination of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and p-tau181 yielded a significantly improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.92) compared to individual biomarkers. Notably, the diagnostic utility of biomarker combinations varied across disease stages, with the combination of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and NfL demonstrating enhanced diagnostic accuracy in early-stage AD.

This study underscores the importance of considering inter-assay variability when evaluating plasma biomarkers for AD diagnosis. Our findings suggest that combining multiple biomarkers can enhance diagnostic accuracy, particularly when tailored to specific disease stages. The results of this study have significant implications for the development of plasma biomarker-based diagnostic tests for AD and highlight the need for standardized assay methodologies to facilitate clinical translation. As the field continues to evolve, further research is warranted to validate these findings and explore the utility of plasma biomarkers in diverse clinical settings.
