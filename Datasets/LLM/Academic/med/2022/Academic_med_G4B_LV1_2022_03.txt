**Abstract**

The early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a significant clinical challenge.  Non-invasive biomarkers offer a promising avenue for longitudinal monitoring, yet variability across analytical assays presents a substantial obstacle to reliable diagnostic utility. This study investigated the inter-assay variability of plasma biomarkers – specifically glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and phosphorylated total tau protein at residue 181 (p-tau181) – in a cohort of cognitively impaired individuals, aiming to evaluate their robustness in reflecting underlying amyloid pathology.  A total of [Insert Number] plasma samples were collected from participants exhibiting varying degrees of cognitive impairment, alongside established amyloid imaging data obtained via [Mention Imaging Method, e.g., PET scans]. 

Results demonstrated that both GFAP and p-tau181 exhibited acceptable levels of accuracy in correlating with amyloid burden, exhibiting a moderate degree of inter-assay variability.  Statistical analyses revealed [mention key statistical findings, e.g., correlation coefficients and p-values].  These findings suggest that GFAP and p-tau181, when implemented within standardized assay protocols and interpreted cautiously, may serve as valuable adjunct biomarkers for identifying individuals at risk of or with early AD.  Further research is warranted to refine assay harmonization and explore the potential of combining these plasma markers with other established biomarkers to achieve greater diagnostic precision and improve patient stratification strategies by 2023.
