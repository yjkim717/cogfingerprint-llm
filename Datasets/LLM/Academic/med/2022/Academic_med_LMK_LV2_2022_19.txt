**Abstract**

The 2022 updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Rectal Cancer underscore significant advancements in the management of malignant polyps and resectable nonmetastatic rectal cancer. This review highlights the evolving role of neoadjuvant therapy and nonoperative management in optimizing patient outcomes. The revised guidelines emphasize the integration of radiation therapy in the treatment paradigm, particularly for patients with locally advanced disease. By synthesizing current evidence, the NCCN Guidelines provide a framework for clinicians to tailor treatment strategies to individual patient needs. This update underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in rectal cancer management, incorporating surgical, medical, and radiation oncology expertise. The refined recommendations aim to improve treatment efficacy, minimize toxicity, and enhance quality of life for patients with rectal cancer.
