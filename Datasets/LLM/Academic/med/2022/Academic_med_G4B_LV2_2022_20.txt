**Abstract: Personalized Systemic Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer: The Role of Biomarker-Guided Genetic Testing â€“ 2022 ASCO Guideline Update**

The evolving landscape of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) necessitates a shift towards individualized systemic therapy approaches. Recent updates to the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline underscore the critical role of biomarker-guided genetic testing in optimizing patient outcomes. This guideline revises prior recommendations, advocating for comprehensive genomic profiling in newly diagnosed MBC patients, irrespective of prior adjuvant therapy.  Specifically, testing for alterations in genes such as *PIK3CA*, *TP53*, *PTEN*, and *BRCA1/2*, among others, is now central to informing treatment decisions. 

The rationale stems from the increasing recognition that tumor heterogeneity and driver mutations significantly impact response to standard systemic regimens. Utilizing multi-gene assays allows clinicians to identify patients likely to benefit from targeted therapies, including PARP inhibitors and AKT inhibitors, while potentially sparing those unlikely to respond from unnecessary toxicity.  Furthermore, genetic testing informs consideration of clinical trials evaluating novel agents.  

This guideline emphasizes the importance of standardized testing protocols and interpretation to ensure consistent and accurate clinical application.  Future research should focus on refining testing algorithms, validating novel biomarkers, and establishing robust clinical trial designs incorporating genomic data to truly realize the potential of personalized systemic therapy in MBC.
