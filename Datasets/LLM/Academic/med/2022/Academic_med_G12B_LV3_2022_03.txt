**Abstract**

The early and accurate detection of amyloid pathology is crucial for timely intervention in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While amyloid PET imaging remains the gold standard, its accessibility and cost limit widespread screening. This study, conducted in 2022, evaluated the performance and reliability of readily accessible plasma biomarkers—Aβ42/40 ratio, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and phosphorylated tau at position 181 (p-tau181)—in representing amyloid burden across the AD spectrum. Analysis of longitudinal plasma samples revealed that both GFAP and p-tau181 demonstrated superior inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) compared to the Aβ42/40 ratio, suggesting enhanced robustness for clinical application.  Furthermore, these biomarkers exhibited strong correlations with amyloid PET positivity, particularly p-tau181, indicating its potential as a surrogate marker for amyloid deposition. These findings support the expanding role of plasma GFAP and p-tau181 as valuable, cost-effective tools for identifying individuals with AD-related amyloid pathology and monitoring disease progression, particularly within diverse clinical cohorts and longitudinal studies. Further validation in larger, more diverse populations is warranted to solidify these findings and refine their clinical utility.
