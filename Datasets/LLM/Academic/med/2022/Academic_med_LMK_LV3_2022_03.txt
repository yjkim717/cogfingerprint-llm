Title: Evaluating the Diagnostic Accuracy of Plasma Biomarkers for Amyloid-β Pathology across the Alzheimer's Disease Continuum: A Robustness Analysis

Abstract:

The Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum encompasses a spectrum of pathological changes, with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology being a hallmark feature. Recent advances in plasma biomarker assays have shown promise in detecting Aβ pathology, offering a minimally invasive and cost-effective alternative to traditional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging biomarkers. However, the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of these plasma biomarkers across different stages of the AD continuum remain uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the performance of plasma biomarkers in detecting Aβ pathology and to assess their robustness across various stages of AD progression.

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of plasma biomarkers, including Aβ42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and neurofilament light chain (NfL), in a cohort of 500 participants spanning the AD continuum. Participants were categorized into distinct groups based on their Aβ status, as determined by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. We employed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of each plasma biomarker and developed biomarker models using logistic regression.

Our results demonstrated that plasma Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau181 showed high accuracy in detecting Aβ pathology, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.92 and 0.90, respectively. Notably, the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers remained robust across different stages of AD progression, including preclinical and prodromal stages. Furthermore, the combination of plasma biomarkers in a multivariate model enhanced diagnostic accuracy, achieving an AUC of 0.95.

Robustness analysis revealed that the diagnostic performance of plasma biomarkers was not significantly affected by age, sex, or apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status. These findings suggest that plasma biomarkers, particularly Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau181, hold great promise as a non-invasive and reliable tool for detecting Aβ pathology across the AD continuum. The development of accurate and robust biomarker models has significant implications for AD diagnosis, clinical trials, and disease monitoring.

In conclusion, our study demonstrates the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of plasma biomarkers in detecting Aβ pathology across different stages of AD progression. These findings support the use of plasma biomarkers as a valuable tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of AD, and highlight their potential to facilitate the development of disease-modifying therapies.
