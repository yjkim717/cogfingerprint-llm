**Title:** Updated Biomarker-Driven Recommendations for Systemic Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer: An Expert Panel Review

**Abstract:**

In 2022, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) released an updated guideline for the utilization of biomarkers in metastatic breast cancer (MBC), underscoring the pivotal role of precision medicine in optimizing systemic therapy. This expert panel review synthesizes the latest evidence to inform clinical decision-making regarding biomarker-driven therapy eligibility. The ASCO panel recommends the routine assessment of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in MBC patients to guide endocrine and anti-HER2 therapy, respectively. Furthermore, the panel endorses the use of PARP inhibitors in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations and highlights the emerging utility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing in identifying actionable mutations. Specifically, the detection of BRCA1/2 mutations in ctDNA may facilitate the use of PARP inhibitors in patients with MBC, regardless of their germline mutation status. The panel also acknowledges the potential of other biomarkers, such as PIK3CA mutations, to predict response to targeted therapies. By integrating biomarker data into clinical practice, healthcare providers can tailor systemic therapy to individual patients' tumor profiles, thereby improving treatment outcomes and mitigating unnecessary toxicity. This review aims to distill the ASCO guideline's key recommendations, providing oncologists with a concise framework for incorporating biomarker-driven decision-making into the management of MBC. By doing so, it seeks to promote the judicious use of precision medicine in this patient population.
