**Early Detection of Amyloid Pathology in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease via Plasma Phosphorylated Tau Biomarkers**

The identification of individuals at preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a critical challenge for therapeutic intervention. This study investigates the potential of plasma biomarkers to detect early amyloid pathology. Specifically, we examined the correlation between plasma levels of phosphorylated tau isoforms, p-tau231 and p-tau217, and amyloid-β deposition as measured by positron emission tomography (PET). Our findings demonstrate a significant positive correlation between plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217 concentrations and PET retention of amyloid-β, suggesting these biomarkers represent early indicators of underlying disease processes.  These results highlight the utility of readily accessible plasma assays as a valuable adjunct to conventional diagnostic methods. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to evaluate the predictive value of these biomarkers for disease progression and to refine diagnostic thresholds for early AD detection.
