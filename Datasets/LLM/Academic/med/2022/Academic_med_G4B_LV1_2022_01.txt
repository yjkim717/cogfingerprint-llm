**Abstract**

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated existing rural health disparities, particularly concerning healthcare access. This study investigates the efficacy of telehealth interventions in mitigating these inequities within rural communities. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we assessed resident perceptions and demonstrated accessibility to telehealth services among rural dwellers in [Specify Region – e.g., Appalachian States] during 2022. Preliminary findings indicate a significant positive interest in telehealth modalities, with [Quantify – e.g., 78%] of respondents expressing willingness to utilize remote consultations.  Furthermore, logistical barriers, such as broadband availability and digital literacy, were identified as key determinants of telehealth uptake. These results suggest telehealth represents a viable strategy to improve healthcare delivery and reduce disparities for geographically isolated populations. Future research should focus on optimizing telehealth infrastructure and addressing digital inclusion to maximize its potential impact on rural health outcomes.
