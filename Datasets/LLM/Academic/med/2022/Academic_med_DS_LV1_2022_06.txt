**Title:** Integrating Circulating Tumor DNA and Tissue-Based Biomarkers to Guide Targeted and Immunotherapeutic Strategies in Metastatic Breast Cancer

The evolving therapeutic landscape for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) increasingly relies on the precise identification of targetable molecular alterations to direct therapy. This review synthesizes the 2022 guideline updates, emphasizing a multi-modal biomarker approach that incorporates both traditional tissue-based assays and emerging liquid biopsy technologies. We critically evaluate the evidence for three principal biomarker classes: (1) *PIK3CA* mutations, for which targeted inhibition with alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant represents a standard-of-care in hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative disease, following progression on endocrine therapy; (2) germline and somatic *BRCA1/2* mutations, which confer sensitivity to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy, establishing a new paradigm in the management of HER2-negative MBC with homologous recombination deficiency; and (3) programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression, a requisite biomarker for first-line use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in combination with chemotherapy in unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). A pivotal advancement discussed is the integration of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, which offers a dynamic, minimally invasive tool for detecting *PIK3CA* mutations when tissue is unavailable or insufficient, thereby expanding access to genomically guided therapy. This paradigm underscores a shift towards comprehensive biomarker-driven treatment algorithms. The successful implementation of these strategies necessitates robust molecular profiling at the point of metastatic diagnosis to optimize patient selection, sequence therapies effectively, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes in MBC.
