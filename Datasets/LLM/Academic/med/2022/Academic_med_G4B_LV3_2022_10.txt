**Abstract**

The accurate and timely segmentation of pediatric brain tumors from multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is crucial for treatment planning and monitoring. This study investigates the application of deep learning techniques to automate this critical process. We developed and validated a novel deep learning model designed for the automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors utilizing a comprehensive dataset of multi-parametric MRI scans. The model demonstrates significant potential, achieving robust performance in both the overall tumor volume estimation and the delineation of key subregions, including enhancing and necrotic tissue. Preliminary results indicate a high degree of concordance with manual expert segmentation, suggesting the feasibility of this approach for clinical implementation. Further research will focus on expanding the model’s generalizability across diverse pediatric populations and integrating radiomic features to enhance diagnostic accuracy and prognostic stratification.
