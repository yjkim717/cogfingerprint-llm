Title: Plasma Phosphorylated Tau as a Potential Biomarker for Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis

Abstract:
The preclinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for timely intervention and potential disease modification. Recent studies have identified plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species as promising biomarkers for detecting early amyloid-β pathology. Specifically, p-tau231 and p-tau217 have emerged as sensitive indicators of amyloid-β changes in preclinical AD. This study reviews the current evidence supporting the use of plasma p-tau as a biomarker for preclinical AD diagnosis. We examine the relationship between plasma p-tau231, p-tau217, and amyloid-β pathology, highlighting their potential to detect early AD-related changes. Our analysis suggests that plasma p-tau species may offer a non-invasive and cost-effective approach for identifying individuals at risk of AD, facilitating early intervention and potentially improving treatment outcomes. The findings underscore the importance of further research into the utility of plasma p-tau biomarkers for preclinical AD diagnosis.
