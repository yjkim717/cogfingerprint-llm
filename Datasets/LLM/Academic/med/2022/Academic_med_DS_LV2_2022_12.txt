**Abstract**

**Background:** Type 2 diabetes (T2D) represents a global pandemic with significant morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. While conventional medical and lifestyle interventions (MLI) form the cornerstone of management, they often fail to induce sustained disease remission. Metabolic surgery, originally developed for weight loss, has emerged as a potent intervention for T2D, yet long-term, randomized data comparing its efficacy directly against intensive MLI remain critical for clinical guideline development.

**Objective:** To compare the efficacy of metabolic surgery versus intensive medical/lifestyle intervention in achieving diabetes remission and superior glycemic control over a 3-year period in patients with T2D.

**Methods:** In this single-center, randomized, controlled cohort study conducted between 2019 and 2022, 120 adults with obesity and inadequately controlled T2D (HbA1c >7.5%) were randomly assigned to either undergo metabolic surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy) or receive intensive MLI. The MLI protocol included structured, multidisciplinary management involving pharmacotherapy (including newer agents like SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists), nutritional guidance, and supervised physical activity. The primary outcome was diabetes remission, defined as HbA1c <6.5% without glucose-lowering medications for at least three months. Secondary outcomes included changes in HbA1c, body mass index (BMI), cardiovascular risk factors, and medication burden.

**Results:** At the 3-year follow-up, the metabolic surgery group demonstrated a significantly higher rate of diabetes remission compared to the MLI group (45% vs. 8%; p<0.001). Participants undergoing metabolic surgery also achieved superior glycemic control, with a mean HbA1c reduction of -2.8% versus -0.9% in the MLI group (p<0.001). Furthermore, the surgical cohort exhibited greater reductions in BMI and a significantly lower requirement for antihyperglycemic, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering medications. No mortality was reported, though specific surgical complication rates were documented.

**Conclusion:** In this 3-year randomized study, metabolic surgery was markedly more effective than intensive medical/lifestyle intervention in achieving T2D remission and superior glycemic control among patients with obesity and T2D. These findings underscore the potential of metabolic surgery as a disease-modifying therapy and highlight the need to reconsider its position in the T2D treatment algorithm, particularly for patients where conventional strategies prove insufficient.
