Title: Advancing Precision Medicine in Metastatic Breast Cancer: Biomarker-Guided Systemic Therapy


#### Abstract
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has updated its clinical practice guideline on the use of biomarkers for guiding systemic therapy in metastatic breast cancer. This revision underscores the importance of precision medicine in optimizing treatment outcomes for patients with advanced disease. The guideline recommends specific biomarker tests to inform treatment decisions, thereby personalizing therapeutic strategies. By integrating biomarker-driven approaches into clinical practice, healthcare providers can better identify patients most likely to benefit from targeted therapies. As of 2022, the ASCO guideline reflects the latest evidence on biomarker utility in metastatic breast cancer, facilitating the translation of precision medicine into improved patient care. This update has significant implications for the management of metastatic breast cancer, enabling more effective and tailored treatment paradigms.
