The 2022 updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Rectal Cancer reflect evolving paradigms in the management of rectal adenocarcinoma. Notably, the guidelines now recommend total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) as a preferred approach for select patients, potentially facilitating nonoperative management (NOM). The incorporation of TNT into neoadjuvant therapy regimens has been shown to improve treatment outcomes and increase the likelihood of pathological complete response. This shift towards TNT and NOM underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to rectal cancer care, necessitating careful patient selection and rigorous follow-up protocols to ensure optimal oncologic outcomes.
