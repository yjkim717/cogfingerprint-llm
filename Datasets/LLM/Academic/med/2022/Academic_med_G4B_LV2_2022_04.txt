**Abstract**

The 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines represent a critical update to breast cancer management, specifically addressing the complexities of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and early-stage invasive breast cancers. This document synthesizes current evidence to provide standardized recommendations for clinicians, reflecting evolving understanding of risk stratification and treatment modalities.  The guidelines detail approaches to diagnosis, including imaging modalities and biomarker analysis, alongside tailored surgical and systemic therapy strategies.  Particular emphasis is placed on individualized treatment plans considering factors such as tumor grade, receptor status, and patient comorbidities.  Furthermore, the NCCN recommendations outline surveillance protocols for early-stage disease, aiming to optimize patient outcomes and minimize long-term morbidity.  Adherence to these guidelines is paramount in ensuring consistent and evidence-based clinical practice within the broader context of established clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer care.
