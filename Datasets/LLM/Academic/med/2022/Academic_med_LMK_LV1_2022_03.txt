Title: Evaluating the Diagnostic Accuracy of Plasma Biomarkers for Amyloid-β Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease: An Assessment of Inter-Assay Variability and Robustness Across Disease Stages

Abstract

The quest for reliable and minimally invasive diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to a surge of interest in plasma biomarkers, particularly in detecting amyloid-β pathology, a hallmark of AD. Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) positivity is a well-established indicator of amyloid-β deposition in the brain. However, the relationship between plasma biomarkers and amyloid PET positivity across different stages of AD remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy and robustness of plasma biomarkers for detecting amyloid PET positivity in AD, with a focus on inter-assay variability.

We conducted a comprehensive analysis of plasma biomarkers, including amyloid-β 42/40 ratio, phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and neurofilament light chain (NfL), in a cohort of 250 participants with varying stages of AD. Participants underwent amyloid PET scanning, and the results were correlated with plasma biomarker levels. We employed multiple immunoassay platforms to assess inter-assay variability and evaluated the diagnostic performance of each biomarker using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

Our results demonstrate that plasma amyloid-β 42/40 ratio and p-tau181 showed high diagnostic accuracy for detecting amyloid PET positivity, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.85 and 0.83, respectively. Notably, the diagnostic performance of these biomarkers remained robust across different disease stages, including preclinical and prodromal AD. In contrast, NfL demonstrated a weaker association with amyloid PET positivity (AUC = 0.68). Inter-assay variability was observed, with some immunoassay platforms exhibiting higher precision than others.

Our findings suggest that plasma amyloid-β 42/40 ratio and p-tau181 are reliable biomarkers for detecting amyloid-β pathology in AD, with acceptable inter-assay variability. The robustness of these biomarkers across different disease stages supports their potential utility in clinical practice and research settings. However, standardization of immunoassay platforms and further validation studies are necessary to ensure widespread adoption. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the use of plasma biomarkers as a minimally invasive and cost-effective alternative to amyloid PET scanning in the diagnosis and monitoring of AD.
