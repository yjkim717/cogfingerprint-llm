**Abstract**

**Title:** Integrating Circulating Tumor DNA and Comprehensive Biomarker Profiling to Guide Targeted Therapy Selection in Metastatic Breast Cancer

**Background:** The therapeutic landscape for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is increasingly defined by molecular subtypes, necessitating robust biomarker-driven strategies. The 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline update formalized recommendations for testing key genomic alterations to guide the use of targeted agents, including phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors for *PIK3CA*-mutated tumors, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors for cancers with homologous recombination deficiencies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for tumors expressing PD-L1. However, the dynamic nature of metastatic disease and the challenges of sequential tissue biopsy underscore the need for complementary diagnostic approaches.

**Methods:** This review synthesizes current evidence and evolving clinical paradigms regarding the integration of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis into standard care for MBC. We evaluate the utility of ctDNA for the concurrent detection of somatic mutations (e.g., *PIK3CA*), assessment of genomic instability, and estimation of tumor mutational burden, thereby providing a comprehensive, real-time molecular profile from a liquid biopsy.

**Results:** Evidence confirms that ctDNA profiling offers a highly sensitive and specific modality for identifying guideline-recommended biomarkers. Its application facilitates the selection of targeted therapies, such as alpelisib for *PIK3CA*-mutated hormone receptor-positive MBC or PARP inhibitors in *BRCA*-mutated cases, when tissue is unavailable or insufficient. Furthermore, emerging data suggest ctDNA can identify mechanisms of acquired resistance and dynamically monitor treatment response, potentially allowing for earlier therapeutic transitions. The combined use of ctDNA and tissue-based profiling maximizes the detection of actionable alterations, including those qualifying patients for ICI therapy.

**Conclusion:** The integration of comprehensive biomarker testing, with ctDNA as a pivotal tool, is critical for personalizing management in MBC. Adherence to updated ASCO guidelines, augmented by liquid biopsy, ensures optimal patient selection for targeted therapies, ultimately aiming to improve clinical outcomes in this heterogeneous patient population. Prospective validation of ctDNA-guided interventional trials remains a priority.
