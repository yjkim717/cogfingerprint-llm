**Abstract**

The persistent health disparities experienced by rural populations represent a critical challenge within contemporary healthcare systems. This study investigates the role of telehealth as a potential intervention to mitigate these inequities, specifically examining its impact during the heightened demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing qualitative data gathered from surveys and focus groups conducted with rural dwellers in 2022, we assessed resident perceptions of telehealth accessibility, usability, and perceived benefits. Preliminary findings indicate significant interest and positive experiences with telehealth services, particularly for routine consultations and chronic disease management. However, infrastructural limitations and digital literacy gaps remain substantial barriers to widespread adoption.  The research underscores telehealthâ€™s promise in expanding healthcare access for geographically isolated communities; nevertheless, targeted interventions addressing these systemic challenges are crucial to ensure equitable and sustainable improvements in rural healthcare outcomes.
