**Abstract**

The management of advanced or metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma remains a significant clinical challenge. The 2022 iteration of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines underscores a paradigm shift towards a biomarker-driven therapeutic approach, moving beyond traditional, non-selective chemotherapy. This review synthesizes the current standard of care, emphasizing the critical role of comprehensive molecular profiling at diagnosis. Key actionable alterations include HER2 amplification, microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) status, PD-L1 expression (CPS â‰¥1), and Claudin 18.2 positivity, which guide the use of targeted agents and immunotherapies. For HER2-positive disease, first-line treatment integrates trastuzumab with chemotherapy, while subsequent lines may incorporate novel antibody-drug conjugates. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are now indicated for MSI-H and PD-L1 positive tumors. Furthermore, the guidelines reinforce the concurrent integration of early palliative and supportive care to manage disease-related symptoms and treatment toxicities, aiming to preserve quality of life and improve overall survival. This multifaceted strategy represents the cornerstone of modern, personalized management for this aggressive malignancy.
