**Title:** Adoptive Cell Therapy with Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Navigating Efficacy and Implementation Hurdles

The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has reshaped the therapeutic landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, a significant proportion of patients exhibit primary or acquired resistance, necessitating the development of novel immunotherapeutic modalities. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) utilizing autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) represents a promising strategy, leveraging the inherent specificity of a patient's endogenous T-cell repertoire to target unique tumor neoantigens. This review synthesizes contemporary clinical evidence from trials initiated in the post-ICI era, demonstrating that TIL therapy can mediate durable objective responses, including in heavily pre-treated NSCLC cohorts. Despite this clinical promise, significant translational challenges persist. Key limitations include the technical complexities of *ex vivo* TIL expansion to achieve therapeutic cell doses, the functional impairment of lymphocytes within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, and the logistical demands of a personalized therapy platform. Future directions are focused on optimizing pre-conditioning lymphodepletion regimens, integrating cytokine support, and pioneering genetic engineering approaches to enhance TIL potency and persistence, thereby positioning TIL therapy as a viable subsequent-line intervention for ICI-refractory NSCLC.
