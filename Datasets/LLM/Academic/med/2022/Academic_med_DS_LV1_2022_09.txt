**Title:** Investigating the Causal Role of Insomnia Symptoms in Suicidal Behavior: A Mendelian Randomization Study

**Abstract**

**Background:** Observational studies have consistently identified a robust association between insomnia symptoms and an elevated risk of suicidal behavior (suicidal ideation, attempt, and completion). However, establishing causality within this relationship is challenging due to pervasive confounding factors, particularly the strong co-morbidity with mood disorders like major depression. It remains unclear whether insomnia is an independent causal risk factor or merely an epiphenomenon of underlying psychiatric conditions.

**Objective:** To investigate the potential causal effect of genetically proxied insomnia symptoms on the risk of suicidal behavior, independent of major depressive disorder (MDD), using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.

**Methods:** We performed a two-sample MR analysis utilizing summary-level data from the largest available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for insomnia symptoms (N ≈ 1.3 million) and suicidal behavior (N ≈ 600,000). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with insomnia symptoms (P < 5×10⁻⁸) served as instrumental variables. The primary analysis employed the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, complemented by sensitivity analyses including MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO to assess and correct for potential pleiotropy. A multivariable MR (MVMR) model was subsequently applied to adjust for the genetic liability to MDD.

**Results:** Genetically predicted insomnia symptoms were associated with a significant increase in the odds of suicidal behavior (IVW OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.18-1.39, P = 4.1×10⁻⁹). Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent results, with no evidence of significant horizontal pleiotropy (MR-Egger intercept P = 0.42). Crucially, the association remained statistically significant after adjusting for genetic risk for MDD in the MVMR analysis (OR: 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05-1.26, P = 0.002), indicating a direct effect independent of depression.

**Conclusion:** Our findings provide novel genetic evidence supporting a causal relationship wherein insomnia symptoms directly increase the risk of suicidal behavior. This relationship persists after accounting for the confounding influence of MDD, suggesting that insomnia is not merely a symptom but an independent and modifiable risk factor. These results underscore the critical importance of targeting sleep disturbances as a primary component of suicide prevention strategies in clinical and public health contexts.
