**Telehealth Adoption and Rural Healthcare Equity: A Preliminary Investigation of Acceptability and Potential Impact During the COVID-19 Pandemic**

The COVID-19 pandemic significantly exacerbated existing rural healthcare disparities, highlighting critical limitations in access to timely and specialized care. This study investigated the potential of telehealth interventions to mitigate these inequities, focusing on resident perceptions and experiences in geographically isolated communities. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and semi-structured interviews (n=150), we assessed the acceptability and perceived utility of various telehealth modalities among rural residents. Findings demonstrate a surprisingly high level of openness to and positive experiences with telehealth across demographic subgroups, even among individuals with limited prior technology exposure. Participants cited convenience, reduced travel burden, and perceived continuity of care as key benefits. However, challenges related to digital literacy, internet infrastructure, and concerns regarding data privacy were also identified. These results suggest that strategically implemented telehealth programs, coupled with targeted digital inclusion initiatives, represent a viable pathway toward achieving more equitable healthcare access in rural settings, particularly in the context of ongoing public health crises and evolving models of care delivery. Further research is warranted to evaluate long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness.
