**Abstract**

The identification of robust, accessible biomarkers for the preclinical phase of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a critical imperative for advancing therapeutic development. In 2022, research has increasingly focused on blood-based phosphorylated tau (p-tau) variants as surrogates for cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, a key early event in AD pathogenesis. This investigation specifically evaluates the comparative performance of plasma p-tau231 and p-tau217. Recent longitudinal cohort studies demonstrate that both biomarkers exhibit a marked increase in cognitively unimpaired individuals who are amyloid-PET positive, preceding significant tau-PET signal and cognitive decline. Notably, plasma p-tau217 consistently shows superior diagnostic accuracy, with AUC values often exceeding 0.95 for discriminating Aβ-positive status, closely followed by p-tau231. Their high sensitivity allows for the detection of subtle Aβ changes years before clinical manifestation. These findings robustly position plasma p-tau217 and p-tau231 as transformative tools for participant enrichment in secondary prevention trials. By enabling the precise and cost-effective screening of at-risk populations for Aβ pathology, these biomarkers are poised to streamline clinical trial recruitment, enhance statistical power, and accelerate the evaluation of disease-modifying therapies targeting the earliest stages of AD.
