**Abstract**

The identification of reliable plasma biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a significant challenge. This study aimed to assess the inter-assay variability and stability of commonly investigated plasma biomarkers in relation to established amyloid pathology. Utilizing data from a cohort of cognitively impaired individuals, we evaluated the performance of several biomarkers, focusing on glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and phosphorylated total tau protein at 181 kDa (p-tau181).  Results demonstrated robust stability in GFAP and p-tau181 levels across multiple assays, exhibiting minimal inter-assay variability.  These findings suggest a potential utility for these biomarkers as indicators of underlying amyloid pathology, even amidst the inherent technical challenges associated with plasma-based diagnostics.  Further investigation is warranted to explore the correlation of these stable biomarkers with established amyloid imaging modalities, such as amyloid PET scans, to refine diagnostic accuracy and inform longitudinal monitoring strategies for AD progression.  Addressing the limitations of current biomarker assays is crucial for advancing clinical applications.
