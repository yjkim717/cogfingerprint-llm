Title: Oral Health Outcomes among Syrian Refugee Children in Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study on Dental Extraction Prevalence and Associated Factors

Abstract:

The escalating global refugee crisis has underscored the need for targeted healthcare interventions among displaced populations. Syrian refugee children, in particular, are vulnerable to oral health disparities due to socio-economic constraints and limited access to dental care. This cross-sectional study, conducted in 2022 within Jordan's Zaatari camp, investigates the prevalence and determinants of dental extraction among Syrian refugee children.

A total of 400 children aged 6-12 years were randomly selected and subjected to dental examinations. The results indicate that dental caries and pulpal diseases were the primary reasons for tooth extraction, accounting for 85% of all extractions. Multivariate analysis revealed that sociodemographic factors, including age, family size, and parental education level, significantly influenced the frequency of dental extractions. Notably, children from larger families and those with lower parental education levels exhibited higher rates of tooth extraction.

The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated oral health programs within refugee healthcare services. Targeted interventions, including preventive dental care, health education, and community outreach initiatives, are crucial for mitigating the burden of dental caries and promoting optimal oral health outcomes among Syrian refugee children. The study's results have significant implications for policymakers and healthcare providers, highlighting the importance of addressing the oral health needs of vulnerable refugee populations.
