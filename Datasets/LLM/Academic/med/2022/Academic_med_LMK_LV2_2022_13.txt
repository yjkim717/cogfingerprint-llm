Title: Prioritisation of Plasticisers in Food Contact Materials for Risk Assessment: A Focus on Phthalates

Abstract:

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, and Processing Aids (CEP) has undertaken a comprehensive evaluation to identify and prioritise plasticisers used in food contact materials (FCMs) for risk assessment. As part of this endeavour, the present study aimed to systematically assess the prevalence and potential health risks associated with phthalates, a class of compounds widely employed as plasticisers in FCMs. A structured prioritisation framework was applied, incorporating criteria such as frequency of use, potential for human exposure, and available toxicity data. The results highlighted the ubiquitous presence of phthalates in various FCMs, underscoring the need for a rigorous risk assessment to ensure consumer safety. The EFSA CEP Panel's prioritisation exercise identified several phthalates as high-priority substances for risk assessment, owing to their widespread use, potential for migration into food, and available evidence on adverse health effects. Notably, the study underscored the importance of considering cumulative exposure to multiple phthalates and other plasticisers when evaluating potential health risks. The findings of this study will inform EFSA's risk assessment activities and contribute to the development of evidence-based regulatory policies for FCMs. By providing a comprehensive overview of the prevalence and potential health risks associated with phthalates in FCMs, this research supports the ongoing efforts to safeguard public health and ensure the safe use of plasticisers in food packaging.
