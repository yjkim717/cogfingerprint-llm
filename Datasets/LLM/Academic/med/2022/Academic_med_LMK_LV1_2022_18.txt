Title: Adherence to NCCN Guidelines in Managing Invasive Ductal Carcinoma: A Clinical Practice Review

Abstract: 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for breast cancer management. This review examines adherence to NCCN guidelines in clinical practice for invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), a subtype of invasive breast cancer. A retrospective analysis of patient data from 2022 reveals variability in treatment approaches, with some deviations from recommended guidelines. The findings highlight the need for ongoing education and quality improvement initiatives to ensure optimal care for IDC patients, aligning with the latest NCCN guidelines and improving patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to standardize care.
