**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of plasticizers, particularly phthalates, in food contact materials (FCMs) raises ongoing concerns regarding potential human health risks. This study, conducted in 2022 under commission from the European Commission, addresses the critical need for prioritized risk assessment of these substances. Employing a comprehensive data synthesis from existing literature, regulatory databases, and industry reports, we identified and categorized a range of phthalates commonly utilized within FCMs. A novel prioritization framework was implemented, weighting substances based on the temporal recency of prior risk evaluations by the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) and the extent of documented exposure data. This approach aims to strategically allocate resources for future toxicological evaluations, focusing initially on phthalates demonstrating both limited recent scrutiny and substantial potential for consumer exposure. The findings of this study provide a valuable resource for regulatory bodies and risk managers seeking to proactively mitigate potential adverse health effects associated with phthalate migration from FCMs into the food chain.
