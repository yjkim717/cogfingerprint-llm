**Abstract**

The 2022 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer represent a pivotal update in the standardized management of this complex malignancy. These guidelines offer detailed recommendations across a spectrum of breast cancer presentations, encompassing carcinoma in situ and early-stage invasive subtypes.  Implementation of these protocols, readily accessible via NCCN.org, is increasingly crucial for optimizing patient outcomes.  Specifically, the guidelines delineate preferred chemotherapeutic regimens, surgical approaches – including neoadjuvant and adjuvant strategies – and supportive care measures.  Adherence to NCCN recommendations fosters clinical practice alignment and contributes to improved survival rates while minimizing unnecessary toxicity. Further research is warranted to evaluate the impact of these updated guidelines on diverse patient populations and to explore refinements based on emerging clinical data, ensuring continued progress in breast cancer treatment.
