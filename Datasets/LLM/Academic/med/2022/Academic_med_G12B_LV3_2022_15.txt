**Abstract**

The persistent challenge of healthcare disparity in rural communities necessitates innovative solutions to improve access to care. This study, conducted in 2022, investigates the potential of telehealth as a viable strategy for mitigating these disparities, specifically addressing limitations imposed by geographical distance and transportation barriers. Findings reveal a generally positive perception and receptiveness toward telehealth among rural residents, with younger demographics demonstrating particularly high levels of acceptance. The implementation of telehealth services has demonstrably expanded access to specialist consultations and routine care, potentially reducing delays in diagnosis and treatment. While acknowledging the need for continued infrastructure development and digital literacy initiatives to ensure equitable access, this research suggests that telehealth represents a promising avenue for enhancing healthcare delivery and improving health outcomes in underserved rural populations. Further investigation should focus on long-term impact assessment and the integration of telehealth into comprehensive rural health strategies.
