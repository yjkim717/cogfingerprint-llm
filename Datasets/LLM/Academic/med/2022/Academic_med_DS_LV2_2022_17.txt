**Abstract**

**Background:** The validation of blood-based biomarkers represents a pivotal advancement in the quest to develop accessible and scalable screening tools for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plasma biomarkers, particularly those associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, offer a promising alternative to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and positron emission tomography (PET), which are limited by their invasiveness, cost, and limited availability. However, the transition of these plasma assays from research settings to clinical practice is contingent upon their robustness, specifically their ability to maintain diagnostic accuracy despite the inherent pre-analytical and analytical variability encountered across different laboratory environments.

**Objective:** This study was designed to comprehensively evaluate the robustness of a panel of plasma biomarkers in detecting cerebral amyloid pathology across the continuum of Alzheimer's disease, with a specific focus on their performance stability in the context of significant inter-assay variability.

**Methods:** We conducted a multi-cohort analysis involving participants spanning the AD clinical spectrum, including cognitively unimpaired individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with AD dementia. Amyloid status was confirmed using the reference standard of CSF Aβ42/40 ratio or Aβ-PET. We measured plasma concentrations of key biomarkers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 (p-tau181), neurofilament light (NfL), and Aβ42/40. To simulate real-world variability, we introduced controlled pre-analytical and analytical perturbations and utilized different assay platforms. Predictive performance for amyloid status was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, with the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary metric.

**Results:** Our findings demonstrate a marked differential resilience among the plasma biomarkers to introduced variability. While the predictive performance of plasma Aβ42/40 and NfL was significantly attenuated under conditions of high inter-assay variability, the accuracy of GFAP and p-tau181 remained robust. Both GFAP and p-tau181 consistently maintained high AUC values (>0.85) for discriminating amyloid-positive from amyloid-negative individuals, even when other biomarkers showed considerable degradation in performance.

**Conclusion:** This investigation provides critical evidence for the relative robustness of specific plasma biomarkers. We conclude that GFAP and p-tau181 are the most resilient candidates for detecting underlying amyloid pathology in the presence of methodological variability that is characteristic of widespread clinical implementation. These findings underscore the necessity of evaluating not only absolute diagnostic accuracy but also performance stability, thereby informing the selection of the most reliable biomarkers for future use in primary care settings and large-scale screening trials.
