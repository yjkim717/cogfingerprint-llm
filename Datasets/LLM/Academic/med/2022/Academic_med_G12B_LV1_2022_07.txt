## Evolving Diagnostic and Therapeutic Landscapes in Adult Diffuse Gliomas: An Update Reflecting EANO Guidelines

**Abstract:** This paper addresses recent refinements to the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) guidelines concerning the diagnosis and management of diffuse gliomas in adult patients. Published in 2022, this work serves as an author correction and clarification of previously released recommendations, reflecting accumulating clinical evidence and advancements in molecular profiling. The evolving understanding of glioma heterogeneity necessitates precise diagnostic classification utilizing both radiological and histopathological criteria, with increasing emphasis on integrated genomic assessments to guide therapeutic decision-making. Key updates pertain to the integration of novel molecular biomarkers, particularly within the context of IDH status and 1p/19q co-deletion, influencing treatment stratification and prognostication. Furthermore, this revision emphasizes the importance of multidisciplinary tumor boards and standardized reporting to ensure optimal patient care and consistent application of these guidelines across European centers. This correction aims to provide clinicians with a consolidated and current framework for the diagnosis and treatment of diffuse gliomas.
