**Abstract**

The precise delineation of pediatric brain tumors from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a critical yet time-consuming prerequisite for surgical planning and oncological management. Manual segmentation remains the clinical gold standard but is subject to inter-observer variability, limiting its reproducibility and efficiency in high-volume clinical settings. This study, conducted in 2022, addresses this challenge by developing and validating a novel deep learning framework for the automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors. Our methodology leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, specifically optimized to integrate complementary tissue contrasts from a multi-parametric MRI input, including T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR sequences. The model was trained and evaluated on a clinically representative dataset of pediatric patients with confirmed brain tumors. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that the proposed model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.71 for whole tumor segmentation, indicating a substantial volumetric agreement with expert-annotated ground truth. These results underscore the model's capability to accurately localize and delineate heterogeneous tumor sub-regions. The findings suggest that this automated segmentation tool holds significant potential for clinical translation, offering a reliable and efficient means of supporting diagnostic workflows, enhancing the precision of radiation therapy planning, and providing quantitative biomarkers for longitudinal treatment response assessment in pediatric neuro-oncology.
