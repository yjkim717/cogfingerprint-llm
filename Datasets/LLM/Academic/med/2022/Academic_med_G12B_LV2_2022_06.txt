**Biomarker-Guided Systemic Therapy Selection in Metastatic Breast Cancer: An Update Informed by ASCO Guideline Recommendations (2022)**

The management of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has undergone significant evolution with the advent of targeted therapies. This review synthesizes recent updates to the ASCO (American Society of Clinical Oncology) guideline recommendations concerning the role of biomarkers in guiding systemic treatment decisions for patients with MBC.  A primary focus is placed on the eligibility testing for specific therapeutic agents, particularly poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.

The guideline update emphasizes the importance of comprehensive genomic profiling to identify patients who may benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy. Specifically, the presence of deleterious germline or somatic mutations in *BRCA1*, *BRCA2*, and other homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes is highlighted as a key determinant for PARP inhibitor eligibility, both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents. The abstract further discusses the expanding role of biomarkers beyond *BRCA* mutations, including considerations for PIK3CA mutations, HER2 alterations, and potential utility of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis for treatment selection and monitoring.

This review underscores the clinical utility of biomarker testing in personalizing treatment strategies for MBC, with the goal of maximizing efficacy and minimizing toxicity. The ASCO guideline update represents a significant advancement in the field, advocating for a precision medicine approach to improve patient outcomes and quality of life in the context of this complex disease. Further research evaluating the cost-effectiveness and implementation challenges of widespread biomarker testing remains essential.
