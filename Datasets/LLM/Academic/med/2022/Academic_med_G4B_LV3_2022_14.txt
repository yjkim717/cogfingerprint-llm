**Abstract**

This study investigates the prevalent oral health challenges experienced by Syrian refugee children residing within the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. An observational cohort of 322 children (ages 4-16) was assessed to determine the primary etiology of tooth extractions. Findings revealed a significant association between dental caries and pulpal diseases as the dominant drivers of restorative interventions. Lower primary molars exhibited the highest incidence of extraction, indicating a potential vulnerability within this age group.  Furthermore, a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between parental education levels and the frequency of dental extractions, suggesting a possible link between socioeconomic factors and oral health outcomes. These results highlight the urgent need for targeted public health programs within refugee populations, focusing on preventative dental care and addressing systemic determinants of health. Future research should explore the long-term impact of displacement and limited access to dental services on child dental health trajectories.
