**Evolving Landscape of Systemic Therapy in Advanced Gastric Cancer: A Contemporary Review Informed by NCCN Guideline Updates (2022)**

The management of unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma has undergone significant refinement in recent years, driven by advancements in targeted therapies and a growing appreciation for the role of molecular biomarker testing. This review synthesizes current best practices, particularly as reflected in the 2022 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, focusing on the integration of biomarker assessment into treatment decision-making.  Initial evaluation should include testing for *HER2* amplification and microsatellite instability (MSI) status, guiding selection towards trastuzumab-based regimens or immune checkpoint inhibitors, respectively.  Beyond these established biomarkers, emerging data supports the consideration of tumor mutational burden (TMB) and alterations in homologous recombination repair genes.  The abstract explores the evolving therapeutic landscape, including the increased utilization of fluoropyrimidine- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, antibody-drug conjugates, and novel immunotherapy approaches.  Ultimately, personalized treatment strategies, informed by robust biomarker profiling, represent the cornerstone of improved outcomes in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
