Title: Assessing the Robustness of Plasma Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease Pathology: Impact of Assay Variability and Disease Stage

Abstract:

The quest for reliable and minimally invasive biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has led to a surge in research on plasma biomarkers, particularly those associated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology. As of 2022, the field is witnessing a paradigm shift towards the validation of these biomarkers across various disease stages and under different assay conditions. This study aims to evaluate the robustness of plasma biomarkers in detecting Aβ pathology in Alzheimer's disease across different stages and under varying assay variability conditions.

Using a cohort of participants with varying degrees of AD pathology, we examined the performance of several plasma biomarkers, including Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), using different assay platforms. The study assessed the impact of assay variability on biomarker performance and investigated whether specific biomarker combinations could enhance diagnostic accuracy for Aβ pathology across different disease stages.

Our results demonstrate that certain plasma biomarkers, particularly the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, exhibit robust performance in detecting Aβ pathology, even when assay variability is taken into account. However, the performance of these biomarkers was influenced by the disease stage, with better diagnostic accuracy observed in the early stages of AD. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that combining plasma biomarkers can improve diagnostic accuracy, with the combination of Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio and NfL showing the most promising results.

The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of plasma biomarkers for AD. Firstly, they underscore the importance of considering assay variability when evaluating biomarker performance. Secondly, they highlight the potential of combining multiple biomarkers to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Finally, they suggest that plasma biomarkers can be used to detect Aβ pathology across different disease stages, although their performance may vary depending on the stage of the disease.

In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the robustness of plasma biomarkers for detecting Aβ pathology in AD. Our findings support the continued development and validation of plasma biomarkers for AD diagnosis and highlight the need for further research into the impact of assay variability and disease stage on biomarker performance. The results of this study contribute to the ongoing efforts to develop reliable and minimally invasive diagnostic tools for AD.
