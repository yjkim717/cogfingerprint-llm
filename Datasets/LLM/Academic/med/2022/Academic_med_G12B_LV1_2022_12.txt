**Title: Three-Year Outcomes of Metabolic Surgery Versus Conventional Medical and Lifestyle Interventions in Type 2 Diabetes: A Prospective, Observational Study**

**Abstract**

**Background:** Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a significant global health challenge, demanding effective interventions beyond traditional medical management. While lifestyle modifications and pharmacological approaches remain cornerstones of care, a growing body of evidence suggests that metabolic surgery may offer superior glycemic control and broader metabolic benefits. This prospective, observational study aimed to compare the long-term efficacy of metabolic surgery with conventional medical and lifestyle interventions in achieving diabetes remission and improving key metabolic parameters over a three-year period.

**Methods:**  A cohort of [Insert Number] adult patients diagnosed with T2DM (duration of diabetes ≤ [Insert Duration, e.g., 10 years]) and a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² were enrolled. Participants were categorized into two groups: a surgical group (n=[Insert Number], undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy) and a control group (n=[Insert Number], receiving standard medical care including dietary counseling, exercise recommendations, and pharmacological interventions as per established guidelines).  Primary outcome measures were achievement of diabetes remission, defined as HbA1c < 5.7% without pharmacological intervention for at least three months, and changes in HbA1c levels. Secondary outcomes included changes in body weight, fasting plasma glucose, lipid profiles (total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides), and the incidence of diabetes-related complications. Data were collected at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years post-intervention. Statistical analysis employed intention-to-treat principles and included t-tests, chi-square tests, and repeated measures ANOVA to assess differences between groups, adjusted for potential confounders such as age, sex, and duration of diabetes at baseline.

**Results:** At three years, the surgical group demonstrated a significantly higher rate of diabetes remission ( [Insert Percentage] vs. [Insert Percentage], p < 0.001) compared to the control group.  Mean HbA1c reduction was also significantly greater in the surgical group (-[Insert Value] ± [Insert SD]%) compared to the control group (-[Insert Value] ± [Insert SD]%) (p < 0.001).  Furthermore, the surgical group exhibited substantial improvements in body weight, fasting plasma glucose, and lipid profiles, with statistically significant differences observed compared to the control group.  The incidence of diabetes-related complications was lower in the surgical group.

**Conclusion:** This study provides compelling evidence that metabolic surgery is associated with superior long-term outcomes in patients with T2DM, including a markedly increased likelihood of diabetes remission and significant improvements in metabolic health compared to conventional medical and lifestyle interventions.  These findings support the consideration of metabolic surgery as a valuable therapeutic option for carefully selected individuals with T2DM. Further research is warranted to investigate the optimal surgical approach and long-term sustainability of these benefits.
