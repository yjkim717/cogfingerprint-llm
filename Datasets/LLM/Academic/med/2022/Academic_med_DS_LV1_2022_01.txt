**Title:** Telehealth as an Equitable Intervention: Mitigating Rural Health Disparities Through Digital Access

The persistent challenge of health disparities in rural populations, characterized by limited access to specialists and primary care, necessitates innovative solutions. This study evaluates the efficacy of telehealth platforms in enhancing healthcare access and promoting health equity within these underserved communities. Conducted in 2022, our mixed-methods analysis incorporated quantitative survey data from 500 rural residents alongside qualitative interviews with healthcare providers. Results indicate a significant positive correlation between telehealth utilization and self-reported measures of healthcare satisfaction and perceived access. Notably, regression analysis revealed that younger demographic cohorts (18-45 years) demonstrated higher adoption rates and more favorable perceptions of telehealth's convenience and effectiveness compared to older groups. These findings suggest that while telehealth presents a viable strategy for bridging critical gaps in rural healthcare delivery, its equitable implementation requires targeted strategies to address generational digital literacy and access barriers. We conclude that telehealth is a pivotal tool for advancing health equity, yet its full potential is contingent upon inclusive, multi-faceted deployment.
