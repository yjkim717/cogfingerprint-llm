**Abstract**

Distinguishing between risk ratios, odds ratios, and hazard ratios remains a critical challenge in clinical research. This study clarifies the nuanced interpretations of these statistical measures, emphasizing their distinct applications in assessing disease incidence and progression. Risk ratios quantify relative probabilities of an outcome, odds ratios relate exposure to the likelihood of a binary event, while hazard ratios assess the instantaneous risk of an event within a defined time period. Accurate interpretation necessitates consideration of study design and underlying data characteristics. Improved understanding of these ratios facilitates more robust data analysis and ultimately, more informed clinical decision-making.
