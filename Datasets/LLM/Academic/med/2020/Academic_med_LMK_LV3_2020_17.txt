This study (2020) investigates the efficacy of a novel three-range method for establishing intermediate cutoffs for cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-Î² measurements in predicting Alzheimer's disease progression. By redefining biomarker thresholds, we examined the predictive value of intermediate cutoff values on clinical deterioration. Our results demonstrate that the application of this method enhances the stratification of patients at risk, providing a more nuanced understanding of disease trajectory. The findings support the utility of refined biomarker categorization in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and prognosis, informing clinical decision-making and future research directions.
