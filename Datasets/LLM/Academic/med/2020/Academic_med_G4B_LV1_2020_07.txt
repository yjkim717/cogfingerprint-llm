**Contemporary Management of Adult Diffuse Gliomas: Refinement of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Strategies Informed by EANO Guidelines**

Diffuse gliomas represent a significant and heterogeneous subset of primary brain tumors, posing considerable diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for adult patients. Recognizing the evolving landscape of this disease, the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) recently published updated guidelines aimed at optimizing patient management. This study examines the core tenets of these revised recommendations, emphasizing a shift towards more nuanced diagnostic approaches.  The guidelines strongly advocate for integrating recent clinical trial outcomes, particularly those evaluating novel molecular markers, with the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification system to improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate precise tumor grading. Furthermore, the EANO framework underscores the importance of multidisciplinary team collaboration in tailoring treatment plans, encompassing both surgical resection and targeted therapies.  Implementation of these updated guidelines promises to enhance patient prognosis and improve the standardization of care for adults diagnosed with diffuse gliomas in 2020 and beyond.
