**The Genetic Architecture of Daytime Napping and its Implications for Cardiometabolic Health: A Genome-Wide Association and Mendelian Randomization Approach**

**Abstract:**  Daytime napping, a prevalent behavior, has been increasingly implicated in diverse health outcomes, particularly within the context of cardiometabolic disease. This study leveraged the extensive UK Biobank resource to explore the genetic determinants of habitual daytime napping and its potential causal relationship with established cardiometabolic risk factors. Utilizing genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis, we identified novel genetic loci associated with varying levels of daytime napping frequency.  Subsequently, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the potential causal pathway between these identified genetic variants and cardiometabolic phenotypes, including glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, and blood pressure.  Preliminary results from the GWAS indicated significant association with several genes involved in circadian rhythm regulation and inflammatory pathways. MR analysis, employing robust methods to address potential pleiotropy, suggested a directional association between these identified genetic variants and improved cardiometabolic health, implying a potential causal role for daytime napping in mitigating cardiometabolic risk. Further investigation, including replication in independent cohorts and exploration of underlying biological mechanisms, is warranted to fully elucidate the complex interplay between genetics, napping behavior, and long-term health.
