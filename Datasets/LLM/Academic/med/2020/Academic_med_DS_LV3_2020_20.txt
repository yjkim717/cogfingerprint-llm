In the context of evolving oncologic practice, the management of male breast cancer (MBC) remains a clinically distinct entity, necessitating guidelines that address its unique epidemiologic and biologic characteristics. The 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) clinical practice guideline provides a critical, evidence-based framework for the multidisciplinary care of this patient population. This review synthesizes the guideline's core recommendations, which are largely extrapolated from trials in female breast cancer yet tailored to the specific needs of men. A principal focus is the central role of adjuvant endocrine therapy, with tamoxifen constituting the cornerstone of treatment for hormone receptor-positive disease, which represents the vast majority of MBC cases. The guideline underscores the imperative for comprehensive genetic testing for germline *BRCA1/2* mutations, given the significantly elevated lifetime risk associated with MBC and its implications for both patients and their families. Furthermore, the recommendations delineate strategies for surgical management, the consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy based on tumor burden and genomic risk scores, and the management of treatment-related adverse effects, particularly in the context of prolonged endocrine therapy. By integrating these elements—systemic therapy, genetic evaluation, and personalized risk assessment—the ASCO guideline establishes a standardized, yet adaptable, approach aimed at optimizing oncologic outcomes and quality of life for men with breast cancer.
