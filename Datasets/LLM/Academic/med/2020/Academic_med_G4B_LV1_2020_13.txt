**Prioritization of Substances with Limited Migration Limits for Food Contact Materials: A Framework for Enhanced Risk Assessment**

The increasing scrutiny of chemical migration from food contact materials (FCMs) necessitates robust methodologies for evaluating potential human exposure. In 2020, the European Food Safety Authority’s (EFSA) Chemical Agents in Food Contact Materials (CEFCM) panel undertook a critical prioritization exercise, focusing on a cohort of 451 substances currently lacking established Scientific Migration Limits (SMLs). This systematic approach, informed by hazard assessments and an evaluation of exposure potential, represents a significant advancement in regulatory risk management. 

The rationale for this prioritization stemmed from the acknowledged limitations of relying solely on substances possessing predefined migration thresholds.  By identifying those lacking SMLs – potentially representing a higher risk due to insufficient data – EFSA aimed to strategically direct future re-evaluations.  This process leverages a tiered system, acknowledging differential exposure scenarios and prioritizing substances exhibiting a combination of elevated hazard profiles and plausible routes of human contact.  Ultimately, this framework seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of FCM risk assessment, ensuring a more precautionary and data-driven regulatory landscape for consumer safety. Further research will focus on refining exposure modeling techniques to complement hazard characterization.
