**Abstract**

The management of male breast cancer (MBC), a rare but clinically significant malignancy, has historically been extrapolated from evidence derived from female populations. This 2020 review synthesizes the prevailing clinical guidance, primarily from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), to delineate a contemporary, evidence-based framework for MBC care. The cornerstone of systemic treatment for hormone receptor-positive disease, which constitutes the vast majority of MBC cases, is adjuvant endocrine therapy. Tamoxifen remains the standard-of-care, though aromatase inhibitors are often considered in conjunction with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists due to the hormonal milieu of male physiology. Concurrently, the high prevalence of pathogenic germline variants, particularly in the *BRCA2* gene, mandates universal genetic testing and counseling for all MBC patients and has profound implications for therapeutic targeting and familial risk assessment. Diagnostic and surveillance imaging strategies, while centered on mammography, must be tailored; the typically central retroareolar tumor location and denser pectoral muscle background in males necessitate a nuanced radiological approach. Consequently, the 2020 paradigm for MBC is one of refined mimicryâ€”adapting the robust principles established in female breast cancer through gender-specific considerations in endocrine manipulation, proactive genetic evaluation, and diagnostic imaging protocols to optimize oncologic outcomes for this unique patient cohort.
