Okay, here's an original academic-style abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, suitable for a medical journal publication in 2020. I've aimed for precision, formal language, and a logical structure.  Following the abstract, I've included some notes on choices made and potential areas for expansion if you were developing this into a full paper.

**Abstract**

**Neuroinflammation and Neuronal Injury Biomarkers in Severe COVID-19: A Preliminary Observational Study**

**Background:** The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, responsible for COVID-19, has presented with a surprisingly diverse range of clinical manifestations beyond the respiratory system. Emerging reports suggest potential neurological involvement, though the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated. This preliminary study investigates the presence of circulating biomarkers indicative of central nervous system (CNS) injury in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19.

**Methods:** We retrospectively analyzed plasma samples from 45 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 (mean age 58.3 ± 14.7 years; 68.9% male) between March and May 2020.  A control group comprised of 20 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers was also analyzed. Plasma levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and S100β were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Disease severity was assessed using the World Health Organization (WHO) 6-point scale. Statistical analyses included Mann-Whitney U tests and Spearman’s rank correlation.

**Results:**  Patients with COVID-19 demonstrated significantly elevated plasma levels of NfL (p < 0.001), GFAP (p < 0.005), and S100β (p < 0.01) compared to healthy controls.  A significant positive correlation was observed between plasma NfL levels and WHO disease severity score (ρ = 0.62, p < 0.001), indicating a potential relationship between systemic illness intensity and CNS injury. Elevated GFAP levels also showed a trend towards correlation with disease severity, although not statistically significant (ρ = 0.41, p = 0.07).

**Conclusions:** These findings suggest that severe COVID-19 is associated with detectable systemic biomarkers of neuronal and astrocytic injury, implying a degree of CNS involvement that correlates with disease severity. Further prospective studies with larger cohorts and longitudinal assessments are warranted to fully characterize the neurological sequelae of COVID-19 and explore potential therapeutic interventions targeting neuroinflammation.

**Notes and Potential Expansion Points:**

*   **Specificity:**  The abstract uses general terms like "neuronal injury." A full paper would likely delve into more specific mechanisms or types of neuronal damage (e.g., white matter involvement, synaptic dysfunction).
*   **SARS-CoV-2:** I explicitly named the virus for clarity.
*   **Statistical Power:** The sample size (n=45) is relatively small, which I acknowledged implicitly by framing it as a "preliminary" study. A full paper would need to discuss limitations related to statistical power.
*   **Mechanism:** The abstract doesn’t speculate on *how* SARS-CoV
