## Abstract: Evidence of Central Nervous System Injury Biomarkers in Patients with COVID-19

**Background:** The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resultant COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a complex clinical spectrum extending beyond respiratory illness. While neurological manifestations are increasingly recognized, the underlying mechanisms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the presence of biomarkers indicative of neuronal and glial injury in patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

**Methods:** We retrospectively analyzed serum samples from a cohort of patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19 (n=XX) and a control group of hospitalized patients without COVID-19 (n=YY).  Levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytic activation and reactive astrogliosis, and neurofilament light chain (NfL), a proxy for axonal and neuronal damage, were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Statistical analyses, including t-tests and correlational analyses, were performed to compare biomarker levels between groups and explore potential associations with disease severity and clinical outcomes.

**Results:**  Patients with COVID-19 exhibited significantly elevated serum levels of both GFAP and NfL compared to the control group (p < 0.05 for both).  The observed increase in GFAP suggests increased astrocytic activation, potentially reflecting a response to inflammatory processes or direct viral insult within the CNS. Elevated NfL levels indicate neuronal injury, possibly contributing to the reported neurological symptoms observed in some COVID-19 patients.  Furthermore, a moderate positive correlation was observed between NfL levels and markers of systemic inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), suggesting a link between systemic inflammation and neuronal damage.

**Conclusion:**  The detection of elevated GFAP and NfL in COVID-19 patients provides preliminary evidence of CNS injury and highlights the potential for neuroinflammation and neuronal damage as components of the disease process. These findings warrant further prospective investigations to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying neurological complications in COVID-19 and to explore potential therapeutic interventions targeting CNS involvement.
