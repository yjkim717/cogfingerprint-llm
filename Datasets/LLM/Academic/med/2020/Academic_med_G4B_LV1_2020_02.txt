**Neuroinflammatory Biomarkers Reveal Central Nervous System Involvement in Severe COVID-19**

Background: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the central nervous system (CNS) remains incompletely understood despite increasing reports of neurological sequelae following COVID-19. This study investigates the potential for plasma biomarkers to reflect underlying CNS pathology. 

Methods: We analyzed plasma samples from a cohort of hospitalized patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=75) and a matched control group (n=75) exhibiting no respiratory symptoms.  Levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were quantified using commercially available ELISA assays.  Statistical analyses included t-tests and ANOVA to compare biomarker levels between groups.

Results: Significantly elevated levels of both NfL and GFAP were observed in the COVID-19 cohort compared to controls (p<0.001 for both).  Specifically, median NfL levels were 2.1 times higher, and GFAP levels were 1.8 times higher in patients with COVID-19. These findings suggest an active process of astrocytic and neuronal injury within the CNS in severe COVID-19. 

Conclusion: The detection of elevated plasma NfL and GFAP in COVID-19 patients provides compelling evidence of neuroinflammation and potential CNS damage, warranting further investigation into the mechanisms and long-term neurological consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
