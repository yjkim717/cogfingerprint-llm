**Abstract: Evolving Approaches to Rectal Cancer Management: A Review of Biomarker-Informed Neoadjuvant Strategies within the Context of NCCN Guidelines**

Rectal cancer management has undergone significant refinement in recent years, driven by advancements in molecular profiling and a deepened understanding of tumor biology. This review examines the evolving landscape of treatment strategies for locally advanced rectal cancer, specifically within the framework of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as updated through 2020. We focus on the increasing integration of neoadjuvant therapy, emphasizing the role of emerging biomarker-targeted approaches. The traditional approach of total mesorectal excision (TME) remains the cornerstone of surgical management, but pre-operative chemoradiation (CRT) is increasingly utilized, often augmented with targeted agents based on molecular characteristics.  Specifically, we discuss the implications of mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) status, RAS/RAF mutations, and BRAF mutations on treatment selection.  This review highlights how the NCCN guidelines are adapting to incorporate these advancements, promoting personalized therapeutic strategies aimed at maximizing pathological complete response rates (pCR) and improving long-term survival outcomes while mitigating treatment-related toxicities. Future directions involve further biomarker discovery and the development of novel, targeted neoadjuvant regimens.
