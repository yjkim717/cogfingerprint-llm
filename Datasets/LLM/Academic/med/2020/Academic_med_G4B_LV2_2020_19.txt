**Abstract**

Recent advancements in the management of rectal cancer necessitate ongoing refinement of clinical guidelines. This document presents an analysis of updated 2020 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations pertaining to rectal cancer treatment, specifically focusing on the integration of neoadjuvant therapy strategies.  The evolving landscape emphasizes a shift toward increasingly personalized approaches, driven by the identification of predictive biomarkers.  Central to this paradigm is the growing recognition of *BRAF* V600e mutation as a critical determinant of response to targeted therapies.  The updated guidelines detail specific criteria for patient selection amenable to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, alongside considerations for incorporating biomarker-targeted interventions – notably, BRAF inhibitors – prior to definitive surgical resection.  Further research is warranted to optimize sequencing and combination strategies, aiming to improve local control rates and mitigate the incidence of recurrence in this patient population.
