Title: Targeting YAP1 Inhibition as a Therapeutic Strategy for Gastric Adenocarcinoma Peritoneal Metastases

Abstract:

Gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) is a highly malignant neoplasm with a propensity for peritoneal carcinomatosis, a condition characterized by the dissemination of cancer cells throughout the peritoneal cavity. The underlying molecular mechanisms driving this process remain poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, in the regulation of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties and metastatic potential. Here, we investigate the role of YAP1 in GA peritoneal metastases and the therapeutic efficacy of YAP1 inhibition. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that YAP1 is essential for the maintenance of CSC properties and the development of peritoneal metastases in GA. Notably, YAP1 expression was significantly elevated in GA tissues with peritoneal carcinomatosis compared to those without. Mechanistically, YAP1 promoted the self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity of GA CSCs, thereby facilitating peritoneal dissemination. Inhibition of YAP1 using a small-molecule inhibitor significantly attenuated tumor growth and reduced the number of peritoneal metastases in preclinical models. Our findings highlight YAP1 as a critical regulator of GA peritoneal metastases and suggest that targeting YAP1 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of this devastating disease. Overall, this study provides a rationale for the clinical investigation of YAP1 inhibitors in patients with GA peritoneal carcinomatosis, and underscores the potential for improving patient outcomes through targeted molecular therapies.
