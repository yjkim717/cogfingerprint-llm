**Abstract**

Glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most aggressive and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, characterized by significant inter-patient heterogeneity and limited therapeutic efficacy. Accurate prognostication and refined patient stratification are critical for optimizing treatment strategies and improving clinical outcomes. This prospective study investigated the potential of integrating advanced imaging biomarkers, clinical factors, and circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a multimodal approach to enhance survival prediction and facilitate more precise risk-based stratification in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.

A cohort of [Insert Number] patients with confirmed GBM, undergoing initial resection and concomitant chemoradiotherapy, were retrospectively analyzed. Radiomic features, extracted from pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, were utilized to characterize intratumoral heterogeneity. These features were subsequently combined with established clinical variables (e.g., age, KPS score, MGMT promoter methylation status) and plasma cfDNA levels, measured via [Specify cfDNA measurement technique, e.g., droplet digital PCR], to construct predictive models.  Several machine learning algorithms, including Cox proportional hazards regression and random survival forests, were employed to assess the prognostic value of individual and combined predictors.

The radiomic signature demonstrated independent prognostic significance, with specific features correlating with overall survival (OS).  Furthermore, elevated plasma cfDNA levels were significantly associated with poorer OS. Critically, the multimodal model, incorporating radiomics, clinicopathological factors, and cfDNA, yielded significantly improved predictive accuracy compared to models based on clinical factors or radiomics alone, as assessed by [Specify metrics, e.g., C-index, AUC].  This improved stratification allows for the potential identification of patients at higher risk of early recurrence who may benefit from more aggressive therapies or enrollment in clinical trials.  While further prospective validation is warranted, these findings suggest that a combined radiomic-clinical-cfDNA approach holds promise for refining risk assessment and personalizing treatment strategies in GBM, ultimately aiming to improve patient survival and quality of life.
