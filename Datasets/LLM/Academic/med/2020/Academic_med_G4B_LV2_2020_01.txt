**Abstract**

Accurate interpretation of comparative effectiveness research hinges upon a nuanced understanding of various statistical ratios. This study clarifies the distinctions between risk ratios (RR), odds ratios (OR), and hazard ratios (HR), critical measures frequently employed in clinical trials. While RRs represent the relative probability of an event occurring in an exposed group compared to a control, ORs quantify the association between an exposure and a binary outcome. Hazard ratios, conversely, reflect the instantaneous risk of an event occurring over time.  Misinterpretation can lead to flawed conclusions; therefore, careful consideration of the underlying event type and study design is paramount.  This paper provides illustrative examples to promote rigorous application of these ratios within medical research, emphasizing the importance of appropriate contextualization in 2020 and beyond.
