**Abstract**

**Management of Male Breast Cancer: An Evidence-Based Approach Informed by the ASCO Guideline**

Male breast cancer (MBC) represents a rare malignancy, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancer diagnoses. Despite the relative rarity, incidence rates are gradually increasing, necessitating refined clinical management strategies. This review synthesizes key recommendations from the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline concerning the diagnosis and treatment of MBC, highlighting areas of consensus and ongoing research need. The guideline underscores the therapeutic parallels between MBC and female breast cancer, advocating for a predominantly endocrine-based approach, particularly in hormone receptor-positive disease.  Tamoxifen remains a cornerstone of adjuvant endocrine therapy for these patients, with aromatase inhibitors considered for select cases, mirroring established practices in female breast cancer. However, the guideline emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment decisions, acknowledging the potential differences in disease presentation and response in men.

Furthermore, the ASCO guideline strongly recommends comprehensive genetic testing for individuals diagnosed with MBC, irrespective of family history. This is predicated on the higher prevalence of *BRCA1/2* mutations in MBC compared to female breast cancer, impacting prognosis and guiding decisions regarding risk-reducing strategies for family members. The guideline also addresses the role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy in hormone receptor-negative disease and high-risk features, aligning with established protocols for female counterparts.  Finally, the review emphasizes the critical need for multidisciplinary care involving surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and genetic counseling to optimize patient outcomes and address the unique psychosocial considerations within this relatively understudied population. Future research should prioritize investigation into disease biology specific to MBC and the development of targeted therapies.

**Notes on Choices and Rationale:**

*   **Year Context (2020):** I've explicitly mentioned "2020 ASCO guideline" to ground the review in a specific timeframe.
*   **Expanded Introduction:** The abstract begins by establishing the context and rarity of MBC and noting the increasing incidence, justifying the need for updated guidelines.
*   **Specificity:** I've included specific details like mentioning aromatase inhibitors alongside tamoxifen, and *BRCA1/2* mutations. More specifics enhance academic rigor.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: introduction, endocrine therapy, genetic testing, consideration of chemotherapy, multidisciplinary care, and future research needs.
*   **Precise Terminology:** Terms like "adjuvant," "neoadjuvant," "hormone receptor-positive," and "risk-reducing strategies" are used to maintain a medical/academic tone.
*   **Emphasis on Individualization:** The abstract highlights the importance of tailored treatment plans, reflecting the complexity of cancer care.
*   **Future Research:**  Concluding with a call for further research is standard in academic abstracts.
