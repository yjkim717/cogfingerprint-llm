**Abstract**

The escalating prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) necessitates improved diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. This study, conducted in 2020, examined the predictive value of intermediate amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels within cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for clinical progression in cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals. Utilizing a longitudinal cohort, we assessed whether CSF Aβ profiles falling between established pathological and normative ranges conferred an elevated risk of conversion to symptomatic AD. Our findings suggest that intermediate Aβ CSF status, contrary to prevailing assumptions, does not significantly predict future cognitive decline or progression to AD within the observed timeframe. These results challenge current biomarker interpretation strategies and highlight the need for refined cutoff values and potentially alternative diagnostic approaches.
