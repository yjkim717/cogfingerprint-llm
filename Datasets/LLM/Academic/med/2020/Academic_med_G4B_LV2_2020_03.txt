**Abstract**

The progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is often characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides within the central nervous system. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ levels represent a clinically accessible biomarker for tracking disease trajectory. However, establishing optimal thresholds for predicting AD progression remains a challenge. This study investigated the utility of two-graph receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to identify informative intermediate Aβ CSF cutoffs. Utilizing a retrospective cohort of individuals at risk for AD, we employed a two-graph ROC approach to simultaneously assess the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of multiple Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios. Results demonstrated that strategically defined cutoffs, identified through ROC analysis, yielded significantly improved predictive performance compared to traditional single-threshold approaches. These intermediate cutoffs offer a refined stratification tool for individuals at risk, potentially facilitating earlier intervention and improved patient management. Further validation across diverse populations is warranted to establish the generalizability of these findings within the context of 2020 AD research.
