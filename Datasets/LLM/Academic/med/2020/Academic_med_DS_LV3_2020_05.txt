The 2020 NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer establish a paradigm shift toward total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) as a standard of care, optimizing tumor downstaging and sphincter preservation. These evidence-based recommendations systematically integrate comprehensive biomarker profiling, including BRAF V600E mutation status, to guide targeted therapeutic strategies in metastatic settings. This structured framework facilitates personalized treatment algorithms, significantly advancing precision oncology by aligning therapeutic intensity with individual tumor biology and improving survival outcomes through tailored intervention pathways.
