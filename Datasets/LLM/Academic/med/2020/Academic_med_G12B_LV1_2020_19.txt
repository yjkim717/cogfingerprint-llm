>## Abstract: Evolving Landscape of Neoadjuvant Therapy for Rectal Cancer: An Analysis Informed by NCCN Guideline Updates (2020)

The management of locally advanced rectal cancer has undergone significant refinement in recent years, driven by advancements in surgical techniques and a growing understanding of molecular biomarkers. This analysis examines the evolving landscape of neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer, informed by updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as of 2020. We explore the updated definitions of complete clinical response (cCR) and their prognostic implications, particularly in the context of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) regimens incorporating chemoradiation followed by targeted agents. The integration of biomarker analysis, including mismatch repair (MMR) status and microsatellite instability (MSI), is highlighted as crucial for patient stratification and selection for immunotherapy. This review discusses the evolving role of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, targeted therapies (e.g., anti-VEGF, anti-EGFR), and the potential for personalized approaches based on genomic profiling. Ultimately, this analysis underscores the shift towards more precise and effective neoadjuvant strategies aimed at optimizing local control, systemic disease management, and overall survival in rectal cancer patients.
