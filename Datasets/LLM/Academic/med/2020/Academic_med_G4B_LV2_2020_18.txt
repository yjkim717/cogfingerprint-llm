**Abstract**

The 2020 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for metastatic breast cancer represent a crucial update reflecting the increasing integration of tumor biology into treatment decision-making. These recommendations delineate a tiered approach to therapy, primarily stratified by hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.  Treatment selection is rigorously guided by NCCN protocols, prioritizing regimens tailored to the specific molecular profile of the malignancy.  Specifically, patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative disease typically benefit from endocrine therapy, while HER2-positive tumors are frequently targeted with monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy.  Adherence to these guidelines ensures optimal patient outcomes and facilitates a standardized, evidence-based approach to managing this complex disease.
