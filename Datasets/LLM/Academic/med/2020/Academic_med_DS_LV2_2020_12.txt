**Abstract**

**Background:** The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity necessitates effective, durable management strategies. While intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) remains a cornerstone of first-line therapy, its long-term efficacy for achieving diabetes remission is often limited. Bariatric surgery, particularly Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), has emerged as a potent intervention, though long-term comparative data against structured medical therapy were previously insufficient.

**Objective:** To compare the five-year efficacy of bariatric surgery versus an intensive lifestyle intervention for achieving remission of T2D and significant weight loss in obese patients.

**Methods:** We conducted a randomized, controlled trial involving patients with severe obesity and inadequately controlled T2D. Participants were allocated to one of two groups: (1) surgical intervention, primarily RYGB, or (2) a comprehensive ILI program involving structured diet, physical activity, and behavioral counseling. The primary outcome was T2D remission, defined by glycemic criteria (HbA1c <6.5% without active pharmacologic therapy). Secondary outcomes included percentage of total body weight loss, changes in cardiometabolic risk factors, and medication burden.

**Results:** At the five-year follow-up, the rate of diabetes remission was significantly higher in the surgical cohort compared to the ILI cohort (p<0.001). Participants undergoing RYGB also exhibited superior and sustained weight loss, with a significantly greater mean percentage reduction in total body weight. Furthermore, the surgery group demonstrated more substantial improvements in glycemic control, lipid profiles, and a marked reduction in the use of antihyperglycemic and cardiovascular medications.

**Conclusion:** In obese patients with T2D, bariatric surgery, specifically RYGB, was significantly more effective than intensive lifestyle intervention alone in achieving durable diabetes remission and substantial weight loss over a five-year period. These findings, published in 2020, underscore the role of metabolic surgery as a definitive treatment modality in the management algorithm for severe T2D complicated by obesity.
