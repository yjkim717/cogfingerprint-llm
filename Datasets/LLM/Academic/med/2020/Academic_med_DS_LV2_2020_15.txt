This study delineates the critical distinctions between risk ratios, odds ratios, and hazard ratios in clinical research. We systematically analyze their respective definitions, underlying statistical models, and appropriate applications for different study designs and outcome types. Our objective is to provide a clear methodological framework to guide researchers in selecting and interpreting these measures accurately, thereby enhancing the validity of epidemiological inferences and clinical decision-making in contemporary medical literature.
