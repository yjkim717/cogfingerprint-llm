**Title:** YAP1 Drives Peritoneal Carcinomatosis in Gastric Adenocarcinoma by Sustaining Cancer Stem Cell Populations

**Abstract**

Peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) represents the most common pattern of metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma (GC) and is a leading cause of mortality, with limited effective therapeutic options. The molecular drivers of this aggressive dissemination remain incompletely elucidated. This study investigates the role of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key effector of the Hippo pathway, in promoting GC peritoneal metastasis and tumorigenicity. Utilizing a panel of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models established from malignant ascites of GC patients, we demonstrate that YAP1 is consistently hyperactivated and nuclear-localized in PC-derived tumors. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of YAP1 significantly suppressed tumor growth and ascites formation in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified that YAP1 is a critical regulator of cancer stem cell (CSC) properties within these metastases. YAP1 knockdown or inhibition with the small molecule Verteporfin led to a marked reduction in the CD44+ CSC subpopulation, impaired spheroid formation capacity in vitro, and decreased tumor-initiating potential in serial transplantation assays. Gene expression analysis revealed that YAP1 coordinates a transcriptional program involving key genes associated with stemness, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and cell survival. Our findings establish YAP1 as a central oncogenic driver of peritoneal carcinomatosis in GC by maintaining CSC pools. These results position YAP1 as a promising therapeutic target for a subset of GC patients with disseminated peritoneal disease, for whom current treatments are largely palliative.
