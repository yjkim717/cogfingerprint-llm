**Abstract**

The neurological sequelae of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represent a critical area of investigation, with the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remaining incompletely elucidated. This study aimed to characterize the presence and extent of central nervous system (CNS) injury in critically ill COVID-19 patients through the quantification of specific plasma biomarkers. We hypothesized that severe SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with measurable neuroaxonal injury and reactive astrocytosis. In a prospective cohort study, plasma concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a biomarker of neuronal axonal damage, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytic activation, were measured in 45 patients with severe COVID-19 requiring intensive care and compared to 30 age-matched healthy controls. Our results demonstrated significantly elevated plasma levels of both NfL (p < 0.001) and GFAP (p < 0.001) in the patient cohort compared to controls. The pronounced increase in NfL provides direct neurochemical evidence of significant neuroaxonal injury, while the elevated GFAP indicates a concomitant, robust astrocytic response, likely reflecting both neuroinflammation and potential astrogliopathy. These findings confirm that severe COVID-19 is associated with a distinct biomarker profile indicative of active CNS compromise. The interplay between neuronal injury and astrocytic activation may contribute to the acute neurological manifestations and potential long-term cognitive deficits observed in this patient population, underscoring the need for neuroprotective strategies and long-term neurological follow-up.
