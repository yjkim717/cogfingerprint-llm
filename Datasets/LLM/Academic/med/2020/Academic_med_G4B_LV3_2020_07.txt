**Abstract**

Diffuse gliomas represent a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge within adult oncology. The 2020 European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) guidelines offer a critical framework for standardized management, synthesizing recent advancements in pathological classification and clinical trial outcomes. This document provides evidence-based recommendations spanning the spectrum of diffuse glioma care, from initial diagnosis utilizing multimodal imaging to refined histological assessment aligning with the latest World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Furthermore, the guidelines detail tailored treatment strategies, encompassing surgical resection, radiation therapy, and systemic chemotherapy, stratified by glioma subtype and patient factors.  Crucially, the EANO protocol emphasizes diligent post-treatment surveillance and long-term follow-up, acknowledging the variable prognoses associated with these tumors.  Adherence to these guidelines is paramount for optimizing patient outcomes and fostering a consistent approach to diffuse glioma management across diverse clinical settings.
