This 2020 methodological review delineates the appropriate application and interpretation of risk, odds, and hazard ratios in clinical research. We systematically clarify their distinct statistical definitions, underlying assumptions, and respective contexts for valid inference. The analysis underscores that misapplication of these measures can lead to erroneous conclusions, thereby providing a critical framework for enhancing the rigor of epidemiological and clinical trial reporting.
