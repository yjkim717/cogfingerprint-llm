**Abstract**

The accurate interpretation of comparative risk measures is crucial for robust clinical research. This study elucidates the distinct properties of risk ratios (RR), odds ratios (OR), and hazard ratios (HR), highlighting their appropriate applications within observational and interventional trials. RRs quantify relative rates of incidence, ORs represent associations between exposures and outcomes in case-control studies, while HRs reflect the instantaneous risk of an event within a defined time period in cohort designs.  Misinterpretation of these ratios can lead to flawed conclusions; therefore, careful consideration of study design and data characteristics is paramount.  Understanding the nuances of each measure supports more informed clinical decision-making and strengthens the validity of medical research findings published in 2020 and beyond.
