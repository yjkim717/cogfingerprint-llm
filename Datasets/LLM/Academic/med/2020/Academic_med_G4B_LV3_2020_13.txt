**Abstract**

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Food Contact Materials undertook a critical priority-setting exercise in 2020, addressing the substantial challenge of 451 substances absent specific migration limits (SMLs) under Regulation (EU) 10/2011. Utilizing a robust risk assessment framework, including hazard identification and exposure modelling, the Panel categorized these substances into low, medium, and high priority groups. This systematic approach, leveraging the Scientific Panel on Risk Assessment (SPRRA), aimed to optimize resource allocation within the regulatory process.  The prioritization process considered both the inherent toxicity of the substances and the potential for human exposure via food contact materials.  Findings suggest a clear need for enhanced data requirements for higher-priority substances, particularly those demonstrating potential for adverse health effects.  Further research is warranted to refine exposure assessment methodologies and ultimately inform the establishment of scientifically defensible SMLs, ensuring consumer safety and supporting the long-term sustainability of the EU food contact materials regulatory landscape.
