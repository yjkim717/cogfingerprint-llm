**Abstract**

Daytime napping, a prevalent behavior with variable reported effects on health, warrants investigation into potential underlying genetic determinants. This study leverages data from the UK Biobank to explore the genetic architecture of daytime napping and its association with cardiometabolic health outcomes. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on a cohort of approximately 350,000 individuals, identifying novel genetic loci potentially influencing habitual daytime napping. Subsequently, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to assess the causal relationship between these identified genetic variants and established cardiometabolic phenotypes, including glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, and blood pressure. 

Preliminary GWAS results indicated several significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with napping frequency. MR analyses, utilizing multiple instrumental variables, demonstrated a suggestive causal pathway wherein increased expression of these identified genes is linked to improved glucose homeostasis and reduced systolic blood pressure. Conversely, evidence of a potential pleiotropic effect from certain genetic variants necessitates further investigation. These findings contribute to a growing understanding of the complex interplay between sleep behavior and cardiometabolic risk, highlighting the potential of leveraging genetic data to identify individuals at heightened risk or benefit from targeted interventions. Future research incorporating longitudinal data and functional genomic analyses will be critical to validate these initial observations and refine our mechanistic understanding.
