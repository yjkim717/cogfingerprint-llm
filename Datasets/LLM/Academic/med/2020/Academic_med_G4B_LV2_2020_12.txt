**Abstract**

The escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies. This randomized controlled trial investigated the comparative efficacy of bariatric surgery and intensive lifestyle intervention in achieving sustained remission of T2DM after a five-year follow-up period.  A total of [Insert hypothetical participant number – e.g., 200] patients with established T2DM and a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m² were randomized to either a surgical intervention group (n=[Insert hypothetical number – e.g., 100]) receiving a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or a lifestyle intervention group (n=[Insert hypothetical number – e.g., 100]) adhering to a structured diet and exercise program. 

Primary outcome measures included the sustained achievement of T2DM remission, defined as HbA1c < 6.5% and cessation of diabetes medication, at five years. Secondary outcomes assessed weight loss, improvements in glycemic control, and alterations in metabolic parameters. Results demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of patients in the bariatric surgery group achieved T2DM remission ( [Insert hypothetical percentage – e.g., 68%] ) compared to the lifestyle intervention group ( [Insert hypothetical percentage – e.g., 32%] ), representing a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001).  Furthermore, the surgical cohort exhibited greater mean weight loss and more pronounced improvements in insulin sensitivity. These findings underscore the superior efficacy of bariatric surgery as a therapeutic modality for achieving and maintaining long-term remission of T2DM, highlighting its potential as a transformative intervention for patients struggling with this chronic condition.
