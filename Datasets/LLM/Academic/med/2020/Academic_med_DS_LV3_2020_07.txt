The 2020 iteration of the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) guidelines represents a pivotal advancement in the clinical management of adult diffuse gliomas, systematically integrating the revised 2016 WHO Classification of Central Nervous System Tumors with a comprehensive synthesis of contemporary evidence from pivotal clinical trials. This update fundamentally shifts the diagnostic paradigm from a purely histopathological framework to an integrated diagnosis, wherein molecular parameters—such as IDH1/2 mutation status, 1p/19q co-deletion, and TERT promoter mutations—are indispensable for precise tumor classification and prognostication. Consequently, therapeutic stratification has been refined; for instance, the distinction between IDH-mutant and IDH-wildtype glioblastomas now dictates divergent treatment pathways, including the application of alkylating agents and targeted therapies. The guidelines provide robust, evidence-based recommendations for maximal safe surgical resection, delineate the roles of radiotherapy and temozolomide-based chemoradiation in newly diagnosed and recurrent settings, and address the management of elderly and frail patient populations. Furthermore, the document establishes standardized protocols for follow-up, incorporating advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques to distinguish true progression from pseudoprogression, a critical challenge in neuro-oncology. By codifying these evidence-based standards, the 2020 EANO guidelines serve as an authoritative, unifying framework intended to harmonize clinical practice, inform the design of future clinical trials, and ultimately improve survival and quality-of-life outcomes for patients with these neurologically devastating malignancies.
