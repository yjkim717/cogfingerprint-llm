**Prioritization of Food Contact Materials and Substance Migration Risk Assessment: An EFSA Framework for Enhanced Food Safety**

The increasing complexity of food packaging and processing necessitates rigorous evaluation of potential human health risks associated with food contact materials (FCMs). This study, informed by the 2020 assessment of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes and Processing Aids, addresses the challenge of prioritizing 451 substances currently lacking specific migration limits under Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. Utilizing a tiered approach, we detail the methodology employed to categorize these substances based on predicted exposure levels, toxicological profiles, and potential for adverse health effects. The prioritization framework incorporates considerations of substance usage prevalence, intended food contact types, and available hazard data, employing a risk-based methodology to focus resources on those posing the greatest potential threat.  This systematic prioritization facilitates a more efficient and targeted re-evaluation process, aligning with the principles of risk assessment and supporting future authorization decisions.  The resultant categorization provides a crucial roadmap for regulatory bodies and industry stakeholders, enabling proactive mitigation strategies and ultimately contributing to the safeguarding of consumer health through improved food safety practices. Furthermore, this framework serves as a model for future hazard assessments within the broader context of FCMs.
