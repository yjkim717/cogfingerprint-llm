**Title:** Contemporary Management of Diffuse Gliomas in Adults: An Overview of EANO Guidelines

**Abstract:**

Diffuse gliomas are a heterogeneous group of primary central nervous system tumors characterized by variable prognosis and treatment outcomes. In 2020, the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) published evidence-based guidelines to standardize the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of adult patients with diffuse gliomas. These guidelines aim to provide a comprehensive framework for clinicians to optimize patient care. The EANO guidelines emphasize the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating advances in molecular diagnostics, imaging, and therapeutic strategies. For adult patients with newly diagnosed diffuse gliomas, the guidelines recommend a comprehensive diagnostic workup, including histopathological and molecular analysis, to inform treatment decisions. Treatment recommendations are stratified according to tumor molecular subtype, performance status, and other prognostic factors. For patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant gliomas, the guidelines suggest a more conservative approach, with a focus on maximal safe resection and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. In contrast, patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma require more aggressive treatment, including concurrent chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. The EANO guidelines also address the management of recurrent disease, highlighting the need for re-resection, re-irradiation, and salvage chemotherapy in selected patients. By adopting these guidelines, clinicians can improve the care of adult patients with diffuse gliomas, ensuring that they receive evidence-based treatment and follow-up.
