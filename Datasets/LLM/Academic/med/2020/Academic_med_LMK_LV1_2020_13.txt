Title: Prioritisation of Food Contact Substances for Re-Evaluation: A Risk-Based Approach in Accordance with Regulation (EU) No 10/2011

Abstract:

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, and Processing Aids is tasked with ensuring the safety of substances used in food contact materials (FCMs). Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 governs the use of plastic FCMs, establishing a list of authorised substances, including specific migration limits (SMLs) for certain compounds. However, not all substances have been assigned an SML, necessitating a prioritisation procedure for their re-evaluation. This study outlines the EFSA's risk-based approach for prioritising substances without an SML for re-evaluation, as mandated by the Regulation.

The prioritisation procedure involves a multi-step process, beginning with the compilation of a comprehensive list of substances without an SML. The EFSA Panel then assesses the available data on these substances, including their chemical structures, uses, and potential toxicity. A key factor in this evaluation is the substance's potential exposure, estimated through modelling or experimental determination of migration into food simulants. The Panel also considers the availability of new toxicological data and the substance's structural alerts for potential genotoxicity or other adverse health effects.

Substances are then prioritised based on a combination of their potential exposure and hazard characteristics. The EFSA Panel applies a weight-of-evidence approach, integrating all relevant information to assign a priority score to each substance. Those with the highest scores are identified as the highest priority for re-evaluation. This approach enables the EFSA to focus its resources on substances that pose the greatest potential risk to human health.

By 2020, the EFSA had successfully applied this prioritisation procedure to a substantial number of substances, facilitating a targeted re-evaluation of those most likely to pose a risk. The outcome of this process has informed regulatory decisions, enabling the European Commission to update Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 and ensure the continued safety of FCMs. The EFSA's risk-based approach to prioritisation has thus played a crucial role in maintaining a high level of consumer protection, while also optimising the use of resources in the regulatory process.
