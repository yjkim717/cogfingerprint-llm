**Title:** Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein as Biomarkers of Central Nervous System Injury in Severe COVID-19

**Abstract**

The neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection represent a critical and poorly understood dimension of the COVID-19 pandemic. While respiratory failure is the primary cause of mortality, there is growing concern regarding the virus's potential to induce direct or indirect injury to the central nervous system (CNS). This study aimed to investigate the presence of neuro-axonal injury and astrocytic activation in hospitalized COVID-19 patients by quantifying established plasma biomarkers. We conducted a prospective, observational cohort study of 150 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, stratified by disease severity into moderate (n=75) and severe (n=75) groups, alongside 50 age-matched healthy controls. Plasma concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a specific marker of axonal damage, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an indicator of astrocytic activation, were measured using ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) technology. Our results demonstrated a significant elevation in both NfL (p < 0.001) and GFAP (p < 0.001) in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls. Crucially, this elevation was markedly more pronounced in patients with severe disease requiring intensive care, compared to those with moderate illness (p < 0.01 for both biomarkers). These findings provide compelling neurochemical evidence of concomitant neuronal injury and reactive astrogliosis in COVID-19. The strong association with disease severity suggests that CNS involvement may be a significant contributor to the pathophysiology of critical illness. Monitoring these plasma biomarkers could aid in risk stratification and illuminate the mechanisms underlying the neurological manifestations of this novel disease.
