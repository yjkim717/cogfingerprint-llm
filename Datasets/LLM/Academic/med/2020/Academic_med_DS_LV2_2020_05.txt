This 2020 analysis examines the updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for rectal cancer management. We evaluate the paradigm shift towards total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) as a primary treatment strategy, highlighting its potential to enhance pathological complete response rates and organ preservation. Furthermore, the review critically appraises the integration of biomarker-driven approaches, with a specific focus on targeted therapies for BRAF V600E-mutant tumors. These evidence-based recommendations signify a move towards more personalized, effective treatment algorithms, aiming to improve oncological outcomes and patient quality of life.
