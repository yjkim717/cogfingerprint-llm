**Abstract**

Contemporary management of metastatic breast cancer increasingly prioritizes a personalized approach guided by evolving tumor biology and refined systemic therapy strategies. The 2020 NCCN Guidelines reflect this shift, emphasizing the critical integration of hormone receptor and HER2 status assessments within the initial workup and subsequent treatment planning.  Advances in understanding metastatic disease mechanisms have driven the incorporation of targeted therapies and immunotherapies alongside traditional chemotherapy. Consequently, adherence to updated NCCN recommendations – informed by robust clinical trials – is associated with improved patient survival rates and enhanced quality of life. Further research remains crucial to optimize treatment sequencing and predict response to systemic interventions in patients with recurrent breast cancer.
