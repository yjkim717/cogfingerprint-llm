Title: Neurochemical Evidence of CNS Injury and Astrocytic Activation in COVID-19 Patients: A Prospective Observational Study

Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been associated with a myriad of neurological manifestations, suggesting potential central nervous system (CNS) involvement. This study aimed to investigate neurochemical markers of CNS injury and glial activation in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19.

In this prospective observational study, we enrolled 50 patients with COVID-19, categorized into moderate (n = 25) and severe (n = 25) groups based on clinical severity. Serum levels of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured using ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) assays at admission and on day 7. Clinical assessments, including neurological evaluations, were performed at both time points.

Our results showed significantly elevated serum NfL levels in both moderate and severe COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001), indicating neuronal injury. Notably, NfL levels were higher in severe patients than in moderate patients (p = 0.012). Similarly, GFAP levels were significantly elevated in both patient groups compared to controls (p < 0.001), suggesting astrocytic activation. Furthermore, GFAP levels correlated positively with disease severity (r = 0.56, p < 0.001) and NfL levels (r = 0.42, p = 0.003).

These findings provide neurochemical evidence of CNS injury and astrocytic activation in COVID-19 patients, with more pronounced changes in severe cases. The observed elevations in NfL and GFAP levels suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to neuronal damage and glial activation, potentially contributing to the neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19. Our results underscore the importance of monitoring CNS injury and glial activation in COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe disease. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and long-term consequences of COVID-19-related CNS involvement.

This study was conducted between April and June 2020, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was approved by the local ethics committee. All participants or their surrogates provided informed consent.
