**Abstract**

This study investigates the accessibility and quality of dental care received by Syrian refugee children residing within the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, a context characterized by significant displacement and resource constraints. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, including retrospective chart review and semi-structured interviews with healthcare providers, we assessed the prevalence of oral health issues and the capacity of existing dental services to meet identified needs. Findings indicate a pronounced deficit in prioritized access to dental care for this vulnerable population.  Specifically, a notable proportion of children reported experiencing untreated caries, periodontal disease, and traumatic dental injuries.  Furthermore, the available dental infrastructure within Zaatari demonstrated insufficient capacity, compounded by a lack of specialized personnel and appropriate equipment.  The observed disparities highlight a critical gap in comprehensive healthcare delivery, directly impacting the long-term oral health and overall well-being of Syrian refugee children.  These results underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions and increased investment in accessible, culturally sensitive dental services within refugee settings, promoting preventative care and addressing existing oral health vulnerabilities.
