The 2020 update to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Rectal Cancer marks a significant paradigm shift, emphasizing the role of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) to enhance pathological complete response rates and facilitate non-operative management in select patients. This evolution in the standard of care is coupled with refined molecular stratification, mandating universal testing for biomarkers such as BRAF V600E in metastatic disease. These findings underscore a move towards a more personalized treatment algorithm, integrating intensive upfront chemoradiation with biomarker-directed systemic therapy to optimize oncologic outcomes and tailor therapeutic intensity based on individual tumor biology.
