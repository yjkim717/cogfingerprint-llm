**Abstract**

**Objective:** This cross-sectional study investigates the oral health status and predominant dental treatments administered to Syrian refugee children residing in camps within Jordan, with the objective of evaluating the sufficiency of available dental care services.

**Methods:** A retrospective analysis of dental service records was conducted for a representative cohort of pediatric refugees (n=1,200) across three major camps during the 2018-2019 period. Data on patient demographics, procedures performed, and primary diagnoses were systematically extracted and analyzed.

**Results:** The analysis revealed that dental extraction was the most frequently performed procedure, constituting 58% of all interventions. Restorative treatments, including fillings, accounted for only 22% of cases. This high prevalence of extractions, primarily necessitated by advanced caries and pulpal infections, indicates a pattern of late-stage disease intervention rather than preventive or early restorative care.

**Conclusion:** The predominance of exodontia over conservative dental therapies signifies a critical insufficiency in preventive oral healthcare and access to basic restorative services within the refugee camp infrastructure. These findings, contextualized in 2020, underscore an urgent need for policy reforms and international aid to shift the paradigm from emergency dental relief to sustainable, preventive oral health programs for this vulnerable pediatric population.
