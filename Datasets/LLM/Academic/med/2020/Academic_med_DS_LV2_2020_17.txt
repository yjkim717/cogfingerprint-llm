**Abstract**

The clinical interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Aβ) biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is often constrained by binary classification. This 2020 study investigates the prognostic utility of a three-range categorization for CSF Aβ42 levels, establishing intermediate cutoffs to delineate "ambiguous," "pathological," and "normal" biomarker categories. We analyzed longitudinal data from a prospective cohort to assess the association between these refined categories and rates of clinical progression to AD dementia. Results demonstrate that individuals within the intermediate "ambiguous" range exhibit a significantly higher risk of progression compared to the "normal" group, yet a more variable trajectory than the "pathological" group. These findings advocate for the adoption of intermediate CSF Aβ cutoffs to enhance prognostic stratification in pre-dementia stages, thereby refining clinical trial enrollment and personalized management strategies.
