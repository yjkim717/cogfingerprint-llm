>Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract based on the provided summary, targeting a medical/dental audience and adhering to the requested specifications. I've aimed for clarity, precision, and a structure commonly found in medical research abstracts.  I've also included a plausible timeframe (2020) given the context of the Syrian refugee crisis.

**Abstract**

**Prevalence of Extractions and Access to Oral Health Care Among Syrian Refugee Children Residing in the Zaatari Refugee Camp, Jordan: A Retrospective Record Review**

**Introduction:** The protracted Syrian refugee crisis has resulted in significant population displacement, with substantial implications for the health and well-being of refugee children. Oral health is often overlooked within humanitarian settings, potentially leading to preventable morbidity and impacting overall health. This retrospective study investigates the oral health status and dental service utilization of Syrian refugee children residing in the Zaatari Refugee Camp, Jordan, a major host site.

**Methods:** A retrospective review of dental records maintained at the Zaatari Refugee Camp dental clinic was conducted between January 2018 and December 2019. Data extracted included patient demographics, chief complaints, diagnoses, and treatment provided, with a particular focus on the frequency of dental extractions. Descriptive statistics were calculated to determine the prevalence of extractions within the study population.  Records were anonymized to protect patient confidentiality.

**Results:** Analysis of [Insert plausible number, e.g., 850] dental records revealed a concerningly high prevalence of extractions. [Insert plausible percentage, e.g., 42%] of children received at least one extraction during the study period, with [Insert plausible reason, e.g., caries and associated pulpal involvement] being the most frequent indication. Furthermore, a significant proportion of patients presented with untreated dental caries and periodontal disease.  Observations suggest limited access to preventative oral health care services, including fluoride application and oral hygiene instruction, contributing to the high extraction rate.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights the critical need for improved oral health care delivery for Syrian refugee children in Zaatari Camp. The high prevalence of extractions underscores the urgent requirement for a shift towards preventative strategies and expanded access to comprehensive dental services, including restorative care, to mitigate the burden of oral disease and improve the overall health outcomes of this vulnerable population. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies evaluating the effectiveness of targeted preventative interventions.
