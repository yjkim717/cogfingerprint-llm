**Abstract**

**Background:** Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a lethal primary brain malignancy with a universally poor prognosis and a median overall survival (OS) rarely exceeding 15 months. Accurate prognostication at diagnosis is critical for personalized therapeutic strategies but remains challenging due to the disease's pronounced heterogeneity. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard for diagnosis and monitoring, qualitative radiological assessment offers limited prognostic value. Concurrently, the role of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a non-invasive biomarker, or "liquid biopsy," is gaining traction in neuro-oncology for its potential to reflect tumor burden and genomic landscape.

**Objective:** This study aimed to develop and validate an integrated prognostic model for newly diagnosed GBM by combining quantitative radiomic features extracted from pre-treatment MRI, established clinical variables, and plasma cfDNA concentration.

**Methods:** In this prospective, multi-institutional cohort study, we enrolled 180 patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed GBM. Pre-treatment T1-weighted post-contrast and T2-weighted/FLAIR MRI sequences were subjected to radiomic feature extraction, yielding 1,130 features per patient. A radiomic signature prognostic for OS was constructed using a Cox regression model with LASSO regularization for feature selection. Plasma cfDNA was quantified using fluorometric assays. The primary endpoint was OS, and model performance was assessed using the concordance index (C-index) and time-dependent area under the curve (AUC).

**Results:** The integrated model, incorporating the radiomic signature, clinical factors (age, KPS, MGMT promoter methylation status), and plasma cfDNA level, demonstrated superior prognostic performance (C-index: 0.78) compared to models using clinical variables alone (C-index: 0.65) or clinical variables with cfDNA (C-index: 0.70). Furthermore, the model facilitated significant patient stratification into distinct high-, intermediate-, and low-risk groups with markedly different median OS (log-rank p < 0.001).

**Conclusion:** The integration of a non-invasive MRI-based radiomic signature with plasma cfDNA quantification and clinical data provides a robust, comprehensive tool for predicting overall survival and improving disease stratification in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. This multimodal approach holds significant promise for enhancing clinical trial design and guiding risk-adapted treatment paradigms.
