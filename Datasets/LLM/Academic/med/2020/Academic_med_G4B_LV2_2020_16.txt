**Abstract: Emerging Central Nervous System Pathology in Moderate to Severe COVID-19 Infection â€“ Evidence from Plasma Biomarkers**

The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection extends beyond acute respiratory distress, with growing evidence suggesting significant neurological sequelae in a substantial proportion of patients. This study investigates the presence of elevated neurochemical markers indicative of neuronal injury and glial activation in individuals with moderate to severe COVID-19. Utilizing readily accessible plasma biomarkers, we observed a statistically significant increase in both neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels compared to age- and sex-matched controls. 

NfL, a primary axonal protein released following neuronal damage, demonstrated a strong correlation with disease severity, suggesting widespread axonal pathology within the central nervous system (CNS).  Similarly, elevated GFAP, a marker of astrocyte activation, indicated an exacerbated inflammatory response and glial scar formation. These findings collectively point towards a previously underestimated degree of CNS involvement in COVID-19 pathogenesis.  

The observed increases in NfL and GFAP represent potential indicators of ongoing or residual neurological damage, warranting further investigation into the mechanisms driving these changes.  Future studies employing longitudinal assessments and neuroimaging techniques are crucial to delineate the long-term neurological consequences and identify potential therapeutic targets for mitigating CNS complications associated with COVID-19 infection.
