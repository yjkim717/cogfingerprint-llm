Title: Neurochemical Evidence of Central Nervous System Injury in COVID-19 Patients: A Biomarker-Based Study

Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has presented a significant global health challenge since its emergence in late 2019. While primarily characterized by respiratory symptoms, an increasing body of evidence suggests that COVID-19 can also affect the central nervous system (CNS). This study aimed to investigate the presence of neurochemical markers indicative of CNS injury in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19.

Serum samples from 120 patients with COVID-19, categorized as moderate (n = 60) and severe (n = 60) according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, were analyzed for neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) levels. NfL is a well-established biomarker of neuronal injury, while GFAP is a specific marker for astrocytic damage. The results were compared with those from 40 healthy controls.

Our findings revealed significantly elevated levels of both NfL and GFAP in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls. Specifically, patients with severe COVID-19 had higher NfL and GFAP levels than those with moderate disease, suggesting a correlation between biomarker levels and disease severity. These results provide neurochemical evidence of both astrocytic and neuronal injury in COVID-19 patients.

The study's findings are consistent with the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to CNS damage. The observed elevations in NfL and GFAP levels indicate that COVID-19 is associated with both neuronal and astrocytic injury, which may contribute to the neurological manifestations observed in some patients. The correlation between biomarker levels and disease severity suggests that NfL and GFAP may serve as useful prognostic markers for CNS injury in COVID-19.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that COVID-19 is associated with neurochemical evidence of CNS injury, as indicated by elevated levels of NfL and GFAP. These findings have implications for the understanding of COVID-19's neuropathological effects and highlight the potential utility of these biomarkers in monitoring and predicting CNS outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying CNS injury in COVID-19 and to explore the clinical applications of NfL and GFAP as biomarkers.
