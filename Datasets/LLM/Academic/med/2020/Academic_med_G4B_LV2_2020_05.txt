**Abstract**

Recent advancements in the management of rectal cancer necessitate a refined understanding of NCCN guidelines and the integration of personalized treatment strategies. This document details revisions to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for rectal cancer, reflecting evolving clinical practice in 2020.  Specifically, the updated recommendations emphasize the increasing role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, frequently coupled with targeted therapies, particularly those leveraging biomarker identification.  A critical focus is placed on the utilization of *BRAF* V600e mutation status as a predictive biomarker for response to MAPK inhibitor therapy.  The document outlines standardized definitions for disease stage and response criteria, alongside updated algorithms for patient stratification.  Furthermore, it explores the potential for biomarker-targeted therapy to enhance treatment efficacy and minimize adverse events, highlighting the need for prospective clinical trials to further validate these approaches within the framework of neoadjuvant regimens.
