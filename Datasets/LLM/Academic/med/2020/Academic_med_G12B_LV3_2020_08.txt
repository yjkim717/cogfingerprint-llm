**Abstract**

Gastric adenocarcinoma frequently disseminates via peritoneal seeding, leading to aggressive peritoneal carcinomatosis and poor patient prognosis. This study investigated the role of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in the pathogenesis of this metastatic cascade. Utilizing preclinical models, we demonstrate a critical dependency of peritoneal metastasis formation on YAP1 signaling in gastric adenocarcinoma. Specifically, YAP1 activation promotes the expansion and maintenance of cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulations, facilitating their dissemination and subsequent colonization of the peritoneal cavity. Pharmacological inhibition of YAP1 resulted in a marked reduction in tumor burden and complete elimination of peritoneal metastases. These findings strongly implicate YAP1 as a key driver of peritoneal carcinomatosis in gastric adenocarcinoma and highlight its potential as a novel therapeutic target for improving treatment outcomes in patients afflicted with this challenging disease. Further investigation into YAP1-directed therapies warrants immediate consideration.
