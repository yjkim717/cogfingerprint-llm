"The 2020 NCCN Guidelines Insights for Rectal Cancer reflect recent paradigm shifts in management. For localized disease, neoadjuvant therapy remains a cornerstone, with emerging evidence supporting tailored approaches based on molecular profiling, including BRAF V600E mutation and HER2 amplification status. For metastatic rectal cancer, novel targeted therapies and intensified chemotherapy regimens have improved outcomes. This review synthesizes these updates, highlighting the integration of molecular diagnostics and precision oncology principles into contemporary rectal cancer care, and discusses implications for clinical practice and future research directions."
