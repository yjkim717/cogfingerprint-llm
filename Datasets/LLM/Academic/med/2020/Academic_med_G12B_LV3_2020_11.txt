**Abstract:**

The emergence of COVID-19 in early 2020 presented unprecedented challenges for healthcare systems globally, demanding rapid adaptation of diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. This report details the preliminary radiology guidelines developed by the Iranian Society of Radiology COVID-19 Consultant Group (ISRCC) during this critical period. Informed by the collective experience of numerous Iranian medical institutions, the ISRCC guidelines addressed initial radiologic management strategies for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. Key recommendations encompassed standardized chest computed tomography (CT) imaging protocols, emphasizing the detection of characteristic pulmonary findings, alongside considerations for radiation dose optimization and infection control measures within radiology departments. These guidelines represent a valuable resource reflecting the evolving understanding of COVID-19â€™s radiological presentation and the pragmatic responses of Iranian radiologists.
