Title: Neurochemical Correlates of CNS Injury in Moderate to Severe COVID-19: A Biomarker-Based Investigation

Abstract

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has been associated with a myriad of neurological manifestations, suggesting potential central nervous system (CNS) involvement. This study aimed to investigate the neurochemical evidence of CNS injury in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. Serum levels of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were quantified as biomarkers of neuronal injury and astrocytic activation, respectively. 

A total of 120 patients with COVID-19, categorized into moderate (n = 60) and severe (n = 60) groups based on clinical severity, were enrolled in the study. Serum NfL and GFAP levels were measured using ultra-sensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) technology. The results showed significantly elevated levels of both NfL and GFAP in patients with severe COVID-19 compared to those with moderate disease. Furthermore, a positive correlation was observed between NfL and GFAP levels, indicating concomitant neuronal injury and astrocytic activation.

The findings of this study provide neurochemical evidence of CNS injury in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, highlighting the potential for long-term neurological sequelae. The observed correlation between NfL and GFAP levels suggests a complex interplay between neuronal damage and glial response in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results underscore the importance of continued neurological monitoring and investigation into the long-term CNS effects of COVID-19. The identification of NfL and GFAP as potential biomarkers may facilitate the early detection and management of COVID-19-related CNS injury.
