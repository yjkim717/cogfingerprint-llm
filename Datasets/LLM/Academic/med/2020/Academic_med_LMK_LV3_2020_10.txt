Title: Multimodal Prognostication in Glioblastoma: Integrating Radiomics, Clinical Variables, and Circulating Biomarkers for Enhanced Survival Prediction

Abstract:

Glioblastoma remains a malignancy with dismal prognosis, underscoring the need for refined prognostication strategies. Leveraging advances in radiomics and liquid biopsy, this study investigates the prognostic value of integrating radiomic signatures, clinical variables, and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) quantification in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. A retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed in 2020 was analyzed, with overall survival (OS) as the primary endpoint. Radiomic features were extracted from preoperative MRI scans, while cfDNA concentrations were quantified using plasma samples obtained at diagnosis. Clinical variables, including age, performance status, and extent of resection, were retrieved from medical records. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was employed to develop a multimodal prognostic model, which was subsequently validated using bootstrap resampling.

The results demonstrate that the integration of radiomic signatures, clinical variables, and cfDNA quantification significantly enhances the prediction of OS in glioblastoma patients. The multimodal model outperformed models relying on individual modalities, with a concordance index of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.78-0.88). Notably, the incorporation of cfDNA quantification improved model performance, highlighting the value of circulating biomarkers in glioblastoma prognostication. This study underscores the potential of multimodal integration in refining glioblastoma prognostication, with implications for personalized treatment planning and risk stratification. By combining radiomics, clinical variables, and liquid biopsy, clinicians may be able to identify high-risk patients and tailor therapies to improve outcomes in this challenging disease.
