**Abstract**

This study investigates the comparative efficacy of bariatric surgical interventions versus lifestyle modification in achieving diabetes remission among individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). A five-year, prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the impact of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) compared to a comprehensive lifestyle intervention. Results demonstrated a statistically significant advantage for surgical approaches in attaining T2DM remission, defined as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) below 6.5% and cessation of diabetes medication. Furthermore, patients undergoing bariatric surgery exhibited a greater magnitude of weight loss compared to the lifestyle intervention group. These findings underscore the potential of bariatric surgery as a highly effective strategy for metabolic re-organization in individuals with T2DM, warranting further investigation into long-term outcomes and optimal patient selection.  The observed improvements in glycemic control and medication reduction highlight the clinical significance of these surgical techniques in 2020.
