**Abstract**

The 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline for the management of male breast cancer represents a significant evolution in treatment paradigms.  This document advocates for a predominantly endocrine therapy-based approach, mirroring established strategies utilized in female breast cancer, yet incorporating nuanced adjustments predicated upon individual patient characteristics. Specifically, the guideline highlights the continued importance of tamoxifen as a foundational agent, though emphasizes its judicious application considering patient comorbidities and potential limitations.  Furthermore, the ASCO recommendations delineate tiered treatment protocols dictated by disease stage – encompassing early-stage, locally advanced, and metastatic disease – with tailored regimens incorporating aromatase inhibitors alongside or in lieu of tamoxifen.  Crucially, the guideline underscores the critical role of long-term surveillance to mitigate recurrence risk, emphasizing the need for comprehensive risk stratification and proactive monitoring following endocrine therapy completion.
