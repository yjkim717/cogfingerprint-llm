**Abstract:**

The publication of NCCN Guidelines Insights for Rectal Cancer (Version 6.2020) represents a significant evolution in the management of this malignancy. This document details refinements to anatomical staging, formally endorsing total neoadjuvant therapy (TAN) as a standard approach. Furthermore, the guidelines emphasize the integration of biomarker analysis, particularly *BRAF* V600E mutation status, to guide treatment selection in metastatic rectal cancer. This shift towards biomarker-targeted therapy underscores a move away from traditional, non-personalized strategies, aiming to improve patient outcomes through more precise therapeutic interventions and optimized treatment sequences within a multidisciplinary framework.
