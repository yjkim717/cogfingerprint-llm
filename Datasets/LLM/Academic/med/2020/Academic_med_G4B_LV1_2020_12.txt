**Abstract**

The escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies. This randomized controlled trial investigated the comparative efficacy of bariatric surgery versus lifestyle intervention in achieving sustained T2DM remission over a five-year period.  A cohort of [Insert Sample Size – e.g., 120] patients with established T2DM were randomized to either a surgical intervention (gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy) or a comprehensive, multi-faceted lifestyle modification program incorporating dietary restrictions, increased physical activity, and behavioral counseling. 

Primary outcomes included the proportion of patients achieving T2DM remission, defined as HbA1c < 6.5% and cessation of diabetes medication, at five years. Secondary outcomes assessed changes in body mass index (BMI), glycaemic control, and cardiovascular risk factors.  Results demonstrated a significantly higher rate of T2DM remission in the surgical group (68.2%) compared to the lifestyle intervention group (32.7%; p < 0.001).  Furthermore, the surgical cohort exhibited a greater reduction in BMI and improvements in surrogate markers of cardiovascular risk. 

These findings suggest that bariatric surgery represents a more effective modality for achieving and maintaining long-term T2DM remission than conventional lifestyle interventions, highlighting the potential role of surgical approaches in transforming the clinical trajectory of this prevalent chronic disease. Further research is warranted to explore the specific mechanisms underlying this observed disparity and to optimize both surgical and non-surgical management strategies.
