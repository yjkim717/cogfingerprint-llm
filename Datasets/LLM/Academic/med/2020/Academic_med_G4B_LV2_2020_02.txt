**Abstract**

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a complex and often underappreciated spectrum of neurological sequelae, prompting investigation into the potential involvement of the central nervous system (CNS). This study examines the prevalence of neuroinflammatory markers in a cohort of COVID-19 patients, hypothesizing a correlation between disease severity and evidence of neuronal and glial damage. Utilizing readily accessible plasma biomarkers, we quantified levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAp) in a sample of [Insert Number] patients diagnosed with COVID-19. 

Results demonstrated a statistically significant elevation in both NfL and GefAp concentrations compared to pre-pandemic control values (p < 0.05). Notably, the magnitude of these increases was positively correlated with disease severity, as determined by clinical presentation and respiratory support requirements. Specifically, patients exhibiting severe COVID-19 manifestations – including pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and requiring mechanical ventilation – demonstrated markedly higher plasma NfL and GefAp levels than those with milder symptoms. 

These findings suggest that COVID-19 induces a robust neuroinflammatory response, characterized by microglial and astrocyte activation, potentially mediated by the release of neuronal and glial debris into the systemic circulation. Elevated plasma levels of NfL and GefAp serve as valuable, non-invasive biomarkers for identifying individuals at risk of, or experiencing, CNS involvement following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms driving these observations and to explore the clinical implications of these biomarkers for patient stratification and therapeutic intervention.
