**Abstract**

Recent investigations into the association between daytime napping and cardiometabolic health have yielded intriguing, yet correlational, findings. This study leveraged a genome-wide association study (GWAS) utilizing data from the UK Biobank to explore the genetic architecture underlying habitual daytime napping. Employing Mendelian randomization, we hypothesized a causal link between identified napping-associated genetic variants and established cardiometabolic risk factors. Preliminary analyses revealed several genomic loci exhibiting significant correlations with both daytime napping propensity and measures of cardiometabolic health, including blood pressure and waist circumference. These findings suggest a potential biological pathway wherein genetic predispositions to napping may exert a causal influence on these key health indicators. Further research, incorporating longitudinal designs and mechanistic investigations, is warranted to fully elucidate the complex interplay between sleep behavior and cardiometabolic physiology.
