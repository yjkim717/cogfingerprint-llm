**Abstract**

The evolving landscape of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) necessitates continuous refinement of treatment protocols. This study examines recent updates to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, reflecting a greater emphasis on integrating comprehensive tumor biology into treatment selection. Specifically, the revised recommendations prioritize stratification of MBC patients based on hormone-receptor status (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status.  Adherence to NCCN guidelines remains crucial, yet the complexity of individual patient presentations demands a nuanced approach.  These updates underscore the importance of considering molecular characteristics alongside traditional prognostic factors to optimize therapeutic strategies and improve patient outcomes within this challenging disease subset.
