**Abstract**

The prevalence of daytime napping varies considerably across populations, suggesting an underlying genetic component. This study aimed to elucidate the genetic architecture of daytime napping behavior and to assess the potential causal relationship between habitual napping and cardiometabolic health outcomes. Utilizing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a large cohort, we identified novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with both napping frequency and duration. Subsequent Mendelian randomization analyses, employing these genetically predicted napping patterns as instrumental variables, were performed to evaluate the causal impact on markers of cardiometabolic risk, including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose levels. Findings from this research contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between sleep genetics, lifestyle behaviors, and long-term health, potentially informing targeted interventions for cardiometabolic disease prevention.
