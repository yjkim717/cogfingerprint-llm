**Abstract**

The pervasive utilization of synthetic polymers in food contact materials (FCMs) necessitates a robust regulatory framework to mitigate potential public health risks. A significant challenge lies in the multitude of authorized plastic substances for which no Specific Migration Limit (SML) has been established, creating a critical data gap in consumer safety assessment. This study, contextualized within the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) 2020 mandate, addresses this gap by developing and applying a systematic, tiered prioritization procedure. The methodology integrated a comprehensive hazard assessment, based on the Cramer classification scheme and in silico toxicity predictions, with a refined consumer exposure estimation model. From an initial inventory of 284 substances lacking an SML, the procedure successfully identified a subset of three compounds as high-priority for further regulatory scrutiny and toxicological evaluation. The hazard assessment revealed structural alerts indicative of potential carcinogenicity or endocrine disruption, while the exposure modeling, accounting for consumption factors and migration potential, confirmed a non-negligible intake for these substances. The findings underscore the utility of a structured, evidence-based prioritization strategy in proactively managing chemical risks from FCMs. This work provides a critical tool for regulatory bodies, enabling the efficient allocation of resources towards the most hazardous substances and thereby strengthening the scientific foundation for protecting consumer health from dietary exposure to migrating chemicals.
