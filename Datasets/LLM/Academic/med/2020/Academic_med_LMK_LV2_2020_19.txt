The NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer (2020) provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of rectal cancer. For localized disease, neoadjuvant therapy remains a cornerstone of treatment. The integration of biomarker-targeted therapy has improved outcomes in metastatic colorectal cancer. This update synthesizes the latest research, incorporating emerging data on novel therapeutic strategies. The guidelines underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to rectal cancer care, highlighting the need for personalized treatment planning and surveillance protocols to optimize patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to refine treatment paradigms.
