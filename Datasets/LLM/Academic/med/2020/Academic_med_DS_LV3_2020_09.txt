In this genome-wide association study (GWAS) leveraging data from the UK Biobank, we systematically investigated the genetic architecture of daytime napping frequency and its potential causal relationship with cardiometabolic health. Our analysis identified 123 independent genetic loci significantly associated with habitual napping behavior, providing novel insights into the biological mechanisms regulating sleep-wake patterns. Employing Mendelian randomization approaches, we further examined the causal pathways between frequent napping and cardiometabolic outcomes. Our findings demonstrate that genetic predisposition to increased daytime napping is causally associated with adverse cardiometabolic profiles, specifically elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure parameters and increased waist circumference measurements. These results persisted after comprehensive sensitivity analyses and multivariable adjustments for established risk factors. The convergence of GWAS signals with causal inference methods suggests that excessive daytime napping may represent an independent risk factor rather than merely a consequence of underlying health conditions. This research, conducted in 2020, provides compelling genetic evidence that napping behavior warrants consideration in cardiovascular disease prevention strategies and underscores the importance of sleep-wake regulation in maintaining optimal metabolic health.
