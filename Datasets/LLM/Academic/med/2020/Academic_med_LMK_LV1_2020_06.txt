The management of male breast cancer (MBC) has garnered significant attention in recent years, with the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) releasing updated guidelines in 2020 to inform clinical practice. Endocrine therapy remains a cornerstone in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive MBC, with tamoxifen being the preferred agent due to its efficacy in improving overall survival. The ASCO guideline recommends that all men diagnosed with breast cancer undergo germline genetic testing to identify pathogenic mutations in genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, which are associated with an increased risk of developing MBC. Furthermore, the guideline emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to MBC management, incorporating input from medical oncology, surgery, and radiation oncology. By integrating endocrine therapy with genetic testing and a comprehensive treatment plan, clinicians can provide optimal care for men with breast cancer, improving outcomes and quality of life. This review aims to summarize the ASCO guideline recommendations for MBC management, highlighting the critical role of endocrine therapy and germline genetic testing.
