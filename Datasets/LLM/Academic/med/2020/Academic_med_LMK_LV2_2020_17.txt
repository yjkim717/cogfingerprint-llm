Title: Refining Amyloid-β Cerebrospinal Fluid Cutoffs for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis

Abstract: 
This study evaluates the predictive value of a three-range method for categorizing amyloid-β cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measurements in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. By defining cutoff values for abnormal, intermediate, and normal ranges, we assessed the clinical progression of patients with varying amyloid-β CSF levels. The results demonstrate that the intermediate range is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline, highlighting the utility of this categorization in refining biomarker-driven diagnosis. The findings support the application of this method in clinical practice, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy in 2020.
