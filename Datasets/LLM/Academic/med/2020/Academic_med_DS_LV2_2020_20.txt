**Title:** Contemporary Management of Male Breast Cancer: An Analysis of Guideline-Driven Endocrine and Adjuvant Therapies

**Abstract**

Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare malignancy, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancers and 1% of all cancers in men. Historically, its management has been extrapolated from clinical trials and evidence derived from female breast cancer (FBC) populations, leading to potential gaps in optimized, sex-specific care. This review synthesizes the current (2020) standard of care for MBC, with a specific focus on the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines, which provide a critical framework for evidence-based practice. The analysis confirms that the cornerstone of systemic treatment for hormone receptor-positive MBC, which constitutes over 90% of cases, is adjuvant endocrine therapy. Tamoxifen for a duration of five years remains the established first-line therapeutic agent, mirroring its foundational role in FBC. The pathophysiological rationale hinges on the suppression of estrogen-mediated tumor proliferation, though the endocrine milieu in men differs significantly. Furthermore, ASCO guidelines strongly advocate for universal genetic testing for germline *BRCA1/2* mutations in all men diagnosed with breast cancer, given the substantially higher prevalence of these pathogenic variants compared to the female population. This recommendation underscores a pivotal shift towards personalized medicine, as a positive result has profound implications for both prognostic stratification and therapeutic decision-making, including the consideration of PARP inhibitors in the metastatic setting and guiding risk-reducing strategies for the patient and their family. In conclusion, while the overarching principles of management—encompassing surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapies—are largely aligned with those for FBC, the 2020 paradigm for MBC is distinctly characterized by the central, guideline-mandated roles of prolonged tamoxifen therapy and comprehensive genetic assessment to optimize oncological outcomes in this unique patient cohort.
