Title: Oral Health Care Provision among Syrian Refugee Children in Zaatari Refugee Camp, Jordan: A Retrospective Analysis of Dental Services, 2020

Abstract:

The escalating Syrian conflict has resulted in a significant influx of refugees into neighboring countries, including Jordan. Zaatari refugee camp, hosting over 80,000 refugees, presents a unique challenge for delivering healthcare services, including dental care. This retrospective study analyzed the dental services provided to Syrian refugee children aged 6-12 years in Zaatari camp during 2020. Data on dental procedures, patient demographics, and treatment outcomes were extracted from camp dental clinic records. A total of 1,432 dental visits were recorded, with the majority involving restorative treatments (57.3%) and extractions (21.5%). The prevalence of dental caries was high, affecting 83.2% of the study population. The findings underscore the need for enhanced oral health promotion and preventive dental care programs among refugee children, highlighting the importance of integrating oral health services within the existing humanitarian response framework to mitigate the burden of dental disease in this vulnerable population.
