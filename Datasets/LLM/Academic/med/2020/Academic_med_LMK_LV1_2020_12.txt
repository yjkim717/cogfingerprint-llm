Title: Comparative Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery and Lifestyle Intervention on Type 2 Diabetes Remission: A 5-Year Randomized Controlled Trial Analysis

Abstract

Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder with significant global prevalence and associated morbidity. Lifestyle interventions and bariatric surgery are established treatment modalities for T2DM, particularly in obese individuals. However, the comparative long-term efficacy of these approaches remains uncertain.

Methods: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted between 2015 and 2020 to evaluate the effectiveness of bariatric surgery versus lifestyle intervention on T2DM remission at 5 years. Eligible participants (n = 200) with a diagnosis of T2DM and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35 kg/m² were randomly assigned to either undergo bariatric surgery or participate in an intensive lifestyle intervention program. The primary outcome measure was T2DM remission, defined as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) < 6.5% without glucose-lowering medication.

Results: At 5-year follow-up, the bariatric surgery group demonstrated significantly higher rates of T2DM remission compared to the lifestyle intervention group (45% vs. 12%, p < 0.001). The mean reduction in HbA1c was also more pronounced in the surgical cohort (-2.4% vs. -0.8%, p < 0.01). Furthermore, participants in the bariatric surgery group achieved greater weight loss (-25.6 kg vs. -6.4 kg, p < 0.001) and improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, including systolic blood pressure (-12 mmHg vs. -4 mmHg, p < 0.05) and triglycerides (-30% vs. -10%, p < 0.05).

Conclusion: This 5-year RCT provides robust evidence that bariatric surgery is more effective than lifestyle intervention in achieving T2DM remission and improving associated metabolic parameters. While lifestyle interventions remain a crucial component of T2DM management, bariatric surgery should be considered a viable treatment option for obese individuals with T2DM, particularly those with inadequate glycemic control despite optimal medical therapy. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of treatment guidelines and healthcare policy, highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach to T2DM care that incorporates surgical interventions where appropriate. Future research should focus on identifying predictors of response to bariatric surgery and optimizing patient selection criteria to maximize treatment outcomes.
