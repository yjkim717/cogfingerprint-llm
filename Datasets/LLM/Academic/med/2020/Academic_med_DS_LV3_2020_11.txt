In response to the emergent COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Iranian Society of Radiology (ISR) established a dedicated Consultant Group to formulate standardized radiologic management protocols. This initiative, documented in a seminal report, synthesized expertise from multiple national medical institutions and incorporated international collaborative insights to address the diagnostic and operational challenges posed by the novel coronavirus. The resulting framework provides critical guidance on the appropriate and efficient application of medical imaging, including computed tomography and chest radiography, for patient triage, diagnosis, and monitoring. By establishing evidence-based strategies for pandemic management, the ISR guidelines aim to optimize resource allocation in overburdened healthcare systems while mitigating infection risks to radiology personnel. This foundational work not only served as a crucial national reference but also contributed to the global radiology community's evolving understanding of the disease's manifestations and the strategic role of imaging in public health crises.
