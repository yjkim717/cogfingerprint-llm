**Abstract: Advancing Neoadjuvant Strategies for Rectal Cancer â€“ Integrating NCCN Guidelines and Emerging Biomarkers (2020)**

Recent refinements to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for rectal cancer management necessitate a comprehensive re-evaluation of neoadjuvant therapeutic approaches. This study examines the evolving landscape, specifically focusing on the incorporation of biomarker-targeted therapies informed by contemporary clinical trials.  The updated NCCN recommendations emphasize a staged approach, prioritizing neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgical resection, contingent upon pathologic findings.  Notably, the increasing prevalence of *BRAF* V600e mutations within rectal adenocarcinoma has driven a shift toward targeted therapies in patients with this specific mutation profile.  Further research is crucial to establish optimal sequencing and stratification strategies leveraging these biomarkers to maximize treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes within the framework of the revised NCCN guidelines.
