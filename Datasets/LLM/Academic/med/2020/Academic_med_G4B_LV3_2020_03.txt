**Abstract**

Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease progression is crucial for targeted intervention. This study utilized two-graph receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to determine optimal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta thresholds for predicting future cognitive decline. Specifically, we examined the predictive power of an ‘AbInt’ status – defined by a specific CSF amyloid-beta index – within a cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals. Establishing robust cutoffs necessitates careful evaluation of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.  The resultant ROC curves informed the selection of clinically relevant thresholds, offering a refined approach to identifying individuals at elevated risk. These findings contribute to improved risk stratification and potentially facilitate earlier therapeutic engagement in the management of Alzheimer’s disease.
