Title: Assessing Dental Care Provision among Syrian Refugee Children in Zaatari Refugee Camp, Jordan: A Retrospective Analysis

Abstract:
The protracted Syrian crisis has resulted in a substantial influx of refugees into neighboring countries, including Jordan. As of 2020, the Zaatari refugee camp hosted a significant population of displaced Syrians, with children being particularly vulnerable to health disparities. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the dental services provided to Syrian refugee children within the camp. Data analysis revealed a high prevalence of dental pain among the examined population, with tooth extraction being the most frequently performed dental procedure. The findings underscore the need for enhanced oral health care services tailored to the unique needs of this demographic. The study's results have significant implications for humanitarian organizations and policymakers, highlighting the importance of integrating comprehensive dental care into existing health services for refugee populations. Improved access to preventive and curative dental services is crucial for mitigating the oral health burden among Syrian refugee children.
