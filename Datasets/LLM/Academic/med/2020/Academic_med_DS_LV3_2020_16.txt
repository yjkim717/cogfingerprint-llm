**Abstract**

The neurological sequelae of COVID-19 represent a critical area of investigation, with the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of central nervous system (CNS) involvement remaining incompletely characterized. This study aimed to delineate the temporal dynamics of neuronal injury and astrocytic activation in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 through the longitudinal analysis of plasma biomarkers. We quantified plasma concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a specific biomarker of axonal injury, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytic activation, in a cohort of 87 hospitalized patients. Serial blood samples were collected at admission (acute phase), one-week post-admission (subacute phase), and at a 6-week follow-up (convalescent phase). Our results demonstrate a significant and sustained elevation of NfL levels during the acute and subacute phases compared to healthy controls (p<0.001), indicative of substantial neuronal injury coinciding with peak systemic inflammation. GFAP levels were markedly elevated in the acute phase, suggesting robust early astrocytic activation, but exhibited a more rapid decline in the subacute phase compared to NfL. Notably, a significant proportion of patients with severe respiratory involvement displayed persistently elevated NfL at the 6-week convalescent assessment, suggesting potential for ongoing or incomplete neuronal repair. These findings provide compelling neurochemical evidence of CNS compromise in COVID-19, revealing distinct temporal patterns of neuronal and glial pathology. The dissociation in the kinetics of NfL and GFAP underscores a complex, multi-faceted neuroinflammatory cascade, which may inform the development of targeted neuroprotective strategies and provide objective biomarkers for long-term neurological monitoring in survivors.
