**Abstract**

Male breast cancer (MBC), while less prevalent than its female counterpart, presents a unique clinical challenge requiring tailored management strategies. This review synthesizes current recommendations for MBC treatment, primarily drawing upon the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline. Treatment paradigms largely align with those established for female breast cancer, with a strong emphasis on endocrine therapy. However, specific considerations regarding hormonal status and response prediction necessitate individualized approaches. Tamoxifen remains a cornerstone of endocrine therapy in MBC, demonstrating efficacy in hormone-sensitive disease. Furthermore, the increasing recognition of germline mutations in genes such as *BRCA1/2* and other DNA repair genes highlights the critical role of genetic testing in MBC patients. These findings inform both treatment decisions, particularly regarding the potential utility of PARP inhibitors, and familial risk assessment for at-risk relatives. Finally, the guideline underscores the importance of screening strategies, although evidence-based recommendations remain limited. Further research is warranted to refine screening protocols and optimize treatment algorithms specifically for MBC, ultimately improving patient outcomes and addressing the unique complexities of this malignancy.
