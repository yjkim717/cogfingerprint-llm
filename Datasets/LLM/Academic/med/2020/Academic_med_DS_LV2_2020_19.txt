This 2020 update to the NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer refines anatomical staging definitions and consolidates Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (TNT) as a standard paradigm for high-risk locally advanced disease. The recommendations underscore the critical integration of comprehensive biomarker profiling into clinical decision-making. Notably, the guidelines provide specific therapeutic strategies for patients with BRAF V600E-mutant tumors, reflecting an evolving treatment landscape increasingly driven by molecular characteristics. These revisions aim to optimize multidisciplinary management and personalize therapeutic approaches to improve oncologic outcomes.
