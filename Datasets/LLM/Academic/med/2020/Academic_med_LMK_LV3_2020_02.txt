Title: Neurochemical Evidence of CNS Injury in COVID-19 Patients: A Biomarker-Based Study

Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has posed significant challenges to global healthcare systems since its emergence in late 2019. While primarily characterized by respiratory symptoms, growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 may also affect the central nervous system (CNS). This study investigates the neurochemical correlates of CNS injury in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. Serum levels of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were quantified as biomarkers of neuronal and astrocytic damage, respectively. Our results show that patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 exhibited significantly elevated levels of NfL and GFAP compared to healthy controls, indicating concurrent neuronal and astrocytic injury. Notably, the degree of biomarker elevation correlated with disease severity, suggesting a potential link between CNS damage and COVID-19 pathogenesis. These findings provide neurochemical evidence of astrocytic activation and neuronal damage in COVID-19 patients, underscoring the need for further research into the mechanisms and long-term consequences of SARS-CoV-2-related CNS injury. As the pandemic continues to unfold, elucidating the neurological implications of COVID-19 is crucial for developing comprehensive management strategies and mitigating potential long-term neurological sequelae. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence highlighting the complex interplay between COVID-19 and CNS function.
