**Abstract**

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains a devastating primary brain tumor with limited prognosis.  This study aimed to evaluate the integrated predictive utility of radiomic features, circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis, and established clinical parameters for improved survival prediction in newly diagnosed GBM patients. A retrospective analysis of patient data was conducted, utilizing radiomic signatures derived from pre-treatment MRI scans alongside quantitative cfDNA measurements and conventional clinical variables.  Results demonstrated a statistically significant enhancement in overall survival prediction accuracy when incorporating the combined radiomic signature and cfDNA data compared to models relying solely on clinical factors or radiomics alone. Specifically, the integrated approach achieved a notable improvement in the C-index, indicative of superior discrimination between patient groups.  These findings suggest that leveraging multi-modal data – encompassing imaging biomarkers and genomic alterations – offers a valuable strategy for refining prognostic stratification and potentially informing personalized treatment strategies within the challenging landscape of GBM.
