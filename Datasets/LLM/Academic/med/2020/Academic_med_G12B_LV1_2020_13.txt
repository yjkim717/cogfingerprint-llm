**A Prioritized Re-Evaluation of Chemical Migration Potential from Food Contact Materials: An EFSA Initiative Focused on Substances Lacking Specific Migration Limits**

**Abstract**

The pervasive use of polymeric materials in food packaging and processing necessitates rigorous assessment of potential human exposure to constituent chemicals via migration into food. While regulatory frameworks, such as those established by the European Union, define Specific Migration Limits (SMLs) for numerous substances commonly utilized in Food Contact Materials (FCMs), a significant number of chemicals remain without such limitations. This study details the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel’s recent prioritization exercise (circa 2020) aimed at identifying and re-evaluating a cohort of 451 substances lacking established SMLs, presenting a potential, albeit currently undefined, risk to public health.

The Panel’s methodology involved a tiered approach, initially focusing on substances with higher estimated exposure levels based on production volume and application frequency. A subsequent hazard assessment considered existing toxicological data, with particular emphasis on endpoints pertinent to human health, including carcinogenicity and endocrine disruption.  The selection criteria prioritized compounds exhibiting structural alerts suggestive of potential adverse effects, drawing upon in silico predictive toxicology and read-across approaches where empirical data were limited.  Substances flagged as potential concerns underwent a more in-depth literature review and, where necessary, were proposed for further toxicological investigation.

This proactive initiative recognizes the limitations of current regulatory oversight regarding chemicals used in FCMs and addresses the evolving understanding of low-dose effects, particularly concerning endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). The prioritized list serves as a roadmap for future risk assessments, directing resources toward substances posing the greatest potential exposure and exhibiting concerning hazard profiles.  The findings underscore the need for continued refinement of migration testing methodologies and the incorporation of advanced toxicological methodologies to accurately characterize the risks associated with FCMs, ultimately safeguarding consumer health and bolstering confidence in the safety of the food supply chain. This work highlights a crucial step in adapting regulatory frameworks to reflect the complexity of chemical exposure from everyday materials.

**Notes on Choices and Potential Expansion:**

*   **Year Context (2020):** The phrase "circa 2020" is included to ground the work in a specific timeframe, reflecting when such initiatives would have been gaining momentum.
*   **Formal Tone and Terminology:** I used terms like "tiered approach," "structural alerts," "in silico predictive toxicology," "read-across approaches," "endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs)," and phrases like "bolstering confidence" to maintain an academic register.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: problem statement, methodology, rationale, and conclusion/implications.
*   **Focus on Hazard and Exposure:** It explicitly mentions both exposure assessment (production volume, application frequency) and hazard assessment (carcinogenicity, endocrine disruption).
*   **Addressing Limitations:** The abstract acknowledges the limitations of current regulations and the need for updated methodologies.
