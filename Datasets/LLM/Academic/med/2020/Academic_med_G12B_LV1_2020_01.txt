## Interpreting Relative Risk Measures in Clinical Research: A Guide to Risk Ratio, Odds Ratio, and Hazard Ratio

**Abstract:** Accurate interpretation of relative risk measures is paramount in clinical research for translating findings into informed clinical practice. This paper addresses the nuances of three frequently employed statistical measures – risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR), and hazard ratio (HR) – highlighting their distinct definitions and appropriate application within different study designs. The RR, representing the ratio of event probabilities between exposed and unexposed groups, provides a direct measure of effect when incidence rates are comparable. However, its utility is limited in rare disease contexts. The OR, derived from cross-sectional or case-control studies, approximates the RR when the disease is infrequent.  The HR, specifically utilized in time-to-event analyses (e.g., survival analysis), reflects the instantaneous risk of an event in one group relative to another, accounting for varying observation times.  This review outlines the methodological considerations for each measure, including potential biases and limitations.  Furthermore, we discuss practical implications for researchers and clinicians in selecting and interpreting these measures, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of the underlying study design and the prevalence of the outcome of interest to ensure accurate inferences about treatment effects and risk associations.  Understanding these distinctions is critical for robust evidence synthesis and reliable clinical decision-making.
