This study examines recent updates to the NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer, emphasizing advancements in neoadjuvant therapy and targeted treatments. For patients with localized disease, intensified neoadjuvant regimens have shown promise. Moreover, molecular profiling has identified actionable mutations, such as BRAF V600E and HER2 amplification, in metastatic rectal cancer. Integration of these biomarkers into clinical practice may inform personalized treatment strategies, improving patient outcomes. As of 2020, these guidelines provide a framework for clinicians to optimize care for rectal cancer patients, reflecting the evolving landscape of diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.
