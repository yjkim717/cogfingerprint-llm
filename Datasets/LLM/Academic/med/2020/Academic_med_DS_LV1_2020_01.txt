This paper delineates the appropriate application of risk ratios, odds ratios, and hazard ratios in clinical research. We systematically review their definitions, underlying statistical models, and assumptions. A critical analysis of common misinterpretations in the contemporary literature (circa 2020) is presented, providing a framework for enhancing the accuracy of result reporting and strengthening evidence-based clinical decision-making.
