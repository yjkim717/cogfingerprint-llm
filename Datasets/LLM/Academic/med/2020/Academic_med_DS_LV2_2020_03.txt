This study establishes intermediate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Aβ) cutoffs to refine prognostic accuracy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a data-driven, three-range method (positive, intermediate, negative), we analyzed longitudinal cohorts to determine optimal thresholds. Participants within the intermediate Aβ range demonstrated significantly heterogeneous rates of clinical progression to dementia compared to clearly positive or negative cohorts. These findings indicate that binary Aβ classification obscures a clinically meaningful at-risk population. Intermediate CSF Aβ levels provide superior stratification for predicting cognitive decline, highlighting the necessity of incorporating indeterminate zones into biomarker-guided prognosis. This approach enhances early intervention strategies by identifying individuals in a transitional pathological state, ultimately supporting more personalized AD clinical management.
