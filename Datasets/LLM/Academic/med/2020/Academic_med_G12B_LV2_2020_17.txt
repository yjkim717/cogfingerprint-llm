**Abstract**

**Defining Intermediate Amyloid-β Cerebrospinal Fluid Cutoffs to Enhance Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease Progression**

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques in the brain, and measurement of Aβ<sub>42</sub> in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a well-established biomarker for AD pathology. While low Aβ<sub>42</sub> levels are strongly indicative of increased AD risk, individuals with intermediate levels present a diagnostic challenge. This study sought to refine the utility of CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> as a predictive biomarker by investigating a three-range categorization method for defining intermediate cutoffs and assessing their incremental prognostic value for AD progression. A longitudinal cohort of cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment individuals underwent CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> measurement and were followed for conversion to dementia. We defined three groups based on CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> levels: low, intermediate (further divided into two sub-ranges), and high.  Time-to-event analyses were performed to evaluate the predictive power of the intermediate subgroups compared to a single intermediate cutoff. Results demonstrated that the finer differentiation within the intermediate range provided significant improvements in predicting AD conversion (Hazard Ratio [HR], p-value). These findings suggest that a nuanced approach to CSF Aβ<sub>42</sub> interpretation, employing a three-range methodology, may enhance risk stratification and improve the clinical management of individuals at risk for AD.
