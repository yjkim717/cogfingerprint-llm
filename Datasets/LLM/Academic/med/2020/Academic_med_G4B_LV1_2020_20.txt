**Abstract**

Male breast cancer (MBC) represents a distinct, albeit increasingly recognized, subset of the disease.  Current evidence suggests a substantial overlap in therapeutic approaches between MBC and female breast cancer, particularly regarding the implementation of endocrine therapy. This paper contextualizes the evolving management of MBC within the framework of 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines.  These recommendations prioritize a multi-faceted strategy, commencing with confirmation of hormone receptor (HR) status – estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) – via immunohistochemistry. 

Furthermore, the ASCO guidelines advocate for the integration of genetic testing, specifically assessing *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* mutations, in selected patients, reflecting growing understanding of the genetic predisposition to MBC. Endocrine therapy, principally utilizing tamoxifen, remains a cornerstone of treatment for HR-positive MBC.  Future research should continue to refine patient stratification and personalize endocrine regimens, acknowledging the unique clinical presentation and potential for response variation observed in this patient population.
