**Abstract: Advancing Personalized Neoadjuvant Therapy in Stage II Rectal Cancer â€“ A Review of 2020 NCCN Guidelines**

Recent refinements to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for Stage II rectal cancer emphasize a shift towards increasingly personalized treatment strategies. This review synthesizes key updates, focusing on the expanded role of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) combined with biomarker-targeted therapies. Specifically, the document highlights the growing importance of assessing for *BRAF* V600e mutations, a critical predictive biomarker for response to CRT and subsequent benefit from targeted agents. Early detection of this mutation informs decisions regarding adjuvant therapy and potentially allows for a reduced intensity neoadjuvant approach in selected patients.  Further, the guidelines underscore the need for comprehensive post-CRT surveillance, incorporating imaging and fecal immunochemical tests, to optimize patient management and detect recurrence.
