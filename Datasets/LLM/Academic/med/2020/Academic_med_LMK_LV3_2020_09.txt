Title: Elucidating the Genetic Underpinnings of Daytime Napping and its Causal Associations with Cardiometabolic Health

Abstract:
Daytime napping is a ubiquitous behavior with unclear implications for cardiometabolic health. To investigate the genetic determinants of daytime napping and its potential causal links with cardiometabolic outcomes, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2020. Our GWAS identified several genetic variants associated with daytime napping, which were subsequently used as instrumental variables in a Mendelian randomization analysis. The results suggest a potential causal relationship between daytime napping and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as altered lipid profiles. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a significant genetic correlation between daytime napping and sleep disorders, highlighting the complex interplay between sleep regulation and cardiometabolic health. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between daytime napping and cardiometabolic outcomes, informing future studies on the prevention and treatment of related disorders.
