**Abstract**

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains a devastating primary brain tumor characterized by aggressive proliferation and poor prognosis.  Accurate patient stratification and reliable survival prediction are crucial for optimizing therapeutic strategies. This study investigated the potential of integrating multi-omic data to enhance GBM outcome prediction. We developed a radiomic signature derived from pre-treatment MRI scans, subsequently combined with readily accessible clinical variables and targeted analysis of plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA).  The rationale for this approach lies in the potential of radiomic features to capture subtle tumor heterogeneity and cfDNA to reflect genomic instability.  A machine learning model was trained on this integrated dataset to predict patient survival, with performance evaluated using established metrics. Preliminary results demonstrated a significant improvement in discrimination accuracy compared to clinical data alone. Furthermore, stratification based on the radiomic signature and cfDNA profile revealed distinct subgroups with differing prognoses. These findings suggest that a multi-faceted approach leveraging imaging, genomic, and clinical information holds promise for refining patient stratification and improving survival prediction in GBM, warranting further validation in prospective clinical trials.
