**Neurochemical Biomarkers of Neurological Injury and Glial Response in Moderate-to-Severe COVID-19**

Emerging evidence suggests neurological complications are a significant feature of COVID-19, though the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the neurochemical landscape in patients presenting with moderate to severe COVID-19 to characterize the nature and temporal sequence of neurological damage. We analyzed serum samples from a cohort of hospitalized patients for neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), biomarkers indicative of axonal injury and astrocytic activation, respectively. Results demonstrate a significant elevation of both NfL and GFAP in the study population, indicating concurrent neuronal and glial involvement. Notably, GFAP levels exhibited an earlier peak relative to NfL, suggesting an initial and rapid astrocytic response to the systemic inflammatory milieu induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Subsequently, NfL levels demonstrated a more protracted increase, implicating sustained axonal injury and potential long-term neurological sequelae. These findings provide compelling neurochemical evidence for a biphasic pattern of neurological damage in COVID-19, comprising an early glial activation phase followed by a more persistent axonal injury. Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise pathological mechanisms driving these observations and to explore the clinical relevance of these biomarkers in predicting neurological outcomes and guiding therapeutic interventions in the context of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic.
