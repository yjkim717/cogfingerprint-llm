**Abstract**

The influx of Syrian refugees into Jordan presented a critical challenge to established healthcare systems, particularly within refugee camps. This retrospective analysis, conducted in 2020, investigated the oral health status of Syrian children residing in the Zaatari camp. Findings demonstrate a markedly elevated prevalence of dental pain and infectious oral diseases, significantly exceeding baseline rates observed in Jordanian children.  Capacity for providing adequate dental care – including preventative services and treatment – was demonstrably insufficient to meet identified needs.  These data highlight a critical public health vulnerability within the refugee population.  Furthermore, the observed disparities underscore the urgent requirement for targeted interventions and resource allocation to mitigate the long-term consequences of compromised oral health, impacting overall well-being and potentially exacerbating broader systemic health challenges.
