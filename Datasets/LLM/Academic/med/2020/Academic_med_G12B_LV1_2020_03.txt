dehyde's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques in the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ levels are increasingly recognized as valuable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. While established cutoff values for CSF Aβ levels exist, they often fail to capture the spectrum of disease progression, particularly in individuals exhibiting intermediate Aβ burden. This study, conducted in 2020, aimed to refine the diagnostic utility of CSF Aβ measurements by employing a three-range methodology to define novel intermediate cutoffs.

We retrospectively analyzed CSF Aβ data from a cohort of [Insert Cohort Size Here] participants enrolled in longitudinal AD studies. Participants were categorized into three ranges based on CSF Aβ levels: low, intermediate, and high. The predictive power of these refined intermediate cutoff values for subsequent cognitive decline and conversion to AD dementia was assessed using [mention statistical methods, e.g., Cox proportional hazards regression]. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed intermediate ranges provide significantly improved discriminatory power compared to traditional binary cutoffs, enabling more precise risk stratification and potentially facilitating earlier intervention strategies in individuals at elevated risk of AD. These results highlight the importance of nuanced biomarker interpretation in the clinical management of AD.
