**Abstract**

Clinical research frequently employs risk ratio, odds ratio, and hazard ratio to evaluate treatment effects; however, inconsistent application and interpretation remain prevalent. This 2020 analysis clarifies the distinct definitions and appropriate usage of each measure. The risk ratio quantifies the proportionate increase in event risk between groups, while the odds ratio reflects the association in cross-sectional data. Hazard ratio, particularly relevant in time-to-event analyses, assesses relative risk over time. Understanding these nuances is crucial for accurate interpretation and avoids misleading conclusions regarding treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. This paper aims to provide researchers with a practical guide for selecting and correctly interpreting these vital statistical tools.
