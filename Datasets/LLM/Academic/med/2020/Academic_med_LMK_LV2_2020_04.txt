"Advances in systemic therapies have significantly enhanced survival outcomes in patients with metastatic breast cancer. As of 2020, treatment paradigms are increasingly informed by tumor biology, specifically hormone-receptor and HER2 status. Tailoring therapeutic strategies to these molecular characteristics optimizes clinical decision-making, underscoring the importance of precision medicine in breast cancer management. This approach has revolutionized the field, yielding improved patient outcomes."
