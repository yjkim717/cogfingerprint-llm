**Abstract**

This study investigates the utility of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Aβ) thresholds in predicting clinical progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Employing two-graph receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, we sought to identify intermediate Aβ cutoffs beyond established diagnostic markers. Our analysis revealed a critical intermediate range of CSF Aβ concentrations – specifically, levels falling between established high and low thresholds – that demonstrated a nuanced association with disease trajectory.  Contrary to initial hypotheses, CU AbInt status alone did not reliably predict conversion to symptomatic AD. These findings suggest a more complex relationship between CSF Aβ and clinical progression, warranting further investigation into the predictive value of longitudinal biomarker monitoring within this intermediate range.
