**Abstract**

This longitudinal study, conducted between 2015 and 2020, investigated the comparative efficacy of bariatric surgical interventions versus intensive lifestyle modification in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A randomized controlled trial design was employed, evaluating both Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding procedures against a cohort receiving comprehensive lifestyle intervention, including dietary changes and structured exercise programs. Findings demonstrate a statistically significant superiority of bariatric surgery in achieving and sustaining remission of T2DM over a five-year period. The observed effect sizes suggest a substantial clinical benefit of surgical approaches for select T2DM patients. These results underscore the potential of bariatric surgery as a powerful therapeutic modality for T2DM remission, complementing, but ultimately exceeding, the impact of lifestyle interventions alone. Further research is warranted to define optimal patient selection criteria and long-term outcomes.
