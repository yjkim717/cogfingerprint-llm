Title: Elucidating the Genetic Underpinnings of Daytime Napping and its Causal Associations with Cardiometabolic Health

Abstract:
Daytime napping is a ubiquitous behavior with unclear health implications. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants influencing daytime napping and subsequently explored its causal relationships with cardiometabolic health outcomes using Mendelian randomization (MR). Our GWAS meta-analysis (N = 452,633) identified 123 independent genetic loci associated with daytime napping, with significant enrichment for genes involved in sleep-wake regulation and circadian rhythm. Using these genetic variants as instrumental variables, MR analyses suggested a causal link between daytime napping and increased risk of hypertension (OR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.03-1.24) and type 2 diabetes (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.33). These findings provide novel insights into the genetic basis of daytime napping and its potential causal associations with adverse cardiometabolic health outcomes, highlighting the importance of considering sleep disorders in the context of cardiovascular disease prevention. Our results have significant implications for the development of targeted interventions aimed at mitigating the deleterious effects of excessive daytime napping.
