**Abstract**

Male breast cancer (MBC) represents a distinct, albeit rare, malignancy necessitating specialized management approaches. Recent advancements in oncological care have culminated in the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline, offering a revised framework for the clinical management of this disease. This guideline largely parallels established protocols for female breast cancer, prioritizing endocrine therapy as the cornerstone of treatment and integrating risk-stratified screening strategies. 

The ASCO recommendations emphasize the critical role of adjuvant endocrine therapy, primarily utilizing tamoxifen, for patients with hormone receptor-positive MBC.  However, the guideline diverges in its approach to initial adjuvant chemotherapy, advocating for a more selective strategy based on tumor stage, grade, and patient comorbidities, moving away from universally prescribed regimens.  Furthermore, the document underscores the importance of long-term surveillance and risk assessment to inform subsequent screening decisions – a key component of recurrence prevention.

Crucially, the 2020 guideline highlights the evolving understanding of MBC’s unique biological characteristics and patient populations.  It acknowledges the potential for personalized treatment approaches, though further research is required to fully elucidate optimal strategies.  Adherence to these updated ASCO recommendations is paramount for ensuring optimal patient outcomes and minimizing the risk of disease recurrence within the MBC cohort. Continued monitoring and refinement of these guidelines are anticipated as new clinical data emerge.
