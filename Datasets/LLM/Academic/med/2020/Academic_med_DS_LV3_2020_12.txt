**Abstract**

**Background:** The escalating global burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) necessitates the exploration of therapeutic strategies that induce sustained disease remission, moving beyond conventional glycemic management. While intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) remains a foundational pillar of T2D care, its long-term efficacy in achieving remission is limited. Bariatric surgery, particularly Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), has emerged as a potent metabolic intervention, yet long-term comparative data against rigorous medical management were, until recently, scarce.

**Objective:** This analysis presents the five-year follow-up results from a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the durability of T2D remission and reduction of diabetes medication dependency following bariatric surgical procedures versus a structured ILI protocol.

**Methods:** Patients with severe obesity and T2D were randomized to one of three groups: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or an intensive lifestyle and medical management program. The primary endpoint was partial or complete T2D remission, defined by glycemic control (HbA1c <6.5% or <6.0%) without active pharmacologic therapy. Secondary endpoints included changes in diabetes medication burden, weight loss sustainability, and incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications.

**Results:** At the five-year mark, both surgical cohorts demonstrated a significantly higher rate of T2D remission compared to the ILI group. RYGB was associated with the most profound and sustained metabolic benefits, with a substantially greater proportion of participants maintaining HbA1c levels below 6.5% without the use of any glucose-lowering agents. Furthermore, the discontinuation of all antidiabetic medications, including insulin, was markedly more frequent in the surgical arms. The superior glycemic control was accompanied by sustained weight loss and a more favorable cardiovascular risk profile in the RYGB and SG groups compared to ILI.

**Conclusion:** This long-term randomized trial provides robust evidence that bariatric surgery, specifically RYGB, is a superior therapeutic modality for achieving durable T2D remission and eliminating the need for pharmacologic treatment in patients with obesity, fundamentally altering the disease trajectory beyond the capabilities of intensive lifestyle intervention alone. These findings underscore the need to reconceptualize bariatric procedures as definitive treatments for metabolic disease.
