**Abstract**

Delineating the nuances of relative risk estimators is crucial for accurate interpretation of clinical research data. This study addresses the frequent confusion surrounding risk ratios, odds ratios, and hazard ratios, emphasizing their distinct applications within medical investigations. Risk ratios quantify the probability of an event occurring in an exposed group relative to a control; odds ratios assess association between exposures and outcomes, particularly in case-control studies. Hazard ratios, conversely, measure the instantaneous risk of an event within a defined time period, predominantly utilized in survival analysis.  Clear understanding of these statistical measures is paramount for robust data analysis and meaningful clinical conclusions.  Further investigation into appropriate selection and interpretation remains a vital area of methodological development.
