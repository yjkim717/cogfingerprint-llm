**Evidence of Central Nervous System Injury and Neuroinflammation in COVID-19 Patients: A Biomarker Analysis**

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resultant COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a surprisingly broad spectrum of clinical manifestations beyond the respiratory system. While neurological symptoms, including headache, anosmia, and encephalopathy, have been reported, the underlying neuropathological mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the presence of biomarkers indicative of central nervous system (CNS) injury in a cohort of COVID-19 patients, aiming to delineate the extent of CNS involvement. Utilizing readily available serum samples, we quantified glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) â€“ established markers of astrocytic activation and neuronal damage, respectively. Our findings demonstrate significantly elevated levels of both GFAP and NfL in COVID-19 patients compared to established healthy controls (p < 0.05). The degree of biomarker elevation correlated with the severity of systemic illness, suggesting a potential link between systemic inflammation and CNS injury.  These observations support the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger neuroinflammation and neuronal damage within the CNS.  Furthermore, the persistent elevation of these biomarkers suggests the possibility of ongoing neurodegeneration or repair processes, warranting longitudinal studies to assess long-term neurological sequelae.  Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms driving these changes, including potential direct viral invasion of the CNS and the role of immune-mediated injury. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence implicating the CNS as a target organ in COVID-19 and emphasize the need for comprehensive neurological evaluation in affected individuals.
