In this 2020 investigation, we operationalized a three-range classification system for cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels to establish intermediate diagnostic cutoffs. While binary Aβ categorization (positive/negative) robustly predicts clinical progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD), the prognostic significance of intermediate Aβ status remains ambiguous, particularly in cognitively unimpaired populations. Our longitudinal analysis of asymptomatic individuals revealed that intermediate CSF Aβ42/40 ratios demonstrated limited predictive validity for cognitive decline over a 36-month observation period. These findings challenge the clinical utility of indeterminate biomarker ranges in preclinical AD staging and suggest that intermediate amyloid pathology may represent a transitional state with heterogeneous outcomes. The study underscores the necessity of multimarker approaches rather than relying solely on intermediate Aβ thresholds for prognostic stratification in primary prevention frameworks.
