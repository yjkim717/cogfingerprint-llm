**Oral Health Service Utilization and Treatment Modalities for Syrian Refugee Children in the Zaatari Camp, Jordan: A 2020 Analysis**

The protracted Syrian refugee crisis has placed considerable strain on host-nation health systems, with pediatric oral health representing a critical, yet often neglected, component of primary care. This cross-sectional study, conducted in 2020, aimed to evaluate the dental service utilization patterns and predominant treatment modalities for Syrian refugee children residing in the Zaatari camp, Jordan. Retrospective analysis of clinical records revealed a significant disparity in care provision. Emergency and restorative interventions, particularly dental extractions due to advanced caries and pulpitis, constituted the overwhelming majority (est. 78%) of provided treatments. In contrast, preventive services, including topical fluoride applications, dental sealants, and oral health education, were markedly underrepresented. This skewed profile towards exodontia over prevention indicates a systemic insufficiency in the camp's oral healthcare infrastructure, likely driven by resource limitations and a focus on acute pain management. The findings underscore an urgent need for policy shifts to integrate sustainable, preventive-focused programs, which are crucial for mitigating long-term oral disease burden and improving the quality of life for this vulnerable pediatric population.
