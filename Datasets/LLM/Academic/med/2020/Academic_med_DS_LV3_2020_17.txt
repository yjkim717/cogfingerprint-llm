This study investigates the prognostic utility of intermediate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels in cognitively unimpaired individuals, employing a three-range method to define biomarker cutoffs. In 2020, as Alzheimer's disease (AD) research increasingly focused on preclinical stages, we hypothesized that intermediate Aβ status would not significantly predict progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia. A cohort of 450 participants underwent longitudinal clinical assessments. Results demonstrated that while clearly abnormal CSF Aβ robustly predicted clinical decline, intermediate values exhibited no significant association with symptomatic progression over a 4-year follow-up. These findings challenge the categorical interpretation of amyloid pathology and underscore the limited clinical validity of intermediate CSF Aβ cutoffs for individual risk stratification in preclinical AD. This necessitates refined biomarker frameworks that incorporate additional pathological drivers beyond amyloid burden alone.
