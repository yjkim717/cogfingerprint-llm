**Abstract**

The 2020 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for metastatic breast cancer represent a critical update reflecting the increasing integration of tumor biology into treatment selection. These guidelines prioritize a nuanced approach, acknowledging the significant impact of hormone receptor status (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression on therapeutic efficacy.  Specifically, the document delineates distinct treatment strategies based on triple-negative, HR-positive/HER2-negative, HR-positive/HER2-positive, and HER2-positive disease subtypes. Adherence to NCCN recommendations, informed by molecular profiling, is underscored as essential for optimizing patient outcomes. Future research should explore the utility of incorporating circulating tumor DNA analysis to further refine individualized treatment pathways within this challenging clinical landscape.
