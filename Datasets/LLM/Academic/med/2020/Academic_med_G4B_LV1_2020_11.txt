**Abstract**

The global impact of COVID-19 necessitated rapid adaptation of diagnostic modalities within radiology departments. This study presents a preliminary evaluation of the Iranian Society of Radiology’s (ISR) experience in utilizing medical imaging to manage a growing influx of COVID-19 patients during 2020.  Leveraging a collaborative consultant group approach, the ISR implemented standardized imaging protocols focusing primarily on chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) scans of the thorax.  Initial data analysis, encompassing a cohort of [Insert estimated patient number – e.g., ‘over 500’], revealed a consistent pattern of ground-glass opacities and consolidations indicative of pulmonary involvement.  Furthermore, the study documented the utility of specific CT sequences – including [Mention specific sequences – e.g., ‘lung window’ and ‘soft tissue window’] – in differentiating COVID-19 from other common respiratory illnesses.  While recognizing the limitations of a preliminary assessment, this report underscores the critical role of radiology and interdisciplinary collaboration in the early detection and monitoring of COVID-19 severity within the Iranian healthcare system.  Further research is warranted to refine diagnostic accuracy and optimize clinical management strategies.
