Title: Integrating Radiomic Signatures with Clinical Variables and Plasma Cell-Free DNA for Enhanced Prognostication in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Patients

Abstract:

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive and heterogeneous malignancy characterized by dismal prognosis. Accurate patient stratification is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving overall survival (OS). This study investigates the prognostic value of combining radiomic signatures, clinical variables, and plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in newly diagnosed GBM patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of 120 GBM patients diagnosed in 2020. Radiomic features were extracted from preoperative MRI scans, and a radiomic signature was developed using a machine learning algorithm. Plasma cfDNA concentration was quantified using qPCR. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the association between the radiomic signature, clinical variables, cfDNA, and OS. A composite prognostic model was developed by integrating the radiomic signature with clinical variables and cfDNA. Our results demonstrate that the radiomic signature was significantly associated with OS (HR: 2.34, 95% CI: 1.45-3.81, p < 0.001). The composite model showed improved prognostic performance (C-index: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.75-0.89) compared to models using individual variables. Furthermore, the composite model enabled effective stratification of patients into high- and low-risk groups, with significant differences in OS (median OS: 12.4 vs. 20.5 months, p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that integrating radiomic signatures with clinical variables and plasma cfDNA enhances prognostication and patient stratification in newly diagnosed GBM patients, potentially informing personalized treatment strategies.
