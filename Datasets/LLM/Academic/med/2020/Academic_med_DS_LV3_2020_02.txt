**Abstract**

The neurological sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in moderate to severe presentations, remain a critical area of investigation. While anosmia and ageusia are well-documented, the potential for significant central nervous system (CNS) injury is less understood. This study aimed to characterize the extent of CNS involvement by quantifying plasma biomarkers of neuronal and glial integrity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients during the 2020 pandemic wave. We hypothesized that the systemic inflammatory response and potential neurotropism of the virus would be reflected in elevated levels of specific neurochemical markers. We conducted a prospective cohort study analyzing plasma samples from 45 patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 (requiring supplemental oxygen or intensive care) and 30 age-matched healthy controls. Concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL), a biomarker of axonal injury, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytic activation, were measured using ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) technology. Our findings revealed significantly elevated plasma levels of both NfL (p < 0.001) and GFAP (p = 0.002) in the COVID-19 cohort compared to controls. Furthermore, biomarker elevations correlated with clinical disease severity scores and inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein. These data provide compelling neurochemical evidence of concurrent neuronal injury and astrocytic activation in moderate to severe COVID-19. The findings suggest that the pathophysiology extends beyond primary respiratory involvement to include significant CNS impact, potentially driven by systemic inflammation or direct viral effects. This underscores the urgent need for longitudinal studies to determine the long-term neurological consequences and inform neuroprotective therapeutic strategies.
