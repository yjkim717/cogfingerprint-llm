**Abstract**

The identification of predictive biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression remains a critical area of investigation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Aβ) levels are increasingly recognized as potential indicators of disease trajectory. This study employed a novel two-graph receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to establish intermediate Aβ CSF cutoffs capable of stratifying individuals at varying risk of AD progression. Utilizing a robust dataset, we systematically evaluated multiple Aβ thresholds to optimize diagnostic discrimination.  The resultant ROC curves demonstrated a clear separation between groups exhibiting accelerated versus stable cognitive decline.  Specifically, we identified two distinct cutoff values – one indicative of early, subtle changes and another representing a more pronounced amyloidogenic signature. These empirically derived cutoffs offer a valuable adjunct to clinical assessment, potentially facilitating earlier intervention and improved patient management within the evolving landscape of AD research.
