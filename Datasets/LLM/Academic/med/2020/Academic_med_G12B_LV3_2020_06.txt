**Abstract**

Male breast cancer (MBC) represents a relatively rare malignancy, yet its clinical management necessitates specialized considerations within the broader framework of breast cancer treatment. This review synthesizes current best practices and recommendations for MBC management, largely informed by established approaches in female breast cancer, as articulated in the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines. A critical element of MBC treatment remains endocrine therapy, with tamoxifen demonstrating efficacy as a primary agent; however, nuanced responses and potential adverse effects warrant individual patient assessment. Furthermore, the elevated prevalence of germline mutations, particularly in *BRCA1/2* genes, underscores the importance of comprehensive genetic testing for both the affected individual and their family members. Finally, given the often-delayed diagnosis of MBC, the role of targeted screening strategies in high-risk populations – including those with Klinefelter syndrome or a family history of breast cancer – requires further investigation to optimize early detection and improve patient outcomes.  This analysis highlights the evolving landscape of MBC management, emphasizing the integration of genomic profiling and tailored endocrine approaches.
