**Abstract**

The diagnostic utility of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-beta (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often constrained by binary classification. This 2020 study posits that indeterminate Aβ42 levels represent a critical transitional stage. We established intermediate CSF Aβ42 cutoffs using a data-driven, three-range method derived from Gaussian mixture modeling in a cohort of individuals with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment. The predictive validity of these zones for clinical progression to AD dementia was then assessed using time-to-event analyses. Results demonstrated that subjects within the intermediate Aβ42 range exhibited a significantly heightened risk of progression compared to the amyloid-negative group, underscoring the prognostic value of refining CSF biomarkers beyond dichotomous interpretation for improved stratification in preclinical and prodromal AD.
