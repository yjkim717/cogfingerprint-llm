Title: Oral Health Care Provision for Syrian Refugee Children in Zaatari Refugee Camp, Jordan: A Descriptive Analysis

Abstract:

The protracted Syrian conflict has resulted in a substantial influx of refugees into neighboring countries, including Jordan. As of 2020, Zaatari refugee camp remains one of the largest temporary settlements, hosting hundreds of thousands of displaced individuals, including a significant proportion of children. This study aims to describe the oral healthcare services provided to Syrian refugee children within the Zaatari refugee camp. A retrospective analysis of dental records and procedural data from the camp's dental clinics was conducted. The findings highlight the scope and nature of dental services delivered, including preventive and curative treatments. The results underscore the complexities of providing comprehensive oral health care to vulnerable populations in crisis settings. The study's insights contribute to understanding the oral health needs of refugee children and inform strategies to enhance dental care delivery in similar humanitarian contexts.
