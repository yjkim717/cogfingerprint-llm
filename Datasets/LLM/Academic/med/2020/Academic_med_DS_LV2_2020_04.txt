This review synthesizes 2020 updates to the NCCN guidelines for metastatic breast cancer, focusing on the evolution of systemic therapy. We analyze the paradigm of treatment selection, which is fundamentally guided by tumor biology, with a primary emphasis on hormone-receptor and HER2 status. The discussion underscores how this biomarker-driven approach personalizes therapeutic strategies to optimize patient outcomes in the advanced disease setting.
