**Abstract**

Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a devastating malignancy with limited therapeutic efficacy and significant inter-patient heterogeneity. Accurate prognostication and refined patient stratification are crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and improving outcomes. This study investigated the potential of integrating multi-parametric imaging analysis with readily accessible clinical data and circulating biomarkers for enhanced survival prediction in newly diagnosed GBM patients. Radiomic features extracted from pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were combined with established clinical variables and quantification of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma. A multivariate analysis revealed a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) prediction when incorporating the combined radiomic-clinical-cfDNA model compared to traditional clinical risk scores alone. Furthermore, this integrated approach facilitated more refined patient stratification, identifying distinct subgroups with divergent prognoses. These findings suggest that radiomics, when coupled with clinical data and cfDNA analysis, represents a promising non-invasive strategy for personalized risk assessment and therapeutic decision-making in GBM management.
