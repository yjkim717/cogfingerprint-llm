**Abstract**

The progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is often characterized by subtle cognitive decline, necessitating sensitive biomarkers for early detection. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ) levels represent a promising avenue for predicting disease trajectory. This study employed a novel two-graph receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to establish intermediate Aβ CSF cutoffs capable of differentiating between individuals with varying degrees of AD progression. Utilizing established ROC methodology, we systematically evaluated the diagnostic utility of multiple Aβ thresholds. These thresholds were determined to optimize the balance between sensitivity and specificity, providing clinically relevant stratification.  The resultant cutoffs offer a refined approach compared to traditional single-point assessments.  These intermediate cutoffs, derived through rigorous statistical analysis, contribute to a more nuanced understanding of Aβ’s predictive value in AD, potentially informing earlier intervention strategies and improved patient management within the context of 2020 research.
