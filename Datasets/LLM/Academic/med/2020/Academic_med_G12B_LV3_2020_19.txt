The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines Insights, Version 6.2020, present crucial refinements in the management of rectal cancer. These updates clarify rectal cancer definition and strongly advocate for total neoadjuvant therapy (TAN) as a standard approach. Furthermore, the guidelines highlight the increasing importance of biomarker-targeted therapies, particularly focusing on *BRAF* V600E mutations, in the treatment of metastatic disease. This evolution reflects a shift towards personalized medicine and improved patient outcomes in rectal cancer management.
