The 2020 NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer represent a paradigm shift in clinical management, prioritizing total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) to enhance pathological complete response rates and facilitate organ preservation. These updated recommendations underscore the critical role of comprehensive molecular profiling, particularly for identifying BRAF V600E mutations in metastatic disease, to guide biomarker-targeted therapeutic strategies. This evolution in standard care integrates tumor biology with multimodal treatment, aiming to improve survival outcomes through personalized medicine.
