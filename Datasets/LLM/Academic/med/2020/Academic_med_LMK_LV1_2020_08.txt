Title: YAP1 Orchestrates Gastric Adenocarcinoma Peritoneal Metastasis through Cancer Stem Cell Regulation

Abstract:

Gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) remains a malignancy with poor prognosis, largely attributed to peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC), a condition characterized by the dissemination of cancer cells throughout the peritoneal cavity. Recent studies have underscored the pivotal role of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, in promoting oncogenic processes. Here, we investigate the functional significance of YAP1 in GA peritoneal metastasis and its interplay with cancer stem cells (CSCs). Our findings demonstrate that YAP1 is aberrantly overexpressed in GA tissues, particularly in those with PC. Elevated YAP1 expression correlates with advanced tumor stage, poor differentiation, and reduced overall survival. Mechanistically, YAP1 promotes the self-renewal and metastatic potential of GA CSCs by transcriptionally regulating stemness-associated genes, including SOX2 and OCT4. Conversely, YAP1 inhibition attenuates CSC properties, suppresses tumor growth, and reduces peritoneal metastasis in preclinical models of GA. Notably, our data reveal that YAP1-driven CSC expansion is mediated through the upregulation of CD44, a cell surface marker implicated in CSC maintenance. Furthermore, we show that pharmacological inhibition of YAP1 using verteporfin, a small molecule inhibitor, effectively suppresses GA tumor growth and peritoneal dissemination in vivo. Our study provides compelling evidence that YAP1 is a critical regulator of GA peritoneal metastasis, acting through the modulation of CSCs. These findings suggest that targeting YAP1 may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of GA patients with PC. As such, our research highlights the clinical potential of YAP1 inhibition as a novel anti-metastatic therapy, warranting further investigation in clinical trials. By elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying YAP1-driven peritoneal metastasis, this study contributes to the development of more effective treatment modalities for GA, a malignancy characterized by dismal outcomes.
