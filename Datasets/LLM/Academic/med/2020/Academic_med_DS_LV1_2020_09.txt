**Abstract**

While daytime napping is a common behavioral trait, its determinants and health implications remain incompletely understood. Leveraging data from the UK Biobank, we conducted a **genome-wide association study (GWAS)** of self-reported daytime napping frequency in over 400,000 individuals of European ancestry. Our analysis identified 78 independent **genetic loci** significantly associated with napping propensity (P < 5×10⁻⁸), implicating genes involved in sleep homeostasis, circadian rhythms, and orexinergic signaling. To investigate the potential health consequences, we performed **Mendelian randomization (MR)** analyses using these genetic variants as instrumental variables. Our findings provide evidence for a putative causal relationship, suggesting that a genetic predisposition to more frequent daytime napping is associated with adverse **cardiometabolic health** outcomes. Specifically, we observed significant causal estimates for increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure and larger waist circumference. These results, robust to sensitivity analyses, suggest that habitual napping may not be a benign activity but could be a marker or contributor to poorer metabolic health, highlighting a need for further mechanistic investigation.
