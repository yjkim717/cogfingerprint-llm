**Abstract**

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains the most aggressive primary malignant brain tumor, presenting significant challenges in prognosis and treatment response. This study investigated the potential of integrating multi-omic data to improve survival prediction and patient stratification within this complex disease landscape. Utilizing a retrospective cohort of newly diagnosed GBM patients, we developed and validated a radiomic signature derived from pre-treatment MRI scans, subsequently integrating this with established clinical variables and readily accessible plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) profiles. 

The primary objective was to assess the predictive accuracy of this combined approach for overall survival (OS) and to identify distinct patient subgroups based on biomarker expression. Machine learning algorithms were employed to construct a prognostic model, demonstrating a statistically significant correlation between the radiomic signature, plasma cfDNA alterations, and OS (p < 0.001).  Furthermore, patient stratification revealed discernible clusters exhibiting differential responses to standard-of-care therapies. 

These findings suggest that the synergistic analysis of imaging biomarkers, genomic alterations within plasma cfDNA, and clinical data offers a refined framework for personalized GBM management. Specifically, this approach facilitates more accurate survival forecasting and supports targeted patient stratification, potentially optimizing therapeutic strategies and ultimately improving patient outcomes. Further prospective validation is warranted to fully elucidate the clinical utility of this integrated biomarker panel.
