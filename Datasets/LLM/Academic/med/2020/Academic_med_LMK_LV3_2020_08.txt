"Title: Targeting YAP1 to Mitigate Peritoneal Carcinomatosis in Gastric Adenocarcinoma: A Promising Therapeutic Avenue

Gastric adenocarcinoma remains a highly malignant neoplasm, with peritoneal carcinomatosis representing a devastating metastatic complication. Recent investigations have underscored the pivotal role of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) in regulating cancer stem cell properties and tumor progression. This study elucidates the mechanistic link between YAP1 and peritoneal carcinomatosis in gastric adenocarcinoma. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, we demonstrate that YAP1 expression is significantly upregulated in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues with peritoneal metastasis. Functional assays reveal that YAP1 inhibition substantially attenuates cancer stem cell characteristics and metastatic potential. Moreover, targeted YAP1 inhibition effectively suppresses peritoneal carcinomatosis in preclinical models. Our findings highlight YAP1 as a critical driver of peritoneal metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma, suggesting that YAP1-targeted therapy may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to improve patient outcomes in this devastating disease."
