**Abstract**

The early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression is crucial for targeted therapeutic interventions. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta (Aβ) levels represent a promising biomarker; however, establishing clinically relevant thresholds remains challenging. This study investigated the utility of two-graph receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to identify intermediate Aβ CSF cutoffs predictive of AD progression. Utilizing a retrospective cohort of [Insert hypothetical sample size, e.g., 250] participants, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of various Aβ CSF concentrations.  Our analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation between Aβ levels and subsequent cognitive decline, as measured by [Insert hypothetical cognitive assessment, e.g., the Mini-Mental State Examination].  Specifically, a cutoff of [Insert hypothetical cutoff value, e.g., 200 pg/mL] demonstrated optimal sensitivity and specificity in differentiating individuals exhibiting AD progression. These findings contribute to the refinement of Aβ CSF biomarker utilization, potentially facilitating earlier clinical intervention strategies for AD.
