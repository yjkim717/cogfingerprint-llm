## Abstract: Evolving NCCN Guidelines for Rectal Cancer Management: Integrating Biomarker-Targeted Neoadjuvant Therapy

This review summarizes key updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the management of rectal cancer, reflecting advancements observed through 2020. A central theme of the revised guidelines is the increasing integration of neoadjuvant therapy, particularly informed by emerging biomarker data. Specifically, the document details refined definitions regarding tumor stage and response criteria, alongside updated recommendations for surgical approaches and adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. Notably, the guidelines emphasize the role of *BRAF* V600E mutation testing as a predictive biomarker, guiding the selection of targeted therapies within the neoadjuvant setting. This shift towards biomarker-driven, personalized treatment strategies aims to optimize patient outcomes and potentially reduce the need for radical surgical interventions. The analysis highlights the evolving landscape of rectal cancer treatment, underscoring the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration and adherence to evidence-based guidelines for improved patient care.
