In the context of increasing regulatory scrutiny of food contact materials, this study addresses critical gaps in the safety assessment of plastic migrants under Regulation (EU) No 10/2011. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes and Processing Aids developed a systematic prioritisation procedure to evaluate 451 substances lacking established Specific Migration Limits (SMLs). This methodological framework integrated comprehensive hazard assessment protocols with migration potential data to classify substances according to their potential risk to consumer health.

The prioritisation methodology employed a tiered approach, incorporating structural alerts, toxicological endpoints from in vitro and in silico analyses, and physicochemical properties affecting migration behavior. Through this rigorous evaluation process, three high-priority substances were identified as requiring immediate re-evaluation due to their potential genotoxicity, endocrine disruption properties, and bioaccumulation potential. These compounds demonstrated significant migration tendencies under simulated usage conditions while presenting adverse effect concentrations of toxicological concern.

The implementation of this prioritisation framework represents a significant advancement in proactive risk management for food contact materials. By systematically identifying substances warranting urgent regulatory attention, this approach enables more efficient allocation of scientific resources while strengthening the evidence base for consumer protection measures. The findings underscore the necessity of continuous monitoring and re-evaluation of plastic migrants, particularly as new toxicological evidence emerges and manufacturing processes evolve. This research contributes to the development of more robust regulatory paradigms that anticipate rather than react to potential public health concerns in the domain of food packaging safety.
