**Title:** An Integrated Model Combining Radiomic Signatures, Clinical Variables, and Plasma Cell-Free DNA Enhances Prognostic Stratification in Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma

**Abstract**

**Background:** Glioblastoma (GBM) remains a lethal malignancy with profound inter-tumoral heterogeneity, complicating accurate prognostication and optimal patient management. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived radiomic signatures capture phenotypic diversity and clinical variables provide baseline assessments, circulating biomarkers like plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) offer a minimally invasive window into the tumor's molecular state. The integration of these multi-modal data streams holds promise for refining prognostic models.

**Objective:** This study aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive prognostic model for overall survival (OS) in newly diagnosed GBM by integrating preoperative contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR MRI radiomics, standard clinical variables (e.g., age, KPS, MGMT promoter methylation status), and quantitative plasma cfDNA levels.

**Methods:** In a retrospective cohort of 158 patients with newly diagnosed IDH-wildtype GBM, we extracted 1,130 radiomic features from manually segmented tumor volumes. A radiomic signature prognostic for OS was constructed using a Cox regression model with LASSO penalty for feature selection. Plasma cfDNA concentration was quantified preoperatively via digital PCR. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the independent and combined prognostic value of the radiomic signature, clinical factors, and cfDNA.

**Results:** The integrated model, incorporating the radiomic signature, clinical variables, and cfDNA level, demonstrated superior prognostic performance compared to models using any single data type (C-index: 0.78 vs. <0.70 for single-modality models; p<0.001). This model significantly stratified patients into distinct high-risk and low-risk groups with markedly different median OS (12.3 vs. 21.1 months, log-rank p<0.0001).

**Conclusion:** The synergistic integration of radiomic phenotypes, clinical data, and liquid biopsy biomarkers provides a robust, non-invasive framework for improving OS prediction and patient stratification at diagnosis, which could inform risk-adapted therapeutic strategies in glioblastoma.
