Title: Comparative Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery and Lifestyle Intervention in Type 2 Diabetes Remission: A 5-Year Randomized Controlled Trial Analysis


#### Abstract

Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a pervasive metabolic disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The efficacy of bariatric surgery versus lifestyle intervention in achieving long-term T2D remission remains a subject of investigation.


#### Methods:
This study was conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 200 participants with T2D, who were randomly assigned to either undergo bariatric surgery or participate in an intensive lifestyle intervention program. The primary outcome measured was T2D remission at 5 years post-intervention.

#### Results:
At the 5-year follow-up, the bariatric surgery group demonstrated a significantly higher rate of T2D remission compared to the lifestyle intervention group (45% vs. 12%, p < 0.001). The bariatric surgery cohort also exhibited greater reductions in body mass index (BMI) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Multivariate analysis revealed that the type of intervention, baseline BMI, and duration of T2D were significant predictors of T2D remission.

#### Conclusion:
This RCT provides robust evidence supporting the superiority of bariatric surgery over lifestyle intervention in achieving long-term T2D remission. The findings underscore the importance of considering surgical options for eligible patients with T2D, particularly those with a higher BMI and shorter disease duration. While lifestyle interventions remain a cornerstone in the management of T2D, bariatric surgery emerges as a more effective strategy for inducing sustained remission.


#### Implications:
The results of this study have significant implications for clinical practice and policy-making. They suggest that bariatric surgery should be considered a viable treatment option for T2D, potentially reducing the burden of diabetes-related complications and healthcare costs. Future research should focus on identifying patient subgroups most likely to benefit from surgical intervention and exploring the mechanisms underlying the observed differences in outcomes between bariatric surgery and lifestyle intervention.


This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of bariatric surgery in the management of T2D, offering a valuable perspective for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers seeking to improve treatment outcomes for this patient population.
