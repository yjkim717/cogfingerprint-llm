Of particular clinical concern in gastric adenocarcinoma is the development of peritoneal carcinomatosis, a condition associated with a profoundly poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. This study investigates the role of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) as a central driver of this aggressive metastatic phenotype. We hypothesized that YAP1 promotes peritoneal dissemination by conferring core properties of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are implicated in therapy resistance and tumor initiation. Through integrated molecular analyses of primary tumors and matched peritoneal metastases, we demonstrated a significant upregulation of nuclear YAP1 in metastatic lesions. Functional assays revealed that YAP1 activation was both necessary and sufficient to enhance clonogenic potential, spheroid formation, and tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mouse models, hallmarks of CSCs. Mechanistically, YAP1 orchestrated a pro-metastatic program by directly regulating key stemness-associated genes, including SOX9 and CD44. Crucially, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of YAP1 inhibition. Genetic silencing of YAP1 via shRNA robustly attenuated tumor growth and prevented the formation of peritoneal metastases in vivo. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of the YAP1-TEAD complex with verteporfin mirrored these effects, significantly reducing the CSC population and metastatic burden in our preclinical models. These findings establish YAP1 as a critical regulator of CSC properties in gastric adenocarcinoma and posit its targeted inhibition as a promising, novel therapeutic strategy to combat the devastating clinical challenge of peritoneal carcinomatosis.
