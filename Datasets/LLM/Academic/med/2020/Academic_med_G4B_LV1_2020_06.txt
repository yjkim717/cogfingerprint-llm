**Abstract**

Male breast cancer (MBC) represents a distinct yet increasingly recognized subset of this malignancy, necessitating specialized management approaches.  The 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline provides a foundational framework for therapeutic strategies, largely converging with established protocols for female breast cancer. Central to this approach is the utilization of endocrine therapy, specifically targeting hormone receptor-positive (HR+) disease.  Tamoxifen remains a cornerstone agent, demonstrating efficacy in reducing recurrence risk and improving overall survival. 

However, the guideline underscores the importance of individualized treatment plans, incorporating tailored imaging modalities – including mammography, ultrasound, and breast MRI – to optimize staging accuracy and monitor for potential recurrence.  Furthermore, consideration of patient-specific factors, such as age, comorbidities, and tumor characteristics, is paramount.  While mimicking many aspects of female breast cancer management, the ASCO 2020 recommendation highlights the necessity for ongoing research to refine strategies and improve outcomes within this specific patient population. Continued vigilance regarding recurrence is a critical component of long-term care.
