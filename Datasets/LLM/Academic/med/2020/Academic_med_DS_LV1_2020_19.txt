The 2020 update to the NCCN guidelines for rectal cancer refines staging definitions and consolidates Total Neoadjuvant Therapy (TNT) as a standard for high-risk localized disease. This paradigm shift aims to enhance pathological complete response rates and facilitate organ preservation. Concurrently, the guidelines expand recommendations for biomarker-driven management in metastatic settings, explicitly endorsing BRAF V600E-targeted regimens. These revisions underscore a critical movement towards personalized, response-adapted treatment algorithms, integrating intensified local control strategies with molecularly-selected systemic therapies to optimize oncologic outcomes.
