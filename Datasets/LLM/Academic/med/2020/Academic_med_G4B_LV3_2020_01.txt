“Contemporary clinical research increasingly relies on diverse statistical measures to assess treatment efficacy and disease risk. This paper addresses the critical need for precise interpretation of risk ratios, odds ratios, and hazard ratios.  While frequently employed interchangeably, these metrics represent distinct methodologies reflecting varying study designs and exposure windows.  Specifically, risk ratios quantify relative probabilities, odds ratios relate binary outcomes, and hazard ratios model time-to-event data.  Clear delineation of these ratios is paramount for accurate reporting and synthesis within medical literature, minimizing misinterpretations and facilitating robust evidence-based decision-making.”
