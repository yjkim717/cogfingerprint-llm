**Abstract**

Diffuse gliomas represent a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in adult neuro-oncology. In 2020, the European Association of Neuro-Oncology (EANO) released updated, evidence-based guidelines to standardize the management of these complex tumors. This document synthesizes current knowledge regarding diagnosis, treatment strategies, and long-term follow-up protocols for adult patients presenting with diffuse glioma. The guidelines incorporate refined diagnostic criteria reflecting advancements in molecular pathology and neuroimaging techniques, particularly the integration of genomic profiling to inform prognostication and therapeutic decision-making. Furthermore, the EANO recommendations address the evolving landscape of therapeutic interventions, reflecting results from recent clinical trials evaluating both standard approaches (e.g., surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy) and novel targeted therapies. These guidelines aim to improve patient outcomes by promoting consistent, multidisciplinary care and facilitating the translation of cutting-edge research into clinical practice within the European context. The document underscores the importance of individualized treatment plans based on tumor characteristics and patient-specific factors.
