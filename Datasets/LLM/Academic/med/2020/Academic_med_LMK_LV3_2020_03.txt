To address the diagnostic challenge posed by Alzheimer's disease, this study (2020) investigates the utility of a three-range method for establishing intermediate cutoff values for amyloid-β (Aβ) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). By analyzing CSF Aβ measurements, the research identifies an intermediate range that signifies uncertain amyloid pathology. The predictive value of this range for clinical progression is assessed, providing insights into the prognostic utility of Aβ biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and research, thereby informing clinical decision-making and future therapeutic strategies.
