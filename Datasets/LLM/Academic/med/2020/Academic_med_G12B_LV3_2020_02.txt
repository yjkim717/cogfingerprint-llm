**Abstract**

The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resultant COVID-19 pandemic has prompted investigation into extrapulmonary manifestations, including neurological complications. This study presents neurochemical evidence of central nervous system (CNS) injury in a cohort of patients experiencing moderate to severe COVID-19. Utilizing plasma biomarkers, we observed elevated levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL), indicative of axonal neuronal damage, alongside increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), reflecting astrocytic activation. These findings suggest a potential direct or indirect impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the CNS, potentially contributing to reported neurological symptoms. The observed neurochemical alterations warrant further investigation into the long-term neurological sequelae of COVID-19 and propose the utility of plasma NfL and GFAP as potential biomarkers for monitoring disease progression and assessing neurological outcomes in affected individuals. Further research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying these observations.
