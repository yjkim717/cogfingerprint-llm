This 2020 methodological review delineates the proper interpretation and application of risk, odds, and hazard ratios in clinical epidemiology. Through critical analysis of contemporary studies, we elucidate frequent misinterpretations of these effect measures, particularly in time-to-event and case-control designs. Our findings underscore the necessity for precise statistical communication to enhance the validity of clinical evidence and inform evidence-based practice.
