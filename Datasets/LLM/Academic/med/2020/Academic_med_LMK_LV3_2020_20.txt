Title: Optimizing Management of Male Breast Cancer: Adherence to ASCO Guidelines and Emerging Trends in Endocrine Therapy and Genetic Counseling

Abstract:
Male breast cancer, a rare and understudied malignancy, necessitates evidence-based management strategies. As per the 2020 ASCO guidelines, endocrine therapy remains a cornerstone in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive male breast cancer, with tamoxifen being the preferred agent. The guidelines also underscore the importance of targeted systemic therapy and genetic counseling in the comprehensive management of male breast cancer. This review examines the current landscape of male breast cancer treatment, highlighting adherence to ASCO recommendations and emerging trends in endocrine therapy. We discuss the role of genetic counseling in identifying high-risk individuals and families, facilitating early detection and prevention. By synthesizing existing evidence and guideline recommendations, this analysis aims to inform clinical practice and optimize patient outcomes in male breast cancer.
