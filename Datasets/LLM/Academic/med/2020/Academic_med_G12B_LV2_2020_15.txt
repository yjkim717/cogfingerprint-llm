## Abstract

**Understanding and Appropriate Application of Risk, Odds, and Hazard Ratios in Clinical Research**

Clinical research frequently employs relative measures of effect to quantify the impact of interventions or exposures. This paper, written in 2020, addresses the nuanced distinctions and appropriate applications of three commonly utilized statistical measures: risk ratios (RR), odds ratios (OR), and hazard ratios (HR). While all reflect comparative risk, their underlying calculations and interpretability differ substantially depending on the study design and data type. The RR represents the ratio of event probabilities between exposed and unexposed groups, directly reflecting absolute risk change. The OR, frequently employed in case-control studies, approximates the RR when the outcome is rare. Finally, the HR, derived from time-to-event analyses (e.g., survival analysis), estimates the instantaneous risk of an event relative to exposure status. Misinterpretation or inappropriate selection of these ratios can lead to flawed conclusions. This analysis clarifies the theoretical underpinnings of each measure and provides guidance for researchers in selecting the most suitable metric for their specific research question and study design, ultimately promoting more rigorous and transparent reporting of clinical research findings.
