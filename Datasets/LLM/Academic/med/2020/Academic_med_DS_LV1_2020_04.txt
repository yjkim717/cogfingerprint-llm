Recent advances in systemic therapy have significantly improved survival outcomes for metastatic breast cancer. Current 2020 clinical practice, guided by NCCN guidelines, emphasizes treatment selection based on tumor biology, particularly hormone-receptor status. This personalized approach tailors therapeutic regimens to molecular subtypes, optimizing efficacy while managing toxicity. The evolution towards biomarker-driven strategies represents a paradigm shift in metastatic disease management, underscoring the critical role of comprehensive tumor profiling.
