A 2020 retrospective analysis of Syrian refugee pediatric populations in Jordanâ€™s Zaatari camp reveals critical deficiencies in oral healthcare delivery. Clinical records indicate that the predominant reasons for dental visits were acute conditions, primarily dental pain and infection, rather than preventive care. Consequently, dental extraction emerged as the most frequent intervention, reflecting a reactive treatment model. This pattern underscores systemic barriers, including limited access to restorative and preventive services, insufficient resources, and the absence of sustained public health initiatives. The high prevalence of extractions highlights an urgent need for enhanced capacity-building, such as integrating preventive oral health programs and expanding the availability of conservative treatments within refugee healthcare systems. These findings emphasize that improving oral health outcomes in displaced populations requires targeted policy reforms and strengthened clinical infrastructure to shift from emergency care to sustainable preventive practices.
