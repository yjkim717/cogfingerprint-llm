**Abstract**

Male breast cancer (MBC) management has undergone significant evolution, largely informed by the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline. This document consolidates established practices, predominantly centering on endocrine therapy as the foundational treatment approach.  Recommendations prioritize tailored strategies dictated by disease stage and assessed genetic risk profiles. Specifically, tamoxifen remains a cornerstone of initial endocrine therapy, frequently complemented by aromatase inhibitors depending on patient characteristics.  Crucially, the guideline strongly advocates for comprehensive genetic testing – encompassing germline mutations in *BRCA1/2* and other high-risk genes – to stratify patient risk and inform treatment decisions.  Furthermore, targeted systemic therapies are integrated into the management plan, contingent upon disease progression or resistance to endocrine agents.  This unified approach, reflecting a shift toward personalized medicine, represents a critical advancement in optimizing outcomes for individuals diagnosed with MBC.
