**Abstract**

**Title:** Long-Term Comparative Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery versus Intensive Lifestyle Intervention for Remission of Type 2 Diabetes and Weight Management: A Five-Year Follow-up of a Randomized Controlled Trial

**Background:** The escalating global burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) necessitates effective, durable management strategies. While intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) is a cornerstone of therapy, bariatric surgery, particularly Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB), has emerged as a potent intervention for severe obesity and T2D. However, long-term, randomized data comparing these modalities remain critical for clinical decision-making.

**Objective:** To evaluate the five-year efficacy of RYGB versus a structured ILI in achieving T2D remission and significant weight loss in patients with severe obesity.

**Methods:** In this single-center, randomized controlled trial, 120 adults with obesity (BMI 35-55 kg/m²) and inadequately controlled T2D were allocated to either RYGB or a comprehensive ILI program. The ILI included caloric restriction, structured physical activity, and behavioral counseling. The primary outcome was partial or complete T2D remission, defined by HbA1c <6.5% without active pharmacologic therapy. Secondary outcomes included percentage of total body weight loss (%TWL), changes in cardiometabolic risk factors, and medication utilization.

**Results:** At the five-year follow-up, the intention-to-treat analysis demonstrated a significantly higher rate of T2D remission in the RYGB cohort compared to the ILI group (45% vs. 12%; p<0.001). Similarly, mean %TWL was substantially greater following RYGB (-25.4% ± 6.1%) than with ILI (-6.2% ± 4.8%; p<0.001). The surgical group also exhibited superior improvements in glycemic control, lipid profiles, and a marked reduction in the use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering agents. No mortality was reported, though specific surgical complication rates were documented.

**Conclusion:** In adults with obesity and T2D, Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass was significantly more effective than intensive lifestyle intervention alone in achieving sustained diabetes remission and substantial weight loss over a five-year period. These findings, published in 2020, underscore the role of metabolic surgery as a definitive therapeutic option for this patient population, highlighting its profound and durable metabolic benefits.
