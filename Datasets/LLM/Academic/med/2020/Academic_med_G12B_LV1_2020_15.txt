## Abstract: Comparative Risk Assessment in Clinical Research: A Clarification of Risk Ratio, Odds Ratio, and Hazard Ratio Interpretation

**Objective:** The interpretation of comparative risk measures – risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR), and hazard ratio (HR) – remains a frequent source of confusion among clinicians and researchers. This study aims to provide a concise clarification of each measure, outlining their distinct definitions, underlying assumptions, and appropriate applications within diverse clinical research designs.

**Methods:** A systematic review of established statistical methodology and published literature pertaining to clinical trial analysis and observational studies was conducted. Definitions of RR, OR, and HR were rigorously examined, emphasizing the populations and events each measure describes. The nuances of their calculation, particularly concerning incidence rates and time-to-event data, were explored.

**Results:** The RR directly quantifies the increased or decreased risk of an event in an exposed group relative to an unexposed group. The OR estimates the association between exposure and outcome when the outcome is not necessarily rare, while the HR reflects the instantaneous risk of an event occurring in one group compared to another, typically used in survival analysis.  Misinterpretation of these measures can lead to misleading conclusions regarding treatment efficacy or disease prognosis.

**Conclusion:** Accurate understanding and appropriate application of RR, OR, and HR are crucial for robust interpretation of clinical research findings. This clarification serves as a reference for researchers and practitioners to ensure accurate risk communication and informed decision-making.
