**Abstract**

Misinterpretation of relative risk measures remains a persistent challenge in clinical research. This analysis clarifies the nuanced distinctions between risk ratio (RR), odds ratio (OR), and hazard ratio (HR), delineating their theoretical underpinnings and practical applications within a medical context. Drawing upon examples from peer-reviewed literature published through 2020, we demonstrate how each measure reflects different aspects of treatment effect. The RR directly quantifies the proportionate increase in risk, while the OR approximates risk when outcomes are rare, and the HR models time-to-event data. Proper selection and interpretation of these statistical measures are crucial for accurate conclusions and informed clinical decision-making, minimizing potential for misrepresentation of research findings.
