**Abstract**

This retrospective study, conducted in 2020, investigated the oral health status of Syrian refugee children residing within the Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan. The study aimed to quantify the prevalence of dental disease and treatment needs within this vulnerable population. Data analysis revealed a significantly high prevalence of dental pain and oral infections, impacting a considerable proportion of the pediatric cohort. Extractions constituted the most frequently performed dental procedure, indicative of advanced caries and periodontal disease. These findings underscore a critical need for the development and implementation of targeted, culturally sensitive, and prioritized dental health programs specifically tailored to the needs of Syrian refugee children. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of integrating preventative oral health education and accessible care within humanitarian aid efforts to mitigate the long-term sequelae of untreated dental disease and improve overall well-being.
