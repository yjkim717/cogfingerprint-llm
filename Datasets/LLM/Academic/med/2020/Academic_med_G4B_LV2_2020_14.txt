**Abstract**

The protracted Syrian refugee crisis has engendered significant public health challenges, particularly within host nations. This retrospective study, conducted within the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan during 2020, investigated the oral health needs and utilization patterns of Syrian refugee children. Our analysis revealed a predominantly reactive approach to dental care, with the majority of pediatric patients presenting due to acute pain and infectious pathologies.  A critical limitation identified was markedly restricted access to comprehensive dental services, compounded by insufficient infrastructure and a constrained clinical capacity within the campâ€™s existing healthcare facilities. 

Specifically, the observed prevalence of untreated caries and periodontal inflammation underscored a systemic failure to prioritize preventative oral health measures. Data analysis indicated a disproportionate burden of oral disease among younger children, suggesting potential developmental vulnerabilities exacerbated by nutritional deficiencies and limited oral hygiene practices.  Furthermore, the study highlighted substantial barriers to care, including financial constraints, logistical difficulties associated with accessing the camp, and a lack of culturally sensitive oral health education. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions focused on both immediate pain management and long-term preventative strategies to mitigate the detrimental impact of inadequate oral healthcare on the well-being of Syrian refugee children within Zaatari camp and similar settings.
