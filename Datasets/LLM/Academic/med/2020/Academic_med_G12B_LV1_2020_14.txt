**Abstract**

**Prevalence of Dental Extractions and Access to Oral Healthcare Among Syrian Refugee Children Residing in Zaatari Refugee Camp, Jordan: A Retrospective Analysis (2013-2019)**

**Background:** The protracted Syrian refugee crisis has resulted in significant population displacement, with vulnerable children experiencing disproportionate health challenges. Limited data exists regarding the specific oral health needs and service provision for this population, particularly within refugee camp settings. This retrospective cohort study aimed to quantify the prevalence of dental extractions and assess the utilization of dental services among Syrian refugee children residing in Zaatari Refugee Camp, Jordan.

**Methods:** Dental records (n=X, *replace with actual number*) from the Zaatari Refugee Camp dental clinic, spanning the period 2013-2019, were retrospectively analyzed. Data extracted included patient demographics, treatment history, and the number and reason for dental extractions. Descriptive statistics were calculated to determine the prevalence of extractions, stratified by age group (5-9 years, 10-14 years, 15-17 years).  Furthermore, the proportion of children receiving preventative dental care (e.g., fluoride varnish application, oral hygiene instruction) was determined.

**Results:** A substantial proportion of Syrian refugee children (Y%, *replace with actual percentage*) underwent at least one dental extraction during the study period.  The highest extraction rate was observed in the 10-14 year age group (Z%, *replace with actual percentage*), with caries being the primary indication.  Utilization of preventative dental services remained low, with only W% (*replace with actual percentage*) of children receiving any form of preventative care.

**Conclusion:** This study highlights a concerning burden of oral disease and a significant reliance on irreversible dental extractions among Syrian refugee children in Zaatari Camp. The limited access to preventative oral healthcare necessitates the implementation of targeted interventions, including improved access to fluoride, scaling and polishing, and oral health education, to mitigate future oral health disparities and promote optimal oral health outcomes for this vulnerable population. Further research should investigate the underlying socioeconomic and environmental factors contributing to these findings.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Placeholders:** I've used X, Y, Z, and W as placeholders for the actual data.  You *must* replace these with the real numbers from the study.
*   **Sample Size:**  The "n=X" is crucial.  A larger sample size strengthens the study's validity.
*   **Specific Reasons for Extraction:** While "caries" is mentioned, specifying other reasons (e.g., trauma, periodontal disease) would add depth.
*   **Preventative Care Details:**  Listing specific preventative measures (fluoride varnish, sealant application, oral hygiene instruction) provides more detail.
*   **2020 Context:** The timeframe (2013-2019) is relevant as it precedes major shifts in global health priorities related to the pandemic, which might have impacted access to care.
