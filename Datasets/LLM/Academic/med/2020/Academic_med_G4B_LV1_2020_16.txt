**Abstract: Elevated Plasma Neurofilament Light Chain and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein Levels in Patients with COVID-19 Indicate Central Nervous System Pathology**

Emerging evidence suggests a significant, yet incompletely understood, neurological impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study investigated the prevalence of plasma biomarkers indicative of central nervous system (CNS) pathology in a cohort of patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Utilizing readily accessible plasma samples, we quantified levels of neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) – established markers of axonal degeneration and astrocyte activation, respectively. Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant elevation in both NfL and GFAP concentrations within the patient group compared to a matched control cohort.  Specifically, mean NfL levels were [Insert Specific Value – e.g., 25.3 pg/mL] higher, while GFAP levels were [Insert Specific Value – e.g., 18.7 ng/mL] elevated. These increases strongly suggest ongoing neuronal and glial injury associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis.  The observed biomarker discordance warrants further investigation into the specific mechanisms driving these inflammatory responses within the CNS, potentially informing the development of targeted therapeutic interventions and improved neurological outcome prediction.
