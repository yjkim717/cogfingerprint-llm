This paper delineates the conceptual and mathematical distinctions between risk ratios, odds ratios, and hazard ratios, three foundational measures of association in clinical epidemiology. We elucidate their respective applications for binary, case-control, and time-to-event data, clarifying common misinterpretations. A critical appraisal of recent literature (circa 2020) demonstrates that inappropriate metric selection persists, potentially leading to flawed inferences in evidence-based medicine.
