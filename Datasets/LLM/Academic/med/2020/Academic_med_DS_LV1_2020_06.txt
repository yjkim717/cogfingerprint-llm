**Abstract**

**Title:** Contemporary Management of Male Breast Cancer: A 2020 Perspective on Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy and Genetic Profiling

**Background:** Male breast cancer (MBC), while rare, presents significant clinical challenges. Historically, treatment paradigms have been extrapolated from those established for female breast cancer (FBC), despite distinct pathophysiological and epidemiological differences. The efficacy and tolerability of established adjuvant endocrine therapies in men, particularly in the era of genomic medicine, require ongoing evaluation.

**Objective:** This review synthesizes the 2020 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines and contemporary evidence to delineate the standard of care for the management of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) MBC, with a focus on adjuvant endocrine therapy and the critical role of genetic testing.

**Methods:** A systematic literature review was conducted of clinical trials, cohort studies, and consensus guidelines published between 2010 and 2020 pertaining to MBC management. Emphasis was placed on studies evaluating tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs), as well as the prevalence and implications of germline genetic mutations.

**Findings:** Tamoxifen remains the cornerstone of adjuvant endocrine therapy for HR+ MBC, supported by robust retrospective data. The use of AIs is not recommended as monotherapy due to compensatory hypergonadotropism and insufficient estrogen suppression; however, combination with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist represents a potential alternative. ASCO guidelines strongly endorse comprehensive germline genetic testing for all MBC patients, given the high prevalence of pathogenic variants, most notably in the *BRCA2* gene. This genetic information is crucial not only for systemic therapy decisions but also for familial risk assessment.

**Conclusion:** The management of MBC in 2020 mirrors that of FBC in its foundational principles but requires specific adaptations. Adherence to guideline-recommended endocrine therapy and universal genetic testing is paramount for optimizing oncological outcomes and providing comprehensive care for men with breast cancer.
