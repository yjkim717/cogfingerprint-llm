**Abstract: YAP1 Promotes Peritoneal Metastasis in Gastric Adenocarcinoma – A Potential Therapeutic Target**

Gastric adenocarcinoma remains a significant global health concern, frequently characterized by aggressive peritoneal dissemination. Emerging evidence implicates the transcriptional co-activator YAP1 (Yes-associated protein 1) in modulating metastatic behavior, yet its precise role within this context remains incompletely elucidated. This study investigates the contribution of YAP1 to peritoneal metastasis development in a murine model of gastric adenocarcinoma. Utilizing patient-derived xenografts, we observed a statistically significant correlation between elevated YAP1 expression and the incidence of peritoneal implant formation, indicative of metastatic spread. 

Specifically, YAP1 activation was found to drive epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) within tumor cells, facilitating their migration and extravasation into the peritoneal cavity. Furthermore, YAP1 was identified as a key regulator of cancer stem cell (CSC) populations, with its suppression diminishing the proportion of CSCs and attenuating metastatic potential.  Pharmacological inhibition of YAP1 demonstrated a marked reduction in peritoneal metastasis burden and improved overall survival in treated animals. 

These findings strongly suggest that YAP1 functions as a critical mediator of peritoneal metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma.  Consequently, YAP1 represents a compelling and actionable therapeutic target for the development of novel anti-metastatic strategies. Future research should focus on elucidating the specific molecular mechanisms underpinning YAP1’s pro-metastatic effects and identifying clinically relevant inhibitors for patient benefit.
