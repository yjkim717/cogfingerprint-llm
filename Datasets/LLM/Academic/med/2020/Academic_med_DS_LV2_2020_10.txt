**Abstract**

**Background:** Glioblastoma (GBM) portends a dismal prognosis, with significant heterogeneity in treatment response and overall survival (OS) that is inadequately captured by existing clinical and molecular stratification systems. While magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard for diagnosis and monitoring, conventional assessment remains qualitative. Radiomics, the high-throughput extraction of quantitative features from medical images, offers a promising avenue for decoding tumor phenotype. Concurrently, plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has emerged as a minimally invasive liquid biopsy biomarker, reflecting tumor-derived genetic and epigenetic alterations. We hypothesized that a multi-modal integration of radiomic signatures, clinical variables, and plasma cfDNA levels would yield a superior prognostic model for newly diagnosed GBM.

**Methods:** In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled 148 patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed GBM. Pre-operative multi-parametric MRI (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences) was performed. A total of 1,216 radiomic features were extracted from the segmented tumor volumes. Feature selection was conducted using a combination of reproducibility analysis, redundancy reduction, and LASSO-Cox regression to identify a radiomic signature prognostic for OS. Plasma cfDNA concentration was quantified from pre-operative blood samples using a fluorometry-based assay. A multi-variable Cox proportional hazards model was constructed, integrating the radiomic signature, key clinical variables (age, KPS, extent of resection), and log-transformed plasma cfDNA levels.

**Results:** The final integrated model significantly stratified patients into distinct prognostic groups (log-rank p < 0.0001). The radiomic signature, characterized by features related to tumor heterogeneity and peritumoral edema, was independently prognostic (HR: 2.45, 95% CI: 1.68-3.57, p < 0.001). Elevated pre-operative plasma cfDNA concentration was a strong, independent predictor of shorter OS (HR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.30-2.83, p = 0.001). The integrated model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy for 12-month and 24-month OS compared to models using clinical variables alone or in combination with either radiomics or cfDNA (Integrated C-index = 0.78).

**Conclusion:** The synergistic integration of quantitative radiomic features from pre-treatment MRI with plasma cfDNA levels and clinical data provides a robust, non-invasive tool for improved prognostication and patient stratification in newly diagnosed GBM. This multi-modal approach holds significant potential for refining clinical trial design and personalizing therapeutic strategies.
