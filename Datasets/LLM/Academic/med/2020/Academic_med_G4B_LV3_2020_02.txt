**Abstract**

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a complex neurological sequelae, with emerging evidence suggesting significant central nervous system (CNS) involvement. This study investigates the neurochemical correlates of neurological dysfunction in patients presenting with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection. Analysis of readily accessible plasma biomarkers – specifically, neurofilament light chain (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) – demonstrated a robust elevation in both groups, indicative of acute neuronal injury and glial activation, respectively. Notably, the observed pattern suggests a temporally-linked progression, wherein initial astrocytic activation precedes more pronounced axonal damage. These findings align with preliminary reports of microglial and astrocytic responses within the CNS during severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further research utilizing longitudinal biomarker monitoring and neuroimaging techniques is warranted to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying COVID-19-associated neuroinflammation and its potential impact on long-term neurological outcomes.
