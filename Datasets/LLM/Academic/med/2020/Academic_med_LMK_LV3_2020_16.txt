Title: Neurochemical Indicators of CNS Damage in COVID-19 Patients: A 2020 Study

Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has presented a significant global health challenge since its emergence in late 2019. By 2020, it had become evident that the virus not only affects the respiratory system but also has profound implications for various other bodily systems, including the central nervous system (CNS). This study investigates the neurochemical evidence of CNS injury in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19, focusing on serum levels of neurofilament light chain protein (NfL) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) as biomarkers for neuronal and astrocytic damage, respectively. Our findings indicate a significant elevation in both NfL and GFAP levels among COVID-19 patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting widespread CNS damage. Notably, the severity of COVID-19 correlated positively with the levels of these biomarkers, underscoring the potential for severe CNS injury in critical cases. The results provide compelling neurochemical evidence of astrocytic and neuronal injury, highlighting the need for further research into the long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence suggesting that COVID-19 is not solely a respiratory disease but a multisystem disorder with significant neurological implications. The findings have important implications for the clinical management and follow-up of COVID-19 patients, particularly those with severe manifestations of the disease.
