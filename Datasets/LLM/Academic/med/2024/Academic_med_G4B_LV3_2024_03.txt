**Abstract**

This study investigated the diagnostic potential of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 immunoassay in identifying preclinical Alzheimer’s disease. A single-center cohort study assessed the assay’s diagnostic accuracy relative to established clinical and neuroimaging biomarkers. Preliminary findings suggest the immunoassay demonstrates promising sensitivity and specificity in detecting early pathological changes. Further validation in larger, multi-center cohorts is warranted to refine diagnostic thresholds and ultimately improve the accuracy of early Alzheimer’s disease detection in 2024.
