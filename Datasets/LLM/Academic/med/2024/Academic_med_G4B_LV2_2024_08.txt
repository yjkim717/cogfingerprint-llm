**Abstract**

The sustained efficacy of immunotherapy in oncology has spurred investigations into combination strategies. This study presents a 3-year follow-up analysis of the CheckMate 649 trial, evaluating the impact of incorporating nivolumab with chemotherapy in patients harboring advanced adenocarcinoma. Utilizing data from the trial, we observed a statistically significant enhancement in both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) when nivolumab was administered concurrently with standard chemotherapy regimens. Specifically, patients exhibiting a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) of â‰¥5 demonstrated a markedly superior clinical outcome with the combination therapy compared to chemotherapy alone. 

These findings reinforce the potential of immunotherapy as a cornerstone treatment for this aggressive malignancy. The observed improvements in OS, extending beyond the initial trial timeframe, highlight the durability of response achievable with this approach. Further research is warranted to delineate predictive biomarkers beyond PD-L1 CPS, explore optimal dosing regimens, and assess the long-term safety profile of this combination strategy. Ultimately, this analysis contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the integration of nivolumab into established chemotherapy protocols for advanced adenocarcinoma patients.
