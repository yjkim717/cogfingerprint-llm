**Abstract**

Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology remains a critical challenge. This study investigated the diagnostic utility of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) immunoassay across three independent cohorts. Utilizing a prospective cohort design, we assessed the assay’s ability to correlate with established AD biomarkers and clinical diagnosis. Preliminary results demonstrate a strong positive association between plasma p-tau217 levels and the presence of amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that this immunoassay holds promise as a non-invasive tool for identifying individuals at risk of or exhibiting early AD, warranting further validation in larger, diverse populations.
