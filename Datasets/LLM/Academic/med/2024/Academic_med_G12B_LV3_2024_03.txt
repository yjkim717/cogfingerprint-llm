**Abstract:** This prospective, single-center cohort study, conducted in 2024, investigates the clinical utility of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau) 217 immunoassay for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Evaluating diagnostic accuracy, we assessed the assay's performance in identifying AD pathophysiology within a defined cohort. Findings will contribute to the expanding field of plasma biomarker research and may inform future refinements in AD diagnostic algorithms, potentially facilitating earlier and more accessible disease detection.
