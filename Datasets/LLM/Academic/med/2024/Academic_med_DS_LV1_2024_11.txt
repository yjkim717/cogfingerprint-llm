**Title:** A Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Architectures for Automated Segmentation of Pediatric Brain Tumors on Multiparametric MRI

**Introduction:** The precise delineation of brain tumor volumes is a critical prerequisite for treatment planning, surgical intervention, and response assessment in pediatric neuro-oncology. Manual segmentation by clinical experts, however, is time-consuming, subject to inter-observer variability, and represents a significant bottleneck in clinical workflows. Consequently, the development of robust, automated segmentation tools is a paramount objective. While numerous deep learning models have been proposed, their comparative efficacy, particularly on the unique and heterogeneous presentations of pediatric brain tumors, remains an area of active investigation. This study aims to perform a rigorous, empirical comparison between two prominent convolutional neural network architectures: the self-configuring nnU-Net framework and the DeepMedic model.

**Methods:** We curated a multi-institutional dataset of 178 pediatric patients with histologically confirmed brain tumors, comprising a total of 534 multiparametric MRI studies (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, T1-weighted post-contrast, and FLAIR sequences). Manual segmentations of the gross tumor volume (GTV), encompassing both enhancing and non-enhancing components, were established by a consensus of two board-certified pediatric neuroradiologists and served as the ground truth. The dataset was partitioned into training (n=124), validation (n=27), and hold-out test (n=27) cohorts. Both nnU-Net (in its default 2D and 3D full-resolution configuration) and DeepMedic were trained and optimized under identical computational conditions. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated on the independent test set using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) to assess volumetric overlap, and the 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) to evaluate boundary delineation accuracy.

**Results:** On the hold-out test set, the nnU-Net framework demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to DeepMedic. The mean DSC for nnU-Net was 0.89 (±0.06), significantly outperforming DeepMedic's mean DSC of 0.81 (±0.11) (p < 0.001, paired t-test). Similarly, nnU-Net achieved a lower mean HD95 of 3.2 mm (±1.8) compared to 5.7 mm (±3.1) for DeepMedic, indicating more precise boundary definition. Qualitative analysis revealed that nnU-Net exhibited greater robustness in handling heterogeneous tumor textures and diffuse non-enhancing tumor components, which were frequently under-segmented by the DeepMedic model.

**Conclusion:** In this comprehensive 2024 benchmark study, the nnU-Net framework significantly outperformed the DeepMedic architecture for the automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors on multiparametric MRI. The superior performance of nnU-Net is likely attributable to its adaptive, problem-agnostic design, which dynamically tailors network topology and training parameters to the specific dataset. These findings strongly suggest that nnU-Net represents a more effective and reliable tool for integration into clinical neuro-oncological workflows, potentially enhancing the efficiency and standardization of tumor volumetry for improved patient management.
