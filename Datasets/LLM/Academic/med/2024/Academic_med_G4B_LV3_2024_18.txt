**Abstract:**

The 2024 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer represent a critical update to systemic therapy management strategies. These guidelines detail evidence-based recommendations for the initial treatment of patients with nonmetastatic breast cancer, integrating surgical, radiation, and medical oncology modalities.  Specifically, the document outlines evolving approaches to adjuvant systemic therapy, considering factors such as tumor subtype and risk stratification.  Adherence to NCCN guidelines ensures standardized clinical practice, potentially improving patient outcomes and optimizing resource allocation within oncology care. Further research evaluating guideline impact is warranted.
