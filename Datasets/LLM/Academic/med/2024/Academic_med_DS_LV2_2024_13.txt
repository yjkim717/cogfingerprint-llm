**Abstract**

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has recently updated its guidance for the safety evaluation of post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) intended for food contact applications. This critical review, situated within the domain of public health and regulatory medicine, analyzes the implications of this revised framework, which pivots on the dual assessment of decontamination efficiency and predictive migration modeling. The primary medical concern underpinning this regulatory evolution is the potential for consumer exposure to chemical contaminants, including legacy substances from prior use and process-induced reaction by-products. These compounds, if migrating into foodstuffs, pose a non-negligible toxicological concern, with risks ranging from endocrine disruption to carcinogenicity. The updated EFSA protocol mandates a rigorous, science-based demonstration that any recycling process can reliably reduce contamination to a level of no detected migration or, more commonly, to a concentration that falls below a pre-defined threshold of toxicological concern. This is quantitatively assessed through challenge tests using surrogate contaminants, from which a decontamination efficiency is calculated. Subsequently, conservative migration models are employed to extrapolate these results to real-world exposure scenarios, ensuring a substantial margin of safety. The 2024 guidance thus represents a significant advancement in safeguarding the food chain, transitioning from a qualitative to a quantitatively robust risk assessment paradigm. Its implementation is paramount for mitigating latent public health threats associated with circular economy initiatives, ensuring that the sustainability of material recycling does not compromise consumer safety.
