This 2024 analysis examines the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical practice guidelines for the systemic management of nonmetastatic breast cancer. We critically appraise the multidisciplinary framework for selecting neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapeutic regimens, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted agents. The review underscores the imperative of biomarker-driven treatment stratification—incorporating hormone receptor status, HER2 expression, and genomic risk scores—to optimize oncologic outcomes. Emphasis is placed on evolving standards for mitigating recurrence risk and managing treatment-related toxicities, thereby refining personalized clinical decision-making in early-stage disease.
