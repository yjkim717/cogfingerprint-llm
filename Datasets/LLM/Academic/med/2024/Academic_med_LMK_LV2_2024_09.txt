Title: Leveraging Mendelian Randomization to Elucidate Causal Relationships in Neurological Disorders

Abstract:
Mendelian randomization (MR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for inferring causality in observational studies, particularly in the field of neurology. By harnessing genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), MR enables researchers to disentangle the complex relationships between genetic variants, intermediate phenotypes, and disease outcomes. In this context, MR exploits the random allocation of genetic variants at conception, thereby minimizing confounding and reverse causation biases. As a result, MR provides a robust framework for testing causal hypotheses and identifying potential therapeutic targets in neurological disorders. This review synthesizes the current state of MR methodology and its applications in neurology research, highlighting the opportunities and challenges associated with integrating genetic data into causal inference frameworks. By leveraging MR, researchers can gain novel insights into the etiology of neurological diseases, ultimately informing the development of targeted interventions and improving patient outcomes.
