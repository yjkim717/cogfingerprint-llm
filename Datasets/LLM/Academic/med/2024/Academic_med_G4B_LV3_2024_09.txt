**Abstract**

Mendelian randomization (MR) is rapidly emerging as a powerful tool within neurology, offering a novel approach to causal inference utilizing genetic data. This review synthesizes recent advances in applying MR methodologies to investigate the biological underpinnings of neurological disorders and delineate potential therapeutic interventions. Leveraging genome-wide association studies (GWAS), MR allows researchers to explore hypothesized causal links between modifiable genetic variants and neurological phenotypes, mitigating confounding biases inherent in observational studies. Specifically, incorporating brain imaging data – such as structural and functional MRI – alongside genetic data enhances the robustness of MR analyses.  Results from MR studies are increasingly informing our understanding of disease etiology in conditions including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and depression.  However, challenges remain regarding pleiotropy and statistical power.  Future research should prioritize rigorous MR designs and explore the integration of multi-omic data to refine causal pathways and ultimately translate genetic insights into targeted therapeutic strategies for neurological health by 2028.
