This study evaluates the efficacy of adhering to the 2024 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer in optimizing systemic therapy for patients with diverse breast cancer subtypes. By analyzing treatment outcomes in a cohort of 500 patients, we assessed the impact of guideline-concordant therapy on overall survival and disease-free survival. Results demonstrate that adherence to the guidelines significantly improves patient outcomes, underscoring the importance of evidence-based medicine in oncology practice. These findings support the continued use of the NCCN guidelines as a framework for delivering high-quality breast cancer care.
