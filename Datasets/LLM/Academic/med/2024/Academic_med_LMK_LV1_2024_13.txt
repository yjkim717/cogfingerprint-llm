Title: Evaluating Decontamination Efficiency in Post-Consumer PET Recycling for Food Contact Materials: An Updated EFSA Guidance Framework

Abstract:

In 2024, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) released an updated guidance document on assessing the safety of post-consumer mechanical polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling processes for food contact materials (FCMs). This revision aims to refine the evaluation of decontamination efficiency in PET recycling, ensuring the production of safe FCMs. The updated guidance builds upon previous EFSA frameworks, incorporating new scientific evidence and methodological advancements.

The EFSA guidance outlines a structured approach to evaluating the regeneration process, focusing on the decontamination efficiency of PET recycling processes. The framework involves a comprehensive assessment of the recycling process, including the characterization of post-consumer PET waste, the decontamination efficiency of the recycling process, and the quality of the recycled PET (rPET) output.

The updated guidance emphasizes the importance of using surrogate contaminants to assess decontamination efficiency and provides detailed recommendations for the selection and application of these surrogates. Furthermore, the EFSA guidance highlights the need for robust statistical analysis and modeling to predict the decontamination efficiency of PET recycling processes under various operating conditions.

By providing a more comprehensive and scientifically grounded framework for evaluating PET recycling processes, the updated EFSA guidance is expected to enhance the safety of FCMs and support the development of more efficient and sustainable PET recycling practices. This, in turn, will contribute to a reduction in plastic waste and the promotion of a more circular economy in the European Union.
