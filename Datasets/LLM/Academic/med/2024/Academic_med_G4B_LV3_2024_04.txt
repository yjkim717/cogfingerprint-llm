**Abstract**

The 2024 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology for Breast Cancer represent a critical update to systemic therapy management strategies. These guidelines specifically address the nuanced approaches required for nonmetastatic breast cancer subtypes, acknowledging increasing heterogeneity in patient populations.  Recommendations detail tailored systemic regimens, integrating chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and endocrine treatment, reflecting advancements in molecular profiling.  Adherence to NCCN guidelines ensures standardized clinical practice, optimizing patient outcomes and minimizing treatment-related toxicities. Further research is warranted to evaluate the impact of these updated recommendations on survival rates and quality of life for individuals diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer, solidifying their role in contemporary oncology.
