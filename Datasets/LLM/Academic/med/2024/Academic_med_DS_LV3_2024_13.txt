**Abstract**

The 2024 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) scientific guidance establishes a rigorous, toxicologically-driven framework for the safety evaluation of post-consumer recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) intended for food contact materials. This paradigm is predicated on the principle of functional barrier efficacy, mandating that mechanical recycling processes demonstrate a quantifiable and sufficient decontamination efficiency. The core of the assessment hinges on two complementary methodologies: controlled challenge tests and predictive migration modeling. Challenge tests simulate a worst-case contamination scenario using surrogate substances, thereby empirically determining a process's ability to purge contaminants. Concurrently, migration modeling provides a computational forecast of the potential for any residual contaminants to migrate into foodstuffs under foreseeable conditions of use. The toxicological benchmark for this entire evaluation is the Threshold of Toxicological Concern (TTC), specifically the Cramer Class III threshold of 0.0025 Î¼g/kg body weight per day, which defines a negligible risk level for unknown substances. The synergistic application of these tools ensures that the cumulative dietary exposure from any potential non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) or legacy contaminants in the recycled PET remains below this stringent safety threshold. Consequently, this EFSA guidance provides a scientifically robust and health-protective protocol, enabling the safe circularity of PET and mitigating potential public health risks associated with its reuse in food packaging, thereby supporting broader environmental sustainability goals without compromising consumer safety.
