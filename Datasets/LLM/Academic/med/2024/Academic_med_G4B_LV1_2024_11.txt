**Abstract**

Accurate and reliable segmentation of pediatric brain tumors is crucial for treatment planning, monitoring response, and assessing prognosis. This study investigated the comparative performance of two deep learning architectures – nnU-Net and DeepMedic – for the automated delineation of these lesions on neuroimaging data. Utilizing a retrospective dataset of pediatric brain tumor cases, we evaluated the segmentation accuracy and inter-observer concordance of each model. Results demonstrated a statistically significant advantage for nnU-Net, exhibiting superior Dice scores (mean ± SD: 0.87 ± 0.05) and Hausdorff distances (mean ± SD: 0.21 ± 0.08 mm) compared to DeepMedic (Dice score: 0.82 ± 0.06, Hausdorff distance: 0.25 ± 0.10 mm; *p* < 0.001).  Furthermore, visual inspection indicated improved delineation of tumor margins and reduced false positives with nnU-Net. These findings suggest that nnU-Net represents a robust and effective tool for automated segmentation in pediatric neuro-oncology, potentially enhancing clinical workflows and facilitating more precise patient management. Future research will explore the integration of nnU-Net within clinical decision support systems.
