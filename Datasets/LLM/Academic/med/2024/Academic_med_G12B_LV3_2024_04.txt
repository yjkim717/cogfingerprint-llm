**Abstract**

The 2024 iteration of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology presents a refined framework for the multidisciplinary approach to breast cancer management. This update underscores the evolving landscape of systemic therapies for nonmetastatic disease, reflecting recent advancements in targeted agents and immunotherapies. Surgical oncology and medical oncology remain integral components, with guideline recommendations emphasizing individualized treatment strategies based on tumor biology, patient characteristics, and genomic profiling. The guidelines provide clinicians with evidence-based recommendations to optimize treatment sequencing and combination regimens, ultimately aiming to improve disease-free survival and quality of life for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.
