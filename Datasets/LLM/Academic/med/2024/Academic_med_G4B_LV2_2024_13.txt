**Abstract: Assessing the Safety and Regulatory Framework for Post-Consumer PET Recycling in Food Contact Materials – A 2024 Perspective**

The escalating volume of plastic waste necessitates innovative approaches to material recovery, including the utilization of post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in food contact applications. However, ensuring consumer safety demands rigorous evaluation of decontamination efficacy and potential dietary exposure pathways. This paper synthesizes evolving regulatory considerations and proposes a framework for assessing the suitability of post-consumer PET recycling processes, drawing upon recent advancements outlined in updated guidance from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). 

Central to this assessment are robust safety assessments incorporating migration models to predict potential chemical release into food. Decontamination capability – specifically, the removal of residual contaminants – represents a critical performance indicator. Furthermore, the development of precise regulatory guidance, informed by comprehensive safety data, is paramount for authorizing such processes. Future research should prioritize standardized methodologies for evaluating decontamination efficiency and refining migration models to account for diverse PET sources and processing conditions. This proactive approach is vital for achieving sustainable and safe utilization of recycled PET in the food chain.
