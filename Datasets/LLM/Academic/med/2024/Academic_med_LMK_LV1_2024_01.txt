Title: Reevaluating R-Squared Values in Clinical Medicine: A Context-Dependent Approach

Abstract:

The interpretation of R-squared (R²) values in regression models remains a contentious issue in clinical medicine. While R² is widely used to quantify the goodness of fit, its significance is often misjudged due to an over-reliance on arbitrary thresholds. This study proposes a nuanced approach to evaluating R² values, taking into account the coefficient of variance and clinical context. By analyzing a range of regression models derived from diverse clinical datasets (2020-2024), we demonstrate that R² values should be interpreted in relation to the specific research question, study design, and data characteristics. Our findings suggest that an R² value of 0.7 may be considered satisfactory in certain contexts, such as predictive modeling, but inadequate in others, like explanatory modeling. By adopting a context-dependent approach, researchers and clinicians can more accurately assess the utility and limitations of regression models, ultimately enhancing the validity and applicability of clinical research findings.
