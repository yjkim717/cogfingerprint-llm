**Abstract**

Mendelian randomization (MR) represents a burgeoning strategy for establishing causal relationships within complex disease pathways, particularly in neurology where traditional observational studies are frequently confounded. This review synthesizes current applications of MR utilizing extensive genetic data to investigate the causal roles of modifiable risk factors in neurological phenotypes. Leveraging the inherited genetic correlations between exposures and outcomes, MR allows researchers to move beyond correlational inferences and propose plausible causal pathways. Recent advances in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and imputation techniques have significantly expanded the availability of robust genetic instruments. We examine the methodological considerations inherent in MR, including potential biases and the importance of pleiotropy, alongside illustrative examples of its deployment in areas such as Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, and epilepsy, coupled with brain imaging data to strengthen causal inferences. Future directions involve integrating multi-omics data and refining analytical approaches to enhance the robustness and clinical relevance of MR in neurological research.
