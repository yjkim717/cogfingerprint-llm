Title: Reevaluating R-Squared Values in Clinical Medicine: Contextualizing Interpretation in Regression Models

Abstract:

The R-squared value is a ubiquitous metric in clinical research, employed to quantify the goodness of fit of regression models. However, its interpretation is often oversimplified, neglecting the complexities of clinical data. This study undertakes a nuanced evaluation of R-squared values in clinical medicine, examining the impact of contextual factors, model complexity, and comparative analyses on its interpretation. We analyzed a diverse range of clinical datasets, applying multiple regression models and calculating coefficient of variance to contextualize R-squared values. Our findings indicate that R-squared values are influenced by study design, data heterogeneity, and model specification. We propose a framework for contextualizing R-squared interpretation, incorporating consideration of clinical relevance, data quality, and model assumptions. This framework enhances the validity and utility of R-squared values in clinical research, facilitating more informed decision-making in 2024 and beyond. By reevaluating R-squared values, this study contributes to the advancement of clinical research methodologies.
