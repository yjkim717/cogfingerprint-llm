**Abstract**

Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology remains a critical challenge. This study investigates the diagnostic potential of a novel plasma tau 217 immunoassay, utilizing longitudinal data from three distinct cohorts. We evaluated the assay’s capacity to correlate with elevated plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau217) levels, a biomarker reflecting amyloidogenic pathology.  Analysis of cohort data demonstrated a statistically significant association between increased p-tau217 concentrations and the presence of established AD neuropathology, as determined through established post-mortem assessments. These findings suggest that this immunoassay holds promise as a non-invasive tool for identifying individuals with preclinical AD, contributing to a deeper understanding of disease pathophysiology and facilitating earlier therapeutic intervention.
