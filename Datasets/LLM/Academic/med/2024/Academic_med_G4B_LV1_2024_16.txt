**Abstract**

Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology remains a significant clinical challenge. This study evaluated the diagnostic potential of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) immunoassay across three distinct patient cohorts. Utilizing a longitudinal cohort study design, we assessed the correlation between plasma p-tau217 levels and established AD biomarkers and clinical diagnoses. Preliminary results indicate a robust association between elevated p-tau217 concentrations and the presence of amyloid pathology and cognitive impairment.  The assay demonstrated acceptable sensitivity and specificity in differentiating between cohorts exhibiting varying stages of AD progression. These findings suggest that a readily accessible plasma p-tau217 immunoassay holds promise as a valuable tool for facilitating earlier AD diagnosis and monitoring disease progression, warranting further validation in larger prospective studies (2024).
