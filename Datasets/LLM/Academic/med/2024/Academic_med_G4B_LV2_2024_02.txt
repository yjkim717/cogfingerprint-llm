**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) necessitates the development of accessible biomarkers for early detection and longitudinal monitoring. This study investigates the diagnostic potential of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) immunoassay within three independent observational cohorts. Utilizing an immunoassay platform, we assessed the correlation between plasma p-tau217 levels and established AD neuropathology. Results demonstrate a statistically significant positive association between elevated p-tau217 concentrations and the presence of AD pathology, supporting the utility of this biomarker as a potential indicator of early disease progression.  Further analysis within the cohort study revealed a predictive value for conversion to clinical AD. These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence supporting the role of plasma p-tau217 in elucidating the pathophysiology of AD and warranting its exploration in clinical trials and routine diagnostic applications.
