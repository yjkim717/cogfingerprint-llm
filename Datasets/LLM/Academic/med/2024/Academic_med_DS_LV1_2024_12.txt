**Comparative Long-Term Efficacy of Metabolic-Bariatric Surgery versus Intensive Medical Therapy for Glycemic Control and Disease Remission in Type 2 Diabetes: A 2024 Perspective**

**Abstract**

**Background:** The global pandemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D) necessitates the exploration of therapeutic modalities that offer durable glycemic control and potential disease remission. While intensive medical therapy (IMT) remains the cornerstone of management, metabolic-bariatric surgery (MBS) has emerged as a potent intervention, yet long-term comparative data remain critical for clinical decision-making.

**Objective:** This review synthesizes contemporary evidence to evaluate the long-term efficacy and durability of MBS, specifically Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG), against advanced IMT for achieving glycemic control and T2D remission.

**Methods:** A systematic analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies with follow-up periods exceeding five years was conducted. Primary endpoints included mean change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline and rates of diabetes remission, defined as HbA1c <6.5% off antihyperglycemic medications. Secondary endpoints encompassed weight trajectory, cardiovascular risk factor reduction, and medication burden.

**Findings:** The consolidated evidence robustly demonstrates the superior efficacy of MBS. Patients undergoing RYGB or SG exhibit significantly greater and more sustained reductions in HbA1c compared to IMT cohorts, with mean differences often exceeding 1.5-2.0% at 5-10 year follow-up. Crucially, MBS is associated with substantially higher rates of partial and complete T2D remission. While remission rates may attenuate over time, a significant proportion of surgical patients maintain euglycemia without pharmacologic intervention, a outcome rarely observed with IMT. The mechanisms extend beyond weight loss alone, involving enhanced insulin sensitivity, potentiation of incretin hormones (e.g., GLP-1), and alterations in bile acid metabolism. Furthermore, MBS cohorts demonstrate superior amelioration of comorbidities, including hypertension and dyslipidemia, leading to a reduced composite cardiovascular risk profile.

**Conclusion:** In 2024, the evidence unequivocally positions metabolic-bariatric surgery as a superior therapeutic strategy for selected patients with T2D and obesity, providing durable glycemic control and significantly higher rates of diabetes remission compared to intensive medical management alone. These findings advocate for the expanded integration of MBS into treatment algorithms for appropriate candidates, emphasizing its role not merely as a weight-loss procedure but as a fundamental intervention for metabolic disease.
