**Automated Segmentation of Pediatric Brain Tumors via Artificial Intelligence: Progress and Clinical Implications**

The increasing prevalence of pediatric brain tumors necessitates enhanced diagnostic accuracy and efficient treatment planning. This study examines the advancements in automated segmentation techniques, specifically focusing on gliomas, driven by the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge. Leveraging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms were rigorously evaluated for their ability to delineate tumor boundaries with improved precision compared to traditional manual methods.  The challenge’s collaborative framework stimulated innovation in deep learning architectures and facilitated benchmarking of performance metrics.  Successful segmentation represents a critical step toward streamlining clinical workflows and supporting clinical trials evaluating novel therapeutic interventions. Future research should prioritize validation across diverse patient cohorts and explore the integration of segmentation outputs with predictive modeling for personalized patient care, ultimately optimizing clinical outcomes for pediatric brain tumor patients.
