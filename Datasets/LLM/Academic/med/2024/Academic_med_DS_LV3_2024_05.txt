The 2024 NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer delineate a precision oncology framework for managing metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). These evidence-based recommendations prioritize systemic therapy selection contingent upon individualized therapeutic objectives, prior treatment exposure, and comprehensive tumor mutational profiling. The guidelines underscore the necessity of integrating molecular diagnostics—such as RAS, BRAF, and MSI status—to guide targeted and immunotherapeutic interventions. This paradigm emphasizes optimizing clinical outcomes through biomarker-driven strategies while mitigating adverse effects, thereby advancing personalized medicine in mCRC and reinforcing the critical role of genomic characterization in contemporary oncology practice.
