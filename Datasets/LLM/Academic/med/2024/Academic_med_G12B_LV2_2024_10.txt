**Abstract**

The accurate and efficient segmentation of pediatric brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data remains a critical challenge in neuro-oncology, significantly impacting treatment planning and clinical trial stratification. Addressing this need, the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge represented a novel initiative, marking the first dedicated competition focused specifically on the segmentation of tumors within the pediatric population. This challenge provided a standardized dataset of multi-modal pediatric brain tumor MRI scans, facilitating a rigorous evaluation of automated segmentation algorithms.  Participants were tasked with developing and refining models capable of delineating tumor core, edema, and enhancing tumor regions.  Preliminary findings from the challenge demonstrate considerable advancements in segmentation accuracy, particularly with the application of architectures such as the nnU-Net and its derivatives, highlighting the efficacy of established deep learning frameworks adapted to the unique complexities of pediatric tumor morphology.  The BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge serves as a catalyst for enhanced collaboration within the research community, ultimately aiming to improve the precision of patient selection and outcome prediction within pediatric brain tumor clinical trials and to accelerate the development of more targeted and effective therapeutic interventions. Future research will focus on incorporating radiomics and longitudinal data to further refine segmentation models and predict treatment response.
