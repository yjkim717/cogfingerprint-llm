**Abstract:**

This study investigates the diagnostic potential of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 immunoassay in identifying Alzheimer’s disease pathology. Utilizing a single-center cohort, we assessed the assay’s diagnostic accuracy compared to established clinical and neuropathological criteria. Preliminary findings suggest the immunoassay demonstrates promising sensitivity and specificity in detecting early indicators of tau hyperphosphorylation, a hallmark of Alzheimer’s. Further validation across diverse populations is warranted to refine its clinical utility and improve the non-invasive identification of individuals with preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.
