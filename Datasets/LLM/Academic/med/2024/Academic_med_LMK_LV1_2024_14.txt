Title: The Interplay between Orthorexia Nervosa, Psychological Distress, Mindful Eating, and Academic Self-Efficacy among Lebanese University Female Students: A Mediation Analysis

Abstract:

Orthorexia nervosa, characterized by an excessive preoccupation with healthy eating, has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential impact on both physical and mental health. This study investigates the mediating roles of psychological distress and mindful eating in the relationship between orthorexia nervosa and academic self-efficacy among a sample of Lebanese university female students. A cross-sectional design was employed, with data collected from 350 female students via self-report questionnaires assessing orthorexia nervosa, psychological distress, mindful eating, and academic self-efficacy. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the hypothesized mediation model. Results revealed a significant positive association between orthorexia nervosa and psychological distress, and a negative association between orthorexia nervosa and both mindful eating and academic self-efficacy. Furthermore, psychological distress was found to mediate the relationship between orthorexia nervosa and academic self-efficacy, while mindful eating also played a mediating role in this association. The findings suggest that orthorexia nervosa is not only linked to increased psychological distress but also negatively impacts academic performance through decreased mindful eating and heightened psychological distress. The study's results underscore the need for targeted interventions aimed at promoting healthy eating habits, reducing psychological distress, and enhancing mindful eating among university students, particularly females, to foster academic success. The implications of these findings for university counseling services and health promotion programs are discussed.
