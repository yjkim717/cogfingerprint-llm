**Abstract**

The pursuit of minimally invasive diagnostic biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical area of investigation. This observational cohort study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) immunoassay in detecting AD pathophysiology. Utilizing longitudinal data, we assessed the assayâ€™s performance in differentiating AD from other neurodegenerative conditions and healthy controls. Preliminary findings suggest that plasma p-tau217 demonstrates promising utility as a readily accessible biomarker, potentially enhancing early AD detection and facilitating improved patient stratification for clinical trials in 2024. Further validation within larger, diverse cohorts is warranted.
