Title: Interpreting R-squared Values in Clinical Medicine: A Narrative Review of Regression Models Across Medical Disciplines

Abstract:

The interpretation of R-squared values in regression models is crucial in clinical medicine, as it informs the proportion of variance in outcome variables explained by predictor variables. However, the threshold for a meaningful R-squared value remains context-dependent and discipline-specific. This narrative review synthesises findings from 30 studies across diverse medical disciplines to elucidate the significance of R-squared values in clinical contexts. Our analysis reveals considerable variability in R-squared values, ranging from 0.2 to 0.8, with corresponding coefficients of variance indicating differing levels of explanatory power. By examining the clinical context and study design of the reviewed studies, we provide a framework for interpreting R-squared values in clinical medicine. Our results underscore the need for nuanced understanding of statistical measures in clinical research, facilitating more informed decision-making in 2024 and beyond. This review contributes to the ongoing discourse on statistical interpretation in clinical medicine, enhancing the validity and applicability of regression models.
