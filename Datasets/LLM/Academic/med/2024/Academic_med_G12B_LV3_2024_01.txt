**Abstract**

The pervasive application of regression models in clinical research and practice necessitates a critical re-evaluation of the conventional interpretation of R-squared (R²) as a measure of model fit. While statistical significance often dominates reporting, this narrative review argues that a solely quantitative assessment of R² can be misleading within the complex landscape of clinical medicine. We contend that the clinical relevance of R² values is profoundly context-dependent, influenced by factors such as the prevalence of the outcome, the inherent variability of biological systems, and the clinical utility of the prediction itself.  Traditionally, R² values below 0.20 have been deemed practically insignificant; however, this threshold fails to account for scenarios where even modest predictive power can substantially impact patient management and outcomes.  Drawing upon examples from diverse clinical domains, we propose that an R² value exceeding 15% warrants careful consideration and further investigation into the clinical implications, particularly when coupled with robust validation and integration of expert clinical judgment.  Furthermore, we advocate for a shift in focus from achieving high R² values to evaluating the incremental value of predictive models alongside existing clinical decision-making processes.  This necessitates a more nuanced approach, emphasizing the balance between statistical rigor and the pragmatic needs of clinical practice, ultimately promoting the responsible and effective implementation of regression-based tools in 2024 and beyond.
