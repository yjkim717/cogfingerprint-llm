Title: Advancements in the Management of IDH-Mutant Gliomas: Integrating IDH Inhibitors and Extent of Resection into Treatment Paradigms

Abstract:

The evolving understanding of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas has significantly impacted their classification and treatment. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics have underscored the prognostic importance of IDH mutation status, distinguishing these tumors from their IDH-wildtype counterparts. The introduction of targeted therapies, such as the IDH inhibitors vorasidenib and ivosidenib, has expanded the therapeutic arsenal against IDH-mutant gliomas. Emerging evidence suggests that the extent of resection (EOR) remains a critical determinant of overall survival in these patients. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the interplay between tumor grade, IDH mutation status, and EOR in informing treatment decisions. We discuss the integration of IDH inhibitors into the management of IDH-mutant gliomas, highlighting their potential to improve outcomes. A nuanced understanding of these factors is essential for optimizing personalized treatment strategies in the era of precision neuro-oncology. As the therapeutic landscape continues to evolve in 2024, ongoing research is poised to further refine the role of IDH inhibitors and surgical interventions in IDH-mutant glioma management.
