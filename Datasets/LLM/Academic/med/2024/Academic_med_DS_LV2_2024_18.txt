This 2024 review synthesizes the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for the systemic management of nonmetastatic breast cancer. It critically examines the evidence-based recommendations for cytotoxic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted biologic agents, stratified by disease stage and biomarker profiles. The analysis underscores the imperative of a multidisciplinary approach, integrating medical oncology, surgery, and radiation oncology, to optimize therapeutic sequencing and patient outcomes. Adherence to these evolving, personalized protocols is posited as fundamental for enhancing disease-free survival and quality of life within contemporary clinical practice.
