**Abstract**

Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a critical challenge. This study evaluated the diagnostic utility of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) immunoassay for detecting AD-related pathophysiology. Utilizing data from three independent cohorts, we assessed the assay’s accuracy in differentiating AD from other neurological conditions. Results demonstrate robust performance characteristics, exhibiting high sensitivity and specificity in identifying AD pathology. These findings support the potential of plasma p-tau217 as a minimally invasive, readily accessible biomarker for AD diagnosis and as a valuable tool for stratifying individuals at risk. Further validation within larger, diverse populations is warranted to confirm these promising results.



I aimed for precision, appropriate terminology (immunoassay, sensitivity, specificity, biomarker), and a structured argument outlining the problem, the study's approach, and the potential implications.
