This 2024 systematic review evaluates the integration of mutational profiling into first-line systemic therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We analyze recent clinical trial data to refine NCCN-aligned treatment algorithms, emphasizing RAS/RAF status and emerging biomarkers like HER2 and NTRK. Our findings demonstrate that biomarker-driven therapy selection significantly improves progression-free survival compared to conventional chemotherapy regimens. The proposed framework enables personalized sequencing of biologic agents and cytotoxic regimens based on dynamic molecular assessment, underscoring the necessity of comprehensive genomic profiling in initial mCRC management to optimize therapeutic efficacy and patient outcomes.
