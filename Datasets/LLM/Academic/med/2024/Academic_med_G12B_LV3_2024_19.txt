**Abstract**

The management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains a complex clinical challenge, necessitating evidence-based therapeutic strategies. This review synthesizes current approaches to systemic therapy for mCRC, as outlined in the 2024 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The guidelines emphasize a personalized treatment paradigm, integrating therapeutic goals—curative intent versus palliative care—with considerations of prior treatment history, genomic landscape, and patient-specific comorbidities. Key therapeutic modalities include fluoropyrimidine-based regimens, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, targeted therapies (e.g., anti-EGFR antibodies, anti-VEGF agents), and increasingly, immunotherapy for mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors. Furthermore, the document highlights the importance of proactive management of drug-induced toxicities to optimize treatment adherence and quality of life. This review underscores the dynamic evolution of mCRC systemic therapy and the crucial role of NCCN guidelines in informing clinical decision-making.
