**Abstract**

The escalating incidence of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) necessitates refined therapeutic strategies. This study synthesizes current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines regarding systemic therapy approaches for mCRC, emphasizing the integration of comprehensive mutational profiling. Prior treatment history is explicitly acknowledged as a critical determinant influencing treatment selection.  NCCN recommendations prioritize regimens incorporating fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRINOX) for patients with favorable performance status, while alternative regimens, such as capecitabine-based therapies, are considered for those with reduced tolerance.  Crucially, emerging evidence underscores the predictive value of tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status in guiding immunotherapy incorporation.  This review highlights the evolving role of personalized medicine – specifically, utilizing mutational profiles – to optimize systemic therapy efficacy and improve patient outcomes within the context of NCCN-directed care in 2024.
