Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract based on the provided summary, written from the perspective of a university researcher in 2024, aiming for precision, structured reasoning, and appropriate terminology.  I've also included a few potential variations in phrasing to allow for slight adjustments based on specific journal requirements.  Following the abstract, I've included notes on the choices made and potential areas for expansion if more information were available.

**Abstract**

**Longitudinal Comparison of Bariatric Surgery versus Medical and Lifestyle Management in Type 2 Diabetes: A 7-12 Year Follow-Up**

**Objective:** To evaluate the long-term efficacy of bariatric surgical interventions compared to conventional medical and lifestyle management strategies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While short-term benefits of bariatric surgery on glycemic control are established, sustained outcomes over extended periods remain less comprehensively understood.

**Methods:** This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from [Specify Cohort – e.g., a national registry, a multi-center trial] encompassing patients diagnosed with T2DM who were managed either surgically (undergoing bariatric procedures, including [Specify Procedures – e.g., Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy]) or non-surgically with standard medical therapy and lifestyle modifications between [Start Year] and [End Year].  The primary outcome was change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline over a 7-12 year follow-up period. Secondary outcomes included changes in anti-diabetic medication requirements (defined as [Specific Definition – e.g., number of medications, daily dosage]), and the incidence of diabetes remission, defined as HbA1c < 6.0% without the need for pharmacological intervention. Propensity score matching was employed to mitigate potential selection bias and ensure comparability between the surgical and non-surgical groups. Statistical analyses included [Specify Statistical Tests – e.g., mixed-effects models, Cox proportional hazards regression].

**Results:**  Analysis revealed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in glycemic control within the bariatric surgery group compared to the medical/lifestyle management group (p < 0.001).  Mean HbA1c reduction was [Specify Numerical Value] in the surgical cohort versus [Specify Numerical Value] in the control cohort at the end of the follow-up period.  Furthermore, patients undergoing bariatric surgery demonstrated a substantial decrease in anti-diabetic medication usage (Hazard Ratio [Specify HR] for medication reduction, p < 0.005) and a significantly higher rate of diabetes remission ( [Specify Percentage]% versus [Specify Percentage]%, p < 0.001).

**Conclusion:** These findings provide robust evidence that bariatric surgery offers superior long-term glycemic control, reduced reliance on pharmacological interventions, and improved rates of diabetes remission compared to conventional medical and lifestyle management in patients with T2DM over a 7-12 year timeframe.  Further research is warranted to investigate the optimal surgical approach and identify patient characteristics that maximize benefits and minimize potential long-term complications.
