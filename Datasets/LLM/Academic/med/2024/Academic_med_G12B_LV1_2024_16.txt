## Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 217 as a Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology: A Multi-Cohort Observational Study

**Abstract:**

The early and accurate detection of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) pathophysiology is critical for therapeutic intervention. This study investigates the utility of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) immunoassay as a biomarker reflecting underlying AD pathology across diverse observational cohorts. Utilizing data from three independent cohorts (n=[Insert Sample Size Here]), we assessed the assay's performance in relation to established AD biomarkers, clinical dementia diagnosis, and longitudinal cognitive decline. Preliminary findings demonstrate a strong correlation between elevated plasma p-tau217 levels and both amyloid burden and tau accumulation, as evidenced by [mention specific imaging or CSF biomarkers]. These results suggest that this immunoassay holds significant promise for facilitating early AD detection and monitoring disease progression, potentially enabling more effective clinical trial recruitment and personalized therapeutic strategies. Further validation in larger, longitudinal cohorts is warranted.
