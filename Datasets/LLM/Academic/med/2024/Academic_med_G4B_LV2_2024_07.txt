**Abstract**

The evolving landscape of treatment for IDH-mutant gliomas necessitates a refined approach to risk stratification, particularly in light of the clinical availability of IDH inhibitor therapies. This study examines the integration of traditional prognostic factors with contemporary radiological assessments to optimize treatment decisions for this patient population. Specifically, we analyze the predictive value of tumor grade, patient age, and surgical resection extent, alongside key radiological features, in determining efficacy and survival outcomes.  Historically, treatment strategies were largely dictated by tumor grade alone; however, the advent of IDH inhibitors has introduced a layer of complexity. 

Our analysis posits that a comprehensive evaluation incorporating these variables – particularly in conjunction with advanced imaging – will improve the precision of risk stratification.  This multifaceted approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of individual patient prognosis, informing tailored treatment plans that maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing unnecessary toxicity. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and establish standardized protocols for integrating these data points into clinical practice, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes in the management of IDH-mutant gliomas by 2024.
