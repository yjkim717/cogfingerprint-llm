**Title:** Implementation and Impact of the 2024 ASCO-SSO Guideline Update on Universal Germline *BRCA1/2* Testing in High-Risk Breast Cancer Cohorts

**Abstract**

The integration of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy into the standard of care for metastatic breast cancer patients with germline *BRCA1/2* pathogenic variants has fundamentally reshaped the clinical utility of genetic testing. This paradigm shift necessitates a re-evaluation of testing criteria to ensure equitable access to targeted therapies. This article reviews the evidence underpinning the 2024 update to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) guideline, which advocates for a significant expansion of germline genetic assessment. The updated recommendation moves beyond traditional, restrictive family history-based models to endorse universal *BRCA1/2* testing for all patients diagnosed with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and, critically, for specific cohorts of breast cancer patients. For breast cancer, this includes individuals diagnosed under the age of 50, those with a personal history of triple-negative disease, and any patient with metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer being considered for PARP inhibitor therapy. The guideline underscores that the identification of a germline *BRCA1/2* mutation is no longer solely a risk-assessment tool for relatives but a direct determinant of systemic treatment options, thereby constituting a predictive biomarker. Concurrently, the guideline strongly emphasizes the indispensable role of pre- and post-test genetic counseling by qualified professionals. This ensures informed consent, accurate interpretation of complex results—including variants of uncertain significance—and facilitates cascade testing for at-risk family members. The systematic implementation of this expanded testing framework is poised to optimize therapeutic precision, improve survival outcomes, and advance the principles of personalized oncology in 2024 and beyond.
