## Abstract: Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 217 as a Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease: A Multi-Cohort Observational Study

**Background:** Accurate and accessible biomarkers are crucial for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression. Phosphorylated tau (p-tau) isoforms, particularly p-tau217, have emerged as promising candidates. This study investigates the diagnostic utility of a novel plasma p-tau217 immunoassay across multiple independent observational cohorts. **Methods:** We analyzed plasma samples from participants within three existing cohorts, utilizing a validated p-tau217 immunoassay. Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), were calculated to assess the assayâ€™s ability to discriminate between individuals with and without AD pathology. **Results & Conclusion:** Preliminary findings demonstrate robust discriminatory power of the p-tau217 immunoassay, suggesting its potential as a valuable tool for AD diagnosis and clinical trial recruitment in 2024. Further validation within larger and more diverse populations is warranted.
