Title: Leveraging Mendelian Randomization to Elucidate Causal Relationships in Neurological Disorders: Opportunities and Challenges in the Genomic Era

Abstract:
The integration of genetic data into neurological research has revolutionized our understanding of disease etiology. Mendelian randomization (MR), a paradigm that exploits genetic variants as instrumental variables, has emerged as a powerful tool for making causal inferences. By leveraging genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, MR analyses can dissect the causal relationships between modifiable risk factors and neurological outcomes. This approach has far-reaching implications for identifying novel therapeutic targets and informing evidence-based medicine. However, MR is not without its limitations; issues such as pleiotropy, linkage disequilibrium, and population stratification can compromise the validity of causal estimates. As we continue to navigate the complexities of MR in 2024, it is essential to acknowledge both the opportunities and challenges presented by this methodology, refining our understanding of the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in neurological disorders.
