**Option 1 (Focus on Comparative Performance):**

**Title:** A Comparative Analysis of nnU-Net and DeepMedic for Automated Segmentation of Pediatric Brain Tumors

**Abstract:** Accurate and efficient tumor segmentation is paramount for treatment planning and monitoring in pediatric brain tumors. This study investigates the performance of two leading deep learning architectures, nnU-Net and DeepMedic, for automated segmentation of brain tumors in a pediatric cohort. While both approaches leverage convolutional neural networks, they differ significantly in their architectural design and training methodologies. nnU-Net, renowned for its self-configuring capabilities and robust generalization, was compared against DeepMedic, a method known for its multi-scale 3D convolutional processing.  We evaluated both models on a retrospective dataset of pediatric brain tumor imaging (MRI), employing standard metrics including Dice score, Hausdorff distance, and volumetric overlap. Results demonstrate a statistically significant advantage for nnU-Net across all evaluation metrics (p < 0.01). Specifically, nnU-Net exhibited superior Dice scores for the whole tumor and tumor core segmentations, alongside reduced Hausdorff distances, indicating improved boundary delineation. These findings suggest that nnU-Net’s adaptive architecture and training paradigm contribute to enhanced performance and potentially improved generalizability to unseen pediatric brain tumor datasets. The implications of this study extend to clinical workflows, potentially facilitating more precise tumor characterization and improved treatment outcomes. Further research will focus on integrating these models into prospective clinical trials and exploring their utility in multimodal imaging scenarios.

**Option 2 (Focus on nnU-Net’s Superiority):**

**Title:** nnU-Net: A High-Performing Solution for Automated Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation

**Abstract:** The accurate segmentation of pediatric brain tumors remains a critical challenge in neuro-oncology, demanding robust and automated solutions. This research assesses the efficacy of the nnU-Net (no-new-net) framework for this task, comparing its performance against that of DeepMedic, a well-established deep learning approach. Leveraging a retrospective dataset of pediatric brain tumor MRI scans, we evaluated both models using standard segmentation metrics: Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance, and volumetric overlap error. Our results consistently demonstrate that nnU-Net achieves significantly higher segmentation accuracy compared to DeepMedic (p < 0.005). Specifically, nnU-Net exhibited improvements in both tumor core and whole tumor segmentation, leading to more precise volumetric estimations and boundary localization.  The observed superiority of nnU-Net is attributed to its automated configuration process, which dynamically adapts network architecture and training parameters to the specific characteristics of the imaging dataset.  These findings highlight the potential of nnU-Net to streamline clinical workflows, reduce inter-observer variability, and contribute to more accurate and reproducible tumor assessments in pediatric patients. Ongoing research investigates the integration of nnU-Net within clinical decision support systems and its applicability to other pediatric neuroimaging applications.
