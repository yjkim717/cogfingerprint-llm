In 2024, the management paradigm for IDH-mutant gliomas is undergoing a significant transformation, driven by refined risk stratification and the advent of targeted molecular therapies. Contemporary WHO classifications and pivotal clinical trial data now enable more precise prognostication, distinguishing indolent from aggressive tumor behaviors. This enhanced stratification directly informs therapeutic sequencing, supporting a strategic delay in conventional interventions such as radiotherapy and alkylating chemotherapy. The central rationale is to mitigate the substantial neurocognitive sequelae associated with these modalities, thereby prioritizing patients' long-term quality of survival. The INDIGO trial results have been particularly influential, demonstrating the efficacy of vorasidenib, a dual inhibitor of mutant IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes, in prolonging progression-free survival. Consequently, the emerging standard of care advocates for the initial use of targeted inhibitors like vorasidenib in eligible patients, effectively postponing more toxic treatments until clinical or radiological progression necessitates escalation. This paradigm shift underscores a broader movement in neuro-oncology towards molecularly-guided, patient-centric treatment algorithms that balance oncological control with functional preservation.
