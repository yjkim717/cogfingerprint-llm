Of note, the application of Mendelian randomization (MR) has substantially advanced the interrogation of causal pathways in neurological disorders. Leveraging large-scale genome-wide association studies, this methodology employs genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer causality, thereby mitigating confounding and reverse causation inherent to observational epidemiology. In 2024, MR analyses are increasingly pivotal for resolving long-standing etiological controversies, such as the role of lipid fractions in Parkinson's disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, this approach systematically elucidates disease mechanisms by nominating intermediate molecular phenotypes, including proteomic and metabolomic traits. A critical translational output is the triangulation of evidence for drug repurposing, where genetic support for a drug target's causal role in a specific neurological outcome directly informs clinical trial design. Consequently, MR serves as a powerful framework for de-risking therapeutic development and prioritizing novel interventions for complex neurological conditions.
