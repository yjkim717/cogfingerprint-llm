**Abstract**

The burgeoning availability of large-scale genetic data has revolutionized biomedical research, prompting increased utilization of Mendelian randomization (MR) as a powerful tool for causal inference in observational epidemiology. This review critically examines the application of MR within the field of neurology, a domain characterized by complex etiologies and significant unmet clinical needs. We detail the fundamental principles of MR, leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of modifiable risk factors on neurological outcomes, including stroke, dementia, and neurodegenerative diseases. The review showcases diverse MR applications, illustrating its utility in elucidating disease pathophysiology by identifying key biological pathways and potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, we address the inherent challenges and limitations of MR analyses in neurology, such as pleiotropy, genetic heterogeneity, and the potential for confounding by allele frequencies.  The expanding landscape of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and multi-omics data integration presents both opportunities and complexities for MR implementation. We conclude by highlighting future directions, emphasizing the need for robust analytical methodologies, refined MR designs (e.g., MR-XL, Steiger filtering), and careful consideration of biological context to maximize the validity and translational potential of MR studies in advancing neurological healthcare in 2024 and beyond.
