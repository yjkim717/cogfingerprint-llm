**Title:** Refining the Implementation of Germline *BRCA1/2* Testing in Breast Cancer Management: A 2024 Perspective on ASCO-SSO Guideline Integration

**Abstract**

The integration of germline genetic testing for pathogenic variants in the *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* genes has become a cornerstone of personalized oncology for breast cancer patients. Current guidelines, notably those from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO), provide a critical framework for identifying individuals who stand to benefit most from this testing. This review synthesizes the contemporary application of these guidelines, emphasizing a dual-strategy rationale that informs both therapeutic decision-making and hereditary cancer risk assessment. A primary driver for testing is the eligibility for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy, a class of targeted agents demonstrating significant efficacy in patients with *BRCA*-associated tumors. Identifying a germline pathogenic variant directly enables the deployment of these precision medicines, improving progression-free survival in the metastatic setting. Concurrently, established clinical criteria—including early age of onset, specific tumor histopathology (e.g., triple-negative breast cancer), and a significant family history of breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate cancer—remain indispensable for identifying individuals with a high pre-test probability of a hereditary cancer syndrome. The identification of a pathogenic variant through comprehensive genetic testing, followed by expert post-test genetic counseling, facilitates cascade testing of at-risk relatives and enables enhanced, evidence-based cancer surveillance and risk-reduction strategies for the proband. This article contends that the optimal model of care in 2024 involves the seamless integration of these two paradigms: utilizing testing to unlock targeted therapeutic options while simultaneously fulfilling the essential public health goal of primary cancer prevention. We conclude that adherence to and nuanced interpretation of these guidelines are imperative for maximizing both therapeutic outcomes and long-term cancer risk management.
