**Title:** Refining Hereditary Cancer Risk Assessment: An Analysis of the 2024 ASCO-SSO Guideline Update on Germline *BRCA1/2* Testing in Breast Cancer Patients

**Background:** The integration of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy into the standard of care for metastatic breast cancer has fundamentally altered the clinical utility of germline mutation testing. Identifying pathogenic variants in the *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* cancer susceptibility genes is no longer solely a tool for risk assessment but a critical determinant of therapeutic eligibility and efficacy. This paradigm shift necessitates updated, evidence-based guidelines to streamline testing criteria and ensure equitable access to targeted treatments.

**Objective:** To synthesize and critically evaluate the 2024 updated consensus guideline from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) on indications for germline *BRCA1/2* testing in individuals diagnosed with breast cancer.

**Methods:** This analysis examines the structured framework of the ASCO-SSO recommendations, which are predicated on a systematic review of contemporary evidence. The guideline development process incorporated data from randomized clinical trials on PARP inhibitor outcomes, large-scale genomic sequencing studies, and cost-effectiveness analyses.

**Results:** The 2024 guideline establishes a tripartite indication for testing, moving beyond family history alone. Key criteria now include: 1) a diagnosis at a young age (e.g., ≤45 years), 2) a significant personal or family history suggestive of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, and 3) a new, pivotal criterion—eligibility for PARP inhibitor therapy in the metastatic setting, irrespective of family history. The guideline underscores the indispensability of pre- and post-test genetic counseling by a qualified professional to facilitate informed consent, accurate interpretation of variants of uncertain significance, and communication of results to at-risk relatives.

**Conclusion:** The updated ASCO-SSO guideline represents a significant advancement in precision oncology, formally linking diagnostic genetic testing directly to therapeutic decision-making. By expanding testing criteria to include all patients for whom a positive result would inform the use of PARP inhibition, it promotes a more personalized and therapeutically actionable approach to hereditary cancer risk management.
