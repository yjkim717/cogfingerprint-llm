“Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a critical challenge. This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 immunoassay within a single-center cohort. Results demonstrate the assay’s potential as a non-invasive biomarker, exhibiting promising sensitivity and specificity in identifying individuals with evidence of AD pathophysiology. Further validation across diverse populations is warranted to establish its clinical utility.”
