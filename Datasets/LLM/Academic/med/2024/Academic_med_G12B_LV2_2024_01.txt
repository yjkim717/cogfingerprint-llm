**Abstract**

The interpretation of R-squared, the coefficient of determination, within clinical research and practice remains a source of frequent misunderstanding. While widely employed in regression models to quantify the proportion of variance in an outcome variable explained by predictor variables, its clinical significance is often oversimplified or misconstrued. This review critically examines the challenges inherent in interpreting R-squared values in the context of clinical medicine, acknowledging the inherent complexities of biological systems and the limitations of observational data.  Specifically, we address the tendency to treat R-squared as a definitive measure of model validity or clinical utility, failing to adequately consider factors such as sample size, the inclusion of irrelevant predictors (inflating R-squared without enhancing predictive power), and the presence of unmeasured confounders.  We argue that a rigid application of arbitrary thresholds, such as a universal expectation of R-squared ≥ 0.15 (15%), lacks scientific rigor and can lead to misleading conclusions regarding the clinical relevance of regression models. Instead, interpretation should be grounded in a thorough understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms, the clinical importance of the predicted outcome, and a consideration of alternative modeling approaches. We advocate for a nuanced approach that emphasizes the integration of R-squared with other model evaluation metrics, alongside clinical judgment and a careful assessment of the model’s potential impact on patient care and decision-making. Future research should prioritize the development of clinically-informed guidelines for R-squared interpretation, emphasizing its role within a broader framework of model validation and clinical utility assessment.
