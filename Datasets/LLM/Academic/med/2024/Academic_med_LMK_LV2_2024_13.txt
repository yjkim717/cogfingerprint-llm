Title: Evaluating the Safety of Post-Consumer PET Recycling for Food Contact Materials: An Updated EFSA Guidance

Abstract:

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has released an updated guidance document for assessing the decontamination efficiency of post-consumer mechanical polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling processes intended for food contact materials. This guidance is crucial in ensuring the safety of recycled PET for use in packaging food products, thereby mitigating potential toxicological concerns. The updated guidance provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the ability of PET recycling processes to remove contaminants from post-consumer PET waste, thus ensuring compliance with food safety regulations.

The EFSA guidance outlines a series of steps to be followed in the evaluation process, including the identification of potential contaminants, the assessment of decontamination efficiency, and the characterization of the recycled PET material. The guidance also emphasizes the importance of applying a conservative approach when evaluating the safety of recycled PET, taking into account the potential for variability in the recycling process and the limitations of the available data.

By providing a standardized framework for evaluating the safety of post-consumer PET recycling processes, the updated EFSA guidance is expected to enhance the consistency and reliability of risk assessments conducted by PET recycling operators and regulatory authorities. This, in turn, is likely to promote the use of recycled PET in food contact materials, contributing to a more circular economy while maintaining a high level of protection for public health. The present review aims to summarize the key aspects of the updated EFSA guidance and discuss its implications for the PET recycling industry and food safety regulation in 2024.
