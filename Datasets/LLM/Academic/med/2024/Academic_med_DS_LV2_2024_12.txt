**Comparative Long-Term Efficacy of Bariatric Surgery versus Medical Management for Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis**

**Abstract**

**Background:** The global pandemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D) necessitates the exploration of durable therapeutic strategies beyond conventional medical and lifestyle interventions. While bariatric surgery has emerged as a potent intervention for severe obesity, its long-term efficacy as a primary treatment for T2D, particularly in comparison to intensive medical management (IMM), remains a critical area of clinical investigation. This study synthesizes the extant evidence to evaluate the comparative long-term outcomes of these divergent therapeutic pathways.

**Objective:** To systematically assess and compare the long-term (7-12 years) efficacy of bariatric surgery versus IMM in achieving and sustaining glycemic control and diabetes remission in patients with T2D.

**Methods:** We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies with extended follow-up (minimum 7 years). Databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central were queried from inception through January 2024. Primary outcomes were mean HbA1c reduction and diabetes remission rates, defined as HbA1c <6.5% without active pharmacologic therapy. Secondary outcomes included changes in cardiovascular risk factors, medication burden, and incidence of microvascular complications. Data were pooled using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity was assessed with the IÂ² statistic.

**Results:** Analysis of data from 8 studies encompassing over 2,100 patient-years of follow-up demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically superior effect of bariatric surgery. The surgical cohort exhibited a mean HbA1c reduction of -1.8% (95% CI: -2.1 to -1.5) compared to -0.5% (95% CI: -0.7 to -0.3) in the medical management group (p<0.001). Crucially, the diabetes remission rate was substantially higher in the surgical group, with a pooled risk ratio of 4.8 (95% CI: 3.2 to 7.1) at the 7-year mark, indicating a nearly five-fold greater likelihood of remission. This metabolic superiority was sustained across the 12-year follow-up period in available studies. Furthermore, the surgical intervention cohort demonstrated significant improvements in secondary outcomes, including a greater reduction in antihyperglycemic and antihypertensive medication requirements.

**Conclusion:** In patients with T2D, bariatric surgery confers a profound and durable advantage over intensive medical and lifestyle management in achieving sustained glycemic control and diabetes remission over 7 to 12 years. These findings underscore the role of metabolic surgery not merely as an anti-obesity intervention but as a cornerstone therapy for altering the natural history of T2D. The long-term data advocate for a re-evaluation of clinical guidelines to facilitate broader access to surgical intervention for appropriate candidates, with a focus on long-term disease modification and potential mitigation of diabetic sequelae.
