**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of breast cancer necessitates refined approaches to patient management. Current ASCO-SSO guidelines advocate for germline mutation testing, particularly focusing on *BRCA1* and *BRCA2*, within the cohort of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients. This proactive genetic assessment serves a multifaceted purpose, extending beyond immediate treatment selection to encompass comprehensive risk stratification and individualized genetic counseling.  Early identification of pathogenic variants allows for tailored preventative strategies, including prophylactic surgery and enhanced surveillance protocols.  Furthermore, germline testing informs family cascade analysis, potentially identifying at-risk relatives and facilitating proactive screening.  Despite growing acceptance, challenges remain regarding equitable access and standardized interpretation of results.  Future research should prioritize optimizing testing algorithms, addressing ethical considerations surrounding incidental findings, and developing robust educational programs to disseminate knowledge and facilitate informed decision-making within the field of cancer genetics.
