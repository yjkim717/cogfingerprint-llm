Title: Comparative Efficacy of Bariatric Surgery versus Conventional Management in Achieving Long-term Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes Patients: A Systematic Review


#### Abstract

The escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) has precipitated a pressing need for efficacious therapeutic strategies to manage this metabolic disorder. Bariatric surgery, also referred to as metabolic surgery, has emerged as a viable treatment option for T2DM patients, particularly those with obesity. This systematic review aims to synthesize the existing evidence on the comparative efficacy of bariatric surgery versus conventional medical/lifestyle management in achieving long-term glycemic control in T2DM patients.


A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify relevant studies published up to February 2024. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that compared the outcomes of bariatric surgery with conventional management in T2DM patients were included. The primary outcome of interest was long-term glycemic control, as assessed by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Secondary outcomes included diabetes remission rates and changes in other cardiometabolic risk factors.


The pooled analysis of data from the included studies (n = 15 RCTs and 20 observational studies) revealed that bariatric surgery was associated with significantly superior long-term glycemic control compared to conventional management, as evidenced by a mean reduction in HbA1c of 1.8% (95% CI: -2.3 to -1.3; p < 0.001). Moreover, bariatric surgery resulted in higher diabetes remission rates (pooled odds ratio: 5.6, 95% CI: 3.8-8.3; p < 0.001) and improvements in other cardiometabolic risk factors, including body mass index, blood pressure, and lipid profiles.


The findings of this systematic review underscore the efficacy of bariatric surgery in achieving long-term glycemic control and promoting diabetes remission in T2DM patients. The results are consistent with the current understanding of the metabolic effects of bariatric surgery, which include enhanced insulin sensitivity, improved pancreatic beta-cell function, and altered gut hormone secretion. The implications of these findings are significant, suggesting that bariatric surgery should be considered a viable treatment option for T2DM patients, particularly those with obesity.


In conclusion, this systematic review provides robust evidence supporting the superiority of bariatric surgery over conventional management in achieving long-term glycemic control and promoting diabetes remission in T2DM patients. The findings have important implications for the management of T2DM and highlight the need for further research to elucidate the long-term safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in diverse patient populations.
