Title: Evolving Paradigms in IDH-Mutant Glioma Management: Integrating Molecular Insights into Personalized Treatment Strategies

Abstract:
The therapeutic landscape for IDH-mutant gliomas has undergone significant transformation with the advent of IDH inhibitors, notably vorasidenib, which have shown promise in clinical trials. As of 2024, treatment guidelines are being reevaluated to incorporate molecular and clinical risk stratification, enabling more precise and personalized treatment decisions. The integration of IDH mutation status into diagnostic and prognostic frameworks has refined patient categorization, facilitating targeted therapeutic interventions. Emerging evidence supports the efficacy of IDH inhibitors in improving outcomes for patients with IDH-mutant gliomas. Consequently, a paradigm shift towards molecularly informed treatment strategies is underway, with ongoing research aimed at optimizing combination regimens and identifying predictive biomarkers. This review synthesizes current evidence and discusses the implications of IDH inhibitors for future treatment guidelines, highlighting the potential for enhanced patient outcomes through tailored therapeutic approaches.
