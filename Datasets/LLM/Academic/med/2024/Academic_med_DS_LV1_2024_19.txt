This 2024 review synthesizes current evidence-based systemic treatment strategies for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We delineate therapeutic algorithms aligned with patient-specific factors, including performance status, prior treatment exposure, and comprehensive tumor molecular profiling (e.g., RAS, BRAF, MSI status). The analysis underscores the paradigm of tailoring first-line and subsequent therapies according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, emphasizing the critical role of biomarker-driven decision-making to optimize clinical outcomes and navigate the expanding therapeutic landscape for mCRC.
