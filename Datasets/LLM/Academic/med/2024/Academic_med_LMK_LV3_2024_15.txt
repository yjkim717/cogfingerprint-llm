Title: Reevaluating R-squared Values in Clinical Medicine: Contextualizing Statistical Interpretation

Abstract:

The R-squared value, a ubiquitous metric in regression analysis, is often misinterpreted in clinical medicine due to oversimplification. As of 2024, research underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of R-squared values, considering the complexity of the phenomenon being studied and the research context. The coefficient of variance, a related statistical measure, further complicates interpretation, as high variability can lead to inflated R-squared values. This study critically examines the role of R-squared values in regression models used in clinical medicine, highlighting the importance of contextualizing statistical interpretation. By reevaluating R-squared values through the lens of research complexity and phenomenon variability, clinicians and researchers can develop a more accurate understanding of the relationships between variables, ultimately informing more effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. This nuanced approach to statistical interpretation has significant implications for the field of clinical medicine.
