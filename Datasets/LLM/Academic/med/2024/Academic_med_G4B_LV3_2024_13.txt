**Abstract**

Recent advancements in post-consumer polymer recycling necessitate rigorous evaluation of potential human health impacts, particularly concerning food contact materials. This study examines the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding pet recycling of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) – informed by updated guidance from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).  Specifically, we address the critical role of decontamination efficacy in mitigating toxicological concerns associated with recycled PET intended for food applications. Current risk assessment methodologies increasingly rely on conservative migration modeling, acknowledging the potential for residual contaminants to transfer into food.  Further investigation is warranted to standardize decontamination protocols and establish quantitative thresholds for acceptable residue levels.  Failure to adequately address these factors could compromise consumer safety and necessitate a re-evaluation of existing food contact material regulations, demanding proactive strategies to ensure polymer recycling aligns with established public health standards by 2026.
