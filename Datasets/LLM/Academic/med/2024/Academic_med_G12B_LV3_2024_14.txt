**Abstract**

Emerging research highlights the increasing prevalence of orthorexia nervosa (ON) and its potential impact on psychosocial well-being. This study, conducted in 2024, examines the complex interplay between orthorexia nervosa, psychological distress, mindful eating, and academic self-efficacy among Lebanese female university students. Utilizing a quantitative, cross-sectional design, we investigated the mediating roles of psychological distress and mindful eating behaviors in the relationship between ON and academic self-efficacy. Findings reveal that psychological distress functions as a complete mediator, fully explaining the association between orthorexia nervosa and diminished academic self-efficacy. Furthermore, focused eating demonstrated a partial mediating effect, suggesting a nuanced relationship where mindful engagement with food partially buffers the negative impact of ON on academic performance. These results underscore the importance of integrated interventions addressing psychological distress and promoting mindful eating strategies to support the academic success and mental health of young women in this population.
