**Abstract: The Nuanced Interpretation of R-squared in Clinical Decision-Making: Bridging Statistical Significance and Clinical Relevance**

**Background:** The coefficient of determination, R-squared, remains a ubiquitous metric in regression models employed within clinical research, particularly when analyzing data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). While traditionally interpreted as the proportion of variance explained by a model, its application in clinical medicine demands a more sophisticated understanding that extends beyond mere statistical significance. Oversimplified reliance on R-squared can lead to misinterpretations regarding the clinical utility and impact of interventions, potentially hindering evidence-based decision-making.

**Objective:** This study critically examines the contextual interpretation of R-squared in clinical settings, arguing for a shift towards incorporating measures of effect size, clinical relevance, and the coefficient of variance (CV) alongside R-squared values.  We explore scenarios where a statistically significant, yet modest, R-squared may not translate to clinically meaningful change, and conversely, situations where smaller R-squared values can still indicate substantial practical impact.

**Methods:** We conducted a systematic review of literature examining the use of regression models in various clinical disciplines, focusing on studies utilizing RCT data.  We analyzed the reporting practices regarding R-squared and its relationship to other measures of model fit and clinical outcomes.  Furthermore, we propose a framework for incorporating CV to assess the stability and generalizability of regression coefficients, particularly in datasets with high variability.

**Results & Conclusion:** Our findings highlight the importance of considering the clinical context and underlying biological plausibility when interpreting R-squared.  A sole focus on R-squared can be misleading; therefore, we advocate for a multifaceted approach that integrates effect sizes, confidence intervals, and measures of variability like the CV.  This nuanced interpretation is crucial for translating statistical findings into informed clinical practice and avoiding potentially detrimental over- or under-estimation of intervention effects.  Future research should prioritize the development of standardized reporting guidelines that emphasize a comprehensive evaluation of regression model performance.
