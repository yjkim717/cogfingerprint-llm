Title: Enhancing Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation: Insights from the BraTS-PEDs Challenge

Abstract:

Accurate segmentation of pediatric brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for effective neuro-oncological management. The BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge provided a collaborative platform for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for volumetric segmentation of pediatric brain tumors. Building upon this initiative, our study aims to further advance the field by investigating the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures on a multicenter dataset of pediatric brain MRI scans. We evaluated the segmentation accuracy of various AI models using metrics such as Dice score and Hausdorff distance. Our results demonstrate the potential of AI-driven approaches for improving tumor segmentation accuracy, with implications for enhancing clinical decision-making and patient outcomes. This study contributes to the ongoing development of robust and generalizable AI solutions for pediatric neuro-oncology, with potential applications in future clinical trials and routine practice.
