**The Interplay of Orthorexia, Psychological Distress, and Academic Performance in Lebanese University Women**

This study explored the complex relationship between orthorexia nervosa and academic self-efficacy within a cohort of Lebanese university women. Utilizing a cross-sectional design, we hypothesized that orthorexia would be associated with heightened psychological distress and, subsequently, diminished academic self-belief. Data analysis employing mediation modeling revealed significant positive correlations between orthorexia scores and both psychological distress (p < 0.001) and negative correlations with academic self-efficacy (p < 0.01).  Mindful eating behaviors emerged as a significant mediator, demonstrating a partial mediating effect whereby orthorexia was associated with increased restrictive eating, subsequently contributing to elevated psychological distress and a reduction in perceived academic competence. These findings suggest that interventions addressing orthorexia should incorporate strategies promoting mindful eating and psychological well-being to foster improved academic outcomes. Future research should investigate longitudinal effects and explore potential demographic variations within Lebanese student populations.
