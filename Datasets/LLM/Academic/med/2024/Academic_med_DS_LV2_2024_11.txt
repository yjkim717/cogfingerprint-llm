**Abstract**

**Background:** The precise and automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a critical prerequisite for accurate diagnosis, surgical planning, radiotherapy targeting, and treatment response assessment. While deep learning models have shown significant promise in this domain, their performance can be highly dependent on architectural choices and implementation details. A rigorous comparative analysis of state-of-the-art frameworks is therefore essential to establish clinical best practices. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of two prominent convolutional neural network architectures, nnU-Net and DeepMedic, for the task of automated tumor sub-region segmentation in a pediatric cohort.

**Methods:** We curated a retrospective mpMRI dataset of pediatric patients with brain tumors, comprising T1-weighted, T1-weighted post-contrast, T2-weighted, and FLAIR sequences. Manual segmentation masks, delineating the enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor/core, and peritumoral edema, served as the ground truth. Both the nnU-Net framework, which automates network configuration and training, and the DeepMedic architecture, a dedicated 3D dual-pathway model, were trained and validated using an identical five-fold cross-validation scheme. Model performance was quantitatively evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) to assess volumetric overlap, with the Hausdorff Distance (HD95) providing a complementary measure of boundary delineation accuracy. Statistical significance was determined using paired t-tests.

**Results:** The nnU-Net framework demonstrated statistically significant superiority (p < 0.05) over the DeepMedic model across all evaluated tumor sub-compartments. The mean DSC for the whole tumor region achieved by nnU-Net was 0.89 (±0.06), compared to 0.82 (±0.09) for DeepMedic. Similar performance gaps were observed for the tumor core (nnU-Net: 0.85 ±0.08; DeepMedic: 0.78 ±0.11) and enhancing tumor (nnU-Net: 0.81 ±0.10; DeepMedic: 0.73 ±0.13). Furthermore, nnU-Net yielded significantly lower HD95 values, indicating more precise and anatomically plausible segmentation boundaries.

**Conclusion:** Our findings robustly indicate that the nnU-Net framework, with its adaptive configuration and data-driven preprocessing, achieves superior segmentation accuracy for pediatric brain tumors compared to the DeepMedic architecture. The consistently higher Dice scores and improved boundary delineation suggest that nnU-Net's holistic pipeline optimization is particularly effective for the heterogeneous and complex presentation of pediatric neuro-oncology cases. These results position nnU-Net as a highly compelling tool for future clinical decision-support systems and large-scale radiomics research in this challenging patient population.
