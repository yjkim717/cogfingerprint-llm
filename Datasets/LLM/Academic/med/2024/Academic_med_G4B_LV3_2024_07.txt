**Abstract**

The evolving landscape of IDH-mutant gliomas demands refined therapeutic strategies. Traditional treatment approaches, reliant on patient age and residual tumor volume, are increasingly superseded by more nuanced risk stratification. This study highlights the imperative for integrating molecular profiling, radiological assessment, and clinical data to accurately predict patient outcomes. Specifically, enhanced tumor imaging – characterized by increased contrast – correlates strongly with higher tumor grade and poorer prognosis within IDH-mutant astrocytomas and glioblastomas.  Advances in IDH inhibitor therapies necessitate a shift towards identifying patients most likely to benefit, rather than solely relying on outdated volumetric criteria.  Consequently, future treatment guidelines should prioritize incorporating factors such as IDH mutation status, radiographic features, and clinical presentation to facilitate optimal surgical resection and targeted therapeutic intervention, ultimately improving patient survival rates.
