**Abstract**

The investigation of causal relationships within neurological disorders remains a significant challenge, frequently hampered by confounding factors inherent in observational studies. This review synthesizes recent advancements in utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) to address this limitation, particularly within the burgeoning field of neurology. Leveraging extensive genetic data – specifically, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) – MR allows researchers to infer causal pathways between genetic variants and neurological phenotypes.  We highlight the increasing integration of MR with complementary methods, including advanced brain imaging techniques, to elucidate the pathophysiology of complex conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and depression.  Critically, the application of MR necessitates rigorous assessment of pleiotropy, with novel statistical approaches continually being developed to mitigate bias.  This methodological evolution promises to substantially refine our understanding of biological mechanisms driving neurological disease progression, ultimately informing the development of targeted therapeutic interventions by 2024.
