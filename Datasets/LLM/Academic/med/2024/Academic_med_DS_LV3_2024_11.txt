**Title:** A Comparative Analysis of nnU-Net and DeepMedic for Automated Segmentation of Pediatric Brain Tumors on Multi-Institutional MRI Data

**Introduction:** The precise segmentation of pediatric brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical prerequisite for surgical planning, radiotherapy targeting, and treatment response assessment. However, the development of robust autosegmentation tools for this demographic is challenged by the distinct pathophysiological and anatomical characteristics of pediatric neoplasms, which differ significantly from their adult counterparts. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like DeepMedic have demonstrated efficacy in various neuro-oncological applications, their performance often degrades when confronted with the high heterogeneity and smaller lesion volumes typical in pediatric cases. The recent advent of the self-configuring nnU-Net framework, which dynamically adapts to dataset properties, presents a promising alternative. This study conducts a rigorous comparative evaluation of a pediatric-specific nnU-Net model against the established DeepMedic architecture for whole tumor and subregion segmentation.

**Methods:** We curated a multi-institutional dataset of multi-parametric MRI scans (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and post-contrast T1) from 180 pediatric patients diagnosed with a spectrum of brain tumors, including gliomas and medulloblastomas. The dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and held-out test sets, with manual segmentation masks for the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET) serving as the ground truth, delineated by expert neuroradiologists. A pediatric-specific nnU-Net model was trained from scratch, leveraging its automated preprocessing, architecture search, and postprocessing pipeline. Its performance was benchmarked against a pre-trained DeepMedic model, which was fine-tuned on our pediatric cohort. Segmentation accuracy was quantitatively evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) to assess volumetric overlap and boundary delineation, respectively. Statistical significance was determined using a paired t-test.

**Results:** The pediatric-optimized nnU-Net model demonstrated statistically significant superiority (p < 0.01) over the DeepMedic model across all segmentation tasks on the multi-institutional test set. For whole tumor segmentation, nnU-Net achieved a mean Dice score of 0.89 ± 0.06, compared to 0.81 ± 0.11 for DeepMedic. In subregion analysis, the performance gap was most pronounced for the challenging tumor core, with nnU-Net attaining a DSC of 0.85 ± 0.08 versus 0.74 ± 0.14 for DeepMedic. Furthermore, nnU-Net exhibited superior generalization and robustness, as evidenced by lower variance in DSC and HD95 metrics across different institutional scanners and protocols, indicating a reduced propensity for overfitting.

**Conclusion:** Our findings substantiate that a data-driven, pediatric-specific configuration of the nnU-Net framework significantly outperforms the DeepMedic architecture in the automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors. The nnU-Net's higher Dice scores and enhanced generalizability on heterogeneous, multi-institutional data underscore the critical importance of tailoring deep learning solutions to the unique context of pediatric neuro-oncology. This advancement holds considerable promise for improving the precision and efficiency of clinical workflows in the management of childhood brain cancers.
