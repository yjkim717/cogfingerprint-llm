**Abstract**

Accurate and automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors remains a critical challenge in neuro-oncology, demanding robust and generalizable methodologies for improved diagnosis, treatment planning, and longitudinal monitoring. This study investigates the efficacy of deep learning approaches for pediatric brain tumor segmentation, comparing the performance of the nnU-Net architecture to the established DeepMedic framework. Utilizing a novel dataset comprised of multi-institutional pediatric brain MRI scans, we demonstrate that a nnU-Net model, specifically trained and validated on pediatric-specific imaging characteristics, achieves significantly enhanced segmentation accuracy and consistency across diverse patient populations. Quantitative analysis reveals superior performance in delineating both the gross tumor volume (GTV) and sub-regional structures, including edema and enhancing tumor core, compared to DeepMedic. Furthermore, the nnU-Net exhibits improved resilience to inter-scanner variability and acquisition protocols, reflecting its robust generalization capabilities. These findings highlight the potential of nnU-Net as a valuable tool for clinical workflows in pediatric neuro-oncology, facilitating more precise volumetric assessments and ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes. Future research will focus on incorporating multi-modal imaging data and exploring the application of nnU-Net for predicting treatment response in pediatric brain tumor patients. This work contributes to the ongoing evolution of automated medical image analysis and underscores the importance of tailored deep learning solutions for pediatric populations.
