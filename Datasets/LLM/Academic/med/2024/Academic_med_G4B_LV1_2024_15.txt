**Abstract**

The utilization of regression models within clinical medicine increasingly relies on statistical measures such as R-squared to assess predictive validity. However, a simplistic interpretation of R-squared as a direct reflection of model fit can be misleading and potentially detrimental to clinical decision-making. This paper argues for a more nuanced approach, advocating that R-squared should be considered within the specific context of the clinical question and the characteristics of the patient population.  Beyond achieving high R-squared values, clinicians must evaluate the clinical relevance of predicted outcomes and acknowledge potential limitations related to residual variance.  Furthermore, the interpretation of R-squared must account for factors such as multicollinearity and sample size, recognizing that inflated R-squared values may arise from spurious correlations.  Therefore, rigorous validation and thoughtful consideration of clinical utility are paramount when employing regression models and interpreting their associated statistical measures in healthcare research and practice, particularly as of 2024.
