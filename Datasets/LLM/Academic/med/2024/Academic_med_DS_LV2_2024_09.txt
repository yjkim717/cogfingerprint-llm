Mendelian randomization (MR) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for strengthening causal inference in neurological research by leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables. This approach mitigates confounding and reverse causation inherent in observational studies, enabling more robust assessment of modifiable risk factors. Recent advancements in large-scale genome-wide association studies have substantially expanded the genetic association data available for MR applications, facilitating the investigation of complex neurological phenotypes. This review synthesizes current evidence, critically examines methodological controversies—including pleiotropy and population stratification—and discusses the translational potential of MR findings. A primary focus is the identification of novel therapeutic targets and drug repurposing candidates, positioning MR as an instrumental tool for de-risking clinical development in neurology. The integration of MR with multi-omics data holds particular promise for elucidating disease mechanisms and advancing precision medicine approaches in 2024.
