Title: Integrating Germline Testing into Breast Cancer Management: A Paradigm Shift towards Personalized Therapy

Abstract:

The recent ASCOâ€“Society of Surgical Oncology guideline has underscored the importance of germline BRCA1/2 mutation testing in patients with breast cancer, predicated on age, personal and family history, and eligibility for PARP inhibitor therapy. As of 2024, this recommendation marks a pivotal shift towards personalized medicine in oncology. Germline testing for BRCA1/2 mutations not only identifies individuals at heightened risk of breast cancer but also informs treatment decisions, particularly the use of PARP inhibitors, which have shown significant efficacy in patients harboring these mutations. Genetic counseling plays a crucial role in this context, providing patients with a comprehensive understanding of their genetic risk, the implications of test results, and the available therapeutic options. The integration of germline testing into clinical practice necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, involving oncologists, genetic counselors, and surgeons. By streamlining the identification of BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and expanding access to targeted therapies, this guideline has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reshape the breast cancer treatment paradigm. As the field continues to evolve, further research is warranted to optimize testing criteria, elucidate the role of germline testing in diverse patient populations, and explore novel therapeutic strategies leveraging genetic insights.
