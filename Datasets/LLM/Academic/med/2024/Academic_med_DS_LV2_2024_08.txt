**Abstract**

**Background:** The therapeutic landscape for advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) has been historically limited, with chemotherapy representing the standard first-line care for decades. The phase 3 CheckMate 649 trial initially established the efficacy of nivolumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, combined with chemotherapy, demonstrating significant improvements in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). However, the durability of these benefits over an extended period remained a critical, unanswered question in the field. This analysis reports the long-term, three-year follow-up data from this pivotal study.

**Methods:** In this global, open-label, randomized controlled trial, previously untreated patients with HER2-negative, unresectable advanced or metastatic GEA were randomized to receive either nivolumab plus chemotherapy (fluorouracil and oxaliplatin or capecitabine and oxaliplatin) or chemotherapy alone. The co-primary endpoints were OS and PFS, as assessed by blinded independent central review, in patients with a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) of ≥5. Efficacy was also evaluated in the all-randomized population.

**Results:** With a minimum follow-up of 36 months, nivolumab plus chemotherapy continued to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in OS versus chemotherapy alone in the primary efficacy population (PD-L1 CPS ≥5). The survival benefit was sustained, with a persistent separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves. A consistent, superior PFS advantage was also maintained. Furthermore, these superior outcomes extended to the all-randomized population, reinforcing the broad applicability of the regimen. The long-term safety profile remained manageable, with no new safety signals identified, confirming the tolerability of the combination over this extended timeframe.

**Conclusions:** This three-year follow-up from the CheckMate 649 trial provides definitive evidence that first-line nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy confers durable, long-term survival benefits over chemotherapy alone in patients with advanced GEA. These data solidly establish this immunochemotherapy combination as the global standard of care for this patient population, irrespective of PD-L1 status, while affirming its sustained and manageable safety profile.
