**Abstract: Re-evaluating the Threshold for R-squared Significance in Clinical Regression Analysis**

The interpretation of R-squared (coefficient of determination) within clinical medicine remains a subject of ongoing debate, frequently yielding inconsistent application across research disciplines. This paper contends that a conventional threshold of 0.15 (15%) for meaningful R-squared values warrants reconsideration, particularly when employing regression models to predict clinical outcomes. We posit that the inherent complexity of biological systems and the multifactorial nature of clinical phenomena contribute to significantly reduced predictive power, necessitating a more nuanced assessment. 

Traditional statistical significance testing, while crucial, can be misleading when applied to R-squared values exceeding this commonly cited limit.  The observed variance explained by a model may not necessarily translate into clinically relevant improvements in patient care.  Furthermore, the inclusion of numerous covariates – typical in clinical trials – often leads to inflated R-squared values that obscure the relative contribution of individual predictors. 

Therefore, we advocate for a pragmatic approach, focusing on the clinical utility of model predictions rather than solely relying on R-squared magnitude.  Future research should prioritize evaluating the predictive validity of regression models alongside clinically meaningful changes in patient outcomes, ensuring that statistical significance aligns with demonstrable improvements in health.  This perspective is crucial for robust and responsible application of regression techniques in clinical medicine in 2024.
