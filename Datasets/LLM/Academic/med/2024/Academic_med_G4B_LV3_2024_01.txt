**Abstract**

The interpretation of regression models, particularly the R-squared statistic, presents ongoing challenges within clinical medicine. Traditional reliance on fixed thresholds for R-squared significance often fails to adequately capture the inherent complexity of disease etiology. This study synthesizes current literature to advocate for a nuanced approach to R-squared interpretation, suggesting that values exceeding 15% may represent clinically relevant predictive power within the context of conditions exhibiting substantial genetic, environmental, and behavioral influences. However, we posit that a rigid adherence to this threshold is insufficient; instead, rigorous statistical rigor demands careful consideration of the specific research design, sample size, and the interplay of multiple variables. Furthermore, clinical judgment remains paramount in translating statistical findings into actionable insights.  Ultimately, effective utilization of regression models in clinical research necessitates moving beyond simplistic R-squared assessments, embracing a holistic evaluation that integrates statistical metrics with clinical expertise to inform patient care and advance medical understanding.
