**Abstract**

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains a significant clinical challenge, necessitating a nuanced and evidence-based approach to systemic therapy. This review synthesizes current therapeutic strategies for mCRC, drawing primarily from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, Version 2.2024.  Initial management typically involves evaluation of microsatellite instability (MSI) status and *RAS* mutational profiling to guide targeted therapy selection. First-line treatment paradigms commonly incorporate fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy combined with either oxaliplatin, irinotecan, or both, often in conjunction with targeted agents such as anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies (cetuximab or panitumumab) in *RAS* wild-type tumors, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) antibodies (ziv-afatinib, regorafenib) regardless of *RAS* status. Subsequent lines of therapy are dictated by prior treatments and disease response, incorporating novel agents and combinations.  The integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab) for MSI-high mCRC has significantly altered treatment landscapes.  This review highlights evolving treatment algorithms, prognostic factors influencing survival, and considerations for supportive care within the framework of contemporary NCCN recommendations, emphasizing personalized therapeutic strategies for improved patient outcomes in mCRC.
