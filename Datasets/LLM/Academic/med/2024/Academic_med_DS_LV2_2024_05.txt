This 2024 review synthesizes the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for systemic therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We analyze the evidence-based recommendations, which are stratified according to therapeutic intent (curative vs. palliative), prior treatment history, and crucially, the tumor's mutational profile. The central thesis posits that a personalized approach, guided by comprehensive genomic profiling of biomarkers such as RAS, BRAF, and MSI status, is paramount for optimizing first-line and subsequent treatment sequences to improve patient survival and quality of life outcomes.
