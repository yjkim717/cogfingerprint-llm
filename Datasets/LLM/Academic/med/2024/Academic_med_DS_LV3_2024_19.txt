The 2024 NCCN Guidelines for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) establish a precision oncology framework integrating comprehensive mutational profiling with therapeutic decision-making. Systemic therapy selection now prioritizes biomarker-driven strategies over generalized protocols, with treatment algorithms differentiated by RAS/RAF status, HER2 amplification, and mismatch repair proficiency. This paradigm shift necessitates sequential therapy planning based on prior treatment exposure and toxicity management, fundamentally transforming mCRC into a molecularly-defined continuum requiring dynamic clinical reassessment throughout the disease course.
