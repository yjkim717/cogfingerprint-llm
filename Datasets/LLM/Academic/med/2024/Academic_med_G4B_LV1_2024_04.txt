**Abstract**

The 2024 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines represent a significant update in the management of nonmetastatic breast cancer (nmBC). This document prioritizes the strategic implementation of systemic therapy regimens, reflecting evolving evidence regarding efficacy and patient-specific considerations.  Specifically, the revised guidelines delineate preferred first-line systemic approaches – including endocrine therapy and chemotherapy – tailored to risk stratification, tumor characteristics, and patient comorbidities.  Detailed recommendations are provided for managing early-stage disease, encompassing adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings.  Furthermore, the document addresses emerging strategies for patients with high-risk features within nmBC, emphasizing biomarker-driven treatment decisions.  Adherence to these updated NCCN guidelines is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and ensuring consistent, evidence-based clinical practice in the treatment of nmBC, aligning with the latest advancements in oncology.
