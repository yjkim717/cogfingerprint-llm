>## Mendelian Randomization in Neurology: A Review of Current Applications and Future Directions

**Abstract:** Mendelian randomization (MR) is increasingly recognized as a powerful tool for inferring causal relationships between modifiable exposures and neurological outcomes, circumventing limitations inherent in observational studies. This review synthesizes the current landscape of MR applications within neurology, examining its underlying principles, established methodologies, and emerging complexities. We discuss how leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables, anchored by the independence assumption, allows for robust estimation of causal effects in areas such as neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Parkinson's disease), stroke, multiple sclerosis, and psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, we critically evaluate common pitfalls, including pleiotropy, horizontal pleiotropy, and weak instrument bias, highlighting strategies for mitigation through methods like MR-Egger regression, weighted median estimation, and multivariable MR.  The review also explores the burgeoning potential of MR in drug repurposing, utilizing genetic liability scores to identify existing pharmaceuticals that may modulate disease risk and progression. Finally, we consider the integration of MR with multi-omics data, including brain imaging phenotypes derived from techniques like MRI and PET, to refine causal inferences and identify novel therapeutic targets. Despite challenges, MR offers a unique opportunity to advance our understanding of neurological disease etiology and accelerate the development of targeted interventions, representing a crucial area of ongoing research in 2024 and beyond.
