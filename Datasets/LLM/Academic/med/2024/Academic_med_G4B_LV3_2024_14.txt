**Abstract**

This study examined the intricate relationship between orthorexia nervosa and academic self-efficacy within a sample of Lebanese university female students in 2024. Utilizing a mediation model, we hypothesized that psychological distress and mindful eating behaviors would partially explain the association between orthorexia and academic performance. Findings revealed a significant positive relationship between orthorexia nervosa and psychological distress, which subsequently mediated the link with diminished academic self-efficacy. Furthermore, engagement in mindful eating behaviors demonstrated a protective effect, attenuating the negative impact of psychological distress on academic self-perception. These results underscore the importance of addressing psychological well-being alongside dietary restriction in interventions targeting orthorexia, particularly within higher education settings.
