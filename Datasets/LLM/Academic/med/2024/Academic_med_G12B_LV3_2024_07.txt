**Abstract**

Recent advancements in molecular diagnostics and clinical understanding of IDH-mutant gliomas necessitate a re-evaluation of established therapeutic paradigms. This paper examines the evolving landscape of treatment strategies for these tumors, emphasizing the potential for refined risk stratification based on integrating clinical, radiological, and molecular data. Specifically, we propose a shift towards incorporating IDH inhibitors, such as vorasidenib, as a therapeutic consideration prior to conventional radio-chemotherapy, particularly within the context of lower-grade IDH-mutant gliomas. This approach warrants meticulous patient selection and rigorous monitoring for efficacy and adverse events. The integration of targeted therapies alongside established modalities may ultimately improve patient outcomes and optimize treatment sequencing in this complex oncological challenge. Further prospective studies are crucial to validate these observations and define optimal treatment algorithms.
