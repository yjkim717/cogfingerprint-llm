**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of breast cancer necessitates refined risk stratification and personalized treatment strategies.  This study examines the evolving role of germline mutation testing within the clinical management of breast cancer patients. Specifically, we address the utility of comprehensive genomic analysis focusing on *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* variants, alongside exploration of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, as integral components of patient care. 

Current guidelines increasingly advocate for expanded germline mutation testing, particularly in individuals with a personal or family history suggestive of heightened genetic susceptibility. Identification of *BRCA1/2* mutations allows for tailored risk reduction strategies, including prophylactic surgery and enhanced surveillance protocols. Furthermore, PARP inhibitor testing is gaining traction, revealing patients with deleterious *BRCA* mutations who may benefit from targeted therapy in the event of advanced disease. 

This review synthesizes contemporary evidence, highlighting the importance of integrated genetic counseling to facilitate informed decision-making.  Accurate and timely genetic testing, coupled with robust counseling, enables proactive risk management and improves patient outcomes. Future research should prioritize the development of comprehensive, cost-effective testing panels and refine predictive models to optimize clinical application and expand access to these vital diagnostic tools.
