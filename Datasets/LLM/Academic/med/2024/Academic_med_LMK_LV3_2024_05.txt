As of 2024, systemic therapy for mCRC is tailored to individual patient profiles, incorporating factors such as prior treatment history, tumor mutational status, and drug toxicity profiles, in accordance with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, thereby underscoring the need for personalized cancer management strategies.
