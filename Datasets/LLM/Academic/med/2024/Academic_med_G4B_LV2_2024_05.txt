**Abstract**

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) represents a significant clinical challenge, necessitating tailored systemic therapy approaches. This study synthesizes current recommendations from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines to delineate optimal treatment strategies for patients with mCRC.  The evolving landscape of mCRC treatment is increasingly informed by comprehensive mutational profiling, which allows for stratification of patients and prediction of response to targeted therapies.  This review examines the spectrum of systemic therapies, including chemotherapy regimens, targeted agents, and immunotherapies, considering their integration within a multi-modal approach.  Key considerations highlighted include patient performance status, disease stage, and the presence of actionable genomic alterations.  Further, the paper emphasizes the importance of utilizing genomic data to personalize treatment decisions and anticipate potential resistance mechanisms.  Continued refinement of NCCN guidelines, coupled with advances in molecular oncology, remains crucial for optimizing patient outcomes in this complex disease.
