**Optimizing Germline Mutation Testing Strategies in Breast Cancer Patients: A Risk-Stratified Approach**

**Abstract:**  The increasing incidence of breast cancer necessitates refined strategies for risk stratification and targeted genetic counseling. This guideline proposes an optimized approach to germline mutation testing, emphasizing the primacy of *BRCA1/2* analysis within the broader context of early breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.  Initial evaluation should invariably include *BRCA1/2* sequencing, particularly in patients presenting at younger ages or those considered for aggressive therapeutic interventions such as chemotherapy or PARP inhibitor therapy.  

While *BRCA1/2* mutations represent the most prevalent germline risk factors, expanding testing to encompass other relevant variants – including, but not limited to, *BRCA3*, *TP53*, and *PTEN* – is increasingly warranted, especially in cases of complex or atypical presentations.  Furthermore, the potential utility of PARP inhibitor assessment should be considered in patients with identified *BRCA1/2* mutations and evidence of homologous recombination deficiency.  This risk-stratified approach, coupled with comprehensive genetic counseling, aims to enhance patient understanding, facilitate informed decision-making regarding preventative measures and treatment selection, and ultimately improve clinical outcomes.  Future research should focus on refining predictive algorithms and expanding the repertoire of actionable mutations identified through advanced sequencing technologies.
