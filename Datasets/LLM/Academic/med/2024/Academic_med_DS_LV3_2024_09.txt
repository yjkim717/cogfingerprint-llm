**Abstract**

The expanding compendium of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has positioned Mendelian randomization (MR) as a pivotal methodology for causal inference in neurological research. By leveraging genetic variants as instrumental variables, MR analysis robustly infers causal relationships between modifiable exposures and complex neurological outcomes, effectively circumventing confounding and reverse causation biases inherent in conventional observational epidemiology. This approach has been instrumental in resolving long-standing controversies, such as clarifying the null effect of certain circulating biomarkers on Alzheimer's disease risk. Furthermore, the integration of MR with multi-omic data is accelerating the prioritization of novel therapeutic targets and the systematic repurposing of existing drugs. In 2024, the application of MR frameworks to large-scale biobanks and diverse populations is refining our understanding of neurological disease etiology, thereby directly informing the development of precision neurology strategies and de-risking the pipeline for clinical translation. This paradigm continues to strengthen the evidence base for actionable interventions in brain health.
