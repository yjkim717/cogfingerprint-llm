In clinical research, the interpretation of R-squared values within regression models remains a subject of considerable methodological debate. This analysis posits that R², as a statistical measure of variance explained, demands rigorous contextual interpretation rather than reliance on universal thresholds. Through systematic evaluation of clinical prediction models across diverse medical domains—including cardiology, oncology, and epidemiology—we demonstrate that statistical significance alone provides insufficient guidance for clinical applicability. Our framework integrates quantitative metrics with qualitative clinical judgment, establishing that an R² exceeding 15% frequently corresponds to meaningful explanatory power in clinical settings when accompanied by appropriate domain-specific validation. This context-dependent approach addresses the critical distinction between statistical association and clinical relevance, particularly crucial in an era of increasingly complex predictive analytics. The proposed methodology enhances the translational utility of regression outputs, ensuring they inform clinical decision-making rather than merely achieving mathematical optimization. Consequently, this research provides clinicians and researchers with practical guidelines for evaluating model performance in 2024's evolving healthcare landscape, where evidence-based medicine increasingly intersects with advanced statistical modeling.
