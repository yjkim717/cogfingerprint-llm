In clinical research, the interpretation of R-squared values within regression models remains a topic of considerable debate, particularly as predictive analytics gain prominence in medical decision-making. This article posits that R-squared, while a fundamental statistical measure of variance explained, must be evaluated through a dual lens of statistical rigor and clinical relevance. We argue that a decontextualized threshold is insufficient; instead, the clinical meaningfulness of a model is paramount. Our analysis of contemporary literature and clinical trial data from 2020-2024 demonstrates that even models with modest R-squared values—often those exceeding 15%—can provide significant clinical utility when they capture pathophysiologically plausible relationships and inform actionable interventions. This paradigm shift from a purely statistical to a contextually integrated interpretation mitigates the risk of dismissing potentially valuable predictive models. Consequently, we propose a framework for clinicians and researchers to synergistically appraise both the magnitude of R-squared and the clinical consequences of the predictors involved, thereby fostering more nuanced and effective translation of statistical findings into improved patient care pathways.
