**Abstract:**

The management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in 2024 continues to evolve, demanding a nuanced approach to systemic therapy. This review synthesizes current treatment strategies aligned with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, reflecting recent advancements in targeted therapies and immunotherapies. We examine the foundational role of fluoropyrimidine-based regimens, alongside the incorporation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antagonists based on biomarker status (RAS/BRAF mutational profiling). Furthermore, the expanding utility of immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) mCRC, is discussed. This analysis aims to provide a concise overview of evidence-based systemic approaches for optimizing outcomes in patients with mCRC, adhering to established NCCN recommendations.
