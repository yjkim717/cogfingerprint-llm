**Abstract**

The treatment landscape for advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma remains challenging, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies. This retrospective cohort study investigated the efficacy of combining nivolumab, a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, with standard chemotherapy regimens in patients exhibiting advanced disease. Data analysis, conducted in 2024, revealed a statistically significant improvement in both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) compared to historical chemotherapy-only controls (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 0.78, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.67-0.93). Furthermore, objective response rates (ORR) were substantially elevated in the combination arm (32%) relative to chemotherapy alone (15%). These findings suggest a synergistic benefit arising from PD-L1 blockade, potentially mediated by enhanced antitumor immunity.  Further prospective trials are warranted to delineate optimal dosing strategies and identify predictive biomarkers for patient selection, ultimately informing clinical practice guidelines for this aggressive malignancy.
