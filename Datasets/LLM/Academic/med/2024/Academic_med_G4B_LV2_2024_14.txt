**Abstract**

This study examined the complex interplay between orthorexia nervosa, psychological distress, and academic self-efficacy within a specific population: Lebanese university women. Utilizing a quantitative research design, we investigated the potential mediating roles of psychological distress and mindful eating behaviors in the association between orthorexia symptomatology and students’ perceived academic competence.  Orthorexia nervosa, characterized by an obsessive focus on ‘pure’ eating, represents a growing concern, potentially impacting broader well-being and academic performance. 

Our findings suggest a significant positive correlation between orthorexia nervosa and elevated levels of psychological distress. Furthermore, psychological distress emerged as a significant mediator in the relationship between orthorexia and reduced academic self-efficacy.  Notably, mindful eating behaviors demonstrated a partial mediating effect, suggesting that increased awareness and acceptance of food choices may buffer against the negative impact of orthorexia on academic confidence. 

These results highlight the need for targeted interventions addressing both the core symptoms of orthorexia and associated psychological distress. Future research should explore the specific mechanisms underlying these relationships and investigate culturally-sensitive strategies promoting mindful eating practices within this vulnerable population.  Understanding these pathways is crucial for developing effective support systems and promoting optimal student health and academic success in Lebanon.
