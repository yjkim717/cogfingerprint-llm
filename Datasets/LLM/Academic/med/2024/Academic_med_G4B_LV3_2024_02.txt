**Abstract**

This study investigates the diagnostic potential of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 immunoassay in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. Utilizing a single-center cohort study design, we assessed the immunoassay’s diagnostic accuracy relative to established clinical criteria. Preliminary findings suggest the assay demonstrates promising sensitivity and specificity in identifying individuals exhibiting Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology. Further research, incorporating larger, multi-center validation, is warranted to refine its clinical utility and establish its role in longitudinal monitoring of this neurodegenerative condition.
