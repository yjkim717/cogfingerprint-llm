**Abstract**

The year 2024 marks a pivotal moment in the integration of precision oncology into standard clinical practice, particularly in the management of breast cancer. The contemporary therapeutic landscape is increasingly defined by molecularly targeted agents, with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors representing a paradigm-shifting class of therapeutics for tumors harboring homologous recombination deficiencies. The efficacy of PARP inhibitor therapy is intrinsically linked to the presence of deleterious germline mutations in high-penetrance cancer susceptibility genes, most notably *BRCA1* and *BRCA2*. Consequently, the identification of eligible patients through comprehensive germline mutation testing has become a critical determinant of clinical success. This review synthesizes the latest evidence and guidelines, including the seminal ASCO-SSO recommendations, which provide a structured framework for test indication. These guidelines advocate for universal *BRCA1/2* testing in all breast cancer patients diagnosed under the age of 65, moving beyond older, restrictive models based solely on family history. Furthermore, testing is mandated for any patient being considered for PARP inhibitor therapy, regardless of age or familial presentation, underscoring a treatment-driven approach to genetic assessment. The expansion of testing criteria necessitates a parallel reinforcement of pre- and post-test genetic counseling protocols. This ensures informed consent, facilitates the accurate interpretation of complex results—including variants of uncertain significance—and addresses the profound psychosocial and familial implications of identifying a pathogenic variant. In conclusion, the strategic implementation of germline testing, guided by evolving evidence-based guidelines and integrated with expert genetic counseling, is fundamental to optimizing therapeutic outcomes, enabling proactive risk-reduction strategies, and fulfilling the promise of personalized cancer care.
