Okay, here's an original academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided keywords and summary, aiming for a formal tone, precise terminology, and structured reasoning, and set within a 2024 context.  I've aimed for around 238 words.  Following the abstract, I'll include some notes on my choices and potential expansions.

**Abstract: Adaptive Treatment Strategies for IDH-Mutant Gliomas: Integrating Molecular Profiling and Targeted Inhibition with Radiotherapy**

The management of IDH-mutant gliomas presents a significant challenge in neuro-oncology. Historically, treatment has been predicated on conventional approaches—surgical resection followed by radiotherapy and, in some cases, chemotherapy—often resulting in limited long-term survival. However, the recent development and clinical validation of selective IDH1/2 inhibitors (e.g., enasidenib, vorinostat) offer a paradigm shift, potentially enabling more tailored and adaptive therapeutic strategies. This review examines the evolving role of molecular profiling, specifically IDH mutation status and associated glioma grade, in guiding treatment decisions.  We propose a framework where initial assessment incorporates comprehensive genomic sequencing to confirm IDH mutation and stratify patients based on tumor grade (WHO I-III).  In Grade II and select Grade III lesions, a period of observation coupled with targeted IDH inhibition may be considered as an initial approach, with radiotherapy reserved for disease progression or symptomatic burden.  For higher-grade tumors (WHO III and IV), concurrent or sequential IDH inhibition alongside radiotherapy warrants investigation, aiming to enhance treatment efficacy and potentially reduce the long-term sequelae associated with early radiotherapy exposure.  Future research should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers that delineate responders to IDH inhibition, optimizing treatment sequencing, and exploring combination strategies integrating immunotherapy to overcome resistance mechanisms.  The ultimate goal is to refine therapeutic algorithms, maximizing patient benefit and improving overall survival in this complex patient population.

**Notes and Potential Expansions:**

*   **Specificity:** I've included specific examples of IDH inhibitors (enasidenib, vorinostat) to ground the discussion.
*   **WHO Grading:** The use of WHO grading (I-IV) provides a standard framework for classifying gliomas.
*   **Adaptive Treatment:**  The phrase "adaptive treatment strategies" emphasizes the idea of tailoring the approach based on individual patient and tumor characteristics.
*   **Rationale:** I've included a rationale for delaying radiotherapy in lower-grade tumors, highlighting the potential for minimizing long-term side effects.
*   **Future Directions:**  The inclusion of future research directions (biomarker identification, combination strategies) demonstrates an awareness of the ongoing evolution of the field.
*   **Immunotherapy:** I’ve included immunotherapy as a potential future avenue, recognizing the increasing interest in this area within neuro-oncology.
*   **Word Count:** It's slightly over 238 words, but that's easily adjustable by trimming a sentence or two.
*   **Further Elaboration:** This could be expanded to discuss specific resistance mechanisms to IDH inhibitors, the challenges of diffusion and penetration of these drugs across the blood-brain barrier, and the cost-effectiveness considerations of these newer therapies.
