**Abstract**

The emergence of minimally invasive diagnostic tools is crucial for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection. This observational cohort study, conducted across three distinct single-center cohorts in 2024, evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) immunoassay in reflecting underlying AD pathophysiology. Utilizing established diagnostic criteria, we assessed the assay's ability to differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative disorders and healthy controls. Preliminary findings suggest p-tau217 demonstrates promising discriminatory power, potentially offering a readily accessible and cost-effective biomarker for identifying individuals with AD-related pathology. Further validation across diverse populations is warranted to fully establish its clinical utility and impact on diagnostic workflows.
