**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnostics have highlighted the potential of plasma biomarkers. This observational cohort study, conducted in a single center during 2024, evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available immunoassay measuring phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) in identifying AD pathophysiology. Findings will assess the assayâ€™s performance in differentiating AD from other neurodegenerative conditions, contributing to improved early detection and potentially facilitating more targeted therapeutic interventions. Further research is warranted to validate these results across diverse populations.
