Title: The Interplay between Orthorexia Nervosa, Psychological Distress, Mindful Eating, and Academic Self-Efficacy among Lebanese University Female Students: A Mediation Analysis

Abstract:

Orthorexia nervosa, characterized by an excessive preoccupation with healthy eating, has been increasingly prevalent among young adults, particularly university students. This study investigates the mediating effects of psychological distress and mindful eating on the relationship between orthorexia nervosa and academic self-efficacy among Lebanese university female students. A cross-sectional design was employed, recruiting a sample of female students from Lebanese universities. Participants completed standardized self-report measures assessing orthorexia nervosa, psychological distress, mindful eating, and academic self-efficacy. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the hypothesized mediation model. The results indicate that orthorexia nervosa was significantly associated with increased psychological distress and decreased mindful eating. Furthermore, the relationship between orthorexia nervosa and academic self-efficacy was mediated by psychological distress and mindful eating. Specifically, higher levels of orthorexia nervosa were associated with increased psychological distress, which in turn negatively impacted academic self-efficacy. Conversely, mindful eating was found to positively mediate the relationship between orthorexia nervosa and academic self-efficacy. The findings suggest that interventions targeting psychological distress and promoting mindful eating may be effective in mitigating the negative effects of orthorexia nervosa on academic performance among Lebanese university female students. The study's results have implications for the development of prevention and intervention programs aimed at promoting mental health and academic success among this population. (Word count: 266)
