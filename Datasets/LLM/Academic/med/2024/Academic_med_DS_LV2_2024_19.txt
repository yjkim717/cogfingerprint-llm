This 2024 review synthesizes the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for systemic therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We delineate evidence-based treatment algorithms, emphasizing the critical role of comprehensive tumor molecular profiling, including RAS, BRAF, and MSI status, in guiding therapeutic selection. The recommendations are stratified by treatment intent (curative vs. palliative), prior therapy exposure, and specific clinical scenarios. Our analysis concludes that a personalized approach, integrating the patient's mutational profile and treatment history, is paramount for optimizing outcomes in mCRC, underscoring a shift away from a uniform treatment paradigm.
