Title: Reevaluating the Utility of R-Squared Values in Clinical Medicine: A Contextual Analysis

Abstract:

The R-squared value, a statistical measure quantifying the proportion of variance in a dependent variable explained by independent variables in regression models, is frequently employed in clinical medicine to assess the strength of associations. However, its interpretation is not straightforward, as its meaningfulness is contingent upon various factors. This study critically examines the role of R-squared values in clinical medicine, with a particular emphasis on the coefficient of variance and clinical context. By scrutinizing the limitations and potential misinterpretations of R-squared values, we demonstrate that its utility is highly dependent on the specific research question and study design. Our analysis, grounded in contemporary clinical research (2024), underscores the need for a nuanced understanding of R-squared values, considering both statistical and clinical significance. We propose a framework for contextualizing R-squared values, facilitating more informed interpretation and application in clinical decision-making.
