**Abstract**

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) represents a significant clinical challenge, necessitating tailored systemic therapy approaches. This study synthesizes current NCCN guidelines (2024) to delineate optimal treatment strategies for mCRC patients, factoring in evolving mutational profiles and prior therapeutic interventions.  Analysis reveals a shift towards incorporating predictive biomarkers – specifically, microsatellite instability (MSI) status and tumor mutational burden (TMB) – to inform targeted immunotherapy and anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody selection.  Furthermore, sequencing of the tumor’s mutational landscape is increasingly crucial for predicting response to chemotherapy regimens.  Ultimately, a precision medicine approach, integrating genomic data with established NCCN protocols, promises improved patient outcomes and individualized treatment plans in mCRC management.
