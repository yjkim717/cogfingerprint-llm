**Title: Long-Term Glycemic Outcomes and Medication Independence Following Bariatric Surgery Versus Medical Management in Type 2 Diabetes: A Longitudinal Observational Study**

**Abstract**

**Background:** Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a significant global health burden, often requiring chronic medical management and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. While conventional pharmacological interventions and lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of T2DM care, their long-term efficacy in achieving durable glycemic control and reducing reliance on medication is frequently limited. Bariatric surgery, traditionally indicated for severe obesity, has emerged as a potential therapeutic option for T2DM, independent of weight loss. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the long-term glycemic outcomes and medication requirements of patients with T2DM undergoing bariatric surgery versus those receiving standard medical management.

**Methods:** This longitudinal, observational study retrospectively analyzed data from [Specify cohort â€“ e.g., a large, multi-center database of patients with T2DM] spanning a 7-12 year period (2012-2024). Participants were stratified into two groups: those who underwent bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy being the most common procedures) and those receiving continued medical management, including pharmacological interventions (metformin, sulfonylureas, GLP-1 receptor agonists, etc.) and lifestyle counseling. Primary outcomes included changes in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and the proportion of patients achieving diabetes remission (HbA1c < 6.0% without pharmacological intervention). Secondary outcomes included changes in medication usage (number of medications and daily dosage) and incidence of diabetes-related complications. Statistical analyses, including mixed-effects models and Cox proportional hazards regression, were employed to account for potential confounders and assess differences between groups.

**Results:**  Data analysis revealed a statistically significant and sustained improvement in glycemic control in the bariatric surgery group compared to the medical management group (p < 0.001).  Remission rates were substantially higher in the surgical cohort (X% vs. Y% in the medical management group, p < 0.001).  Furthermore, the bariatric surgery group demonstrated a significant reduction in the number and dosage of diabetes medications required over the study period.  [Include specific details on medication reduction/elimination rates].  While the surgical group experienced [mention potential surgical complications, briefly], these were managed effectively and did not negate the overall clinical benefit.

**Conclusion:**  These findings provide compelling evidence that bariatric surgery offers a superior long-term strategy for glycemic control, medication independence, and diabetes remission compared to conventional medical management in patients with T2DM.  Further prospective, randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate these observations and refine patient selection criteria for surgical intervention.
