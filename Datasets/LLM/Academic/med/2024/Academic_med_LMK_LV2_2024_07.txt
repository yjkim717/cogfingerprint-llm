Title: Evolving Paradigms in the Management of IDH-Mutant Gliomas: Integrating Novel Therapeutic Strategies and Surgical Insights

Abstract:
The management of IDH-mutant gliomas is undergoing a paradigm shift, driven by advances in molecular diagnostics and the emergence of targeted therapies. IDH inhibitors, a novel class of agents, have shown promise in improving patient outcomes by specifically targeting the metabolic dysregulation characteristic of IDH-mutant tumors. As of 2024, clinical trials continue to elucidate the efficacy and safety of these agents. Concurrently, the importance of tumor grade and extent of resection in treatment planning remains paramount. This review synthesizes current evidence on the integration of IDH inhibitors into treatment regimens, highlighting the interplay between tumor biology, surgical intervention, and adjuvant therapy. By examining the complex interdependencies between these factors, we provide a nuanced framework for informing treatment decisions in IDH-mutant glioma patients, ultimately aiming to optimize patient outcomes in this evolving therapeutic landscape.
