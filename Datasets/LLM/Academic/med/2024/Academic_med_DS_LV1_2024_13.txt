**Advancements in the Safety Evaluation of Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate for Food-Contact Applications: A 2024 Perspective on Decontamination and Toxicological Risk Assessment**

**Abstract**

The escalating global demand for sustainable packaging has intensified the reliance on mechanically recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) for food-contact applications. However, the potential for contaminant carryover from post-consumer waste poses a significant challenge to public health. This article synthesizes the critical advancements in the safety evaluation paradigm for rPET, as underscored by the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) updated 2024 guidance. The core of the modern assessment framework is the rigorous demonstration of a process's decontamination efficiency. This is quantitatively established through a **challenge test**, wherein the rPET is exposed to surrogate contaminants representing a spectrum of physicochemical properties and **toxicological concern**. The resultant data are used to calibrate **migration models** that predict the potential for consumer exposure to any residual contaminants under foreseeable use conditions. The 2024 guidance places heightened emphasis on the validation of these models against real-world scenarios and mandates a more comprehensive toxicological evaluation of non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) that may form during the recycling process. Consequently, the safety assurance for rPET now hinges on an integrated approach that couples robust empirical decontamination data with predictive modeling and a thorough toxicological risk assessment. This evolved methodology ensures that the circular economy for food-contact plastics progresses without compromising the stringent safety standards required to protect consumer health, marking a significant step towards reconciling environmental objectives with public health imperatives.
