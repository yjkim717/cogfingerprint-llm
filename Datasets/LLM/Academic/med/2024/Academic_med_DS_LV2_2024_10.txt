The accurate volumetric segmentation of pediatric brain tumors remains a critical yet challenging prerequisite for objective response assessment in clinical trials. This study presents the methodology and outcomes of the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge, a systematic evaluation of artificial intelligence algorithms for segmenting pediatric brain tumors from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) data. Utilizing a multi-institutional dataset comprising diverse pediatric tumor subtypes, the challenge benchmarked state-of-the-art segmentation models against expert-annotated ground truth. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that top-performing algorithms achieved robust tumor sub-compartment delineation, with Dice similarity coefficients exceeding 0.85 for enhancing tumor regions. However, performance variability was observed across tumor types and institutions, highlighting domain-specific challenges in pediatric neuro-oncology. These results establish a foundational benchmark for pediatric tumor segmentation and indicate that validated AI tools can potentially standardize volumetric assessment in multicenter trials. Future work will focus on improving model generalizability and integrating these tools into clinical trial workflows to enable more precise therapy response evaluation.
