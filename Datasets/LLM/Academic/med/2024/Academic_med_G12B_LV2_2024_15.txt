## The Nuanced Interpretation of R-Squared in Clinical Regression Models: Bridging Statistical Significance and Clinical Relevance

**Abstract:** The widespread adoption of regression models in clinical research necessitates a critical evaluation of how R-squared, a common measure of model fit, is interpreted and utilized. While R-squared quantifies the proportion of variance in a dependent variable explained by a model, its application within clinical medicine requires careful consideration beyond simple statistical significance. This review examines the challenges inherent in interpreting R-squared values in clinical contexts, highlighting the potential for inflated values arising from multicollinearity and overfitting, and the limitations of relying solely on R-squared to assess clinical utility. We argue that a rigid focus on maximizing R-squared can obscure crucial aspects of model performance and may not necessarily translate to improved patient outcomes.  Furthermore, we explore the relationship between R-squared and the coefficient of variance, demonstrating how a seemingly high R-squared value can mask substantial unexplained heterogeneity within clinical datasets.  We advocate for a shift towards a more holistic assessment of regression models, integrating clinical expertise, consideration of effect sizes, and rigorous validation techniques alongside R-squared. Ultimately, this perspective encourages clinicians and researchers to prioritize models that demonstrably improve clinical decision-making and enhance patient care, rather than solely pursuing models with high explanatory power, particularly when evaluating predictive accuracy for clinical outcomes in 2024 and beyond.
