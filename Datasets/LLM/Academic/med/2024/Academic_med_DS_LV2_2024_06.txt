**Title:** Refining Hereditary Cancer Risk Assessment: An Analysis of the 2024 ASCO-SSO Guideline Update on Germline *BRCA1/2* Testing in Breast Cancer Patients

The integration of germline mutation testing into the standard oncologic care for breast cancer patients represents a critical advancement in precision medicine, enabling both refined risk stratification and the personalization of therapeutic strategies. This analytical review examines the updated 2024 joint guideline from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO), which provides a structured framework for identifying patients who should be offered *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* genetic testing. The guideline underscores a paradigm shift from a reliance predominantly on extensive family history to a more integrated model that incorporates clinical and pathological tumor characteristics. Specifically, it mandates the consideration of germline testing based on a tripartite rationale: a patient's age at diagnosis, particularly in cases of early-onset disease; a detailed assessment of familial cancer susceptibility, including ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer; and, pivotally, the patient's eligibility for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapy. This therapeutic criterion is of paramount importance, as the identification of a pathogenic *BRCA1/2* variant directly informs the use of PARP inhibitors, which exploit synthetic lethality to induce tumor cell death in homologous recombination-deficient cancers. The guideline further emphasizes that genetic testing must be preceded and followed by comprehensive genetic counseling to ensure informed consent, facilitate accurate interpretation of complex results—including variants of uncertain significance—and address the profound psychosocial and familial implications of identifying a hereditary cancer predisposition. In conclusion, the 2024 ASCO-SSO recommendations establish a robust, evidence-based protocol that optimizes patient selection for genetic evaluation, thereby enhancing both therapeutic outcomes through targeted treatment and long-term cancer surveillance and prevention for at-risk individuals.
