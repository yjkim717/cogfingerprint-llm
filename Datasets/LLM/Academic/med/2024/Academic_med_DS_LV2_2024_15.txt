**Abstract**

The utility of R-squared (R²) as a statistical measure in clinical research remains a subject of considerable debate, often leading to misinterpretation in the evaluation of regression models. This narrative review synthesizes current literature to critically appraise the contextual dependency of R² values within clinical medicine. We posit that R² is an insufficient standalone metric for assessing model validity or clinical importance, as its magnitude is intrinsically linked to the inherent variability of the outcome under investigation and the specific clinical domain. Our analysis demonstrates that in many clinical settings characterized by high biological heterogeneity, even models with low R² values can yield significant and actionable predictive insights. Conversely, a high R² does not inherently confirm clinical utility. Based on the synthesized evidence, we propose that an R² value exceeding 15% frequently signifies a meaningful effect size in numerous clinical contexts, providing a pragmatic benchmark for researchers. This work underscores the necessity of complementing R² with domain expertise, confidence intervals, and other goodness-of-fit measures. We conclude that a nuanced, context-driven interpretation is paramount for the accurate translation of statistical findings into clinically relevant knowledge, thereby guiding more informed research and practice in 2024 and beyond.
