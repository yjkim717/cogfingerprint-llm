**Abstract**

The interpretation of R-squared values in clinical medicine remains a point of contention, often leading to misrepresentation of model utility and potential over-reliance on statistical significance. This narrative review, conducted in 2024, critically examines the application of regression models within clinical contexts and synthesizes expert perspectives alongside empirical findings to provide a nuanced framework for R-squared interpretation. We argue that the conventional focus on p-values can obscure the practical relevance of predictive models. While statistical significance is essential, a low R-squared value does not necessarily invalidate a regression model; conversely, a high R-squared should be scrutinized for overfitting and clinical plausibility. Our analysis suggests that an R-squared value exceeding 15% generally warrants consideration of meaningful clinical impact, provided the model demonstrates robustness and aligns with established clinical judgment. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of considering effect sizes, calibration, and clinical utility alongside R-squared when evaluating the overall value of regression models in guiding medical decision-making. This review aims to promote a more holistic and clinically informed approach to interpreting regression diagnostics, ultimately improving the translation of statistical findings into effective patient care.
