**Abstract**

The increasing demand for sustainable materials has spurred the adoption of post-consumer recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) in food contact applications. However, the potential for residual contaminants in rPET necessitates rigorous safety evaluations to ensure consumer protection. This paper examines the European Food Safety Authorityâ€™s (EFSA) 2024 guidance document pertaining to the safety assessment of mechanical PET recycling processes for food contact materials. The guidance establishes a framework for evaluating decontamination efficiency, specifically targeting the removal of process-related contaminants introduced during collection, sorting, and reprocessing. A key element of the assessment involves a tiered approach, utilizing both chemical and microbiological analyses to quantify residual levels of potential migrants. Dietary exposure estimates, derived from anticipated material usage and migration data, are then compared against established Toxicological Concern (TOC) thresholds. The guidance underscores the importance of demonstrating robust decontamination protocols and validating their efficacy through comprehensive testing. Furthermore, it highlights the need for ongoing monitoring and quality control measures within recycling facilities to maintain the safety and suitability of rPET for food contact applications, contributing to a circular economy while mitigating potential health risks.
