**Abstract: Evolving Landscape of Germline Genetic Testing in Breast Cancer: Implementation of Updated Guidelines and Impact on PARP Inhibitor Eligibility**

The incidence of breast cancer continues to necessitate advancements in personalized treatment strategies. Germline genetic testing (GGT) for *BRCA1/2* and other high-penetrance genes has emerged as a critical component of this paradigm shift, informing prognosis, risk reduction strategies, and therapeutic decision-making. This review examines the evolving landscape of GGT in breast cancer management, particularly in light of the 2024 updates to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and Societé Française de Cancérologie Oncologique (SSO) guidelines. These revised recommendations broaden the scope of individuals considered for GGT beyond those with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, incorporating considerations of ancestry, tumor characteristics, and the increasing availability of multi-gene panel testing.

The identification of germline mutations in DNA repair genes, beyond *BRCA1/2*, such as *ATM*, *CHEK2*, and *PALB2*, significantly impacts treatment options, notably expanding eligibility for PARP inhibitors in advanced breast cancer. This review details the current evidence supporting PARP inhibitor use in patients with germline mutations, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive genomic profiling to identify potentially actionable alterations. Furthermore, we address the crucial role of genetic counseling throughout the GGT process, ensuring informed consent, accurate interpretation of results, and appropriate cascade testing within families. Finally, we discuss the ongoing challenges related to equitable access to GGT, cost-effectiveness analyses, and the integration of these findings into routine clinical practice, highlighting future directions for optimizing patient outcomes in the era of precision oncology.
