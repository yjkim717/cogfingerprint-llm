## Abstract: Contemporary Systemic Therapy Strategies in Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer: An Analysis of NCCN Guideline Updates (2024)

This analysis examines recent revisions to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines concerning the systemic therapy management of nonmetastatic breast cancer, reflecting advancements in 2024. The updated guidelines emphasize a multidisciplinary approach, integrating surgical considerations with adjuvant and neoadjuvant systemic therapies. A core focus lies on refining risk stratification and tailoring treatment decisions based on factors including tumor stage, grade, hormone receptor status (ER, PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, and genomic profiling.  The revisions detail nuanced recommendations for endocrine therapy, chemotherapy regimens, and targeted therapies, notably incorporating evolving data on CDK4/6 inhibitors and PI3K inhibitors. Furthermore, the document underscores the importance of patient-reported outcomes and shared decision-making within the context of personalized medicine. This update aims to optimize treatment efficacy, minimize adverse effects, and enhance the quality of life for individuals diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer.
