**Abstract**

The escalating prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) necessitates the development of accessible biomarkers for early detection. This study investigated the diagnostic utility of a novel plasma tau 217 immunoassay in differentiating AD pathology across three independent cohorts. Utilizing a cohort study design, we assessed the assay’s sensitivity and specificity in identifying elevated plasma phosphorylated tau levels, a key correlate of AD pathophysiology. Preliminary findings suggest the immunoassay demonstrates promising diagnostic accuracy, potentially facilitating non-invasive monitoring of disease progression. However, further validation within larger, diverse populations is crucial to establish its clinical utility.  These results contribute to the evolving landscape of AD biomarker research and highlight the potential of plasma-based assays for improved patient stratification and therapeutic intervention strategies in 2024.
