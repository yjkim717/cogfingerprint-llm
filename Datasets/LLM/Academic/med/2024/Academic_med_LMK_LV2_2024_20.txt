Title: Guideline-Informed Germline Testing for Breast Cancer: Optimizing BRCA1/2 Mutation Detection and Genetic Counseling

Abstract:

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has issued guidelines for germline testing in breast cancer patients, emphasizing the importance of identifying BRCA1/2 mutations to inform treatment decisions and cancer risk management. In line with these recommendations, this study examines the role of BRCA1/2 testing in patients with breast cancer, focusing on age, personal and family history, and eligibility for targeted therapies. A comprehensive review of current literature highlights the significance of genetic counseling in the context of germline testing, particularly for individuals with identified mutations in cancer susceptibility genes. The ASCO guideline advocates for a nuanced approach to BRCA1/2 testing, taking into account patient-specific factors to maximize the benefits of genetic testing.

By applying these guideline-informed testing criteria, clinicians can identify patients who are most likely to benefit from BRCA1/2 testing, thereby enhancing the detection of pathogenic mutations and facilitating personalized cancer management. Furthermore, this targeted approach enables the identification of family members who may be at increased risk of developing breast or other cancers, underscoring the importance of genetic counseling in the cascade testing process. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of germline testing into routine clinical practice is poised to improve patient outcomes and refine cancer risk assessment strategies. This study contributes to the ongoing discussion on optimizing germline testing for breast cancer, with implications for clinical practice and research in 2024 and beyond.
