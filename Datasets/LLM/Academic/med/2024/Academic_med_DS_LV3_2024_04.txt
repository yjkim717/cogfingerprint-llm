The 2024 iteration of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer underscores a paradigm centered on a multidisciplinary framework for clinical management. This consensus-driven approach is critical for optimizing therapeutic sequencing and patient-specific care pathways. For individuals with nonmetastatic disease, the guidelines provide a rigorous, evidence-based algorithm for systemic therapy selection, integrating tumor biology and genomic assays. This structured methodology aims to enhance oncologic outcomes while mitigating treatment-related morbidity, thereby reinforcing the centrality of collaborative decision-making in contemporary oncology practice.
