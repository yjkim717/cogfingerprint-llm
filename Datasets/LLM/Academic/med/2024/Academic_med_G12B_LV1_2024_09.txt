## Mendelian Randomization in Neurological Research: Leveraging Genetic Architecture for Translational Discovery in 2024

**Abstract:** The burgeoning field of neurology faces persistent challenges in establishing causal relationships between modifiable risk factors and complex neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Traditional observational studies are vulnerable to confounding and reverse causation, hindering the development of effective therapeutic interventions. Mendelian randomization (MR) offers a powerful, genetically informed approach to infer causality by utilizing genetic variants as instrumental variables, mimicking a randomized controlled trial. This review assesses the current landscape of MR application within neurology in 2024, highlighting its increasing utility in investigating the causal role of circulating biomarkers, lifestyle factors, and pharmacological targets in brain health and disease. We discuss established methodologies, including univariate and multivariable MR analyses, as well as emerging techniques such as MR-Egger regression and weighted median estimation to address potential pleiotropy. While MR provides robust causal inferences, we also acknowledge limitations, including variant validity, weak instrument bias, and the assumption of independence between genetic variants and confounders. Crucially, the integration of large-scale genetic data, brain imaging phenotypes derived from neuroimaging initiatives (e.g., UK Biobank), and pharmacological data presents a compelling opportunity for drug repurposing and the identification of novel therapeutic targets. This review concludes by outlining future directions, emphasizing the need for sophisticated MR designs and collaborative efforts to maximize the translational potential of this powerful methodology in advancing neurological research.
