**Abstract**

The 2024 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Breast Cancer represent a significant update to systemic therapy management, particularly within the context of nonmetastatic disease. This document synthesizes evolving evidence to refine recommendations for adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment strategies.  A core focus is the stratification of patients based on risk factors – including tumor subtype, genomic profiles, and biomarker status – to optimize treatment intensity.  The guidelines delineate preferred regimens for early-stage breast cancer, emphasizing the role of endocrine therapy alongside chemotherapy where indicated.  Furthermore, emerging data regarding targeted therapies and immunotherapy are increasingly integrated, reflecting a shift towards personalized approaches.  Adherence to these NCCN guidelines is crucial for ensuring consistent and evidence-based breast cancer management, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and a reduction in recurrence rates.  Further research is warranted to validate these recommendations in diverse patient populations.
