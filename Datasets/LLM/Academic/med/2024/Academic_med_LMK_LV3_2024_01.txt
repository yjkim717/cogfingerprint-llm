Title: Reevaluating R-squared Values in Clinical Medicine: A Contextual Analysis of Regression Models

Abstract:
In clinical medicine, the interpretation of R-squared values in regression models is increasingly recognized as context-dependent. As medical research continues to rely on statistical analysis, understanding the nuances of R-squared values is crucial for accurate interpretation. This study examines the role of R-squared values in clinical research, considering the coefficient of variance and research questions. Our analysis reveals that R-squared values must be evaluated within the specific clinical context, taking into account the complexity of the research question and the data. By reevaluating the use of R-squared values in regression models, we highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of statistical measures in medical research. This contextual understanding is essential for informed decision-making in clinical practice, ultimately enhancing the validity and applicability of research findings in 2024 and beyond.
