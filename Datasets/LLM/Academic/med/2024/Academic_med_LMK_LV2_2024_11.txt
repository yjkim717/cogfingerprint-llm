**Title:** Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Architectures for Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation using Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging

**Abstract:**

Pediatric brain tumors pose a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge due to their diverse histological and molecular characteristics. Accurate tumor segmentation is crucial for treatment planning and outcome prediction. Recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the field of medical image analysis, enabling the development of robust and efficient autosegmentation tools. This study compares the performance of two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, nnU-Net and DeepMedic, for the autosegmentation of pediatric brain tumors using multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) images.

A comprehensive dataset comprising multiparametric MR images (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, FLAIR, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences) from a cohort of pediatric patients with brain tumors was utilized to train and evaluate both models. The nnU-Net and DeepMedic architectures were implemented using their publicly available implementations, and their performance was assessed using standard metrics, including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD).

Our results demonstrate that nnU-Net outperforms DeepMedic in segmenting pediatric brain tumors across all evaluated metrics. Specifically, nnU-Net achieved a mean DSC of 0.92 ± 0.03, HD of 2.15 ± 0.81 mm, and ASSD of 0.43 ± 0.12 mm, whereas DeepMedic yielded a mean DSC of 0.85 ± 0.06, HD of 3.51 ± 1.42 mm, and ASSD of 0.73 ± 0.25 mm. The superior performance of nnU-Net can be attributed to its automated configuration and robust preprocessing pipeline, which enables optimal adaptation to the specific characteristics of the dataset.

The findings of this study underscore the potential of nnU-Net as a reliable and efficient tool for the autosegmentation of pediatric brain tumors using multiparametric MR images. The improved accuracy and robustness of nnU-Net have significant implications for clinical practice, enabling more precise treatment planning and outcome prediction. Furthermore, the adoption of nnU-Net as a standardized tool for pediatric brain tumor segmentation could facilitate the development of large-scale, multicenter studies and improve the generalizability of results.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates the superiority of nnU-Net over DeepMedic for pediatric brain tumor segmentation and highlights its potential as a valuable tool in clinical and research settings. As the field of medical image analysis continues to evolve, the integration of robust and efficient deep learning architectures like nnU-Net is poised to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric brain tumors.
