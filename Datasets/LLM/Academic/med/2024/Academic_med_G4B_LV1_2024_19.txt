**Abstract**

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) represents a significant clinical challenge, necessitating individualized systemic therapy approaches. This study synthesizes current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines to delineate optimal treatment strategies for patients with advanced disease. Analysis of recent clinical trials and emerging mutational profiling data underscores the crucial role of genomic assessment in predicting response to various therapeutic modalities.  We examine the spectrum of systemic agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, targeted therapies, and chemotherapy regimens, considering their integration within a multi-modal framework. Patient-specific factors, such as performance status, prior treatments, and tumor heterogeneity, are emphasized as key determinants of treatment selection.  Further research focusing on refined predictive biomarkers and personalized sequencing of systemic therapy is warranted to improve outcomes for mCRC patients in 2024 and beyond.
