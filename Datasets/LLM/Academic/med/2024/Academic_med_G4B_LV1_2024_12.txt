**Abstract**

The escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) necessitates innovative therapeutic strategies beyond conventional medical management. This retrospective cohort study investigates the comparative efficacy of bariatric surgery versus intensive medical management in achieving sustained glycemic control and inducing remission among individuals with T2D. Utilizing data from a multi-center randomized trials database spanning 2018-2023, we analyzed patient cohorts adhering to either surgical intervention (restrictive or malabsorptive procedures) or a standardized medical regimen incorporating metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and SGLT2 inhibitors. 

Primary outcomes included changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and the proportion of patients achieving a HbA1c <7.0% at 5 years. Secondary outcomes assessed diabetes remission, defined as discontinuation of diabetes medications and sustained normoglycemia. Results demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c at 5 years in the bariatric surgery group (mean difference -1.8%, p<0.001) compared to the medical management group.  Furthermore, a substantially higher proportion of patients undergoing bariatric surgery achieved remission (42.7% vs. 18.3%, p<0.001). These findings underscore the potential of bariatric surgery as a transformative intervention for individuals with T2D, offering superior long-term glycemic outcomes and a heightened likelihood of diabetes remission when compared to intensive medical management.
