**A Comparative Analysis of nnU-Net and DeepMedic for Automated Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation: Evaluating Generalization and Clinical Applicability**

**Abstract**

**Background:** Accurate and efficient segmentation of brain tumors is crucial for treatment planning, monitoring response to therapy, and assessing prognosis, particularly in pediatric populations where tumor heterogeneity and anatomical variability pose significant challenges. While manual segmentation remains the gold standard, its subjectivity and time-consuming nature necessitate the development of robust automated solutions. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated promise in medical image segmentation; however, their performance and generalizability across diverse datasets remain critical considerations. This study investigates and compares the efficacy of two prominent deep-learning architectures – nnU-Net (no-new-Net) and DeepMedic – for automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors, with a specific focus on evaluating their ability to generalize across multiple datasets and maintain clinical utility.

**Methods:** We retrospectively analyzed a multi-institutional dataset comprising 340 pre-operative, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of pediatric patients (ages 3-18 years) diagnosed with various subtypes of brain tumors (e.g., pilocytic astrocytoma, diffuse astrocytoma, medulloblastoma).  Tumor segmentations were performed by experienced neuroradiologists and used as ground truth. Both nnU-Net and DeepMedic were implemented and trained using a standardized training protocol. nnU-Net’s automated configuration and cascade architecture were leveraged to optimize network parameters for the specific dataset. DeepMedic’s multi-scale 3D convolutional approach was employed with established pre-processing and post-processing techniques.  The models were evaluated using a five-fold cross-validation scheme, with each fold utilizing a distinct subset of institutions to assess generalization. Segmentation performance was quantified using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HD), and Average Surface Distance (ASD). Statistical analysis, including paired t-tests and ANOVA, was performed to compare the performance of the two models.  Furthermore, a subset of segmentations produced by each model were reviewed by a panel of expert radiologists to assess clinical acceptability and identify potential failure modes.

**Results:** nnU-Net consistently outperformed DeepMedic across all evaluation metrics. The mean DSC for nnU-Net was 0.87 ± 0.04, compared to 0.79 ± 0.06 for DeepMedic (p < 0.001). Similarly, nnU-Net exhibited significantly lower mean HD (2.1 mm vs. 3.5 mm, p < 0.001) and ASD (0.8 mm vs. 1.2 mm, p < 0.001).  Crucially, nnU-Net demonstrated superior generalization across datasets from different institutions, showing minimal performance degradation in the unseen folds.  Radiologist review revealed that DeepMedic occasionally struggled with accurately delineating tumor boundaries in regions of high anatomical complexity
