**Abstract**

The utility of R-squared, a common metric within regression models, warrants nuanced interpretation within the context of clinical medicine. While traditionally viewed as a measure of model fit, its application in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demands careful consideration beyond simple statistical significance. This study investigates the limitations of relying solely on R-squared values to assess treatment efficacy, arguing that a universally ‘meaningful’ value is untenable across diverse clinical scenarios. 

We posit that R-squared’s sensitivity to sample size and variable collinearity necessitates a contextualized approach. A high R-squared in a small RCT may not reflect clinically relevant treatment effects, whereas a lower value in a larger study could represent substantial improvements.  Furthermore, the focus should shift towards examining effect sizes and confidence intervals alongside R-squared, adhering to principles of statistical rigor.  Ultimately, this paper advocates for a move toward a more holistic evaluation of treatment outcomes, prioritizing clinical relevance over a singular statistical measure.
