**Abstract**

Accurate delineation of pediatric brain tumors is paramount for effective treatment planning and monitoring. This study investigated the comparative performance of two deep learning architectures – nnU-Net and DeepMedic – for automated segmentation of these lesions from multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. Utilizing a combined internal and external validation cohort, we assessed the segmentation accuracy of each model. Results demonstrated a statistically significant advantage for nnU-Net across both datasets. Specifically, nnU-Net exhibited superior Dice scores and Hausdorff distances, indicative of improved boundary precision and reduced false positives/negatives, compared to DeepMedic. These findings suggest that nnU-Net’s adaptive, self-configuring architecture provides enhanced generalization capabilities within the complex anatomical context of pediatric brain tumors. Further research will explore the clinical implications of this improved segmentation accuracy and its potential to optimize treatment strategies and patient outcomes.
