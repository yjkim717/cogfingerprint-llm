**The Contextual Utility of R-Squared in Clinical Regression Models: A Narrative Review**

**Abstract**

The R-squared (R²) statistic is a ubiquitous yet frequently misinterpreted measure of model fit in clinical research. This narrative review critically appraises the application and interpretation of R² within clinical medicine, arguing against its use as a standalone metric for assessing model validity or predictive power. We contend that the clinical meaningfulness of a specific R² value is inherently context-dependent, varying significantly with the study design, the clinical domain under investigation, and the inherent biological variability of the outcome measure. Our synthesis of the literature demonstrates that in many complex clinical settings, such as predicting individual patient outcomes, even low R² values can be statistically significant and clinically informative. Conversely, a high R² does not necessarily imply clinical utility or causal relationships. We propose that an R² value exceeding 15% often signifies a meaningful effect size worthy of further clinical consideration, but this threshold must be integrated with domain expertise, confidence intervals, and other model diagnostics. The conclusion emphasizes that R² should be interpreted not in isolation, but as one component of a holistic analytical framework, always subordinate to clinical judgment and biological plausibility for deriving actionable insights in patient care.
