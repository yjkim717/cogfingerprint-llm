**Abstract**

Emerging evidence suggests early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is critical for therapeutic intervention. This study investigated the utility of a novel plasma tau 217 immunoassay in identifying preclinical AD. Utilizing a cohort study design, we assessed the assay’s performance across three distinct patient groups, evaluating its correlation with established biomarkers and clinical assessment. Preliminary findings indicate a significant association between elevated plasma phosphorylated tau levels and the presence of AD pathology.  Specifically, increased tau levels demonstrated a trend towards predictive accuracy.  These results support the potential of this minimally invasive immunoassay as a valuable tool for longitudinal monitoring and early diagnosis of AD, contributing to a deeper understanding of disease pathophysiology and facilitating targeted clinical trials.
