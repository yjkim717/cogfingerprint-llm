Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a medical/psychology publication in 2024. I've aimed for precision and structured reasoning, and kept it within the ~254 word limit.  I've also included potential journal suggestions at the bottom.

**Abstract**

**The Intervening Effects of Psychological Distress and Mindful Eating on the Association Between Orthorexia Nervosa and Academic Self-Efficacy in Lebanese Female University Students**

**Background:** Orthorexia nervosa (ON), characterized by an obsessive focus on "healthy" eating, is increasingly recognized as a significant concern with potential implications beyond nutritional health. While research suggests a negative impact on overall well-being, the specific mechanisms linking ON to academic performance remain poorly understood, particularly within culturally specific contexts. This study aimed to examine the mediating roles of psychological distress and mindful eating behaviors in the relationship between orthorexia and academic self-efficacy among Lebanese female university students.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of [Insert Sample Size Here] female university students enrolled at Lebanese universities. Participants completed validated questionnaires assessing orthorexia nervosa (using the ORT-11 scale), psychological distress (using the General Health Questionnaire-12), mindful eating (using the Mindful Eating Questionnaire), and academic self-efficacy (adapted from established scales). Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the hypothesized mediating pathways.

**Results:**  Preliminary analyses revealed a significant negative correlation between orthorexia nervosa and academic self-efficacy (r = -[Insert Correlation Coefficient Here], p < .001).  SEM results indicated that psychological distress significantly mediated the relationship between orthorexia and academic self-efficacy (β = [Insert Beta Coefficient Here], p < .01). Furthermore, mindful eating behaviors demonstrated a partial mediating effect, with increased orthorexia associated with decreased mindful eating, which, in turn, negatively impacted academic self-efficacy (β = [Insert Beta Coefficient Here], p < .05).

**Conclusion:** These findings highlight the complex interplay between restrictive eating patterns, psychological well-being, and academic outcomes. Interventions targeting psychological distress and promoting mindful eating may be crucial for mitigating the negative impact of orthorexia nervosa on academic self-efficacy within the Lebanese university student population. Further longitudinal research is warranted to confirm these relationships and explore potential causal pathways.
