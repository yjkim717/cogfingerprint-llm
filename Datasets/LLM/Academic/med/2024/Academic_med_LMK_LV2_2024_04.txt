The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Breast Cancer provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical management and systemic therapy. This review examines the application of NCCN Guidelines in breast cancer treatment, focusing on optimizing systemic therapy for diverse breast cancer subtypes. By analyzing current clinical practices and emerging research, we assess the impact of guideline adherence on patient outcomes. Our analysis underscores the importance of tailored systemic therapy in improving treatment efficacy and patient survival, highlighting the role of NCCN Guidelines in informing oncology practice in 2024.
