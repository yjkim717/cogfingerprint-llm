**Abstract**

Recent advances in immunoassay technology offer promising avenues for early Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) diagnosis. This single-center cohort study, conducted in 2024, investigates the diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) immunoassay in identifying AD pathophysiology. Preliminary findings suggest a strong correlation between elevated plasma p-tau217 levels and indicators of AD pathology. Further research is warranted to validate these results across diverse populations and assess clinical utility in routine diagnostic workflows.
