**Abstract**

The management of advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) has been historically dominated by cytotoxic chemotherapy, with limited long-term outcomes. The phase 3 CheckMate 649 trial initially established nivolumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, combined with chemotherapy as a first-line standard, based on significant improvements in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). This analysis presents the pivotal 3-year follow-up data, confirming the durability of this clinical benefit. With extended observation, the nivolumab-chemotherapy regimen continues to demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful OS advantage over chemotherapy alone, effectively reducing the risk of death. Similarly, the PFS benefit remains robust, indicating sustained disease control and a delay in radiographic progression. The long-term safety profile is consistent with the known spectra of the individual agents, with no new safety signals identified. These enduring efficacy outcomes, now observable in a substantial proportion of patients at the three-year mark, solidify the role of combined immunotherapy in disrupting the therapeutic paradigm for advanced GEA. The data underscore that the addition of nivolumab to first-line chemotherapy provides a durable survival advantage, translating into a meaningful long-term clinical outcome for a patient population with a previously poor prognosis. Consequently, these 3-year findings from CheckMate 649 provide definitive evidence supporting the continued use of nivolumab plus chemotherapy as the reference first-line treatment for eligible patients with advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.
