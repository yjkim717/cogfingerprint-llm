**Abstract**

The sustained efficacy of immunotherapy in oncology necessitates a deeper understanding of patient stratification and treatment response. This study examines the impact of combining nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, with standard chemotherapy regimens in patients harboring advanced adenocarcinoma. Leveraging data from a three-year follow-up of the CheckMate 649 trial, we observed a statistically significant enhancement in key clinical outcomes. Specifically, the combination exhibited superior overall survival (OS) compared to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio = 0.78, p<0.001). Furthermore, progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORR) were markedly improved – demonstrating a 32% and 25% increase, respectively (p<0.01).  These benefits were primarily observed within a cohort of patients exhibiting a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) and elevated circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts, alongside PD-L1 combined positivity (CPS ≥ 5).  These findings reinforce the value of incorporating immune checkpoint blockade into the treatment paradigm for advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma, warranting further investigation into predictive biomarkers and optimal dosing strategies.
