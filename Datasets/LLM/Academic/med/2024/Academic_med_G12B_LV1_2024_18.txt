**Contemporary Systemic Therapy Strategies in Nonmetastatic Breast Cancer: An Integrated Approach Informed by NCCN Guidelines (2024 Update)**

The management of nonmetastatic breast cancer has undergone significant evolution, demanding a sophisticated and individualized therapeutic approach. This review synthesizes recent updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, focusing on systemic therapy strategies employed in both the preoperative and adjuvant settings. We examine the expanding role of targeted therapies, including PI3K inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates, alongside established cytotoxic agents.  A multidisciplinary framework, integrating medical oncology with surgical and radiation oncology, is underscored as crucial for optimizing patient outcomes.  Furthermore, we address the integration of genomic profiling to guide treatment selection and the evolving landscape of immunotherapy in specific molecular subtypes.  This analysis aims to provide a concise overview of current best practices, emphasizing personalized treatment algorithms and the importance of adherence to guideline-recommended approaches for improved disease-free and overall survival.
