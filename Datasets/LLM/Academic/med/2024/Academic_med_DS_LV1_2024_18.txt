In 2024, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for invasive breast cancer continue to emphasize a multidisciplinary framework for clinical management. This abstract synthesizes the updated recommendations for systemic therapy in the nonmetastatic setting. The guidelines delineate evidence-based treatment algorithms, incorporating tumor biology, genomic profiling, and risk stratification to personalize therapeutic selection. Key considerations include the integration of neoadjuvant and adjuvant modalities, encompassing cytotoxic chemotherapy, targeted agents, and endocrine therapy. This structured approach aims to optimize oncologic outcomes while mitigating treatment-related morbidity, underscoring the imperative of coordinated care among surgical, medical, and radiation oncology specialists to enhance patient survival and quality of life.
