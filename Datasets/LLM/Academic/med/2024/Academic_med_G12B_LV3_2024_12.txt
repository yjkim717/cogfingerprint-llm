**Abstract**

The escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) necessitates exploration of effective therapeutic interventions beyond conventional medical management. This pooled analysis, integrating data from four contemporaneous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted between 2018 and 2024, investigates the comparative efficacy of bariatric surgery versus ongoing medical and lifestyle interventions for individuals with T2DM. Findings demonstrate a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in long-term glycemic control among patients undergoing bariatric procedures (p < 0.001). Specifically, surgery was associated with a marked reduction in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels sustained over a period of three to five years post-intervention. Furthermore, a substantial decrease in reliance on anti-diabetic medications was observed within the surgical cohort, alongside significantly higher rates of diabetes remission defined as HbA1c < 6.0% without pharmacological intervention. These results underscore bariatric surgery as a potentially transformative therapeutic strategy for select individuals with T2DM, offering improved metabolic outcomes and reduced dependence on chronic medication. Further research is warranted to delineate optimal patient selection criteria and to comprehensively evaluate long-term safety profiles and cost-effectiveness within diverse healthcare systems.



I aimed for formal language, precise terminology (HbA1c, RCT), and a structured argument (introduction of the problem, methodology, findings, and implications).
