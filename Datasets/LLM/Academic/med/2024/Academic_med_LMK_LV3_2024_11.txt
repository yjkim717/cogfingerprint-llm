Title: Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning Models for Autosegmentation of Pediatric Brain Tumors: nnU-Net vs. DeepMedic


#### Abstract

Pediatric brain tumors pose a significant challenge in neuro-oncology due to their diverse histological and molecular characteristics. Accurate segmentation of these tumors is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome prediction. Recent advancements in deep learning have revolutionized the field of medical imaging, enabling the development of sophisticated autosegmentation models. This study compares the performance of two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures, nnU-Net and DeepMedic, for the autosegmentation of pediatric brain tumors using multiparametric magnetic resonance (MR) images. A retrospective dataset comprising MR images of pediatric patients diagnosed with brain tumors was utilized. The images included multiple sequences such as T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR. Both nnU-Net and DeepMedic models were trained and validated on this dataset, with their performance evaluated using metrics such as Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and average surface distance (ASD). Our results demonstrate that nnU-Net outperformed DeepMedic in segmenting pediatric brain tumors, achieving a higher DSC (0.92 ± 0.03 vs. 0.85 ± 0.05, p < 0.001) and lower HD (2.15 ± 0.87 mm vs. 3.42 ± 1.21 mm, p < 0.001). The superior performance of nnU-Net can be attributed to its robust and self-configuring architecture, which enables effective exploitation of the available training data. Furthermore, nnU-Net's ability to handle varying tumor morphologies and image characteristics contributed to its enhanced accuracy. The findings of this study have significant implications for clinical practice, as accurate autosegmentation of pediatric brain tumors can facilitate timely diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. The integration of nnU-Net into clinical workflows has the potential to improve patient outcomes by reducing the inter-rater variability associated with manual segmentation. In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of nnU-Net as a reliable and efficient tool for autosegmentation of pediatric brain tumors, paving the way for further research into its clinical applications and integration with other diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.
