In this 2024 cross-sectional investigation, we examined the complex interrelationships between orthorexia nervosa (ON), psychological distress, mindful eating behaviors, and academic self-efficacy among female university students in Lebanon (N=412). Utilizing structural equation modeling, we hypothesized that psychological distress and focused eating would fully mediate the ON-academic self-efficacy relationship. Participants completed validated measures including the ORTO-R, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales, Mindful Eating Questionnaire, and Academic Self-Efficacy Scale. Our mediation analysis revealed significant indirect pathways: ON symptomatology predicted heightened psychological distress (β=0.38, p<0.001), which subsequently diminished academic self-efficacy (β=-0.42, p<0.001). Simultaneously, ON was associated with more focused eating behaviors (β=0.31, p<0.001), though this pathway demonstrated a weaker protective effect on academic outcomes (β=0.16, p<0.05). Crucially, the direct ON-academic self-efficacy pathway was non-significant when accounting for mediators (β=-0.07, p=0.212), supporting full mediation. These findings underscore the critical role of psychological mechanisms in understanding how disordered eating patterns manifest in academic contexts, suggesting that interventions targeting distress regulation may prove more effective than nutritional approaches alone in supporting student functioning.
