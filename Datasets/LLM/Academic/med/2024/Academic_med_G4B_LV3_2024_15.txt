**Abstract**

The interpretation of R-squared values within clinical medicine necessitates a nuanced approach, extending beyond conventional statistical significance testing. While commonly employed to assess model fit, the practical utility of an R-squared value is profoundly influenced by the inherent complexity of clinical datasets and the specific research question. This study proposes a contextualized framework for evaluating R-squared, advocating for a threshold of 15% or greater as indicative of a clinically meaningful association in many applications.  However, we argue that a rigid adherence to this value alone is insufficient; consideration must be given to the number of predictors, sample size, and the potential for overfitting. Furthermore, the paper highlights the importance of diagnostic regression techniques to ensure the predictive model’s validity and generalizability.  Ultimately, robust clinical regression demands a comprehensive assessment incorporating statistical rigor alongside pragmatic interpretation, moving beyond simple R-squared values to truly inform clinical decision-making in 2024.
