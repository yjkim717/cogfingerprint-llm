Title: Integrating Germline Mutation Testing into Breast Cancer Management: A Paradigm Shift Guided by the ASCO-SO Guidelines

Abstract:

The advent of precision medicine has revolutionized the management of breast cancer, with germline mutation testing emerging as a pivotal tool in identifying patients who may benefit from targeted therapies. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the Society of Surgical Oncology (SSO) have jointly issued guidelines recommending BRCA1/2 testing for patients with breast cancer based on specific clinical criteria, including age, family history, and eligibility for PARP inhibitor therapy. This abstract reviews the current landscape of germline mutation testing in breast cancer management and discusses the implications of the ASCO-SO guidelines for clinical practice.

Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes significantly increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. The identification of pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations not only informs cancer risk assessment but also guides treatment decisions. Patients with BRCA1/2 mutations are eligible for PARP inhibitor therapy, which has been shown to improve progression-free survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The ASCO-SO guidelines recommend BRCA1/2 testing for patients with breast cancer diagnosed at a young age, those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those with specific tumor characteristics.

The integration of germline mutation testing into breast cancer management necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, with genetic counseling playing a crucial role in the pre- and post-test counseling process. Genetic counselors facilitate informed decision-making by patients, provide risk assessment, and guide the interpretation of test results. The ASCO-SO guidelines emphasize the importance of pre-test counseling to ensure that patients understand the implications of germline mutation testing, including the potential for variant of unknown significance (VUS) results and the psychological impact of positive test results.

The implementation of the ASCO-SO guidelines is expected to standardize BRCA1/2 testing practices and improve patient outcomes. By identifying patients who are eligible for PARP inhibitor therapy, germline mutation testing can inform treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, the identification of BRCA1/2 mutations can facilitate cascade testing for family members, enabling early detection and prevention strategies. As the field of precision medicine continues to evolve, the role of germline mutation testing in breast cancer management is likely to expand, underscoring the need for ongoing education and training for healthcare providers.
