**Abstract**

The rising prevalence of breast cancer and advancements in targeted therapies have prompted a re-evaluation of germline mutation testing strategies. This review, informed by the 2024 ASCOâ€“Society of Surgical Oncology guideline, examines the current landscape of germline testing in breast cancer management. Core recommendations prioritize BRCA1/2 mutation assessment for patients meeting specific criteria, including those with early-onset disease, triple-negative breast cancer, or a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Furthermore, the guideline advocates for judicious consideration of expanded germline testing panels, particularly in contexts where family history is complex or when treatment decisions may be influenced by identifying mutations impacting therapeutic response or prognosis. Genetic counseling remains integral to this process, ensuring informed consent, accurate risk assessment, and appropriate cascade testing within families. This updated guidance aims to optimize patient care and facilitate personalized treatment approaches within cancer genetics.
