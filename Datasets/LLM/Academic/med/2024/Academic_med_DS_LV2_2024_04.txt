This 2024 review synthesizes the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for the systemic therapy of nonmetastatic breast cancer. We analyze the multidisciplinary, evidence-based recommendations governing clinical management, including neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment modalities. The analysis focuses on the stratification of therapeutic regimens—encompassing chemotherapy, endocrine, and targeted biologic agents—based on tumor biology, stage, and biomarker profiles. This structured framework aims to optimize oncologic outcomes by tailoring systemic interventions to individual patient and disease characteristics, thereby providing a critical resource for standardizing and personalizing contemporary breast cancer care.
