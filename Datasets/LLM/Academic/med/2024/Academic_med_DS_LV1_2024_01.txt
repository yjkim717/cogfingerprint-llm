**Abstract**

The interpretation of R-squared (R²) as a measure of explained variance in clinical regression models remains a subject of considerable debate, often leading to its misapplication in research and practice. This narrative review synthesizes current literature to critically evaluate the utility of R² within the specific context of clinical medicine. We posit that the clinical meaningfulness of an R² value is not absolute but is intrinsically dependent on the research context, including the physiological complexity of the outcome, measurement precision, and the model's intended purpose (e.g., prediction versus etiological inference). Our analysis indicates that in complex, multifactorial clinical scenarios—such as modeling disease progression or treatment response—even modest R² values can hold significant value. Contrary to arbitrary high thresholds often imported from other disciplines, we find that values exceeding 15% frequently denote a meaningful association when the outcome is influenced by numerous unmeasured genetic, environmental, and behavioral determinants. Consequently, we advocate for a paradigm shift away from isolated R² interpretation toward a holistic assessment that integrates domain knowledge, confidence intervals, and other model diagnostics to accurately gauge a model's clinical relevance and utility for informing patient care.
