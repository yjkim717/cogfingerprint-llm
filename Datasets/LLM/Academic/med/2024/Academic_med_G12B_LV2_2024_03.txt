**Abstract**

Recent advancements in immunoassay technology offer promising avenues for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. This prospective cohort study, conducted in 2024, evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of a novel plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217) immunoassay in reflecting underlying AD pathophysiology. Utilizing observational cohort data, we assessed the assay's performance in identifying individuals exhibiting AD-related biomarkers. Preliminary findings suggest a strong correlation between elevated plasma p-tau217 levels and established indicators of AD, demonstrating potential as a valuable tool for non-invasive screening and disease monitoring. Further investigation is warranted to validate these results across diverse populations.
