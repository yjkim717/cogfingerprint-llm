**Abstract**

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains a significant clinical challenge, necessitating a nuanced and evidence-based systemic therapeutic approach. This review synthesizes current recommendations for mCRC systemic therapy as delineated in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, updated through January 2024. The cornerstone of treatment continues to be combination chemotherapy regimens, frequently incorporating oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and fluorouracil/capecitabine, often in conjunction with targeted therapies.  Significant advancements in targeted molecular therapies, including anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab) and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents (bevacizumab, ramucizumab), have demonstrably improved progression-free and overall survival, particularly in patients with specific RAS/BRAF mutational profiles.  The integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors, while showing promise in select patient populations with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) tumors, remains a more specialized application.  This review summarizes the algorithmic approach to treatment selection, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive molecular profiling to guide personalized therapy and optimize patient outcomes in the evolving landscape of mCRC management. Future directions include exploring novel targeted agents and combination strategies, and refining biomarker-driven patient stratification.
