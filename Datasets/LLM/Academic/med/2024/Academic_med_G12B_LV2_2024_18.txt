**Abstract**

This review summarizes recent revisions to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines pertaining to systemic therapy for nonmetastatic breast cancer, reflecting updates as of 2024. The focus is on contemporary approaches to both preoperative and adjuvant settings, emphasizing the evolving landscape of pharmacological interventions. The updated guidelines underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, integrating medical oncology with surgical and radiation oncology to optimize patient outcomes. Key considerations include refinements in endocrine therapy selection, the expanding role of targeted therapies based on biomarker status (e.g., HER2, PIK3CA), and strategies for incorporating chemotherapy based on risk stratification. This analysis highlights the ongoing efforts to personalize treatment regimens, balancing efficacy with minimization of adverse effects, ultimately aiming to improve disease-free survival and quality of life for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Further research investigating novel combinations and sequencing strategies remains crucial.
