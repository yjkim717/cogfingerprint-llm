**Abstract**

The 2024 NCCN guidelines represent a significant update in the management of nonmetastatic breast cancer, emphasizing refined approaches to systemic therapy. This document synthesizes current evidence to inform clinical decision-making, particularly regarding adjuvant and neoadjuvant regimens.  Recommendations prioritize individualized treatment strategies, considering factors such as tumor subtype, biomarker status (e.g., ER, PR, HER2), and patient comorbidities.  Specifically, the guidelines detail updated recommendations for endocrine therapy sequencing, targeted agent incorporation, and the role of chemotherapy in high-risk disease.  Further, they address emerging data regarding novel systemic therapies and strategies for minimizing treatment-related toxicities.  Adherence to these updated NCCN guidelines is critical for optimizing patient outcomes and ensuring consistent, evidence-based care within the evolving landscape of nonmetastatic breast cancer treatment in 2024.
