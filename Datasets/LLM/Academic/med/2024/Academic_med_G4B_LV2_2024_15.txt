**Abstract**

The application of regression models within clinical medicine necessitates a nuanced understanding of key statistical metrics, notably the coefficient of determination, R-squared. While frequently employed to assess model fit, the interpretation of R-squared values remains a subject of ongoing discussion and potential misapplication. This paper examines the contextual dependence of R-squared in clinical settings, arguing that a conventionally ‘significant’ value is no longer universally accepted as exceeding 0.15.  

Historically, a threshold of 0.70 has been applied, but recent methodological advancements and the increasing complexity of multifactorial patient outcomes demand a more pragmatic approach. We posit that R-squared’s value should be evaluated in conjunction with effect sizes, clinical relevance, and the specific research question.  Furthermore, the presence of multicollinearity strongly influences R-squared’s reliability, often artificially inflating the value without reflecting true predictive power. 

This analysis underscores the critical need for researchers and clinicians alike to move beyond simplistic reliance on R-squared alone.  Future investigations should prioritize transparent reporting of both R-squared and associated diagnostic accuracy measures, alongside a rigorous assessment of model assumptions, to ensure robust and meaningful conclusions in clinical medicine.  The study contributes to a more informed discourse regarding statistical interpretation in healthcare.
