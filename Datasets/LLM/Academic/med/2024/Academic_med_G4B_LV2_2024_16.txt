**Abstract**

Emerging evidence suggests early detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is crucial for therapeutic intervention. This study evaluated the diagnostic utility of a novel plasma tau 217 immunoassay in identifying preclinical AD across three independent cohorts. Utilizing a cohort study design, we assessed the assay’s sensitivity and specificity compared to established biomarkers and clinical diagnosis. Preliminary results indicate a promising correlation between elevated plasma phosphorylated tau levels and the presence of AD pathology.  The assay’s ability to detect subtle changes in tau protein prior to symptomatic disease warrants further investigation.  These findings contribute to a growing body of research exploring liquid biopsy approaches for AD pathophysiology and offer a potential tool for early diagnostic stratification within clinical trials.
