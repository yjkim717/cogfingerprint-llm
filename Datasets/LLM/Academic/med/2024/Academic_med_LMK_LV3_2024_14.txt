Title: Exploring the Mediating Role of Psychological Distress and Mindful Eating Behaviors in the Relationship Between Orthorexia Nervosa and Academic Self-Efficacy Among Lebanese University Students

Abstract:

Orthorexia nervosa (ON), characterized by an excessive preoccupation with healthy eating, has emerged as a significant concern among young adults, particularly university students. This study investigates the mediating effects of psychological distress and mindful eating behaviors on the relationship between ON and academic self-efficacy among Lebanese university female students. Using a cross-sectional design, data were collected from a sample of female students in 2024. The findings indicate that psychological distress and mindful eating behaviors significantly mediate the association between ON and academic self-efficacy. Specifically, higher levels of ON were associated with increased psychological distress and altered mindful eating behaviors, which in turn negatively impacted academic self-efficacy. The results underscore the importance of addressing ON and promoting healthy eating habits to enhance the academic performance and well-being of university students. The study's insights have implications for the development of targeted interventions to support the mental health and academic success of Lebanese university students.
