## Abstract: Contemporary Systemic Therapy Approaches for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: An Evidence-Based Review of NCCN Guidelines (2024)

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains a significant clinical challenge necessitating multimodal treatment strategies. This review synthesizes current systemic therapeutic recommendations for mCRC, as outlined in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, updated through 2024. The manuscript provides a structured overview of treatment algorithms, emphasizing the crucial role of molecular profiling, particularly *RAS* and *BRAF* mutational status, in guiding therapeutic selection. First-line therapy typically involves a combination of fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy with an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent or an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibody, dependent on patient performance status and tumor characteristics. Subsequent lines of therapy incorporate targeted agents, including BRAF inhibitors for *BRAF*-mutated tumors, and increasingly, antibody-drug conjugates. The review details considerations for specific patient populations, such as those with mismatch repair deficiency/high microsatellite instability (dMMR/MSI-H) who benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors.  Finally, the abstract highlights ongoing research and emerging therapeutic strategies impacting the evolving landscape of mCRC management, aligning with the latest NCCN recommendations.
