**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cancer immunotherapy has witnessed remarkable progress, with adoptive T-cell therapy, particularly chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells and T-cell receptor (TCR) engineered T-cells, emerging as a transformative therapeutic modality. However, limitations inherent to conventional approaches, including tumor heterogeneity, antigen escape, and potential for on-target, off-tumor toxicity, necessitate innovative strategies to enhance efficacy and safety. Recent advancements in CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology have provided unprecedented opportunities to refine and improve these adoptive cellular therapies. This review synthesizes the current landscape of CRISPR/Cas9-modified TCR/CAR T-cell therapy, focusing on strategies employed to overcome existing challenges in cancer treatment. We detail applications of CRISPR/Cas9 for enhancing CAR T-cell specificity, eliminating inhibitory receptors, disrupting immunosuppressive pathways (e.g., PD-1, CTLA-4), and improving T-cell persistence *in vivo*. Furthermore, we explore the implementation of CRISPR/Cas9 to engineer TCR T-cells with enhanced recognition of tumor-associated antigens and improved targeting of intracellular epitopes. A critical appraisal of ongoing clinical trials employing these approaches is presented, alongside a discussion of potential hurdles, including off-target effects, delivery challenges, and the durability of therapeutic responses. Despite these considerations, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated engineering of TCR/CAR T-cells holds immense promise for expanding the applicability of adoptive T-cell therapy and ultimately improving outcomes for patients with diverse malignancies.
