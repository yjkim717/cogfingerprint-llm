**Abstract**

The escalating global burden of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) necessitates the development of sensitive and accessible biomarkers for early detection and intervention. This study investigated the utility of plasma phosphorylated total tau 231 (p-tau231) as a prospective biomarker for identifying preclinical AD pathology. Utilizing a novel single molecule array (Simoa) platform, we quantified p-tau231 levels in a cohort of individuals with varying degrees of cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative disease risk. Our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between plasma p-tau231 concentrations and established measures of tau pathology, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau levels and amyloid deposition as assessed via PET imaging. Notably, elevated plasma p-tau231 levels were detected in participants exhibiting minimal or no amyloid pathology, significantly preceding the detection thresholds typically observed with established amyloid PET imaging techniques. 

These results provide compelling evidence that plasma p-tau231 represents a robust and sensitive biomarker capable of reflecting early tau pathology in AD. The ability to identify individuals with preclinical disease based on a readily obtainable blood sample offers a transformative opportunity for longitudinal studies and potential therapeutic monitoring. Further investigation is warranted to determine the predictive value of plasma p-tau231 across diverse populations and to explore its integration with other established biomarkers within a comprehensive diagnostic framework.  This work contributes significantly to the evolving landscape of AD diagnostics and underscores the potential of liquid biopsy approaches for managing this debilitating neurodegenerative disorder (2021).
