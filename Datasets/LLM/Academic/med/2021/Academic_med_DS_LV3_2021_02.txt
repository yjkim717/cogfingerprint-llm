**Title:** Plasma Phosphorylated Tau at Threonine-231 as a Precocious Biomarker for Incipient Alzheimer's Disease Neuropathology

**Abstract:**

The protracted and clinically silent progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) underscores the critical need for accessible and sensitive biomarkers capable of identifying pathology in its earliest, pre-symptomatic stages. While amyloid-β positron emission tomography (Aβ-PET) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses represent the gold standard for *in vivo* detection of amyloidosis, their cost, invasiveness, and limited scalability hinder widespread implementation in preventative clinical trials and primary care settings. Consequently, the development of robust plasma-based biomarkers has become a paramount objective in AD research. This study comprehensively evaluates the diagnostic and prognostic utility of plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine-231 (p-tau231) as a biomarker for incipient AD pathology, directly comparing its performance against established plasma markers and Aβ-PET status.

We conducted a multi-center, cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis involving 300 cognitively unimpaired older adults and 150 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). All participants underwent extensive clinical assessment, Aβ-PET imaging, and venipuncture for plasma biomarker analysis, including p-tau231, p-tau181, neurofilament light chain (NfL), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). A subset of participants (n=50) subsequently underwent follow-up Aβ-PET scans to assess amyloid trajectory. Our analyses reveal that plasma p-tau231 concentrations demonstrate a superior ability to discriminate between Aβ-PET positive and Aβ-PET negative individuals, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95, significantly outperforming p-tau181 (AUC=0.88) and other plasma analytes.

Most notably, our data indicate that elevations in plasma p-tau231 are detectable at sub-threshold levels of amyloid accumulation, precisely within the "grey zone" of Aβ-PET Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) where traditional imaging dichotomization fails. Longitudinal analyses confirmed that individuals exhibiting elevated baseline p-tau231, despite being classified as Aβ-PET negative at that time point, demonstrated a significantly accelerated rate of amyloid plaque accumulation over 24 months, progressing to PET positivity faster than those with low p-tau231 levels. This finding positions p-tau231 not merely as a diagnostic correlate but as a dynamic, precocious indicator of the very earliest amyloidogenic processes. Mechanistically, this early rise likely reflects initial neuronal response to soluble Aβ oligomers, preceding widespread fibrillar plaque deposition detectable by PET.

In conclusion, our findings, situated within the 2021 research landscape, robustly establish plasma p-tau231 as a highly accurate and early peripheral biomarker for incipient Alzheimer's disease pathology. Its ability to identify at-risk individuals prior to conventional Aβ-PET positivity thresholds holds profound implications for enriching prevention trials with truly pre-symptomatic candidates and for paving the way towards a cost-effective, blood-based screening paradigm in aging populations.
