**Abstract**

The 2021 NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer represent a significant refinement of adjuvant systemic therapy protocols for patients with early-stage, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. This document synthesizes current evidence to offer tailored recommendations, moving beyond traditional approaches to incorporate novel data regarding endocrine-based regimens. Specifically, the guidelines delineate preferred sequences utilizing aromatase inhibitors (AIs) or cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, often in combination with fulvestrant, reflecting advancements in understanding post-menopause breast cancer progression.  The updated recommendations emphasize individualized treatment strategies, considering factors such as tumor size, lymph node status, and patient comorbidities.  Adherence to these NCCN guidelines is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and minimizing the risk of recurrence in this prevalent subset of breast cancer patients.
