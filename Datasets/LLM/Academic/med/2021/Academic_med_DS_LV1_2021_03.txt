**Title:** The Synergistic Impact of Vascular Risk Burden on Neurodegenerative Trajectories in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease: A Multimodal Biomarker Study

**Abstract**

**Background:** The prevailing model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has historically centered on the primacy of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathology. However, growing evidence from 2021 underscores the critical contribution of vascular dysfunction to the AD pathophysiological cascade. While vascular risk factors (VRFs) such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia are established risk factors for cognitive impairment, their mechanistic interplay with core AD pathologies during the extended preclinical phase, when pathology accumulates silently, remains incompletely elucidated.

**Objective:** This study aimed to investigate the synergistic relationship between aggregate vascular risk burden and AD biomarker status in accelerating neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in a cognitively unimpaired, at-risk cohort.

**Methods:** We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 450 cognitively normal older adults from the Prospective Alzheimer's and Vascular Cohort (PAVC). Participants underwent comprehensive clinical assessment, 3T MRI for structural volumetry (focusing on hippocampal and cortical thickness), Florbetapir-PET for cerebral amyloid deposition, and CSF analysis for phosphorylated tau (p-tau). Vascular risk burden was quantified using the Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular risk score. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to examine the interaction between vascular risk burden and baseline Aβ status on longitudinal rates of brain atrophy and cognitive decline over a 36-month period.

**Results:** Our analyses revealed a significant multiplicative interaction between elevated vascular risk burden and Aβ-positivity. Specifically, Aβ+ individuals with high vascular risk demonstrated accelerated annualized rates of hippocampal atrophy (β = -0.12, p < 0.001) and decline in executive function (β = -0.28, p = 0.003) compared to Aβ+ individuals with low vascular risk or Aβ- groups, after controlling for age, sex, and APOE ε4 status. The association between vascular risk and neurodegeneration in Aβ- individuals was negligible.

**Conclusion:** These findings provide robust in vivo evidence that vascular risk burden does not merely represent a comorbid condition but acts synergistically with emerging Alzheimer's pathology to potentiate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in the preclinical phase. This underscores the imperative for integrated therapeutic strategies targeting both vascular health and amyloid pathways in pre-symptomatic AD intervention trials, potentially offering a critical window for mitigation before irreversible cognitive deficits manifest.
