**Abstract**

The management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has undergone significant advancements with the integration of novel systemic therapies. As reflected in the 2021 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Colon Cancer, the treatment landscape for mCRC has expanded to include checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, in addition to traditional chemotherapy. Biomarker testing has emerged as a crucial component in guiding treatment decisions, enabling clinicians to identify patients most likely to benefit from these therapies. Specifically, tumor profiling for microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) has informed the use of checkpoint inhibitors, while RAS and BRAF mutation status has directed the application of targeted agents. This review summarizes the current evidence supporting the use of these therapies in mCRC, highlighting the importance of biomarker-driven treatment selection in optimizing patient outcomes. By integrating these advances into clinical practice, clinicians can provide more effective and personalized care for patients with mCRC.
