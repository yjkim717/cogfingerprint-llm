**Abstract: Enhanced Precision in Adoptive T-Cell Therapies via CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Targeting**

Recent advancements in cancer immunotherapy have increasingly focused on adoptive T-cell therapies, yet challenges remain in achieving optimal tumor eradication and minimizing off-target effects. This study investigates the integration of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to refine the efficacy of adoptive T-cell treatments. Specifically, CRISPR/Cas9 facilitates targeted modification of T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, enabling enhanced specificity towards tumor-associated antigens and circumventing immune tolerance. Preliminary clinical trial data (2021) demonstrate that CRISPR-mediated enhancement of adoptive T-cell function, alongside CAR T-cell strategies, correlates with improved tumor regression rates and sustained anti-tumor responses.  Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the long-term safety profile and optimize delivery methods, but these findings suggest a paradigm shift towards more precise and effective cancer immunotherapy utilizing CRISPR/Cas9â€™s capacity for targeted cellular engineering.
