Title: Synergistic Interaction between Vascular Risk Factors and Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology in Cognitively Unimpaired Individuals: Implications for Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Decline

Abstract

The interplay between vascular risk factors (VRFs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of preclinical AD. As the population ages, understanding the complex relationships between VRFs, AD pathology, and cognitive decline is crucial for developing effective prevention and intervention strategies. This study investigates the hypothesis that VRF burden synergistically interacts with AD pathophysiology to accelerate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals.

A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals a significant association between VRFs, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, and an increased risk of AD. The presence of VRFs has been shown to exacerbate AD pathology, including amyloid-Î² deposition and tau phosphorylation, leading to accelerated neurodegeneration. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that VRFs are associated with cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals, particularly in those with preclinical AD.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the interaction between VRFs and AD are multifaceted. VRFs can lead to cerebral small vessel disease, characterized by white matter lesions and lacunar infarcts, which in turn can exacerbate AD pathology. Additionally, VRFs can disrupt the blood-brain barrier, leading to the accumulation of neurotoxic substances and inflammation, further contributing to neurodegeneration.

Our analysis suggests that the cumulative burden of VRFs synergistically interacts with AD pathophysiology to accelerate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of prevention and intervention strategies targeting VRFs in preclinical AD. Early identification and management of VRFs may mitigate the risk of AD and related cognitive decline, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive approach to risk factor management in the prevention of AD.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the synergistic interaction between VRFs and AD pathophysiology in cognitively unimpaired individuals. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to develop effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of AD.
