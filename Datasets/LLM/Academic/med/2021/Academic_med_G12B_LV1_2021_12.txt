Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a medical publication, and reflecting a 2021 context. I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and a word count around 422.

**Long-Term Mortality Outcomes Following Bariatric Surgery in a Severe Obesity Cohort: A Comparative Analysis of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy**

**Background:** The escalating global prevalence of severe obesity (Body Mass Index ≥ 40 kg/m², or ≥ 35 kg/m² with obesity-related comorbidities) represents a significant public health challenge, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. While lifestyle interventions are often initially recommended, surgical approaches, particularly bariatric surgery, have emerged as effective strategies for achieving substantial and sustained weight loss and improving associated health outcomes. The comparative effectiveness of different bariatric procedures, specifically Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), regarding long-term mortality remains a topic of ongoing investigation.

**Methods:** This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from [Insert Fictional National Database Name, e.g., the National Bariatric Outcomes Registry (NBOR)] encompassing [Insert Fictional Number, e.g., 15,000] patients diagnosed with severe obesity who underwent either RYGB (n=[Insert Fictional Number, e.g., 6,000]) or SG (n=[Insert Fictional Number, e.g., 5,000]) between January 2008 and December 2018. A propensity score matching analysis was employed to minimize confounding variables related to patient demographics, comorbidities (including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease), and baseline health status.  The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, assessed through linkage with national mortality records up to December 2020. Secondary outcomes included major adverse events (MAEs) within 30 days of surgery, and the incidence of specific mortality causes (cardiovascular, cancer, and other). Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for matched covariates.

**Results:**  After propensity score matching, the RYGB and SG groups demonstrated comparable baseline characteristics.  The overall cumulative incidence of mortality at 10 years was significantly lower in both surgical groups compared to a matched nonsurgical control group (n=[Insert Fictional Number, e.g., 4,000]).  RYGB demonstrated a nominally lower, though not statistically significant (HR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.65-1.04, p=0.11) mortality risk compared to SG.  Analysis of specific mortality causes suggested a trend toward reduced cardiovascular mortality in the RYGB group (HR=0.75, 95% CI: 0.54-1.04, p=0.09), although this did not reach statistical significance.  The SG group exhibited
