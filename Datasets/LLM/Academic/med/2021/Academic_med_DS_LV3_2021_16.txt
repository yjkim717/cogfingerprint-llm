**Title:** Plasma p-tau231 as an Early and Robust Biomarker of Incipient Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology: Validation Across Clinical and Neuropathological Cohorts

**Abstract**

The escalating global prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) underscores the critical need for accessible, cost-effective, and highly sensitive biomarkers capable of detecting the earliest phases of pathophysiology, particularly during the preclinical and prodromal stages. While established biomarkers, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays and amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET), have been instrumental in defining the AT(N) framework, their high cost, invasiveness, and limited scalability impede widespread implementation in clinical screening and therapeutic trials. Consequently, the focus has shifted towards blood-based biomarkers that can accurately reflect central AD processes. Among the most promising candidates are phosphorylated tau (p-tau) species in plasma, which exhibit specificity for AD tau pathology. This study comprehensively evaluates the diagnostic and prognostic utility of a novel plasma biomarker, p-tau231, in detecting incipient AD pathology, positioning it against established markers such as plasma p-tau181 and Aβ PET.

We conducted a multi-cohort investigation encompassing cognitively unimpaired individuals, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a cohort with confirmed post-mortem neuropathology. Plasma p-tau231 concentrations were measured using a novel single-molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay. Our primary objective was to determine the accuracy of p-tau231 in identifying individuals with abnormal Aβ accumulation, as defined by the reference standard of Aβ PET. Secondary analyses assessed its correlation with tau PET burden, its trajectory across the clinical disease spectrum, and its concordance with post-mortem Braak staging.

The results demonstrate that plasma p-tau231 achieves exceptional diagnostic performance, significantly differentiating Aβ-positive from Aβ-negative individuals with high accuracy (Area Under the Curve >0.95). Notably, our longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses reveal that the increase in plasma p-tau231 emerges at a very early stage, preceding the established thresholds for Aβ PET positivity and elevations in other plasma biomarkers, including p-tau181. This suggests that p-tau231 is among the earliest detectable peripheral signals of nascent AD-related tau phosphorylation. Furthermore, in the neuropathologically confirmed cohort, p-tau231 levels showed a strong correlation with the burden of paired helical filament tau tangles, affirming its fidelity to core neuropathological hallmarks.

In conclusion, our findings, generated in 2021, robustly validate plasma p-tau231 as a leading-edge biomarker for the detection of incipient Alzheimer's disease pathology. Its superior early-phase sensitivity, non-invasive nature, and strong correlation with both in vivo amyloid and tau pathology and post-mortem confirmation position it as a transformative tool. The implementation of plasma p-tau231 has profound implications for refining participant selection in preclinical AD trials aimed at secondary prevention and for facilitating the development of scalable, population-wide screening protocols to identify individuals at risk for progressive cognitive decline.
