**Abstract**

The treatment landscape for resected esophageal and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancers has undergone a significant shift following the publication of results from the CheckMate 577 trial. This randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase III study evaluated the efficacy of adjuvant nivolumab in patients who had undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and subsequent surgical resection. The findings, released in 2021, demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in disease-free survival (DFS) with nivolumab compared to placebo. This represents a pivotal advancement, addressing the persistent risk of recurrence following standard surgical approaches combined with neoadjuvant therapy.  Specifically, the data suggests that immune checkpoint inhibition with nivolumab effectively targets residual micrometastatic disease, thereby prolonging DFS in this high-risk patient population.  The observed benefit underscores the potential of immunotherapy to transform adjuvant treatment strategies for esophageal and GEJ cancers. Further research is warranted to investigate the optimal duration of nivolumab administration, identify predictive biomarkers for response, and explore combination strategies to maximize therapeutic efficacy and mitigate potential immune-related adverse events. These findings have substantial implications for clinical practice and necessitate revisions to treatment guidelines for resected esophageal and GEJ cancers.
