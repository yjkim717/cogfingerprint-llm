**Abstract**

The accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a critical challenge in neurology. While amyloid-β imaging has been a cornerstone of AD diagnosis, its limited sensitivity in early disease stages necessitates the exploration of alternative diagnostic modalities. This study presents the development and validation of a novel, highly sensitive plasma p-tau231 assay, demonstrating its potential to significantly improve AD detection and differential diagnosis. Utilizing a cohort of individuals with varying degrees of neuropathological confirmation, including those with AD, other neurodegenerative disorders, and cognitively normal controls, we observed robust correlation between plasma p-tau231 levels and underlying AD pathology. Notably, the assay exhibited superior accuracy in distinguishing AD from other dementias, including frontotemporal dementia and vascular dementia. Furthermore, our findings indicate that elevated plasma p-tau231 concentrations are detectable prior to amyloid-β PET positivity in a substantial proportion of AD patients, suggesting its utility in identifying preclinical AD pathology. These results provide compelling evidence that plasma p-tau231 represents a promising biomarker for AD, facilitating earlier and more accurate diagnosis, potentially enabling therapeutic interventions at a stage when they may be most effective. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to further characterize the prognostic value of this biomarker and its integration into clinical diagnostic algorithms.
