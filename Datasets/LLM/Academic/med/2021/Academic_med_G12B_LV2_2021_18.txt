**Evolving Adjuvant Systemic Therapy Strategies for Early-Stage, Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer: A Review of NCCN Guideline Updates (2021)**

The management of early-stage, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer has undergone significant refinement in recent years. This review summarizes key updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for adjuvant systemic therapy, reflecting advancements in understanding disease biology and treatment efficacy as of 2021. The revised guidelines emphasize the increasing role of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6) in combination with endocrine therapy for patients with high-risk features, including lymph node involvement and/or aggressive tumor biology. Furthermore, the guidelines address the integration of genomic assays to inform treatment decisions, particularly regarding the potential benefit of chemotherapy. This analysis highlights the evolving landscape of adjuvant therapy, emphasizing personalized approaches to optimize patient outcomes and minimize treatment-related toxicities within the framework of established clinical practice guidelines.
