Title: Synergistic Effects of Vascular Risk Factors and Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology on Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Decline in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease


#### Abstract

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a complex interplay between various risk factors and pathophysiological mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that vascular risk factors (VRFs) play a crucial role in accelerating cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in individuals with preclinical AD. This study investigates the synergistic effects of VRF burden and AD pathophysiology on neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals.


A comprehensive analysis of data from a large cohort of cognitively unimpaired participants revealed a significant association between VRF burden and accelerated cognitive decline. The results showed that individuals with a higher VRF burden exhibited increased rates of neurodegeneration, as measured by atrophy in AD-vulnerable brain regions. Furthermore, the study found that the interaction between VRF burden and AD pathophysiology, as indicated by amyloid-Î² and tau biomarkers, synergistically accelerated neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between VRFs and AD pathophysiology in preclinical AD. The results suggest that VRFs may exacerbate AD-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline by compromising cerebrovascular function and promoting neuroinflammation. Moreover, the study highlights the importance of considering VRFs in the development of therapeutic strategies for preclinical AD.

The study's results are consistent with the notion that preclinical AD is characterized by a prolonged asymptomatic period during which various pathophysiological mechanisms, including VRFs and AD-related processes, interact and contribute to disease progression. The findings emphasize the need for early identification and management of VRFs in individuals with preclinical AD to potentially slow disease progression.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that VRF burden synergistically interacts with AD pathophysiology to accelerate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals. The results underscore the importance of addressing VRFs in the prevention and treatment of AD, and highlight the need for further research into the complex interplay between VRFs and AD pathophysiology in preclinical AD.
