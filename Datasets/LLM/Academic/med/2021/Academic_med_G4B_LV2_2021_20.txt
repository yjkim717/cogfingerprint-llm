**Abstract: Optimizing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Strategies in Breast Cancer: Recommendations from the 2021 ASCO Guideline**

The evolving landscape of breast cancer treatment necessitates robust, evidence-based guidelines to inform clinical decision-making. This abstract summarizes key recommendations from the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) in breast cancer, with particular emphasis on its application within a multidisciplinary care team framework. NCT, increasingly utilized to improve local control and overall survival, demands a tailored approach predicated on patient-specific risk stratification. 

The guideline advocates for a shift toward integrated, multidisciplinary care, emphasizing the crucial role of surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and pathologists in collaborative treatment planning.  Specifically, the 2021 ASCO recommendations delineate distinct strategies based on tumor subtype, encompassing considerations for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a particularly aggressive and challenging cohort.  TNBC patients, exhibiting a higher propensity for recurrence despite NCT, are highlighted as requiring intensified regimens and close monitoring. 

Furthermore, the guideline addresses risk stratification utilizing nomograms and clinical factors – including tumor size, grade, and lymph node status – to predict response to NCT and guide selection of chemotherapy agents. The emphasis on shared decision-making and patient engagement is underscored.  Ultimately, the 2021 ASCO guideline reinforces the importance of a comprehensive, team-based approach to NCT, aiming to maximize therapeutic efficacy and mitigate adverse events, thereby improving patient outcomes in the management of breast cancer.
