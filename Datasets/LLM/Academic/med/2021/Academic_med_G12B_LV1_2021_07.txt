**Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profiling Reveals Novel Prognostic Biomarkers in IDH1/2-Mutant Anaplastic Astrocytoma: Results from the CATNON Clinical Trial**

**Abstract**

Anaplastic astrocytoma, particularly those harboring mutations in *IDH1* and *IDH2*, represent a significant challenge in neuro-oncology due to their aggressive behavior and limited therapeutic options. While *IDH1/2* mutation status is a recognized prognostic factor, further refinement of risk stratification is crucial for guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. This study, leveraging data from the CATNON (Chemotherapy Adjuvant Treatment in Newly diagnosed Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma and Astrocytoma) clinical trial, investigated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in a cohort of *IDH1/2*-mutant anaplastic astrocytoma patients to identify novel biomarkers predictive of recurrence and overall survival (OS).

We performed reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) on tumor samples collected from CATNON participants, followed by rigorous quality control and bioinformatics analysis. Differential methylation analysis revealed a cohort of CpG sites exhibiting significantly altered methylation patterns between patients with favorable and unfavorable clinical outcomes.  These differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were subsequently integrated with clinical variables (age, performance status, MGMT promoter methylation status) to construct a multivariable prognostic model.

The resulting methylation-based prognostic index (MPI) demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in predictive accuracy compared to established clinical factors alone, as assessed by Harrell's C-index and time-dependent ROC analysis.  Specifically, patients with high MPI scores exhibited significantly shorter OS and increased risk of recurrence. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of genes overlapping with the identified DMRs suggested involvement of pathways related to cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis, providing potential mechanistic insights into the observed prognostic effect. These findings highlight the potential of DNA methylation profiling as a valuable adjunct to conventional clinical markers in risk stratification and personalized management of *IDH1/2*-mutant anaplastic astrocytoma, paving the way for future studies exploring the therapeutic targeting of these epigenetic modifications.
