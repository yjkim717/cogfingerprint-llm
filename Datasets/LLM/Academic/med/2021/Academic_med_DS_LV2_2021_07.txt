**Abstract**

**Background:** While IDH1/2 mutations define a distinct molecular subgroup of anaplastic astrocytoma with a more favorable prognosis, significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes persists. The identification of robust prognostic biomarkers within this molecularly homogeneous group is critical for refining risk stratification and guiding therapeutic decisions. The phase III CATNON trial provided a unique cohort to investigate this heterogeneity.

**Methods:** We performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling on tumor samples from IDH1/2-mutant anaplastic astrocytoma patients enrolled in the CATNON trial. Our integrative analysis correlated methylation subgroups and specific epigenetic signatures with comprehensive clinical data and copy number variation (CNV) profiles to delineate factors influencing overall survival (OS).

**Results:** Unsupervised clustering of methylation data revealed distinct subgroups within IDH1/2-mutant anaplastic astrocytomas that were associated with significant survival differences. Multivariable analysis confirmed that specific methylation signatures serve as powerful independent prognostic factors. Furthermore, we identified key CNV events, including homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B, which synergized with methylation-based classification to further stratify patient risk. This integrated molecular framework outperformed conventional histopathological and clinical prognosticators.

**Conclusion:** Our findings demonstrate that genome-wide DNA methylation profiling uncovers clinically significant biological heterogeneity among IDH1/2-mutant anaplastic astrocytomas. The identification of specific methylation subgroups and associated CNV alterations provides a refined prognostic model that can aid in patient stratification for future clinical trials and personalized management strategies. This work underscores the utility of epigenetic analysis as an essential component of the diagnostic and prognostic workflow for diffuse gliomas.
