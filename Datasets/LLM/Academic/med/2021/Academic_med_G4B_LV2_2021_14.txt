**Prevalence and Orthodontic Needs in Syrian Refugee Children and Adolescents: A Cross-Sectional Study**

The displacement caused by the ongoing Syrian conflict has resulted in significant population movements, including a substantial influx of refugee children and adolescents into host countries. This study investigated the prevalence of malocclusion and identified orthodontic treatment needs within a cohort of 606 Syrian refugee individuals aged 8-18 years, conducted in [Insert relevant geographic location - e.g., Lebanon, Germany, etc. – assuming this information is available from the original source].  The research aimed to quantify the potential impact of migration-related stressors on oral health outcomes and to inform targeted public health interventions. 

Results demonstrated a markedly elevated prevalence of malocclusion – specifically [Insert specific malocclusion types observed, e.g., Class II malocclusion, crowding, open bites] – compared to established normative data for comparable populations.  These findings suggest a considerable burden of untreated dental irregularities within this vulnerable group.  Furthermore, a significant proportion of participants (estimated at [Insert percentage – assuming this is in the original source]) indicated a need for orthodontic intervention, encompassing both functional and aesthetic considerations. 

The observed high rates of malocclusion and orthodontic demand raise concerns regarding long-term oral health, potential psychosocial implications, and the overall impact on quality of life.  The study highlights the urgent necessity for accessible and affordable orthodontic treatment programs specifically tailored to address the unique challenges faced by Syrian refugee children and adolescents, potentially integrating telehealth and innovative delivery models, as suggested by the identification of an unmet orthodontic need (IOTN).  Further longitudinal research is warranted to assess the efficacy of such interventions.
