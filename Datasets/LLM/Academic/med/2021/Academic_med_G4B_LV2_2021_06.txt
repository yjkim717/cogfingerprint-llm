**Abstract**

The evolving landscape of breast cancer management necessitates continuous refinement of treatment strategies, particularly in the context of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This abstract summarizes key recommendations from the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline regarding the optimal approach to breast cancer treatment, with a specific focus on subtypes exhibiting aggressive characteristics. The guideline underscores the critical importance of a multidisciplinary care team – encompassing medical oncologists, surgical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and pathologists – in facilitating individualized patient care. 

Central to the updated recommendations is a shift towards evidence-based decision-making, acknowledging the heterogeneity within breast cancer populations. Specifically, the guideline delineates tailored neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens based on tumor subtype, notably prioritizing strategies for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), a particularly challenging subset characterized by limited therapeutic options. While the guideline broadly supports neoadjuvant chemotherapy across most subtypes, it advocates for careful patient selection and risk stratification to maximize treatment efficacy and minimize adverse events. 

Furthermore, the 2021 ASCO guideline strongly emphasizes the integration of multidisciplinary care to ensure comprehensive evaluation, treatment planning, and post-treatment surveillance. Future research should focus on refining predictive biomarkers to further personalize neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategies and ultimately improve patient outcomes across all breast cancer subtypes.
