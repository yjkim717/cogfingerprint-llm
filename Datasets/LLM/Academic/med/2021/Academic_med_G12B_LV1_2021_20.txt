**Evolving Strategies in Neoadjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer: Integrating Biomarker-Driven Approaches in the Era of Targeted Agents**

**Abstract**

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has established itself as a cornerstone in the management of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) and early-stage disease with high-risk features. This review examines the current landscape of neoadjuvant systemic therapy, focusing on the integration of endocrine therapy and targeted agents alongside conventional chemotherapy, particularly within the context of evolving molecular profiling and the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline recommendations. The optimal sequencing and combination of therapeutic modalities remain complex, necessitating a personalized approach tailored to tumor biology and patient characteristics.

While cytotoxic chemotherapy continues to play a crucial role in achieving pathological complete response (pCR), recent advancements have highlighted the potential of endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive (HR+) disease, often in combination with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors.  Furthermore, the emergence of targeted therapies, including PI3K inhibitors and PARP inhibitors, demonstrates promise in specific molecular subtypes. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, remains a therapeutic challenge. Ongoing clinical trials are exploring the efficacy of immunotherapy and targeted agents, such as those targeting fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) and neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 2 (NTRK), in TNBC patients.

This review synthesizes current evidence regarding neoadjuvant regimens, emphasizing the utility of biomarker-driven strategies to predict treatment response and optimize patient outcomes. We discuss the implications of ASCO guidelines for clinical practice and highlight areas requiring further investigation to refine treatment algorithms and improve the long-term survival of patients with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy. The incorporation of liquid biopsies and advanced imaging techniques holds significant potential for personalized treatment selection and monitoring response during neoadjuvant treatment.
