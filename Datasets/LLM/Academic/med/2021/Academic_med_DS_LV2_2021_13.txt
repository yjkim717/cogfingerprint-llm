The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has established a revised scientific guidance document for the safety evaluation of food enzymes, representing a critical advancement in regulatory toxicology for 2021. This comprehensive framework mandates a structured, evidence-based assessment of enzyme applications, fundamentally relying on toxicological and allergenicity profiling to characterize potential health hazards. A pivotal component of the risk assessment is the rigorous quantification of dietary exposure, which, when integrated with the toxicological dataset, enables a definitive safety conclusion. The guidance stipulates stringent requirements for data pertaining to the source and manufacturing process, ensuring the absence of pathogenic traits and production contaminants. This harmonized methodology provides a systematic mechanism for establishing the safety of food enzymes intended for market authorization, thereby safeguarding public health through a pre-market approval system grounded in contemporary toxicological principles.
