The emergence of CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology has catalyzed a paradigm shift in adoptive T-cell therapy, representing a pivotal advancement in cancer immunotherapy. By enabling precise, multiplexed genomic modifications, CRISPR/Cas9 directly addresses historical limitations of conventional approaches. This technology facilitates the targeted knockout of endogenous T-cell receptors to mitigate graft-versus-host disease risks while simultaneously enabling the stable insertion of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) transgenes, thereby enhancing tumor-specific targeting. Furthermore, the disruption of immune checkpoint genes, such as PD-1, can be achieved to counteract tumor-induced T-cell exhaustion, thereby augmenting persistence and cytotoxic function within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The resultant "armored" CAR T-cells exhibit superior antigen recognition, reduced on-target/off-tumor toxicities, and sustained anti-tumor activity. As of 2021, these engineered cellular products are demonstrating promising efficacy in clinical trials against refractory hematological malignancies and are being actively investigated for solid tumors. Consequently, the integration of CRISPR/Cas9 is fundamentally redefining the therapeutic landscape, establishing a new generation of potent and safer engineered T-cell therapies with the potential to improve long-term patient outcomes.
