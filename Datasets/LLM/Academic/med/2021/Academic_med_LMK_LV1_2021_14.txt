**Title:** Assessing Malocclusion Prevalence and Orthodontic Treatment Needs among Syrian Refugee Children in Zaatari Camp: A Cross-Sectional Study

**Abstract:**

The oral health status of refugee populations, particularly children, is a pressing concern due to the potential long-term consequences on their overall health and well-being. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the prevalence of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment needs among Syrian refugee children and adolescents residing in Zaatari camp, Jordan, in 2021.

A total of 250 Syrian refugee children (125 males and 125 females) aged between 8 and 16 years were randomly selected from various schools within the Zaatari camp. The Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) was employed to evaluate the prevalence of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment needs. The IOTN comprises two components: the Dental Health Component (DHC) and the Aesthetic Component (AC). The DHC assesses the occlusal characteristics, while the AC evaluates the aesthetic acceptability of the occlusion.

The results revealed a high prevalence of malocclusion among the study population, with 83.2% of the participants presenting with some form of occlusal anomaly. The most common types of malocclusion observed were increased overjet (45.6%), crowding (32.4%), and anterior crossbite (21.2%). According to the DHC, 55.6% of the participants had a definite need for orthodontic treatment, while 21.2% had a moderate need. The AC scores indicated that 31.6% of the participants had a definite need for orthodontic treatment due to aesthetic concerns.

The findings of this study highlight the significant orthodontic treatment needs among Syrian refugee children in Zaatari camp. The high prevalence of malocclusion and treatment needs underscores the importance of integrating oral health services, including orthodontic care, into the existing healthcare infrastructure within refugee camps. Furthermore, the results emphasize the need for targeted interventions and awareness programs to promote oral health and address the specific orthodontic needs of this vulnerable population.

This study provides valuable insights into the oral health status of Syrian refugee children and adolescents, contributing to the existing body of evidence on the oral health needs of refugee populations. The findings have implications for policymakers, healthcare providers, and stakeholders involved in providing healthcare services to refugee populations, highlighting the need for comprehensive oral health care, including orthodontic services, to be incorporated into the humanitarian response efforts.
