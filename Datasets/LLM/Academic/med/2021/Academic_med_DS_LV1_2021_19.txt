**Abstract**

The 2021 update to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) marks a significant evolution in therapeutic strategy, pivoting towards a more nuanced, biomarker-driven paradigm. A cornerstone of this revision is the expanded role of immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR)/microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, solidifying immunotherapy as a first-line option for this distinct molecular subgroup. Concurrently, the guidelines formally integrate the use of biosimilars for reference biologic agents, addressing economic sustainability without compromising efficacy. Furthermore, the imperative of comprehensive biomarker testing at diagnosis is underscored, extending beyond dMMR status to include *RAS*, *BRAF*, and emerging markers like *HER2* amplification and *NTRK* fusions to guide subsequent lines of targeted therapy. These collective refinements emphasize a precision oncology framework, aiming to optimize patient outcomes through tailored treatment selection based on individual tumor biology.
