**Optimizing Neoadjuvant Therapy in Breast Cancer: A Review of ASCO Guideline Recommendations**

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, and neoadjuvant therapy has emerged as a crucial treatment modality for patients with specific tumor characteristics. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has developed guideline recommendations to inform clinical decision-making regarding neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients. This review aims to summarize the ASCO guideline recommendations for neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients based on tumor histology and characteristics.

The ASCO guidelines recommend neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and those with HER2-positive disease. For patients with TNBC, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended, regardless of tumor size or lymph node status. In contrast, patients with HER2-positive disease should receive neoadjuvant anti-HER2 therapy in combination with chemotherapy. The guidelines also emphasize the importance of assessing tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy, as this information can inform subsequent treatment decisions.

The recommendations are based on evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, which have demonstrated improved outcomes with neoadjuvant therapy in specific breast cancer subtypes. By tailoring neoadjuvant therapy to tumor characteristics and histology, clinicians can optimize treatment outcomes and improve patient prognosis. This review highlights the importance of adhering to ASCO guideline recommendations for neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients, particularly those with TNBC and HER2-positive disease. By doing so, clinicians can provide high-quality, evidence-based care that is tailored to the unique needs of individual patients.
