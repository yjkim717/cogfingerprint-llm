**Title:** The Synergistic Interplay of Vascular Risk Burden and Alzheimer's Pathophysiology in Preclinical Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Decline

**Abstract:**

Accumulating evidence from longitudinal cohort studies and biomarker-driven research increasingly indicates that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial disorder, with vascular pathology representing a critical modifiable component. While the canonical amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies remain central to the AD paradigm, their interaction with systemic and cerebrovascular factors is now recognized as a principal driver of disease heterogeneity and progression. This review synthesizes contemporary evidence to posit that the aggregate burden of vascular risk factors (VRFs)—such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity—does not merely operate in parallel to AD pathophysiology but engages in a synergistic and often deleterious interplay, particularly during the extended preclinical phase of the disease. We propose a mechanistic model wherein VRFs induce cerebral hypoperfusion, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. These vascular insults, in turn, create a permissive environment that potentiates the seeding and accumulation of Aβ, accelerates tau hyperphosphorylation and spread beyond the medial temporal lobe, and compromises synaptic integrity and neuronal resilience. Critically, this synergy is not merely additive; the co-occurrence of significant VRF burden and nascent AD pathology, as detectable via PET imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays, appears to trigger a feedforward cycle of accelerated neurodegeneration, evidenced by steeper rates of cortical thinning, particularly in temporoparietal and default mode network regions. This accelerated brain atrophy subsequently manifests as a more rapid decline in episodic memory and executive function, effectively shortening the preclinical stage and hastening the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The implications of this model are profound for both risk stratification and therapeutic intervention. It underscores the necessity of incorporating comprehensive vascular health assessments into the standard of care for asymptomatic at-risk individuals and provides a compelling biological rationale for the implementation of multimodal, early-life interventions targeting vascular health as a viable strategy to mitigate the trajectory of cognitive decline, even in the presence of underlying Alzheimer's pathology.
