**Abstract**

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), under the auspices of the European Commission, has implemented revised scientific protocols pertaining to the regulation of food enzymes (EC No. 1331/2008). These updates reflect a heightened scrutiny of enzyme applications, driven by evolving concerns regarding potential toxicology and allergenicity.  Specifically, the protocols mandate comprehensive data encompassing enzyme source traceability, optimized production methodologies, and rigorous safety assessments.  This proactive regulatory stance acknowledges the increasing prevalence of enzyme-modified foods and the necessity for robust risk management.  Failure to adhere to these detailed requirements could impede market access and necessitate further investigation into potential adverse health effects. Consequently, adherence to these guidelines is crucial for ensuring consumer safety and maintaining public confidence in the food supply chain.
