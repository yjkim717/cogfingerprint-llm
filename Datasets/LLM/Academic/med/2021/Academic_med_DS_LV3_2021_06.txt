**Abstract**

The year 2021 marked a pivotal moment in the management of high-risk, non-metastatic breast cancer with the publication of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) evidence-based clinical practice guideline on neoadjuvant therapy. This comprehensive guideline establishes a refined, multimodal framework for the pre-operative treatment of breast cancer, fundamentally shifting the paradigm from a one-size-fits-all approach to a precision oncology model. The central tenet of this guidance is the critical importance of a multidisciplinary team in the initial assessment and treatment planning, integrating inputs from medical oncology, radiology, pathology, and surgery to optimize patient-specific outcomes. The recommendations are rigorously stratified by tumor biology, with a particular focus on aggressive subtypes where the potential benefit of neoadjuvant therapy is most pronounced.

For patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the guideline strongly endorses the use of neoadjuvant systemic therapy. The primary objective in this cohort is to achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR), a well-validated surrogate endpoint strongly correlated with improved long-term event-free and overall survival. The recommended regimens for TNBC incorporate anthracyclines, taxanes, and, notably, the integration of platinum-based agents or immune checkpoint inhibitors, reflecting the evolving therapeutic landscape aimed at enhancing pCR rates. Similarly, for HER2-positive disease, the standard of care involves neoadjuvant regimens combining chemotherapy with dual HER2-targeted blockade, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Achieving pCR in this subtype is also a crucial prognostic indicator, guiding subsequent adjuvant treatment decisions.

A cornerstone of the 2021 guideline is the explicit linkage between the response to neoadjuvant therapy and post-surgical adjuvant strategies. The failure to attain a pCR, particularly in TNBC and high-risk HER2-positive patients, identifies a population with residual disease at elevated risk of recurrence. This necessitates a tailored approach to adjuvant therapy, which may include novel agents not used in the neoadjuvant setting. Consequently, the guideline underscores that the neoadjuvant pathway is not merely a sequence reversal but a dynamic diagnostic and therapeutic strategy. It enables in vivo assessment of tumor chemosensitivity, facilitates breast-conserving surgery, and provides a critical risk-adapted framework for escalating or de-escalating therapy in the adjuvant phase, thereby personalizing the entire continuum of care for individuals with operable breast cancer.
