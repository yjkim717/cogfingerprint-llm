**Abstract**

The 2021 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines represent a significant refinement in the management of early-stage breast cancer.  Specifically, these guidelines offer updated recommendations for patients diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast malignancies.  The revisions emphasize a shift towards more personalized adjuvant therapy approaches, incorporating novel biomarker considerations and refined risk stratification.  Central to the updated recommendations is a detailed discussion of endocrine-based regimens, alongside continued evaluation of chemotherapy’s role in optimizing patient outcomes.  Adherence to these evolving NCCN guidelines is crucial for ensuring evidence-based practice and guiding clinical decision-making in this prevalent subset of breast cancer patients.
