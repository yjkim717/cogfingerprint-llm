Title: Synergistic Interactions between Vascular Risk Factors and Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology: Accelerating Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Decline

Abstract:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal loss. While amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and tauopathy are hallmark features of AD pathophysiology, vascular risk factors (VRFs) have been increasingly recognized as significant contributors to disease progression. This study investigates the hypothesis that elevated VRF burden synergistically interacts with AD pathophysiology to accelerate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

Using data from a cohort of 500 participants with preclinical AD, we examined the relationships between VRF burden, AD biomarkers (Aβ and tau), and neurodegenerative markers (hippocampal atrophy and white matter hyperintensities). VRF burden was quantified using a composite score incorporating hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and smoking status. Cognitive decline was assessed using longitudinal neuropsychological evaluations.

Our results demonstrate that higher VRF burden is associated with increased rates of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in individuals with preclinical AD. Furthermore, we observed a significant interaction between VRF burden and AD pathophysiology, such that individuals with both high VRF burden and elevated Aβ deposition exhibited accelerated hippocampal atrophy and cognitive decline compared to those with low VRF burden or low Aβ deposition.

These findings suggest that VRFs play a critical role in modulating the trajectory of AD progression, potentially by exacerbating Aβ-related neurotoxicity and tau-mediated neurodegeneration. The synergistic interaction between VRFs and AD pathophysiology highlights the importance of addressing modifiable vascular risk factors in the prevention and treatment of AD.

Our study has significant implications for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of VRFs on AD progression. By incorporating VRF management into existing AD treatment paradigms, clinicians may be able to slow disease progression and preserve cognitive function in individuals with preclinical AD. Future research should prioritize the development of personalized interventions tailored to an individual's unique VRF profile and AD biomarker status.

In conclusion, this study provides evidence for a synergistic interaction between VRFs and AD pathophysiology, accelerating neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in preclinical AD. Our findings underscore the need for a comprehensive approach to AD management, incorporating both disease-specific therapies and vascular risk factor modification. By addressing the complex interplay between VRFs and AD pathophysiology, we may be able to slow disease progression and improve outcomes for individuals at risk of AD.
