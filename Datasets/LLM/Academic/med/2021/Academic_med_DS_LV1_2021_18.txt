This 2021 review synthesizes the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for adjuvant systemic therapy in early-stage, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer. We analyze the evolving risk stratification models that integrate genomic assays, such as Oncotype DX, to guide treatment intensification or de-escalation. The discussion focuses on the expanding role of CDK4/6 inhibitors in high-risk subsets and updated recommendations for extended endocrine therapy. This structured analysis provides a framework for clinicians to personalize adjuvant strategies, aiming to optimize oncological outcomes while mitigating treatment-related toxicity for this prevalent patient population.
