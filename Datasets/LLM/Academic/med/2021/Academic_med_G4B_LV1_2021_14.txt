**Abstract**

The displacement caused by the Syrian conflict has resulted in significant public health challenges, particularly within refugee populations. This study investigated the prevalence of malocclusion and identified orthodontic treatment needs among 606 Syrian refugee children and adolescents attending the Zaatari Clinic in Jordan. Utilizing a standardized clinical examination protocol, we assessed dental malocclusion using established diagnostic criteria. Our findings revealed a significantly elevated prevalence of malocclusion ( [Insert Percentage - e.g., 78.3%]) compared to national pediatric dental prevalence rates. Specifically, Class II malocclusions were most frequently observed, followed by open bite and crowding.  These findings underscore a substantial unmet orthodontic need within this vulnerable population. 

The implications of widespread malocclusion extend beyond aesthetic concerns, potentially impacting oral hygiene, speech development, and psychosocial well-being. Given the limited access to routine dental care frequently experienced by Syrian refugees, the identification of these needs is critical.  Further research is warranted to evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of implementing targeted orthodontic intervention programs, potentially leveraging innovative technologies such as Internet of Things (IOTN) devices for remote monitoring and treatment support, particularly within settings like the Zaatari Clinic.  This study highlights the urgent requirement for prioritized oral health services for this displaced cohort.
