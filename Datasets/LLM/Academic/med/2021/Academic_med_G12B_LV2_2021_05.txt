## Abstract: Evolving Systemic Therapy Strategies in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: An Analysis of the 2021 NCCN Guideline Update

The management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years, driven by advancements in targeted therapies and the emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This analysis examines the 2021 update to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines regarding systemic therapy for mCRC, focusing on the integration of these novel agents within established treatment algorithms. The updated guidelines reflect accumulating evidence supporting the use of anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR therapies in the first-line setting, with refined recommendations based on *RAS* and *BRAF* mutational status. Notably, the 2021 update incorporates data demonstrating clinical benefit from pembrolizumab in combination with fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLF OX) for patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) mCRC, solidifying its role in this distinct subgroup. Furthermore, the guidelines address sequencing strategies and considerations for subsequent lines of therapy, incorporating evolving biomarker data and exploring the potential of novel targets. This review assesses the key changes within the 2021 NCCN guidelines and discusses their implications for optimizing personalized treatment approaches in mCRC.
