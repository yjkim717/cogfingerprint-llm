**Title:** Plasma Phosphorylated Tau at Threonine 231 as an Incipient Biomarker of Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology Preceding Amyloid-β Positivity

**Abstract**

The imperative for accessible and sensitive biomarkers to detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its earliest, pre-symptomatic stages is a central challenge in modern neurology. While the accumulation of cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) is a seminal event in the AD pathological cascade, its detection via positron emission tomography (PET) is often a late occurrence, limiting opportunities for early therapeutic intervention. This study investigates the potential of plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 231 (p-tau231) as a biomarker capable of identifying AD pathology prior to established Aβ-PET positivity thresholds. We hypothesized that p-tau231, a specific epitope of tau pathology, would exhibit elevated levels in the preclinical phase of AD, correlating with initial Aβ deposition.

In a multi-center, cross-sectional cohort, we analyzed plasma samples from 450 cognitively unimpaired older adults who underwent comprehensive clinical assessment, Aβ-PET imaging ([18F]florbetapir), and CSF analysis for AD biomarkers. Participants were stratified into Aβ-negative (Aβ-) and Aβ-positive (Aβ+) groups based on established PET standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs). Plasma p-tau231 concentrations were measured using a novel, ultrasensitive single-molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay. Our analyses revealed a significant stepwise increase in plasma p-tau231 levels across the AD continuum. Crucially, individuals classified as Aβ+ demonstrated markedly higher p-tau231 concentrations compared to the Aβ- group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that plasma p-tau231 could discriminate Aβ+ from Aβ- individuals with high accuracy (AUC = 0.92). Most notably, in a sub-cohort of individuals with borderline or sub-threshold Aβ-PET SUVRs, plasma p-tau231 levels were significantly elevated compared to the clearly negative group, suggesting its sensitivity to incipient Aβ pathology. These findings were corroborated by strong correlations between plasma p-tau231 and CSF p-tau231 (r = 0.78, p < 0.001) and total tau levels.

In conclusion, this study provides robust evidence that plasma p-tau231 is a sensitive and specific blood-based biomarker for underlying AD pathophysiology. Its ability to detect aberrant tau phosphorylation prior to conventional thresholds of Aβ-PET positivity positions it as a powerful tool for identifying individuals in the earliest stages of AD, thereby enriching clinical trials for preventative therapies and facilitating a paradigm shift towards pre-symptomatic diagnosis.
