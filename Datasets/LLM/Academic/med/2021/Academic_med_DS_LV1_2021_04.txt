This 2021 update to the NCCN Guidelines for early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer refines adjuvant systemic therapy recommendations. The revisions integrate recent clinical trial data on extended endocrine therapy and the role of genomic assays in guiding chemotherapy decisions. The guidelines emphasize a risk-adapted approach, stratifying patients based on anatomic and genomic risk profiles to optimize outcomes. For lower-risk disease, de-escalation strategies are prioritized, while higher-risk patients may benefit from more intensive regimens. These evidence-based updates aim to standardize clinical practice, tailoring adjuvant treatment to individual patient and tumor characteristics to maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing toxicity.
