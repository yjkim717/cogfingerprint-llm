**Prevalence of Malocclusion and Orthodontic Treatment Needs in Syrian Refugee Children Residing in the Zaatari Refugee Camp: A Cross-Sectional Assessment**

**Abstract**

**Background:** The displacement of populations due to conflict frequently results in disruptions to essential healthcare services, potentially exacerbating pre-existing health disparities and creating new ones. Syrian refugees, particularly children, represent a vulnerable population facing numerous challenges, including limited access to preventative and restorative dental care. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of malocclusion and the orthodontic treatment needs within a cohort of Syrian refugee children residing in the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2021 within the Zaatari refugee camp. Participants included children aged 8-14 years (n= [Insert Sample Size Here – e.g., 300]).  Orthodontic assessments were performed by trained dental professionals utilizing the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN), a standardized and widely accepted diagnostic tool. The IOTN was employed to categorize participants into treatment groups: negligible, minor, moderate, severe, and very severe need, based on occlusal and aesthetic deviations. Data collected included demographic information (age, gender) and IOTN scores. Statistical analysis involved descriptive statistics to determine prevalence rates within each treatment category and chi-square tests to explore potential associations between demographic factors and treatment needs. Ethical approval was obtained from [Insert Relevant Ethics Committee/IRB] and informed consent/assent was secured from parents/guardians.

**Results:** The study revealed a significant prevalence of malocclusion and a substantial orthodontic treatment need among Syrian refugee children in the Zaatari camp. [Insert specific prevalence percentages for each IOTN category here – e.g., X% exhibited negligible need, Y% moderate, Z% severe].  A considerable proportion of the sample (e.g., XX%) were classified as requiring either moderate, severe, or very severe orthodontic treatment. [Insert any significant findings related to demographic factors - e.g., A statistically significant association was observed between age and severity of malocclusion (p < 0.05)].

**Conclusion:** This study highlights a considerable unmet need for orthodontic intervention among Syrian refugee children in the Zaatari camp. The high prevalence of malocclusion underscores the urgent requirement for culturally sensitive and accessible orthodontic care programs tailored to the specific needs of this displaced population. Future research should focus on evaluating the efficacy and feasibility of implementing sustainable orthodontic care delivery models within refugee settings and addressing the systemic barriers to accessing such care.
