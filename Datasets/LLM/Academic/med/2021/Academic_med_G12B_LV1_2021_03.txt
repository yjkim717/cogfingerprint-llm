**Synergistic Effects of Vascular Risk Factors on Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Trajectories in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease: Evidence from Longitudinal CSF and Plasma Biomarkers**

**Abstract**

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a complex interplay between amyloid-centric pathology and vascular dysfunction. While amyloid-β deposition is a hallmark of AD pathogenesis, the influence of systemic vascular risk factors (VVRFs) – including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity – on disease progression remains incompletely understood. This longitudinal study investigated the combined impact of VVRF burden on neurodegenerative processes and cognitive decline in a cohort of individuals with preclinical AD, defined by the presence of amyloid pathology but without overt clinical dementia.  Participants (n=150) underwent baseline and follow-up assessments over a period of three years, including comprehensive VVRF assessment, measurement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-β1-42 (Aβ42), tau protein, and neurofilament light chain (NfL), and standardized neuropsychological testing.

Our findings demonstrate a significant association between a higher VVRF burden and accelerated decline in longitudinal changes of CSF Aβ42 levels, indicative of enhanced amyloid clearance impairment. Critically, this effect was not merely additive; a substantial synergistic interaction was observed between VVRF burden and amyloid pathology, with individuals possessing both exhibiting a markedly steeper trajectory of neurodegeneration as reflected in rising CSF NfL and declining cognitive performance on measures of episodic memory and executive function.  Furthermore, plasma NfL levels showed a strong correlation with both VVRF burden and the rate of cognitive decline, suggesting a potential peripheral marker of neuroaxonal damage exacerbated by vascular insults.

These results support the hypothesis that VVRFs actively contribute to the pathogenesis of AD, not only through direct cerebrovascular damage but also by modulating amyloid metabolism and accelerating neuronal injury in individuals already vulnerable to AD due to amyloid deposition.  The identification of this synergistic effect underscores the importance of aggressive management of VVRFs in preclinical AD to potentially delay or mitigate disease progression.  Future research should focus on elucidating the specific mechanisms underlying this interaction and exploring targeted interventions aimed at mitigating vascular contributions to AD neurodegeneration.

**Notes on Choices Made:**

*   **Expanded on the Core Idea:** I didn't just repeat the summary. I elaborated on the context (AD as a complex disease), the methods (longitudinal study, specific biomarkers), and the implications (importance of VVRF management, future research directions).
*   **Precise Terminology:**  Used phrases like "synergistic interaction," "amyloid clearance impairment," "neuroaxonal damage," and "VVRF burden" to convey the technical meaning accurately.
