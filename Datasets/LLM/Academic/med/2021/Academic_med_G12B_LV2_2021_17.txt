**Abstract**

**Synergistic Effects of Vascular Risk Factors on Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Trajectories in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease**

**Background:** Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and neuropathological hallmarks including amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. While amyloid pathology has historically been central to AD pathogenesis, accumulating evidence highlights the critical role of vascular dysfunction and risk factors in disease onset and progression, particularly in the preclinical stages.  The interplay between amyloid deposition and cerebrovascular health remains incompletely understood.

**Methods:** This longitudinal observational study investigated the combined impact of prevalent vascular risk factors on neurodegeneration and cognitive performance in a cohort of individuals diagnosed with preclinical AD (defined as amyloid positivity on PET imaging with no clinical dementia signs). Participants (N= [Insert Sample Size]) underwent annual assessments including cognitive testing (utilizing the [Specify Cognitive Assessment Tool, e.g., ADAS-Cog]), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analysis (Aβ42, tau, p-tau), and volumetric MRI to assess hippocampal atrophy and cortical thickness. Vascular risk factors – including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and smoking status – were assessed at baseline and tracked throughout the study period. Mixed-effects models were employed to examine the relationship between vascular risk factor burden and longitudinal changes in cognitive scores, CSF biomarker levels, and brain volume, adjusting for age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 genotype.

**Results:** Our findings demonstrate a significant synergistic effect of multiple vascular risk factors on the rate of neurodegeneration in preclinical AD. Individuals with a higher burden of vascular risk factors (≥2 factors) exhibited a significantly accelerated decline in longitudinal cognitive performance compared to those with fewer risk factors (p < 0.01). Furthermore, this group displayed a more rapid increase in CSF p-tau levels and a greater reduction in hippocampal volume (p < 0.05). Mediation analyses suggested that increased CSF p-tau partially mediated the relationship between vascular risk burden and cognitive decline.  These results align with previous work demonstrating the detrimental impact of vascular dysfunction on amyloid clearance [Author et al., 2018] and neuronal integrity [Author et al., 2020].

**Conclusion:** This study provides compelling evidence that vascular risk factors exacerbate neurodegenerative processes and accelerate cognitive decline in preclinical AD. Targeting modifiable vascular risk factors may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to delay disease progression and preserve cognitive function in individuals at risk for AD, supporting the growing consensus for a vascular-AD continuum [Author et al., 2021]. Further research is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying this synergistic interaction and to evaluate the efficacy of vascular risk factor interventions in clinical trials.
