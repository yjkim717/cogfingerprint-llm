Title: A Rare Case of Symptomatic Pulmonary Hamartoma: Clinical Features and Management

Abstract:
Pulmonary hamartomas are typically benign lung tumors often discovered incidentally. We present a rare case of a symptomatic pulmonary hamartoma in a 44-year-old woman, highlighting its unusual clinical presentation. The patient exhibited characteristic radiological features, and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. This case underscores the importance of considering pulmonary hamartoma in the differential diagnosis of lung conditions, even in symptomatic patients. The clinical features, diagnostic approaches, and management strategies are discussed, providing insight into this uncommon manifestation of a typically asymptomatic condition. (2021)
