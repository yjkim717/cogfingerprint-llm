Title: A Rare Presentation of Symptomatic Pulmonary Hamartoma: A Case Report and Review of Clinical Features

Abstract (2021):
Pulmonary hamartomas are typically benign lung tumors that often present asymptomatically. We report a rare case of a 44-year-old woman who presented with symptomatic pulmonary hamartoma, exhibiting cough and dyspnea. Clinical evaluation and imaging studies revealed a large, well-circumscribed lung mass. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary hamartoma. This case highlights the variable clinical presentation of pulmonary hamartomas and underscores the importance of considering this diagnosis in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic lung lesions. Management strategies and clinical features are discussed.
