**Abstract**

Recent advancements in targeted therapies and immunotherapy have significantly reshaped the landscape of adjuvant systemic therapy for early-stage, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer. This article summarizes key updates from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines, reflecting evidence-based refinements implemented in 2021. The analysis focuses on evolving recommendations concerning endocrine therapy backbone selection, particularly the incorporation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors in the early adjuvant setting. Furthermore, the guidelines address the utilization of targeted agents such as PI3K inhibitors and the expanding role of immunotherapy in select patient populations based on genomic profiling and PD-L1 expression. This review highlights the nuanced approach now advocated for treatment personalization, considering factors like risk stratification, menopausal status, and patient comorbidities. Ultimately, these updates aim to optimize disease-free survival and overall survival while minimizing treatment-related toxicities in patients with HR+/HER2- early breast cancer.
