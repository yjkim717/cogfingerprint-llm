Title: Advancements in Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: An Update on NCCN Guidelines

Abstract:

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Colon Cancer have been updated to reflect recent advancements in the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). As of 2021, the guidelines now incorporate novel systemic therapy options, including checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies, underscoring the importance of biomarker testing in guiding treatment decisions. The integration of these new recommendations aims to enhance patient outcomes by tailoring therapies to specific molecular profiles. This update highlights the evolving role of precision medicine in mCRC management, emphasizing the need for comprehensive biomarker testing to inform the selection of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. By adopting these updated guidelines, clinicians can optimize treatment strategies for patients with mCRC, ultimately improving clinical outcomes.
