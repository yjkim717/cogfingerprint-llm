Title: Synergistic Effects of Vascular Risk Factors and Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology on Cognitive Decline in Preclinical Stages

Abstract:

The interplay between vascular risk factors (VRFs) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology has garnered significant attention in understanding the progression of cognitive decline. This study investigates the synergistic impact of VRF burden on neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals with preclinical Alzheimer's disease. As of 2021, the growing body of evidence suggests that VRFs, including hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, not only contribute to vascular dementia but also exacerbate AD pathology.

Using a cohort of cognitively unimpaired participants from a longitudinal aging study, we examined the association between VRF burden, AD pathophysiology, and cognitive decline. The presence and severity of VRFs were quantified using a composite score, while AD pathophysiology was assessed through biomarkers such as amyloid-Î² and tau protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging measures of brain amyloid burden. Neurodegeneration was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess hippocampal atrophy and cortical thinning.

Our results demonstrate that higher VRF burden is associated with accelerated cognitive decline in individuals with preclinical AD, as evidenced by decreased performance in memory and executive function tests. Notably, the interaction between VRF burden and AD pathophysiology was found to synergistically accelerate neurodegeneration, as measured by increased hippocampal atrophy and cortical thinning. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that the effect of VRF burden on cognitive decline was partially mediated by neurodegeneration, suggesting a complex interplay between vascular and AD-related factors.

These findings underscore the importance of considering VRFs in the context of AD prevention and treatment strategies. The synergistic interaction between VRF burden and AD pathophysiology highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to mitigating cognitive decline in preclinical stages. By targeting modifiable VRFs and AD-related pathology, clinicians and researchers may be able to develop more effective interventions to slow or halt disease progression. Ultimately, this study contributes to the growing understanding of the complex relationships between VRFs, AD pathophysiology, and cognitive decline, informing future research directions and clinical practice in the field of Alzheimer's disease.
