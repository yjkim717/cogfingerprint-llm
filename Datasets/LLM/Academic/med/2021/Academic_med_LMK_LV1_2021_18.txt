This study examines the updates in adjuvant systemic therapy for early-stage, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative breast cancer as per the NCCN Guidelines, Version 4.2021. The guidelines recommend tailored therapeutic approaches based on patient-specific factors, including tumor biology and genomic risk assessments. For HR+, HER2-negative tumors, the guidelines suggest the use of endocrine therapy, with or without chemotherapy, depending on clinicopathological characteristics and multigene assay results. These updates aim to optimize treatment outcomes and minimize unnecessary interventions, reflecting the evolving understanding of breast cancer management in 2021.
