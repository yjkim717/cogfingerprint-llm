**Abstract**

The 2021 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Breast Cancer represent a significant update to systemic adjuvant therapy recommendations for patients with early-stage disease. This document addresses evolving evidence regarding optimal treatment strategies for hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancers. Specifically, the guidelines refine recommendations for chemotherapy regimens, emphasizing tailored approaches based on tumor size, grade, and patient factors.  Updated protocols incorporate insights from recent clinical trials, advocating for intensified chemotherapy in select high-risk populations. Furthermore, the document underscores the continued importance of endocrine therapy, with nuanced guidance on aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen selection.  Adherence to these revised NCCN guidelines is crucial for ensuring consistent and evidence-based care in the management of early-stage breast cancer, ultimately aiming to optimize patient outcomes and minimize recurrence risk.
