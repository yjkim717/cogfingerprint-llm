**Abstract**

The management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has undergone significant evolution, necessitating periodic updates to clinical practice guidelines. This analysis reflects the 2021 revision of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for mCRC systemic therapy. The updated recommendations emphasize the expanding role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) tumors, often in combination with targeted therapies. Furthermore, the guidelines address the increasing utilization of biosimilars to optimize cost-effectiveness while maintaining therapeutic efficacy. A core tenet of these revisions remains the importance of comprehensive biomarker testing, including *KRAS*, *NRAS*, *BRAF*, and PI3K mutations, to guide targeted therapeutic selection. This abstract summarizes the key modifications, highlighting the integration of emerging evidence and refinements in treatment algorithms designed to improve patient outcomes within the framework of best-practice oncology.
