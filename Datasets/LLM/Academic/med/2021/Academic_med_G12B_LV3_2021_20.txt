**Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Strategies in Breast Cancer: An Evidence-Based Synthesis and Guideline Recommendations**

The management of early-stage breast cancer has undergone significant evolution, with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) increasingly recognized as a valuable therapeutic strategy. This paper synthesizes the evidence underpinning the 2021 ASCO guideline recommendations for optimal neoadjuvant treatment approaches. A comprehensive review of 41 pertinent articles informed the development of these guidelines, highlighting the critical role of multidisciplinary tumor boards in tailoring therapeutic regimens. The guideline underscores the importance of integrating tumor biology, including receptor status (ER, PR, HER2), genomic profiling, and pathological features, alongside patient-specific factors such as comorbidities and treatment preferences. Specifically, the guideline addresses the sequential or concurrent use of NAC with endocrine therapy and targeted therapies, such as HER2-targeted agents, demonstrating improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates in select patient populations. Furthermore, the guideline emphasizes the need for ongoing assessment of treatment response and adjustments to therapy based on interim imaging and biomarker data. Ultimately, these recommendations aim to optimize treatment efficacy, minimize toxicity, and improve long-term outcomes for individuals diagnosed with breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant systemic therapy, reflecting a move towards personalized and precision oncology.
