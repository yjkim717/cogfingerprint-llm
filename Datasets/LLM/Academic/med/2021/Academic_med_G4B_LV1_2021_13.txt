**Abstract**

The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) continues to play a pivotal role in the regulatory landscape surrounding food enzyme applications, issuing increasingly specific guidance pertinent to both initial authorization and subsequent extension assessments. This paper examines the evolving requirements articulated under Regulation (EC) No 1331/2008, emphasizing the escalating need for comprehensive toxicological data to accompany novel enzyme submissions.  Analysis of recent EFSA directives reveals a shift toward a more stringent evaluation framework, necessitating detailed characterization of dietary exposure scenarios alongside robust preclinical and, where applicable, clinical safety assessments.  The justification for these heightened standards rests upon the potential for increased consumer exposure through diversified food processing techniques.  Furthermore, the abstract highlights the importance of utilizing updated toxicological data, reflecting advancements in hazard identification methodologies, to ensure the continued safe incorporation of food enzymes into the European food supply chain.  Effective risk management demands a proactive, data-driven approach aligned with EFSA’s evolving standards.
