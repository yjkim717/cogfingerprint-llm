**Title:** High Prevalence of Malocclusion and Orthodontic Treatment Need Among Syrian Refugee Children in the Zaatari Camp: A Cross-Sectional Study

**Abstract**

**Background:** The oral health of displaced pediatric populations represents a critical, yet often overlooked, component of public health in humanitarian crises. Malocclusion, a significant deviation from normal dental occlusion, can impact masticatory function, speech, and psychosocial well-being. While the general health needs of refugee populations are increasingly documented, data on the prevalence and severity of orthodontic conditions within these vulnerable groups remain scarce. This study aimed to quantify the burden of malocclusion and the objective need for orthodontic intervention among school-aged Syrian refugee children residing in the Zaatari camp, Jordan.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional epidemiological survey was conducted in 2021 involving a representative sample of 412 Syrian refugee children aged 12-15 years. Clinical examinations were performed by calibrated examiners to assess occlusal traits. The need for orthodontic treatment was objectively determined using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN), comprising its Dental Health Component (DHC) and Aesthetic Component (AC). The DHC records specific traits such as overjet, crossbite, and displacement of teeth, while the AC assesses dental aesthetic impairment. Data on demographic variables and oral hygiene practices were also collected via a questionnaire.

**Results:** The study revealed a high prevalence of malocclusion, affecting 83.8% of the examined cohort. More critically, 67.7% of children were classified as having a definite need for orthodontic treatment (IOTN grades 4 and 5). Anterior crowding was identified as the most prevalent single occlusal anomaly. Analysis indicated a significant association between the high treatment need and reported barriers to accessing routine dental care prior to and following displacement.

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate an alarmingly high burden of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment need among Syrian refugee children in the Zaatari camp. This underscores a substantial, unmet public health requirement within this displaced population. The results advocate for the integration of basic orthodontic screening and interceptive care into existing humanitarian health programs to mitigate long-term functional and aesthetic sequelae. Further research is warranted to explore the feasibility and impact of such interventions in resource-constrained settings.
