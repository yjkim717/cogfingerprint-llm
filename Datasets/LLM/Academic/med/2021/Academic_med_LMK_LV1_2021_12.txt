Title: Comparative Analysis of Long-term Mortality Outcomes in Patients with Severe Obesity Undergoing Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass versus Sleeve Gastrectomy: A Retrospective Cohort Study

Abstract:

Background: Severe obesity is a complex and multifactorial condition associated with increased risk of premature mortality. Bariatric surgery has emerged as an effective treatment modality for weight management and mitigation of obesity-related comorbidities. This study aimed to investigate the comparative efficacy of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in reducing long-term mortality in patients with severe obesity.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from a large-scale, longitudinal database (2021 updates). Patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m² or ≥35 kg/m² with ≥1 comorbidity) who underwent either RYGB or SG between 2005 and 2015 were identified and followed up until 2021. The primary outcome measure was all-cause long-term mortality. Secondary outcomes included cause-specific mortality and incidence of major adverse events.

Results: A total of 10,542 patients (RYGB: n = 6,231; SG: n = 4,311) were included in the analysis, with a median follow-up duration of 8.5 years. The mean age and BMI of the cohort were 45.6 ± 11.2 years and 42.8 ± 6.3 kg/m², respectively. After adjusting for baseline covariates using propensity score matching, RYGB was associated with a significantly lower risk of long-term all-cause mortality compared to SG (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.61-0.88, p = 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that RYGB was particularly effective in reducing mortality due to cardiovascular disease (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.51-0.83, p = 0.001) and cancer (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56-0.98, p = 0.035). The incidence of major adverse events was comparable between the two groups.

Conclusion: This large-scale retrospective cohort study provides evidence that RYGB is associated with lower long-term mortality compared to SG in patients with severe obesity. While both procedures are effective in managing weight and related comorbidities, RYGB may offer a survival benefit, particularly in reducing cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality. These findings have significant implications for clinical decision-making and highlight the need for further research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these differences in outcomes. Ultimately, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the role of bariatric surgery in improving long-term health outcomes in patients with severe obesity.
