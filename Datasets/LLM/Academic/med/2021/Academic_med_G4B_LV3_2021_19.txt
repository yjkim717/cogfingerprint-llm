**Abstract**

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treatment paradigms are evolving rapidly, necessitating updated systemic therapy approaches. This abstract synthesizes key recommendations from the 2021 NCCN Guidelines for Colon Cancer, focusing on the integration of novel immunotherapies and molecularly-targeted interventions. Specifically, checkpoint inhibitors demonstrate increasing efficacy in mCRC, particularly when combined with chemotherapy. Furthermore, the utilization of biosimilars offers a cost-effective alternative to established monoclonal antibodies, expanding access to these therapies.  Importantly, the guidelines now strongly advocate for the incorporation of targeted therapy – including agents directed against HER2 amplification and BRAF V600E mutations – within treatment regimens for patients exhibiting these specific genomic alterations.  Continued research evaluating these combined strategies promises to optimize patient outcomes and refine the standard of care for mCRC.
