**Title:** Principal Component Analysis of Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI Predicts Acidic Tumor Microenvironment in Glioblastoma

The acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) of glioblastoma (GBM), a hallmark of metabolic reprogramming and a driver of therapeutic resistance, remains challenging to quantify non-invasively. While chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI can assess tissue pH, its clinical translation is limited. This study investigates the efficacy of deriving a surrogate biomarker for tumor acidity from routinely acquired dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC)-MRI through machine learning. In a cohort of treatment-na√Øve GBM patients, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) on standardized DSC-MRI hemodynamic maps to extract dominant, uncorrelated patterns of signal variance. The resulting principal components (PCs) were correlated with voxel-wise acidity measurements derived from amine-weighted CEST imaging. Our analysis revealed that a specific PC, capturing heterogeneity in contrast agent kinetics, was a significant independent predictor of low extracellular pH (p < 0.001). Notably, the predictive strength of this PC-based model was most pronounced within the peritumoral region, an area of infiltrative growth and profound microenvironmental stress. We conclude that PCA of clinical-grade DSC-MRI data provides a readily translatable, non-invasive method for mapping TME acidity in GBM, offering a valuable tool for prognostic stratification and targeting acidosis-adapted therapies.
