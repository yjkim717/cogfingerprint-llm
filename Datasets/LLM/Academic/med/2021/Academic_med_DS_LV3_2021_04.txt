In 2021, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) updated its multidisciplinary guidelines to refine adjuvant systemic therapy for early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. These evidence-based recommendations integrate recent clinical trial data, emphasizing risk stratification to optimize treatment selection. The guidelines advocate for the selective use of extended endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors in high-risk subgroups, aiming to improve recurrence-free survival while managing toxicity. This structured approach provides clinicians with a critical framework for personalizing care and enhancing long-term oncological outcomes in this prevalent patient population.
