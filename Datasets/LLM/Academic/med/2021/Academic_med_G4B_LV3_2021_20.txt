**Abstract:**

Contemporary management of early-stage breast cancer increasingly prioritizes a multidisciplinary approach, reflecting evolving evidence and the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline. This guideline advocates for neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens meticulously tailored to individual patient characteristics. Specifically, tumor histology, stage of disease, and hormone receptor status (estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2) are now central determinants in selecting optimal treatment strategies.  The rationale underpinning this shift lies in maximizing pathological complete response rates, thereby potentially reducing the need for subsequent surgical intervention and systemic therapies. Furthermore, the guideline underscores the importance of integrating hormone therapy – often initiated post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy – to mitigate recurrence risk.  Continued refinement of these individualized approaches, guided by ongoing clinical trials and biomarker research, remains crucial for achieving superior patient outcomes and improved survival rates within the field of breast oncology.
