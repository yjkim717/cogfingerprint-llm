**Abstract**

**Objective:** The displacement and altered living conditions inherent to refugee status can significantly impact pediatric oral health. This cross-sectional epidemiological investigation, conducted in 2021, aimed to quantify the prevalence of malocclusion and the objective need for orthodontic treatment among a vulnerable pediatric population—Syrian refugee children residing in the Zaatari camp, Jordan.

**Methods:** A representative sample of Syrian refugee children was clinically examined according to standardized protocols. The assessment of malocclusion and the determination of orthodontic treatment need were conducted using the Dental Health Component (DHC) of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). The IOTN-DHC provides a validated, reproducible metric to categorize occlusal traits based on their potential impact on dental health, ranging from "no need" to "very great need."

**Results:** Analysis revealed a profoundly high burden of occlusal disharmony within the cohort. The overall prevalence of clinically identifiable malocclusion was 83.8%. More critically, the application of the IOTN-DHC criteria indicated that 67.7% of the examined children were classified as having a definitive "need" for orthodontic treatment. This figure signifies that a majority of the population presented with occlusal traits—such as increased overjet, crossbite, or impeded eruption—deemed capable of compromising long-term dental health and function.

**Conclusion:** The findings demonstrate an alarmingly high prevalence of malocclusion and a substantial, unmet need for orthodontic care among Syrian refugee children in the Zaatari camp. These results underscore a critical pediatric public health challenge within this humanitarian context. The data suggest that the circumstances of displacement may exacerbate or preclude access to early interceptive and preventive dental services, potentially leading to a cumulative oral health burden. This study highlights the urgent necessity for policymakers and humanitarian health agencies to integrate targeted orthodontic screening and basic care into existing refugee health programs to mitigate long-term sequelae.
