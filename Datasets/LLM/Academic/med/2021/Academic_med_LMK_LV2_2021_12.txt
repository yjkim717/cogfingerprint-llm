Title: Long-term Mortality Outcomes in Patients with Severe Obesity Undergoing Bariatric Surgery: A Comparative Analysis

Abstract:

Bariatric surgery has emerged as an effective intervention for managing severe obesity, a condition associated with increased risk of mortality. This study aimed to investigate the long-term mortality outcomes in patients with severe obesity undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) compared to nonsurgical controls. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on observational studies published between 2011 and 2021, retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Studies examining adult patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) who underwent RYGB or SG and reported long-term mortality outcomes were included. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular and cancer-specific mortality.

Pooled data from 15 studies, comprising 55,174 patients (24,455 RYGB, 10,319 SG, and 20,400 nonsurgical controls), were analyzed using random-effects models. The median follow-up duration was 7.5 years (range, 5-12 years). The pooled analysis revealed a significant reduction in long-term all-cause mortality in patients undergoing RYGB (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55-0.72; P < 0.001) and SG (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63-0.85; P < 0.001) compared to nonsurgical controls. Subgroup analysis demonstrated a consistent reduction in mortality risk across various subgroups, including patients with diabetes and those with a BMI ≥ 50 kg/m². The reduction in mortality was primarily attributed to a decrease in cardiovascular mortality (RYGB: HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.43-0.67; P < 0.001; SG: HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51-0.83; P < 0.001). Cancer-specific mortality was also reduced, although the association was less pronounced.

This study provides robust evidence that bariatric surgery, particularly RYGB and SG, is associated with reduced long-term mortality in patients with severe obesity. The findings support the use of bariatric surgery as a viable treatment option for managing severe obesity and reducing mortality risk. The results have significant implications for clinical practice and healthcare policy, highlighting the need for increased awareness and access to bariatric surgery for eligible patients. Future research should focus on optimizing patient selection, improving perioperative care, and investigating the mechanisms underlying the mortality benefits associated with bariatric surgery.
