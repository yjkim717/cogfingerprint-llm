## Abstract: Optimizing Neoadjuvant Therapy Selection in Breast Cancer: A Synthesis of Evolving Evidence and ASCO Guideline Recommendations

**Background:** Neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) has become increasingly integral in the management of locally advanced and early-stage breast cancer, offering the potential for improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates and tailored adjuvant treatment decisions. However, the optimal NST regimens remain complex and dependent on tumor biology and patient-specific factors. This review synthesizes recent evidence and explores the implications of the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline recommendations for neoadjuvant therapy selection in breast cancer.

**Methods:** A comprehensive literature review was conducted, encompassing randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and meta-analyses published between 2016 and 2021, focusing on neoadjuvant approaches for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+), hormone receptor-positive (HR+), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). The ASCO guideline's recommendations were analyzed in conjunction with these findings to evaluate their practical applicability and potential for refinement.

**Results:**  Significant advancements have been made in NST strategies for each breast cancer subtype. For HER2+ disease, the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab with chemotherapy remains standard.  In HR+ disease, endocrine therapy combined with chemotherapy or targeted agents like cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors exhibits efficacy. TNBC, lacking hormone receptor expression, benefits most from immunotherapy combinations, particularly with chemotherapy, demonstrating improved pCR rates and potentially impacting long-term survival. The ASCO guideline underscores the importance of individualized treatment approaches, considering factors such as stage, genomic biomarkers, and patient comorbidities.

**Conclusion:** The evolving landscape of neoadjuvant therapy necessitates a nuanced approach to treatment selection.  The 2021 ASCO guideline provides a valuable framework for clinicians, advocating for personalized strategies based on tumor characteristics and patient profile.  Further research exploring novel combinations and predictive biomarkers is warranted to optimize outcomes and refine treatment algorithms for breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy.
