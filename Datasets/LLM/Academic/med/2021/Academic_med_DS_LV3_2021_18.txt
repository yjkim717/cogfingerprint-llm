The 2021 iteration of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Breast Cancer refines the multidisciplinary framework for managing early-stage, nonmetastatic disease. This analysis focuses on the pivotal updates concerning adjuvant systemic therapy for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), HER2-negative (HER2-) tumors. The guidelines integrate recent clinical evidence to optimize therapeutic sequencing and patient selection, addressing the nuanced risk stratification inherent to this common breast cancer subtype. Emphasis is placed on the extended duration of endocrine therapy and the judicious incorporation of adjuvant chemotherapy, balancing efficacy against potential toxicities. These evidence-based recommendations are instrumental for oncologists in formulating personalized treatment plans, ultimately aiming to improve long-term disease-free and overall survival outcomes in this patient population.
