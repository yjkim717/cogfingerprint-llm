**Abstract**

The 2021 iteration of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology reflects a paradigm shift in the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Notably, first-line systemic therapy now incorporates checkpoint inhibitors, demonstrating evolving efficacy in this challenging malignancy. Furthermore, the guidelines provide updated recommendations regarding the utilization of biosimilars and emphasize expanded biomarker testing to inform treatment decisions. Targeted therapies, guided by the identification of specific genetic mutations, are increasingly integrated into personalized treatment strategies. These revisions collectively represent a significant advance in optimizing therapeutic approaches for patients with mCRC, aiming to improve outcomes through precision medicine.
