Title: Plasma Phosphorylated Tau 231 as a Diagnostic Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease Pathology

Abstract:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and tau protein aggregates in the brain. Recent advances in biomarker research have enabled the detection of AD pathology with increased accuracy. In this context, plasma phosphorylated tau 231 (p-tau231) has emerged as a promising novel biomarker for identifying AD pathology. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of plasma p-tau231 in detecting AD pathology, particularly in relation to Aβ and tau protein aggregates.

A cohort of 150 participants, comprising 50 cognitively normal individuals, 50 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 50 patients with AD dementia, underwent comprehensive clinical evaluation, including neuropsychological assessments and neuroimaging. Plasma p-tau231 levels were measured using a validated ultra-sensitive immunoassay.

Results showed that plasma p-tau231 levels were significantly elevated in patients with AD dementia compared to cognitively normal individuals and those with MCI. Notably, plasma p-tau231 accurately distinguished AD dementia from cognitively normal individuals with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86-0.97). Moreover, plasma p-tau231 was strongly associated with Aβ positivity, as determined by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, and with tau pathology, as assessed by tau PET imaging.

The diagnostic performance of plasma p-tau231 was further compared to other established AD biomarkers, including plasma Aβ42/40 ratio and neurofilament light chain (NfL). Plasma p-tau231 outperformed these biomarkers in detecting AD pathology, particularly in the early stages of the disease. Furthermore, combining plasma p-tau231 with other biomarkers enhanced the diagnostic accuracy, suggesting a potential role for a multi-biomarker approach in AD diagnosis.

In conclusion, plasma p-tau231 is a promising diagnostic biomarker for detecting AD pathology, particularly in relation to Aβ and tau protein aggregates. The high diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau231, as demonstrated in this study, supports its potential utility in clinical practice and research settings. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of plasma p-tau231 into a multi-biomarker panel may facilitate the early detection and monitoring of AD, ultimately contributing to the development of effective therapeutic strategies.
