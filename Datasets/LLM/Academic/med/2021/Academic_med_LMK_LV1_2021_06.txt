**Abstract: Neoadjuvant Therapy in Breast Cancer Management: A Subtype-Specific Approach**

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, comprising distinct subtypes with varying prognostic and therapeutic implications. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines recommend neoadjuvant therapy as a viable treatment strategy for select breast cancer patients. As of 2021, the application of neoadjuvant therapy is guided by tumor characteristics and patient factors, underscoring the need for a subtype-specific approach.

In the context of HER2-positive breast cancer, neoadjuvant therapy has been shown to improve pathological complete response (pCR) rates, a surrogate marker for long-term outcomes. The integration of HER2-targeted agents, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, into neoadjuvant regimens has significantly enhanced treatment efficacy. For patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, neoadjuvant endocrine therapy may be considered, particularly for postmenopausal women with strongly estrogen receptor-positive tumors.

Conversely, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a lack of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 expression, rendering it unresponsive to targeted therapies. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains the standard of care for TNBC, with a focus on anthracycline- and taxane-based regimens. The attainment of pCR following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a strong predictor of improved overall survival in TNBC.

The ASCO guidelines emphasize the importance of considering tumor biology, patient comorbidities, and treatment goals when selecting neoadjuvant therapy. For instance, patients with large or locally advanced tumors may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy to facilitate breast-conserving surgery or improve surgical outcomes. Conversely, patients with early-stage disease may be candidates for upfront surgery.

In conclusion, the application of neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer management is guided by a nuanced understanding of tumor subtype and patient-specific factors. As our knowledge of breast cancer biology continues to evolve, the role of neoadjuvant therapy is likely to expand, incorporating emerging targeted therapies and immunotherapies. By adopting a subtype-specific approach to neoadjuvant therapy, clinicians can optimize treatment outcomes and improve patient care. This review highlights the current state of neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer, with a focus on HER2-positive, HR+, and TNBC subtypes, and underscores the need for ongoing research to refine treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.
