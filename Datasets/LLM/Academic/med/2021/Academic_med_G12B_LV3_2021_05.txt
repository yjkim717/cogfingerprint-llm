**Abstract**

The 2021 update to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology reflects evolving therapeutic landscapes in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This revision prioritizes a refined approach to systemic therapy, integrating recent advancements in immunotherapy and targeted agents. Notably, the guidelines now incorporate recommendations for checkpoint inhibitor utilization, particularly in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, alongside expanded guidance on biosimilar adoption. Furthermore, emphasis is placed on comprehensive biomarker testing, specifically assessing for HER2 amplification and *BRAF* V600E mutations, to guide targeted therapeutic selection. These modifications underscore a shift toward personalized treatment strategies in mCRC, aiming to optimize patient outcomes through the judicious application of emerging systemic therapies and improved diagnostic stratification.
