**Title:** The Synergistic Interplay of Vascular Risk Burden and Alzheimer's Pathophysiology in Preclinical Neurodegeneration: A Biomarker-Based Investigation

**Abstract**

Emerging evidence in 2021 increasingly posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cerebrovascular pathology are not merely concurrent age-related processes but are deeply intertwined in a synergistic relationship that accelerates clinical decline. This study investigates the hypothesis that the aggregate burden of modifiable vascular risk factors (VRFs)—including hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity—interacts synergistically with core Alzheimer's pathophysiology to exacerbate the rate of neurodegeneration and cognitive deterioration in the preclinical phase of AD. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study involving 450 cognitively unimpaired older adults, stratified by their VRF burden (assessed via the Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular risk profile) and amyloid-β (Aβ) status (determined by positron emission tomography). Participants underwent comprehensive neuropsychological assessments and blood sampling at baseline and 24-month follow-ups. Our primary outcome was the longitudinal change in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL), a highly sensitive and specific biomarker of axonal injury and active neurodegeneration. Secondary outcomes included rates of change in global cognition and memory domain scores.

Our analyses, employing linear mixed-effects models, revealed a significant interaction effect between VRF burden and Aβ positivity on the rate of plasma NfL increase (p < 0.001). Specifically, Aβ-positive individuals with high VRF burden exhibited a 35% greater annual increase in plasma NfL compared to Aβ-positive individuals with low VRF burden, and a 120% greater increase compared to Aβ-negative, low VRF controls. This accelerated neuroaxonal injury was paralleled by a significantly steeper decline in episodic memory and executive function performance within the same group. Mediation analysis indicated that the effect of the VRF-Aβ interaction on cognitive decline was substantially mediated by the increase in plasma NfL, underscoring neurodegeneration as a key mechanistic pathway. These findings robustly demonstrate that vascular health is a critical modifier of disease progression in the preclinical phase of AD. The synergistic acceleration of neurodegeneration, quantified by plasma NfL, provides a compelling biomarker-supported rationale for implementing combined therapeutic strategies. Our results advocate for a paradigm shift in early AD intervention, moving beyond singularly targeting amyloid or tau pathology to include aggressive, personalized management of vascular risk as a potent means to mitigate the trajectory of neuroaxonal damage and cognitive impairment.
