Title: A Rare Presentation of Symptomatic Pulmonary Hamartoma: A Case Report and Review of Clinical Features

Abstract:
Pulmonary hamartomas are benign lung tumors typically presenting asymptomatically. We report a rare case of a 44-year-old woman who presented with symptomatic pulmonary hamartoma, manifesting as cough and dyspnea. Computed tomography revealed a well-defined lung mass, which was subsequently resected. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary hamartoma. This case highlights the variable clinical presentation of pulmonary hamartomas and underscores the importance of considering this diagnosis in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic lung lesions. A review of the literature on clinical features and management is also presented (2021).
