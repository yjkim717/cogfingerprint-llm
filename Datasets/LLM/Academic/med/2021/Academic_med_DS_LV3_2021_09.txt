**Title:** A Mendelian Randomization Study Reveals a Causal, Protective Effect of Morning Diurnal Preference on Major Depressive Disorder Risk

**Abstract**

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) represents a profound global health burden, yet its complex, multifactorial etiology remains incompletely elucidated. Observational epidemiology has consistently identified an association between sleep-wake patterns, specifically evening chronotype, and increased susceptibility to MDD. However, these associations are susceptible to confounding and reverse causation, limiting causal inference. To address this, we employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to investigate the potential causal relationship between diurnal preference and MDD risk. Utilizing summary-level data from the largest available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for diurnal preference (n > 700,000) and MDD (n > 500,000), we identified robust genetic instruments for diurnal preference. These instruments comprised single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated (p < 5 × 10⁻⁸) with a preference for morningness versus eveningness, which we used to proxy this exposure. Our primary analysis, using the inverse-variance weighted method, demonstrated a significant protective effect of a genetic predisposition towards morning diurnal preference on MDD risk. Specifically, we found that a one-hour earlier sleep midpoint, genetically proxied, was associated with a 23% reduction in the odds for MDD (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.85, p = 4.2 × 10⁻⁷). Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression and weighted median approaches, yielded consistent results, and no significant evidence of directional pleiotropy was detected. These findings provide robust evidence supporting a causal, protective relationship between a genetically instrumented morning diurnal preference and a lower risk of developing Major Depressive Disorder. This research, conducted in 2021, underscores the importance of circadian biology in the pathophysiology of depression and suggests that sleep-wake cycle alignment may represent a promising target for public health interventions and novel therapeutic strategies aimed at mitigating MDD risk.
