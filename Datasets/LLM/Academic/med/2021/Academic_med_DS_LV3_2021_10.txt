In this 2021 study, we investigate the quantification of glioblastoma microenvironmental acidity using advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The acidic tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in tumor progression and treatment resistance, yet non-invasive assessment remains challenging. We developed a novel analytical framework combining dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI with principal component analysis to derive quantitative biomarkers of tissue acidity. Our methodology enables comprehensive characterization of the heterogeneous tumor landscape, with particular emphasis on the clinically critical peritumoral regions where invasive tumor cells infiltrate surrounding brain tissue. Validation against histopathological correlates demonstrated robust performance, with the strongest correlations observed in peritumoral zones (r=0.82, p<0.001). This machine learning approach provides unprecedented spatial resolution in mapping tumor acidosis, offering valuable insights into tumor biology and microenvironmental dynamics. The technique represents a significant advancement in neuro-oncological imaging, potentially enabling improved treatment planning and response assessment by identifying regions of aggressive tumor phenotype through non-invasive acidity profiling.
