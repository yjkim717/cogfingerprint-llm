**Prognostic Stratification of IDH-Mutant Anaplastic Astrocytoma through Integrated Molecular Profiling: A Post-Hoc Analysis of the EORTC 26053-22054 / CATNON Trial Cohort**

**Background:** The classification of IDH-mutant anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO CNS grade 3) has evolved, yet significant heterogeneity in patient survival persists. The EORTC 26053-22054 / CATNON trial provided a robust cohort to delineate the molecular determinants of this clinical variability beyond the established prognostic factor of adjuvant temozolomide.

**Methods:** We performed a comprehensive molecular analysis on a uniformly treated subset of the CATNON trial cohort (n=228) diagnosed with IDH-mutant anaplastic astrocytoma. Tumor samples were subjected to genome-wide DNA methylation profiling, high-resolution copy number variation (CNV) analysis using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, and targeted next-generation sequencing. Unsupervised clustering of methylation data was performed, and survival outcomes were correlated with molecular subgroups and specific genetic alterations using Cox proportional hazards models.

**Results:** Unsupervised clustering of DNA methylation profiles revealed three distinct intrinsic subtypes, which we designated as Methylation Classes (MC) A, B, and C. These classes exhibited significant associations with overall survival (OS) (log-rank p<0.001). MC-A, characterized by a paucity of CNVs, was associated with the most favorable prognosis. In contrast, MC-C demonstrated a high frequency of deleterious genetic events, including homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B and polysomy of chromosome 7, and was linked to a significantly worse OS, independent of clinical variables. Multivariable analysis confirmed that CDKN2A/B homozygous deletion was the strongest independent molecular predictor of poor outcome (HR: 3.21, 95% CI: 1.98â€“5.20, p<0.001).

**Conclusion:** Our findings demonstrate that IDH-mutant anaplastic astrocytomas comprise biologically discrete entities with divergent clinical outcomes. The integration of DNA methylation profiling and specific CNV assessment, particularly CDKN2A/B status, provides a powerful framework for prognostic stratification, refining risk assessment and potentially guiding future stratified therapeutic approaches for this patient population.
