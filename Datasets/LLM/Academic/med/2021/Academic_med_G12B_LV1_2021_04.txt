**Abstract**

The management of early-stage, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer has undergone significant refinement in recent years. This review examines the evolving landscape of adjuvant systemic therapy as reflected in the 2021 updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.  Historically, endocrine therapy formed the cornerstone of treatment; however, the incorporation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, particularly in combination with endocrine therapy, has demonstrated substantial improvements in disease-free survival.  Furthermore, genomic assays such as Oncotype DX and MammaPrint continue to play a vital role in risk stratification and informing treatment decisions, guiding the use of chemotherapy in select patient populations. This analysis highlights the nuanced recommendations within the NCCN guidelines, emphasizing personalized approaches based on tumor biology, patient risk factors, and the potential benefits and toxicities of various therapeutic regimens.  Future research should focus on identifying biomarkers to further refine patient selection for CDK4/6 inhibitors and optimizing treatment sequencing to maximize efficacy and minimize long-term adverse effects.
