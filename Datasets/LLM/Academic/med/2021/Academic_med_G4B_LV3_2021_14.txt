**Abstract**

The displacement caused by the Syrian conflict has created significant challenges for refugee populations globally. This study investigates the prevalent oral health needs within a large cohort of Syrian refugee children and adolescents residing in Zaatari camp, Jordan. A cross-sectional survey of 606 individuals identified a markedly elevated incidence of malocclusion – 83.8% – suggesting a substantial burden on existing dental resources. Furthermore, 67.7% of participants demonstrated a clinically significant need for orthodontic intervention, indicative of compromised dentofacial development. These findings underscore the critical importance of prioritizing targeted oral health programs within refugee settings.  The observed high prevalence of malocclusion may be linked to factors including nutritional deficiencies, limited access to preventative dental care, and potentially, psychosocial stressors associated with displacement.  Further longitudinal research is warranted to determine the long-term impact of these oral health disparities and to evaluate the effectiveness of tailored interventions aimed at mitigating these challenges and promoting optimal dental health outcomes for this vulnerable population.
