**Optimizing Neoadjuvant Breast Cancer Treatment: Recommendations from the 2021 ASCO Guideline**

The escalating incidence of breast cancer necessitates a sophisticated, individualized approach to initial treatment. This abstract presents a summary of key recommendations derived from the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer.  The guideline underscores the critical role of multidisciplinary teams in tailoring treatment strategies to maximize response rates and minimize the risk of local recurrence. 

Specifically, the recommendation favors a phased approach, commencing with neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens based on tumor subtype and risk factors.  Further stratification incorporates consideration of endocrine therapy – often utilized in hormone receptor-positive disease – and, increasingly, the integration of targeted therapies directed against specific molecular alterations.  The guideline emphasizes careful patient selection for each modality, alongside rigorous monitoring for treatment response via imaging and biomarker analysis.  

Ultimately, adherence to these evidence-based recommendations promotes a shift toward precision medicine, aiming to improve patient outcomes and refine the therapeutic landscape for this prevalent malignancy. Future research should focus on refining predictive biomarkers and optimizing sequencing strategies within this complex treatment paradigm.
