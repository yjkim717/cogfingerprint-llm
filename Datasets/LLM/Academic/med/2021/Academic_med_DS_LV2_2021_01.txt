This case report examines a 44-year-old female presenting with atypical symptomatic manifestations of pulmonary hamartoma, a typically asymptomatic benign lung neoplasm. We detail the diagnostic evaluation, including computed tomography revealing a characteristic "popcorn" calcification pattern, and subsequent histological confirmation via biopsy. The patient underwent successful video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical resection, with complete symptom resolution. This case underscores that while pulmonary hamartomas are generally incidental findings, they can manifest clinically, necessitating differentiation from malignant lesions. Our findings contribute to understanding symptomatic presentations and reinforce VATS as the definitive management approach for symptomatic cases.
