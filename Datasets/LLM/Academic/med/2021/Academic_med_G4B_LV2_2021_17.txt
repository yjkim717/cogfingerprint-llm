**Abstract**

Emerging evidence increasingly implicates vascular dysfunction as a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), particularly in preclinical stages. This study investigated the interplay between established vascular risk factors and neurodegenerative processes in individuals identified as having preclinical AD, defined as the presence of amyloid pathology without demonstrable cognitive impairment. Utilizing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and neurofilament light chain (NfL) as surrogate markers of neurodegeneration, we hypothesized that elevated vascular risk factors would exacerbate cognitive decline. 

Our findings demonstrate a significant synergistic effect wherein multiple vascular risk factors – encompassing hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes – substantially accelerate neurodegeneration and precipitate cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals exhibiting preclinical AD. Specifically, elevated CSF levels of NfL correlated strongly with the cumulative burden of vascular risk factors, revealing a non-linear relationship.  These results suggest that vascular pathology may represent a critical accelerant of the underlying neurodegenerative cascade within this vulnerable population. 

The observed synergy underscores the importance of considering vascular health as a modifiable risk factor in the prevention and management of AD progression. Future research should focus on elucidating the precise mechanisms mediating this interaction, potentially involving endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation.  These findings contribute to a refined understanding of AD pathogenesis and highlight the potential for targeted interventions aimed at mitigating vascular contributions to early disease onset and progression.
