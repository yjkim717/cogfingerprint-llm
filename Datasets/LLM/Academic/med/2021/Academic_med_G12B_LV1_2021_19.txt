## Evolving Systemic Therapy Strategies in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: An Update Informed by Biomarkers and NCCN Guidelines

**Abstract:** The landscape of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treatment has undergone significant evolution, driven by advancements in biomarker identification and the integration of targeted therapies. This review synthesizes recent updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, reflecting these changes and outlining contemporary systemic therapeutic approaches. Historically dominated by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) based regimens, mCRC management now incorporates molecular profiling to guide personalized treatment strategies.  Specifically, testing for *RAS* and *BRAF* mutations informs the selection of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and BRAF inhibitors, respectively, while microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) status dictates consideration of immune checkpoint inhibitors.  Furthermore, the expanding role of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors, often in combination with chemotherapy or targeted agents, is discussed. This analysis highlights the importance of comprehensive biomarker assessment at diagnosis and disease progression, advocating for adherence to updated NCCN guidelines to optimize patient outcomes and improve quality of life in the context of mCRC.  Future research should focus on identifying novel biomarkers and refining predictive algorithms to further personalize therapeutic interventions.
