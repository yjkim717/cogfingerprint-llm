Title: Optimizing Neoadjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer: A Review of Guideline Recommendations

Abstract:

Neoadjuvant therapy has emerged as a crucial component in the management of breast cancer, enabling clinicians to assess treatment response and tailor subsequent interventions. In 2021, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) released guideline recommendations for neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer, based on a systematic review of 41 articles. This review aims to summarize and contextualize these recommendations, with a focus on chemotherapy and targeted therapy. A comprehensive analysis of the guideline recommendations reveals that neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with triple-negative breast cancer and those with HER2-positive disease, with the addition of targeted therapy in the latter group. The guidelines also emphasize the importance of considering tumor biology, patient preferences, and clinical trial availability when selecting neoadjuvant regimens. Notably, the ASCO guidelines highlight the need for further research into biomarkers predictive of treatment response and the development of more effective neoadjuvant strategies. By synthesizing the available evidence and providing clear recommendations, the ASCO guidelines facilitate the delivery of high-quality, patient-centered care for individuals with breast cancer. Furthermore, these guidelines underscore the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration and the need for ongoing evaluation of emerging therapies and treatment approaches. As the breast cancer treatment landscape continues to evolve, adherence to evidence-based guidelines will remain essential for optimizing patient outcomes. This review provides a concise summary of the current ASCO guideline recommendations for neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer, serving as a valuable resource for clinicians, researchers, and patients seeking to navigate the complexities of breast cancer management.
