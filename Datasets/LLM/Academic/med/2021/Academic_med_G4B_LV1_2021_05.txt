**Abstract**

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) continues to present significant therapeutic challenges. Recent advances in oncology necessitate a refined approach to systemic treatment, particularly considering the evolving landscape of targeted therapies and immunotherapies. This document synthesizes updated recommendations derived from 2021 NCCN guidelines, emphasizing the integration of biomarker testing to guide treatment selection.  Specifically, the increasing evidence supporting the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors – including anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 agents – is now routinely incorporated into first-line regimens for eligible patients.  Furthermore, the utilization of companion diagnostics, such as microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB) assays, is critically important for predicting response.  Finally, this discussion acknowledges the potential role of biosimilars in improving access to established therapies and underscores the need for continued research to optimize treatment strategies within this complex disease setting.
