**Abstract**

This retrospective analysis of data from the CATNON trial investigated prognostic biomarkers in patients with IDH1/2-mutant anaplastic astrocytomas, a challenging malignancy with limited therapeutic options. Utilizing next-generation sequencing (NGS) and DNA methylation profiling, we sought to identify independent predictors of patient outcomes, beyond established clinical factors. Our findings demonstrate that specific DNA methylation-based classifiers, in conjunction with identified genetic alterations, significantly and independently predicted overall survival. These molecular signatures offer potential refinement of risk stratification and may inform personalized therapeutic strategies, particularly in the context of temozolomide treatment. Further investigation into the interplay between DNA methylation patterns, genetic landscape, and response to chemotherapy is warranted to optimize treatment approaches and ultimately improve prognosis for patients diagnosed with this aggressive glioma subtype.
