**Abstract**

The management of early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer continues to evolve, necessitating regularly updated clinical guidance. This analysis reflects the revisions outlined in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines Insights, Version 4 (2021), which detail nuanced recommendations for adjuvant systemic therapy.  The multidisciplinary expert panel emphasized refinements in endocrine-based approaches, including the expanded utility of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors in combination with aromatase inhibitors, particularly for patients with high-risk features.  Furthermore, the document addresses considerations for chemotherapy incorporation within this patient population, emphasizing individualized risk assessment and de-escalation strategies. These updates aim to optimize treatment efficacy while minimizing toxicity, ultimately improving long-term outcomes for individuals diagnosed with this prevalent breast cancer subtype.
