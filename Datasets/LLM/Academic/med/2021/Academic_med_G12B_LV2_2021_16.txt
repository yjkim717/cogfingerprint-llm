**Plasma p-Tau231 as a Predictive Biomarker for Early Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology: Validation and Correlation with Amyloid-β PET Status**

**Abstract**

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents a significant and growing global health challenge, demanding improved diagnostic tools for early and accurate intervention. Current diagnostic criteria rely on a combination of clinical assessments, neuroimaging (including amyloid-β positron emission tomography [PET]), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. However, the invasive nature of CSF collection and the relatively late detection associated with amyloid-β PET imaging necessitate the identification of more accessible and sensitive biomarkers for preclinical AD. This study investigates the utility of plasma phosphorylated tau at amino acid 231 (p-Tau231) as a robust biomarker for detecting early AD pathology, independent of amyloid-β deposition. Utilizing a single molecule array (Simoa) platform for highly sensitive quantification of p-Tau231 in plasma, we retrospectively analyzed data from [Specify Study Population – e.g., a longitudinal cohort of cognitively normal individuals and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)] undergoing both plasma p-Tau231 assessment and amyloid-β PET imaging.

Our findings demonstrate a strong and statistically significant correlation between plasma p-Tau231 levels and AD pathology, as evidenced by increased amyloid-β burden on PET scans (r = [Insert Correlation Coefficient, e.g., 0.72, p < 0.001]). Critically, elevated p-Tau231 levels were observed in individuals who were amyloid-β PET negative, suggesting that p-Tau231 can detect tau pathology *prior* to detectable amyloid deposition. Furthermore, p-Tau231 exhibited superior discriminatory power compared to other commonly assessed plasma biomarkers, including total tau and Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio, in distinguishing individuals with preclinical AD from cognitively normal controls (AUC = [Insert AUC Value, e.g., 0.88, p < 0.001]).  Subgroup analyses revealed that the relationship between p-Tau231 and amyloid-β PET status was consistent across different age groups and APOE ε4 carrier statuses, although further investigation with larger cohorts is warranted to fully elucidate potential modulating effects of genetic risk factors.

These results validate plasma p-Tau231 as a highly accurate and potentially transformative biomarker for early AD detection, offering a non-invasive alternative or adjunct to existing diagnostic modalities. The ability to detect tau pathology independent of amyloid-β deposition holds significant implications for identifying individuals at risk of AD progression and for facilitating enrollment in clinical trials targeting tau-based therapeutics.  Future research should focus on longitudinal validation within diverse populations and exploring the clinical utility of p-Tau231 in guiding treatment decisions and monitoring disease progression.  The enhanced sensitivity of Simoa technology has enabled this critical advancement in AD biomarker research, paving the way for earlier
