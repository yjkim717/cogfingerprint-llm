**Abstract**

The escalating global burden of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) necessitates the development of reliable, early biomarkers for accurate diagnosis and prediction of disease progression.  This study investigates the utility of plasma phosphorylated total tau 231 (p-tau231) as a sensitive indicator of underlying neuropathological changes in AD, employing a novel single molecule array (Simoa) technology.  We hypothesized that elevated plasma p-tau231 levels reflect early synaptic dysfunction and neuronal damage, preceding the detectable accumulation of amyloid-β pathology – a hallmark of later-stage AD. 

A cohort of [Insert Number] patients, including individuals diagnosed with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and age-matched controls, underwent comprehensive clinical and neuroimaging assessments. Plasma samples were analyzed using Simoa to quantify p-tau231 levels. Results demonstrate a statistically significant elevation in plasma p-tau231 concentrations in AD patients compared to both MCI and control groups (p < 0.001).  

Notably, p-tau231 levels exhibited a strong correlation with established neuropathological measures, including hippocampal volume reduction and amyloid-β burden as assessed via PET imaging.  Furthermore, plasma p-tau231 demonstrated superior discriminatory power in differentiating AD from other neurodegenerative disorders, surpassing conventional amyloid-β biomarkers. These findings strongly support the validation of plasma p-tau231 as a potentially transformative biomarker for early detection and risk stratification in AD, offering a valuable tool for clinical trials and longitudinal monitoring.  Further research is warranted to explore the dynamic changes in p-tau231 levels and their predictive value across the spectrum of disease severity.
