**Abstract**

Glioblastoma (GBM) represents a significant therapeutic challenge, with aggressive tumor growth and poor patient prognosis frequently linked to a dysregulated tumor microenvironment (TME). Altered pH within the TME is increasingly recognized as a critical factor influencing invasiveness, angiogenesis, and therapeutic resistance. This study investigates the potential of dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI (DSC-EPI) as a non-invasive method for estimating tumor pH in GBM patients. Utilizing principal component analysis (PCA) on acquired DSC-EPI data, we demonstrate a robust correlation between PCA-derived pH estimates and those obtained via pH-sensitive chemical exchange saturation transfer echo planar imaging (CEST-EPI).  Our findings suggest that PCA of standard clinical MRI sequences can provide valuable, readily accessible information regarding peritumoral acidity, potentially enabling improved characterization of the TME and facilitating personalized therapeutic strategies in GBM management. Further validation with larger cohorts is warranted to fully assess the clinical utility of this approach.
