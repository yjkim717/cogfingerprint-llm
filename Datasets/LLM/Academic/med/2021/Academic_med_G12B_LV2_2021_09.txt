**Genetic Predisposition to Earlier Diurnal Preference and Protection Against Major Depressive Disorder: A Mendelian Randomization Study**

Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a significant global health burden, with complex etiological factors. While environmental influences, including sleep disturbances, are recognized contributors, the nature of the relationship between sleep characteristics and MDD remains incompletely understood, particularly regarding potential causal pathways. This study investigated the hypothesis that an earlier diurnal preference – a genetically determined tendency to wake and sleep earlier – confers protection against MDD, employing a robust Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to infer causality. We leveraged genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for diurnal preference (defined as sleep midpoint using actigraphy data) and MDD, obtained from large-scale, publicly available datasets.  Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) significantly associated with sleep midpoint (instrumental variables, IVs) were selected, rigorously assessed for pleiotropy using MR-Egger regression, weighted median MR, and funnel plots, and utilized to estimate the causal effect of earlier sleep midpoint on MDD risk.

Our analysis revealed a statistically significant inverse association between genetically proxied earlier sleep midpoint and the risk of MDD (β = -0.15, 95% Confidence Interval [CI: -0.22, -0.08], *p* < 0.001). This finding suggests that individuals with a genetic predisposition towards earlier sleep timing may exhibit a reduced susceptibility to MDD. Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger intercept tests and Cochran’s Q statistic for heterogeneity, did not provide evidence of substantial directional pleiotropy invalidating the core findings.  Furthermore, we explored potential mediating pathways, considering genetic correlations with traits previously implicated in MDD etiology, such as chronotype-related hormone levels (e.g., melatonin) and inflammatory markers, although data limitations prevented definitive conclusions regarding mediation.

These findings contribute to a growing body of evidence suggesting a complex interplay between sleep regulation and mental health. The use of MR strengthens the inference of a potential causal relationship, mitigating concerns of reverse causation and confounding that often plague observational studies. While this study provides valuable insights, limitations include the potential for residual confounding by unmeasured genetic factors and the reliance on publicly available GWAS data, which may not capture the full spectrum of genetic variation. Future research should investigate the underlying biological mechanisms linking earlier sleep timing to MDD resilience, potentially focusing on the influence of circadian rhythm stability and its impact on neurobiological processes relevant to depression.  Ultimately, understanding these causal pathways may inform the development of targeted preventative strategies and novel therapeutic interventions for MDD.
