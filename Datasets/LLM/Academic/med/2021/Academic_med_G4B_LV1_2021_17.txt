**The Convergent Role of Vascular Risk Factors in Accelerating Alzheimer’s Disease Progression: Evidence from Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers**

**Abstract:**  Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents a significant and growing global health challenge, characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Emerging evidence suggests a complex interplay between cerebrovascular health and AD pathogenesis. This study investigated the relationship between established vascular risk factors and AD progression in a cohort of cognitively unimpaired individuals. Utilizing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers – including amyloid-β42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau – we assessed longitudinal changes in neurodegeneration and cognitive function over a three-year period.  Results demonstrated a statistically significant association between elevated levels of traditional vascular risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes) and accelerated rates of cognitive decline. Furthermore, these risk factors were observed to synergistically exacerbate increases in CSF tau isoforms, indicative of intensified neurodegeneration.  These findings underscore the critical importance of considering vascular health as a modifiable risk factor in AD prevention and treatment strategies.  Targeted interventions addressing vascular risk, alongside conventional AD therapies, may represent a more effective approach to mitigating disease progression and preserving cognitive function.  Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying this interaction.
