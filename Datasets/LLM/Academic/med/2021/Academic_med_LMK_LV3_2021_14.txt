Title: Assessing Orthodontic Treatment Needs among Syrian Refugee Children: A Cross-Sectional Study on Malocclusion Prevalence and Oral Health Implications

Abstract:

Background: The global refugee crisis has led to a significant influx of Syrian refugees into neighboring countries, posing substantial challenges to local healthcare systems. Among the most vulnerable populations are children and adolescents, who often suffer from unaddressed oral health issues due to displacement and limited access to healthcare services. Malocclusion, a prevalent condition among children, can have long-term implications on oral health, self-esteem, and overall quality of life.

Objectives: This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the prevalence of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment needs among Syrian refugee children and adolescents, utilizing the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN).

Methods: Conducted in 2021, this study examined a representative sample of 500 Syrian refugee children aged 8-16 years, residing in refugee camps. Trained orthodontists assessed the participants' dental occlusion using the IOTN, which categorizes treatment needs into three grades: 'no/slight need,' 'borderline need,' and 'great need.'

Results: The findings revealed a high prevalence of malocclusion among the study population, with over 70% of participants exhibiting a 'great need' for orthodontic treatment according to the IOTN. The most common types of malocclusion observed were crowding, spacing, and overjet. The study also identified a significant correlation between malocclusion severity and oral health-related quality of life.

Conclusion: The high prevalence of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment needs among Syrian refugee children underscores the urgent requirement for comprehensive interceptive orthodontic programs. Such initiatives should prioritize early intervention, aiming to mitigate the long-term consequences of untreated malocclusion on oral health and overall well-being. Policymakers and healthcare providers must collaborate to integrate orthodontic services into existing healthcare frameworks for refugee populations, ensuring equitable access to essential oral health care.

Implications: This study highlights the need for targeted oral health interventions and policy reforms to address the unique challenges faced by refugee populations. By integrating orthodontic care into primary healthcare services, governments and humanitarian organizations can improve the oral health and overall quality of life for vulnerable children and adolescents affected by conflict and displacement.
