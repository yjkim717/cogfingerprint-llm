**Abstract**

The accurate and early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology remains a critical challenge in clinical management and therapeutic development. This study reports the validation of a novel ultrasensitive immunoassay for plasma phosphorylated tau at amino acid position 231 (p-tau231) as a robust biomarker for AD. Utilizing a cohort of participants encompassing individuals with AD, other neurodegenerative disorders, and cognitively unimpaired controls, we demonstrate that plasma p-tau231 levels correlate strongly with underlying neuropathological burden, exhibiting superior discriminatory power compared to existing biomarkers. Notably, our findings indicate that elevated p-tau231 levels can be detected prior to amyloid-Î² positivity as determined by standard positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, suggesting potential utility in identifying individuals at risk of AD progression. These results support the implementation of this p-tau231 assay in clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies and for the prospective identification of vulnerable populations for preventative interventions, marking a significant advancement in the early diagnosis and management of AD.
