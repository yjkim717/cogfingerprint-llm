**Abstract**

Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents a significant global public health burden, necessitating a deeper understanding of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors. While circadian rhythm disturbances are increasingly recognized as implicated in MDD etiology, the precise nature of this relationship remains incompletely elucidated. This study investigated the potential causal role of diurnal preference – an individual’s inclination towards morningness or eveningness – in the development of MDD, employing a robust mendelian randomization (MR) framework. Leveraging genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for diurnal preference, we utilized single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables to assess the effect of genetically proxied earlier diurnal preference on MDD risk, accounting for potential confounding through objective sleep timing measures.  Data analysis was performed in 2021, utilizing publicly available GWAS datasets on MDD and diurnal preference. Our MR analysis revealed a statistically significant and protective association between genetically determined earlier diurnal preference and a reduced risk of MDD (p < 0.05).  Furthermore, the observed association was partially mediated by sleep timing characteristics, specifically earlier sleep onset and wake times. These findings provide compelling evidence for a causal link between diurnal preference and MDD susceptibility, independent of confounding from observed sleep behaviors.  This study supports the growing body of literature highlighting the importance of circadian alignment in mental health and suggests potential avenues for preventative interventions targeting diurnal preference and sleep regulation to mitigate MDD risk. Future research should focus on refining our understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms and exploring the applicability of these findings to diverse populations.
