The 2021 update to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Colon Cancer marks a significant evolution in the systemic management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), reflecting a paradigm shift towards precision oncology. A cornerstone of this revision is the first-line recommendation for immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors, leveraging the high mutational burden of these cancers to elicit robust antitumor immune responses. Concurrently, the guidelines endorse the use of biosimilars for reference biologic agents, promoting cost-effective and accessible care. Furthermore, the update mandates expanded biomarker testing, now considered essential for therapeutic stratification. This facilitates the deployment of targeted therapies in molecularly defined subgroups, including anti-HER2 agents for HER2-amplified disease and combination regimens for BRAF V600E mutation-positive mCRC. Collectively, these evidence-based refinements underscore a more personalized, biomarker-driven treatment algorithm, aiming to optimize clinical outcomes by aligning therapeutic selection with individual tumor biology.
