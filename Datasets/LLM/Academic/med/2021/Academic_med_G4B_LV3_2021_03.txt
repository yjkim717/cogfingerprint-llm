**Abstract**

Emerging evidence suggests a complex interplay between established vascular risk factors and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This study investigates the predictive value of combined vascular profiles in individuals exhibiting cognitively unimpaired status, utilizing longitudinal analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and neuroimaging data collected in 2021. Our findings reveal a significant synergistic effect wherein elevated levels of traditional vascular risk markers – including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes – substantially accelerate neurodegeneration, as evidenced by decreased white matter integrity and increased amyloid deposition.  Specifically, individuals with greater cumulative vascular risk scores demonstrated a markedly steeper rate of cognitive decline, as measured by standardized neuropsychological testing. These results underscore the importance of considering vascular health as a critical modifiable risk factor in the early stages of AD.  The identification of this interaction warrants further investigation into targeted therapeutic interventions addressing both vascular and neurodegenerative pathways, potentially delaying disease progression and mitigating cognitive impairment.
