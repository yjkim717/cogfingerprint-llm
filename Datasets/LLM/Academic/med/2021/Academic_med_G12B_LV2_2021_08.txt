## Adjuvant Nivolumab Improves Disease-Free Survival in Resected Esophageal and Gastroesophageal Junction Cancers: Results from the CheckMate 577 Trial

**Abstract:** Esophageal cancer (EC) and gastroesophageal junction cancer (GC) represent significant clinical challenges, frequently exhibiting high rates of recurrence following surgical resection. Adjuvant therapies have historically yielded modest benefits, prompting investigation into novel immunotherapeutic approaches. This study summarizes the findings of the CheckMate 577 trial, a pivotal Phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy of nivolumab, a programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor, in the adjuvant setting for patients with resected EC or GC.  A total of 713 patients with stage II or III disease, confirmed by pathological staging, were randomized to receive either nivolumab or placebo every two weeks for up to one year, following curative-intent surgery and chemoradiation. The primary endpoint, disease-free survival (DFS), was significantly improved in the nivolumab arm compared to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53-0.86; *p* < 0.001).  Median DFS was 23.3 months with nivolumab versus 17.0 months with placebo.  While immune-related adverse events (irAEs) were observed more frequently in the nivolumab group, the safety profile was generally manageable with standard supportive care and immunosuppression. These results represent a significant advancement in the treatment of EC and GC, establishing nivolumab as a valuable adjuvant therapeutic option for improving DFS in patients undergoing resection. The findings underscore the potential of immunotherapy to overcome the limitations of conventional adjuvant approaches and suggest a shift in the standard of care for this aggressive malignancy. Further research is warranted to identify predictive biomarkers for response to nivolumab and optimize treatment strategies.
