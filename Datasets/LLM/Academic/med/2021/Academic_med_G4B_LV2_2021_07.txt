**Abstract**

The evolving landscape of anaplastic gliomas necessitates refined prognostic strategies to optimize patient management and treatment responses. This study leverages genome-wide DNA methylation analysis, utilizing data from the Collaborative Analysis of Notched Oligodendrogliomas (CATNON) trial, to investigate the predictive utility of epigenetic modifications in IDH1/2-mutant anaplastic astrocytomas. Employing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we conducted a comprehensive analysis correlating DNA methylation patterns with clinical outcomes within this cohort. Our investigation aimed to identify novel biomarkers capable of stratifying patients based on their likelihood of response to standard of care, specifically temozolomide chemotherapy. 

Preliminary findings demonstrate significant differential methylation signatures associated with patient survival and treatment efficacy. Specifically, alterations in methylation levels at key genomic loci were correlated with both shorter progression-free survival and reduced overall survival. These identified methylation markers represent potential prognostic factors, offering a mechanistic insight into the complex interplay between tumor biology and therapeutic response.  

The identification of these epigenetic signatures holds considerable promise for enhancing patient stratification prior to initiating temozolomide therapy. Future research will focus on validating these findings in independent cohorts and exploring the functional implications of the observed methylation changes. Ultimately, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of IDH1/2-mutant anaplastic astrocytomas and underscores the potential of DNA methylation analysis as a valuable tool for personalized oncology.
