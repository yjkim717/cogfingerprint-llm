Title: Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profiling Reveals Prognostic Factors in IDH1/2-Mutant Anaplastic Astrocytoma

Abstract:

Anaplastic astrocytoma, a malignant glioma characterized by high genetic heterogeneity, exhibits variable clinical outcomes in patients harboring IDH1/2 mutations. To elucidate the molecular determinants underlying this variability, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in IDH1/2-mutant anaplastic astrocytoma. Utilizing next-generation sequencing and DNA methylation arrays, we investigated the epigenetic landscape of 50 tumor samples. Unsupervised clustering of DNA methylation data revealed distinct epigenetic subgroups, which were subsequently correlated with clinical outcomes. Multivariate analysis identified a subset of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) significantly associated with overall survival. Notably, the methylation status of specific gene promoters, including those involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair, emerged as independent prognostic factors. Furthermore, integration of DNA methylation data with mutational profiles revealed a significant correlation between IDH1/2 mutation status and the methylation signature of tumor suppressor genes. Our findings demonstrate that genome-wide DNA methylation profiling can stratify IDH1/2-mutant anaplastic astrocytoma patients into distinct prognostic subgroups, providing a molecular framework for risk assessment and personalized treatment strategies. The identification of novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets underscores the clinical relevance of epigenetic alterations in this malignancy. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the utility of DNA methylation analysis in glioma diagnosis and prognosis, and highlights the need for further research into the epigenetic mechanisms driving tumor progression.
