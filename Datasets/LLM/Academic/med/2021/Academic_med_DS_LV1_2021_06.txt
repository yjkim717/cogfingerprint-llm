**Title:** Optimizing Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy for Operable Breast Cancer: A 2021 Evidence-Based Paradigm for Subtype-Directed Treatment Selection

**Background:** The administration of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) for operable breast cancer has evolved beyond tumor downstaging to become a critical platform for in vivo assessment of treatment efficacy and a determinant of subsequent adjuvant strategies. The profound heterogeneity of breast cancer necessitates a refined, biologically driven approach to NST selection, as response and long-term outcomes are intrinsically linked to molecular subtype.

**Methods:** This review synthesizes contemporary evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses published through mid-2021 to establish a modern framework for NST. The focus is on tailoring regimens according to the established subtypes defined by hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status. For each subtype, the rationale for specific chemotherapeutic, targeted, and immunotherapeutic agents is evaluated against key efficacy endpoints, primarily pathologic complete response (pCR) and its surrogacy for long-term survival.

**Results:** In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors, notably pembrolizumab, with anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy has demonstrated a significant and practice-changing increase in pCR rates, establishing a new standard of care. For HER2-positive disease, dual HER2-targeted blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab combined with chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of NST, with compelling data supporting the use of adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in patients with residual disease post-NST. Conversely, for HR-positive/HER2-negative disease, where chemotherapy sensitivity is lower, the primary goal of NST shifts to facilitating breast-conserving surgery. The role of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy, particularly in postmenopausal women, is reinforced, while the value of multigene assays to identify patients with highly endocrine-sensitive tumors who may forego chemotherapy is increasingly recognized.

**Conclusion:** The paradigm for NST in 2021 is unequivocally one of precision medicine. Treatment selection must be predicated on comprehensive biomarker assessment at diagnosis. Achieving a pCR holds the greatest prognostic significance in TNBC and HER2-positive subtypes, directly informing the use of escalated adjuvant therapy, while in HR-positive disease, surgical outcomes and long-term endocrine sensitivity are the paramount considerations. This subtype-directed strategy optimizes oncologic outcomes while minimizing unnecessary toxicity.
