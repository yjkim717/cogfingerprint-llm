Of growing interest in the field of neurodegenerative disease research is the complex interplay between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology and modifiable systemic factors. This study investigates the synergistic interaction between aggregate vascular risk burden and core AD biomarkers on the rate of neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive decline in the preclinical phase of the disease. We hypothesized that the co-occurrence of elevated vascular risk and AD pathophysiology would accelerate neuronal injury beyond the additive effects of either condition alone, and that plasma neurofilament light (NfL), a sensitive biomarker of axonal damage, would quantify this interaction.

A cohort of 450 cognitively unimpaired older adults from the prospective Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-3) was stratified based on their Vascular Risk Burden Score (VRBS) and amyloid-β status (Aβ+/-), determined by positron emission tomography. Plasma NfL concentrations were measured at baseline and 24-month follow-up, serving as a dynamic proxy for neuroaxonal injury. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to assess the longitudinal trajectories of plasma NfL and their association with cognitive performance on the Preclinical Alzheimer’s Cognitive Composite (PACC).

Our results demonstrate a significant VRBS-by-Aβ-status interaction on the rate of plasma NfL increase (F(1, 445) = 8.92, p < 0.01). The Aβ+ group with high VRBS exhibited a markedly steeper annualized increase in plasma NfL (Δ +4.1 pg/mL/year, 95% CI 3.2–5.0) compared to Aβ+ individuals with low VRBS or Aβ- groups. This accelerated neuroaxonal injury was further associated with a more rapid decline on the PACC over the study period (β = -0.31, p < 0.001). These findings, current for 2021, underscore that vascular risk factors do not merely coexist with AD but actively potentiate its neurodegenerative cascade. The quantification of this synergy via plasma NfL provides a compelling rationale for implementing combined therapeutic strategies targeting both cerebrovascular health and AD pathology in at-risk populations during the preclinical window.
