This 2021 update to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) provides a critical synthesis of contemporary systemic therapy strategies. The recommendations are increasingly stratified by molecular profiling, underscoring the necessity of comprehensive biomarker testing to guide targeted therapy selection. The guidelines formally integrate immune checkpoint inhibitors for tumors with specific molecular phenotypes, such as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) status. Furthermore, the document addresses the incorporation of biosimilars for reference biologic agents, reflecting their established role in expanding treatment access and managing healthcare costs. This structured, evidence-based framework aims to optimize therapeutic precision and patient outcomes in mCRC by aligning treatment pathways with individual tumor biology and available therapeutic modalities.
