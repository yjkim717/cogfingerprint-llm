Title: Harnessing CRISPR/Cas9 for Enhanced Adoptive T-Cell Therapy in Cancer Immunotherapy

Abstract:
Adoptive T-cell therapy has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy, leveraging the potency of T cells to selectively target and eliminate malignant cells. Recent advances in CRISPR/Cas9 technology have revolutionized the field by enabling precise genome editing of T cells. This review highlights the applications of CRISPR/Cas9 in enhancing adoptive T-cell therapy through the modification of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). By disrupting genes involved in T-cell exhaustion and alloreactivity, CRISPR/Cas9 can improve T-cell persistence and specificity. Furthermore, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing can facilitate the introduction of novel CARs and TCRs, broadening the antigen recognition repertoire of T cells. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of CRISPR/Cas9 technology is poised to overcome current limitations and unlock the full potential of adoptive T-cell therapy in cancer treatment. Ongoing research is expected to translate these advances into clinical benefits for patients with cancer.
