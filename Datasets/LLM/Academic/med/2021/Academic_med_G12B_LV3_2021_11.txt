**Abstract**

The landscape of cancer immunotherapy is undergoing a transformative shift driven by the precision of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology. This review synthesizes recent progress in leveraging CRISPR/Cas9 to enhance adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT), a promising yet complex treatment modality. Traditional ACT approaches, while demonstrating efficacy in select hematological malignancies, face limitations including T-cell exhaustion, antigen escape, and off-target toxicities. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated engineering offers targeted solutions to these challenges by enabling precise modification of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Specifically, strategies involving TCR gene editing are being explored to improve tumor specificity and mitigate graft-versus-host disease, while CAR T-cell engineering utilizes CRISPR to knock out inhibitory receptors, insert costimulatory domains, and refine antigen recognition. This review critically evaluates these advancements, highlighting preclinical and early clinical trial data demonstrating improved persistence, efficacy, and safety profiles. Furthermore, we address current hurdles, including efficient delivery of CRISPR components, minimizing off-target effects, and ensuring long-term stability of engineered T-cells. Despite these challenges, the integration of CRISPR/Cas9 into ACT holds significant potential for expanding the applicability of this therapy to solid tumors and overcoming resistance mechanisms, representing a crucial area of ongoing research and clinical development.
