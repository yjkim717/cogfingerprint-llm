**Abstract**

Emerging evidence underscores the complex interplay between vascular health and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. This retrospective cohort study, conducted in 2021, investigated the impact of cumulative vascular risk factors (VVRFs) on neurodegenerative processes within a population of cognitively unimpaired individuals. Our findings reveal a significant synergistic relationship wherein a heightened VVRF burden – encompassing hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia – accelerates the progression of AD-related neurodegeneration, even in the preclinical phase. The observed acceleration of cognitive decline suggests that VVRFs may exacerbate underlying AD pathology, independently and interactively. These results advocate for a paradigm shift towards integrated therapeutic interventions targeting both established VVRFs and core AD pathologies to mitigate disease progression and potentially delay the onset of dementia.
