**Abstract**

The 2021 publication of the EORTC CATNON trial data marked a pivotal advancement in the prognostic stratification of IDH1/2-mutant anaplastic astrocytoma, a molecularly defined subset of diffuse gliomas. Prior to this, clinical management was challenged by significant heterogeneity in patient outcomes, underscoring the insufficiency of histopathological grading alone. This landmark analysis systematically integrated comprehensive clinical parameters with high-resolution molecular profiling to construct a more refined prognostic model. A key finding was the independent prognostic power of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns, which enable the subclassification of tumors into distinct epigenetic subgroups with differential survival trajectories. Furthermore, the presence of specific copy number variations (CNVs), such as homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/B, was robustly associated with poorer survival, solidifying the role of genomic alterations alongside the canonical IDH mutation. The trial thereby established a multifactorial framework where the synergistic interpretation of clinical variables, epigenetic classifiers, and somatic CNVs significantly enhances the accuracy of risk assessment. This paradigm shift from a purely histological to an integrated molecular-clinical diagnostic approach has profound implications for clinical trial design and patient management. It facilitates the identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from intensified therapeutic regimens within future stratified trials, while also sparing those with favorable molecular profiles from undue treatment-related toxicity. Consequently, the CATNON findings provide a foundational evidence base for personalizing adjuvant therapy and have been instrumental in informing contemporary neuro-oncology guidelines.
