**Abstract**

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines Insights, Version 4.2021, reflect evolving evidence-based approaches to adjuvant systemic therapy for early-stage breast cancer. This document provides critical updates pertaining specifically to patients with nonmetastatic disease characterized by hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) status. The multidisciplinary expert panel's recommendations address refinements in endocrine therapy sequencing, incorporation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, and considerations for genomic-guided treatment strategies. These revisions aim to optimize disease-free survival and overall survival while minimizing treatment-related toxicities, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes within the complex landscape of HR+/HER2- breast cancer management.
