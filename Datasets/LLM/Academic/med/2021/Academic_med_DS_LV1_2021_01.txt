This report details a symptomatic presentation of a pulmonary hamartoma, a rare occurrence for this typically asymptomatic benign lung tumor. A 44-year-old female presented in 2021 with a persistent cough, dyspnea, and marked fatigue. Diagnostic imaging, including computed tomography, identified a characteristic lesion with popcorn calcification. Following a multidisciplinary review, the patient underwent successful video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical resection. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a chondroid hamartoma. The case underscores that while pulmonary hamartomas are often incidental findings, they can manifest with significant clinical symptoms, necessitating a tailored approach to diagnosis and intervention to alleviate morbidity.
