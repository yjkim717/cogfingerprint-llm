**Plasma Phosphorylated Tau231 (p-tau231) as a Superior Biomarker for Early Detection and Differentiation of Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology**

**Abstract**

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents a significant and growing global health challenge, necessitating the development of sensitive and specific biomarkers for early detection and accurate diagnosis. While amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau pathologies remain the hallmarks of AD, current diagnostic approaches, including amyloid PET imaging, often lack sufficient sensitivity to identify preclinical disease or differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative conditions. This study investigates the clinical utility of plasma phosphorylated tau at amino acid 231 (p-tau231) as a potential biomarker for AD, evaluating its performance in detecting and differentiating AD pathology relative to established methods.

A cohort of [Number] participants, comprising cognitively unimpaired controls (CU), individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients diagnosed with AD according to the NIA-AA criteria [Citation 1], were recruited for this longitudinal observational study. Plasma samples were collected and analyzed for p-tau231 levels using a validated [Methodology – e.g., single-molecule array (SIMA) immunoassay]. Amyloid status was assessed via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ42 and Aβ40 concentrations and/or amyloid PET imaging. Tau pathology was evaluated using CSF phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and/or tau PET imaging.

Our results demonstrate a strong correlation between plasma p-tau231 levels and both amyloid and tau pathologies.  Importantly, p-tau231 exhibited significantly higher accuracy in detecting AD pathology, as defined by amyloid positivity and/or tau positivity, compared to standard amyloid PET positivity (SUVrCU > 1.5) [Citation 2]. Furthermore, p-tau231 demonstrated superior discriminatory power between CU, MCI, and AD groups (AUC = [Value], p < 0.001), outperforming CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratios and even showing increased sensitivity in individuals with low amyloid burden. Analysis revealed that p-tau231 levels were elevated in individuals with preclinical AD, defined as amyloid positivity but without cognitive decline, suggesting its potential for early disease detection.  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that a p-tau231 threshold of [Value] provided optimal sensitivity and specificity for identifying individuals with AD pathology.  These findings are consistent with recent reports highlighting the prognostic value of p-tau isoforms [Citation 3].

In conclusion, plasma p-tau231, assessed using the Sima platform, emerges as a robust and highly accurate biomarker for detecting and differentiating AD pathology, even in the presence of subtle or absent amyloid accumulation.  Its ease of acquisition and potential for early detection make it a promising tool for clinical trials targeting AD prevention and for the development of more accurate diagnostic algorithms. Further research is warranted to validate these findings in larger, more diverse cohorts and to
