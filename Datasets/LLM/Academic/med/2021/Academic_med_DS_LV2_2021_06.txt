**Abstract**

**Background:** The utilization of neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in breast cancer management has evolved beyond its initial role of downstaging locally advanced tumors to become a critical platform for assessing in vivo treatment sensitivity and prognosticating long-term outcomes. The achievement of a pathologic complete response (pCR), defined as the absence of invasive cancer in the breast and axillary lymph nodes, is a validated surrogate endpoint for improved event-free and overall survival, particularly in aggressive subtypes. However, the selection of optimal NAT regimens remains complex, necessitating evidence-based guidelines to inform clinical decision-making.

**Objective:** This review synthesizes and critically appraises the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) evidence-based guidelines for the selection of NAT in early-stage, high-risk breast cancer, with a specific focus on the implications of pCR.

**Methods:** A systematic analysis of the guideline development process was conducted, including the systematic literature review, grading of evidence, and formulation of clinical recommendations. Key randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses informing the recommendations were evaluated.

**Results:** The guidelines provide subtype-specific recommendations, underscoring a paradigm of precision medicine. For triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the integration of checkpoint inhibitors with anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy is strongly recommended for eligible patients, based on demonstrated significant improvements in pCR rates. For HER2-positive disease, dual anti-HER2 blockade (pertuzumab and trastuzumab) combined with taxane-based chemotherapy is established as the standard of care, with the option for treatment de-escalation in patients achieving pCR post-NAT being an area of active investigation. The guidelines emphasize that the residual disease burden following NAT dictates subsequent adjuvant therapy, including the use of capecitabine for TNBC and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) for HER2-positive disease.

**Conclusion:** The 2021 ASCO guidelines provide a structured, evidence-based framework for personalizing NAT in breast cancer. The stratification by biologic subtype and the strategic use of pCR as a decision point for adjuvant therapy are pivotal to optimizing oncologic outcomes and represent the contemporary standard of care.
