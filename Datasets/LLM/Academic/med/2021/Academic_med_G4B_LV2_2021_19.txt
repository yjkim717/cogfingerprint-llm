**Abstract**

Recent advancements in systemic therapy have significantly impacted the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This abstract contextualizes evolving NCCN guidelines (2021) reflecting a paradigm shift towards personalized treatment strategies.  Checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have emerged as a critical component of first-line therapy for mCRC patients harboring specific microsatellite instability (MSI) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) status.  However, the efficacy of CPIs remains limited in microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors, necessitating exploration of alternative approaches. 

Biomarker testing, specifically MSI and dMMR analysis, now forms a foundational element of treatment selection.  Furthermore, the increasing availability and affordability of biosimilars for monoclonal antibodies are poised to expand access to these vital therapies.  Concurrent consideration of targeted therapies, alongside CPIs or as single agents, is increasingly recommended based on tumor mutational burden (TMB) and other predictive markers.  Continued research focusing on refining biomarker panels and identifying novel therapeutic targets remains paramount for optimizing patient outcomes in mCRC.
