**Title:** Plasma Phosphorylated Tau at Threonine 231 as an Incipient Biomarker of Alzheimer’s Disease Pathophysiology in the Pre-Amyloid PET Positive Stage

**Abstract**

The definitive neuropathological diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) hinges upon the post-mortem identification of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. In living individuals, the in vivo detection of cerebral Aβ pathology via positron emission tomography (PET) has become a cornerstone of the AT(N) research framework. However, Aβ PET is characterized by substantial cost, limited accessibility, and radiation exposure, constraining its utility for large-scale screening and preventative trials. Consequently, a critical unmet need exists for accessible and cost-effective blood-based biomarkers capable of identifying AD pathophysiology during its earliest, pre-symptomatic stages, prior to the established thresholds of Aβ PET positivity.

This study investigates the potential of plasma phosphorylated tau at threonine 231 (p-tau231) to serve as such an incipient biomarker. We hypothesized that elevations in plasma p-tau231 would be detectable in individuals with normal cognition and subjective cognitive decline who exhibit biomarker evidence of AD pathology below the conventional threshold for Aβ PET positivity. To test this, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a well-characterized cohort (n=350) from the Prospective Alzheimer’s Disease Biomarker Study, comprising cognitively unimpaired individuals and those with mild cognitive impairment. Participants underwent comprehensive assessment, including Aβ PET ([18F]Flutemetamol), structural MRI, and CSF analysis for Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau181. Plasma p-tau231 was quantified using a novel single-molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay.

Our findings demonstrate that plasma p-tau231 concentrations begin to increase significantly in individuals classified as in the "sub-threshold" or "grey-zone" of Aβ PET Centiloid values (approximately 10-30 CL), a stage where global Aβ burden is accumulating but has not yet surpassed the standard positivity threshold (typically >25-30 CL). Furthermore, plasma p-tau231 showed a stronger correlation with Aβ PET Centiloid values in this sub-threshold range than established plasma biomarkers, including p-tau181 and neurofilament light (NfL). Notably, plasma p-tau231 elevations in this pre-PET+ stage were associated with incipient atrophy in AD-vulnerable regions, such as the medial temporal lobe, as measured by MRI.

In conclusion, our data robustly position plasma p-tau231 as a leading fluid biomarker for detecting the earliest phases of AD-related pathological change. Its ability to identify individuals on the AD continuum before they reach conventional Aβ PET positivity thresholds holds profound implications for enriching prevention trials, monitoring sub-threshold disease progression, and ultimately enabling earlier therapeutic intervention when disease-modifying strategies are most likely to be efficacious.
