**Title:** Orthodontic Treatment Needs and Malocclusion Prevalence in Syrian Refugee Children and Adolescents Residing in the Zaatari Refugee Camp: A Cross-Sectional Assessment

**Abstract:**

**Background:** The protracted Syrian civil conflict has resulted in significant population displacement, with a substantial number of Syrian citizens seeking refuge in neighboring countries.  The impact of displacement on oral health, particularly concerning malocclusion and the subsequent need for orthodontic intervention, remains a relatively under-explored area. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of malocclusion and quantify orthodontic treatment needs among children and adolescents residing within the Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan, a significant settlement for Syrian refugees.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional study was conducted in Zaatari Camp during [Specify Timeframe, e.g., Q3 2021]. Participants included a randomly selected sample of [Specify Sample Size, e.g., 400] Syrian children and adolescents aged [Specify Age Range, e.g., 6-16 years].  Clinical examinations were performed by calibrated orthodontic specialists using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) to assess malocclusion severity and determine treatment needs categorized as: no treatment needed (NTN), minor irregularities (MI), definite treatment needed (DTN), and severe treatment needed (STN).  Data collected included age, gender, and self-reported dental history. Statistical analysis involved descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages) and Chi-square tests to examine potential associations between demographic variables and IOTN categories. Ethical approval was obtained from [Specify Ethical Review Board] and informed consent/assent was secured from parents/guardians and participants where appropriate.

**Results:** The prevalence of malocclusion, as determined by the IOTN, was found to be [Specify Prevalence Percentage, e.g., 78.5%].  A significant proportion of participants required orthodontic intervention, with [Specify Percentage, e.g., 22.3%] classified as DTN and [Specify Percentage, e.g., 6.8%] as STN. [Mention a significant finding, e.g., Female participants demonstrated a statistically significant higher prevalence of DTN malocclusions compared to male participants (p < 0.05)].  Self-reported dental history indicated [Summarize relevant findings, e.g., limited access to dental care within the camp setting].

**Conclusion:** This study highlights a substantial unmet need for orthodontic treatment among Syrian refugee children and adolescents residing in Zaatari Camp. The high prevalence of malocclusion, coupled with limited access to dental care, underscores the importance of implementing targeted orthodontic outreach programs and integrating orthodontic services within the existing healthcare infrastructure within refugee camps. Further research is warranted to investigate the long-term oral health consequences of displacement and to evaluate the effectiveness of various intervention strategies in this vulnerable population.
