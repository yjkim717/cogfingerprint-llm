This 2021 update to the NCCN Guidelines for early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer refines adjuvant systemic therapy recommendations. The analysis integrates recent clinical trial data to optimize treatment stratification based on recurrence risk. Key modifications address the duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy and the selective incorporation of CDK4/6 inhibitors in high-risk populations. These evidence-based revisions aim to personalize therapeutic approaches, balancing efficacy against potential toxicities. The updated algorithm provides clinicians with a structured framework for decision-making, ultimately seeking to improve long-term disease-free and overall survival outcomes for this prevalent patient subgroup.
