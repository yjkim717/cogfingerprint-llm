**Abstract**

The escalating global burden of neurodegenerative disorders, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD), necessitates the development of robust early detection biomarkers. This study investigates the utility of plasma p-tau231, a phosphorylated total tau protein isoform, as a novel indicator of preclinical AD pathology. Utilizing data from multiple independent cohorts collected in 2021, we demonstrate the assay’s capacity to differentiate AD-related changes from those observed in related neurodegenerative conditions such as frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson’s disease. Notably, plasma p-tau231 levels exhibited a strong correlation with established neuropathological assessments, predicting the presence of amyloid-β deposition prior to its clinical detection. These findings suggest that p-tau231 represents a promising biomarker for identifying individuals at risk of AD, potentially enabling earlier therapeutic intervention and facilitating longitudinal disease monitoring. Further validation across diverse populations is warranted to fully elucidate its clinical utility.
