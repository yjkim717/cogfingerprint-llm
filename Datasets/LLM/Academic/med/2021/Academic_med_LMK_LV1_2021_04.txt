The guidelines recommend tailored treatment approaches based on clinicopathological factors, including tumor size, grade, and genomic risk assessments. The updates aim to optimize adjuvant therapy selection, potentially improving outcomes for patients with HR+, HER2-negative early-stage breast cancer. By synthesizing the latest evidence, this analysis provides insight into the clinical implications of the revised guidelines, informing best practices in breast cancer management.
