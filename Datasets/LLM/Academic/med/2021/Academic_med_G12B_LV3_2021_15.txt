**Abstract**

Pulmonary hamartomas, typically asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, rarely present with overt clinical manifestations. This case study, reported in 2021, describes an atypical presentation of a pulmonary hamartoma in a 44-year-old female patient exhibiting symptomatic respiratory distress, including persistent cough, dyspnea, and debilitating fatigue. Radiological investigations revealed a solitary pulmonary nodule consistent with a hamartomatous lesion. The observed symptomatic presentation challenges the conventional understanding of this benign lung tumor, necessitating consideration of its potential for local mass effect and airway obstruction. This report details the diagnostic pathway, encompassing chest radiography and computed tomography, culminating in surgical resection.  We discuss the diagnostic and management considerations for pulmonary hamartomas presenting with atypical clinical features, emphasizing the importance of a thorough evaluation to differentiate from malignant etiologies and optimize patient outcomes.
