Title: A Rare Presentation of Symptomatic Pulmonary Hamartoma: A Case Report

Abstract:
In 2021, a 44-year-old woman presented with a rare symptomatic pulmonary hamartoma, a benign lung tumor, exhibiting atypical respiratory symptoms. The case highlights an unusual clinical manifestation, challenging conventional diagnostic approaches. Following thorough evaluation and histopathological confirmation, surgical resection was performed, alleviating symptoms. This report underscores the importance of considering pulmonary hamartoma in the differential diagnosis of benign lung lesions, even in symptomatic cases with atypical presentations, to ensure timely and effective management.
