Title: Investigating the Causal Relationship between Diurnal Preference and Major Depressive Disorder using Mendelian Randomization

Abstract:

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric condition affecting millions worldwide, with a multifactorial etiology involving genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Recent studies have suggested a link between sleep timing and diurnal preference with the risk of developing MDD. However, the nature of this association remains unclear, and it is uncertain whether diurnal preference has a causal effect on MDD. This study employed a Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach to investigate the causal relationship between genetically proxied diurnal preference and the risk of MDD.

Using summary-level data from large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) conducted in 2021, we identified genetic variants associated with diurnal preference and MDD. The GWAS dataset for diurnal preference included 449,734 individuals, while the MDD GWAS dataset comprised 143,265 cases and 368,695 controls. We applied a two-sample MR analysis using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method to estimate the causal effect of diurnal preference on MDD. Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression and weighted median estimation, were performed to assess the robustness of our findings.

Our results demonstrate that genetically proxied earlier diurnal preference is associated with a lower risk of MDD (IVW odds ratio: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.73-0.91, P = 2.2 × 10^−4). The MR-Egger regression analysis did not indicate any significant evidence of directional pleiotropy (intercept P = 0.62), and the weighted median estimate was consistent with the IVW result (odds ratio: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74-0.93, P = 1.3 × 10^−3). These findings suggest that earlier diurnal preference may have a protective effect against MDD.

Our study provides evidence for a causal relationship between diurnal preference and MDD, suggesting that individuals with an earlier diurnal preference may be at lower risk of developing MDD. The MR approach used in this study minimizes the impact of confounding variables and reverse causation, providing a more robust estimate of the causal effect. The findings of this study have implications for the prevention and treatment of MDD, highlighting the potential importance of sleep timing and diurnal preference in the development of the disorder. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which diurnal preference influences MDD risk and to explore the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting sleep timing in MDD prevention and treatment.
