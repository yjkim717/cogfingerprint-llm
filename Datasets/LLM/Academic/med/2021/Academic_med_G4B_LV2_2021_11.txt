**Abstract:**

Recent progress in cancer immunotherapy has increasingly leveraged the power of T-cell therapies, notably chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells and T cell receptor (TCR) T-cells. However, limitations in efficacy and patient selection necessitate innovative approaches to enhance T-cell function and persistence. This review examines the emerging role of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in refining adoptive T-cell therapy for oncology. Specifically, we detail strategies employing CRISPR/Cas9 to modulate T-cell receptor signaling, eliminate inhibitory receptors, and enhance cytokine production â€“ all critical for improved anti-tumor responses. Furthermore, the potential for targeted gene editing to overcome graft-versus-host disease and improve T-cell persistence is explored. Clinical trials utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-modified T-cells are currently underway, demonstrating promising early results.  Despite challenges related to off-target effects and delivery methods, this rapidly evolving field represents a significant advancement, poised to transform the landscape of cancer treatment by optimizing T-cell efficacy and safety in 2021 and beyond.
