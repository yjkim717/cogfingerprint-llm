A 2021 retrospective cohort study investigated the comparative long-term survival outcomes associated with two primary bariatric surgical interventions—Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG)—against nonsurgical management in a cohort of patients with severe obesity. The analysis leveraged comprehensive longitudinal data from a large, multi-institutional database, employing rigorous propensity score matching to mitigate confounding by indication and balance baseline covariates, including age, sex, comorbidities, and body mass index. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality, with extended follow-up periods exceeding five years to capture longitudinal trends.

Statistical analysis, utilizing Cox proportional hazards models, demonstrated a significant reduction in all-cause mortality for both surgical cohorts relative to the nonsurgical control group. The adjusted hazard ratio for RYGB was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.55–0.70; p<0.001), while for SG it was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.60–0.77; p<0.001). Cause-specific mortality analyses revealed pronounced risk reductions for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity-associated malignancies, aligning with the known metabolic and hormonal benefits of these procedures. The magnitude of risk reduction for cardiovascular mortality was particularly notable in the RYGB cohort, suggesting a potential procedure-specific advantage. These findings underscore the durable survival benefit conferred by both RYGB and SG, reinforcing their role as pivotal therapeutic strategies for mitigating the long-term mortality burden of severe obesity. This evidence substantiates the integration of metabolic surgery into standard clinical pathways for eligible patients.
