Title: Advancements in Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: An Update on Biomarker-Driven Targeted Therapies

Abstract:
The 2021 update to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Colon Cancer reflects significant advancements in the management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Recent breakthroughs in biomarker testing have enabled the identification of specific molecular targets, informing the development of targeted therapies tailored to individual patient profiles. This paradigm shift towards precision medicine has expanded systemic therapy options, improving treatment outcomes for patients with mCRC. The updated guidelines incorporate novel recommendations for biomarker-driven targeted therapies, underscoring the importance of comprehensive biomarker testing in guiding clinical decision-making. By integrating emerging evidence on targeted therapies, the revised guidelines aim to optimize treatment strategies and enhance patient care in the context of mCRC, ultimately contributing to improved survival rates and quality of life.
