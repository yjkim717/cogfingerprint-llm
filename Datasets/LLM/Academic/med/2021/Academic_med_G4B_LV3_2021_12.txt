**Abstract**

This study investigates the long-term impact of bariatric surgical interventions on mortality rates in patients with severe obesity. Utilizing data from a 2021 cohort, we compared the outcomes of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) to a control group receiving non-surgical management. Our analysis demonstrates a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality associated with both surgical procedures. Notably, sleeve gastrectomy exhibited a comparatively lower mortality risk after a three-year follow-up period, suggesting a potentially superior long-term safety profile. 

These findings highlight the efficacy of bariatric surgery as a viable and beneficial treatment strategy for individuals grappling with severe obesity and its attendant health risks. While RYGB demonstrated a reduced mortality compared to conventional methods, SG demonstrated a more pronounced effect over the observed timeframe. Further research is warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms contributing to these observed differences and to optimize surgical protocols for maximal patient benefit.  The implications extend to informing clinical decision-making and refining guidelines for obesity management within contemporary healthcare systems.
