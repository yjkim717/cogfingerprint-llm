**Abstract**

Pulmonary hamartomas, typically asymptomatic and discovered incidentally, rarely present with overt clinical manifestations. This case report describes an unusual presentation of a pulmonary hamartoma in a 44-year-old female patient in 2021, exhibiting symptomatic features including persistent cough, dyspnea, and debilitating fatigue. Such symptomatic presentation deviates from the established demographic profile, which commonly involves older male patients. Radiological evaluation revealed a solitary pulmonary nodule consistent with a hamartoma. The atypical clinical features prompted comprehensive diagnostic workup to exclude malignancy. Following confirmation of the diagnosis, conservative management was adopted, given the benign nature of the lesion and patient preference. This case highlights the importance of considering pulmonary hamartoma within the differential diagnosis of respiratory symptoms, even in younger patients, and emphasizes the necessity for individualized management strategies based on clinical presentation and patient factors.
