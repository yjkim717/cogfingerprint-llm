Of particular interest in glioblastoma (GBM) research is the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME), a known driver of tumor progression and treatment resistance. This study investigates the hypothesis that dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI data, processed via principal component analysis (PCA), can serve as a non-invasive biomarker for regional tumor acidity. In a cohort of GBM patients, we performed a retrospective analysis correlating PCA-derived hemodynamic parametric maps with a magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym) index, a validated marker of acidic pH. Our findings demonstrate that PCA components extracted from DSC-MRI data exhibit a significant predictive capacity for estimating tumor acidity. Notably, the strongest correlations between the PCA model and the MTRasym index were identified within the peritumoral region, rather than the enhancing tumor core. This suggests that PCA of DSC-MRI captures unique microenvironmental information, potentially reflecting acidosis-driven vascular alterations at the infiltrative tumor margin. This 2021 study establishes a novel, clinically translatable methodology for mapping the acidic TME, which could inform targeted therapeutic strategies and improve prognostication in GBM.
