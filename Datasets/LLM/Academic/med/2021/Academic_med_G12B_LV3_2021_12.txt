**Abstract**

**Background:** Severe obesity presents a substantial public health challenge, associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery has emerged as an intervention demonstrating significant weight loss and metabolic improvements, but long-term mortality benefits require continued investigation. **Objective:** This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the long-term impact of two prevalent bariatric procedures – Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) – on all-cause mortality in patients with severe obesity. **Methods:** We analyzed data from a large cohort of patients undergoing RYGB or SG, comparing their mortality rates to those of matched, non-surgical individuals with comparable baseline characteristics. **Results:** Analysis performed in 2021 revealed that both RYGB and SG were associated with a statistically significant reduction in long-term all-cause mortality compared to the control group. **Conclusion:** These findings provide robust support for the efficacy of bariatric surgery, specifically RYGB and SG, in improving long-term survival outcomes for individuals with severe obesity, reinforcing its role as a valuable therapeutic option.
