Title: Advancements in Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: An Update on Biomarker-Driven Treatment Strategies

Abstract:

The 2021 updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Colon Cancer reflect the rapidly evolving landscape of systemic therapy options for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Recent breakthroughs in biomarker testing have enabled the identification of predictive markers, facilitating personalized treatment approaches. The incorporation of checkpoint inhibitors has expanded therapeutic possibilities for mCRC patients with specific molecular profiles. This review highlights the latest recommendations for systemic therapy in mCRC, with a focus on biomarker-driven treatment strategies. The updated guidelines underscore the importance of comprehensive biomarker testing in guiding treatment decisions, including the use of checkpoint inhibitors in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors. By integrating biomarker testing into clinical practice, clinicians can optimize treatment outcomes for patients with mCRC.
