**Plasma p-tau231 as an Early Predictor of Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology: A Longitudinal Validation Study**

**Abstract**

**Background:** The early and accurate detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is crucial for timely intervention and potential disease-modifying therapies. Amyloid-β (Aβ) PET imaging has been a cornerstone in identifying Aβ deposition, a hallmark of AD, but its availability and cost limit widespread screening. Plasma biomarkers offer a more accessible alternative, yet their clinical utility, particularly in detecting preclinical AD, requires further validation. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of plasma phosphorylated tau isoforms, specifically p-tau231, as a promising biomarker.

**Methods:** This longitudinal, observational study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau231 in a cohort of [Specify number, e.g., 350] participants enrolled in the SIMA (Swedish Implementation of Multimodal Assessment) study. Participants included cognitively normal individuals, those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and individuals diagnosed with AD dementia. Plasma samples were collected annually and analyzed for p-tau231 levels using [Specify assay type, e.g., ultrasensitive immunoassay]. Aβ PET imaging was performed at baseline and follow-up intervals to assess Aβ burden. Cognitive assessments, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and neuropsychological batteries, were administered to track cognitive decline.

**Results:** Our findings demonstrate a strong correlation between elevated plasma p-tau231 levels and the presence of Aβ deposition as determined by PET imaging. Critically, p-tau231 levels were significantly elevated in individuals who subsequently became Aβ PET-positive, even when baseline Aβ PET scans were negative. Furthermore, elevated p-tau231 predicted cognitive decline, as assessed by longitudinal MMSE scores and neuropsychological performance, independent of Aβ status. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of [Specify AUC value, e.g., 0.88] for p-tau231 in predicting conversion to Aβ positivity, surpassing the diagnostic accuracy of Aβ PET alone in this cohort.

**Conclusion:** This study provides robust validation of plasma p-tau231 as a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for detecting incipient AD pathology, offering a valuable tool for early identification of individuals at risk of developing AD dementia, potentially even prior to detectable Aβ accumulation. The accessibility and cost-effectiveness of plasma p-tau231 testing suggest its potential for widespread screening and inclusion in future clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying interventions.
