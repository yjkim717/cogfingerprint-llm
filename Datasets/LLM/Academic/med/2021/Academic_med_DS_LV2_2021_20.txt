**Title:** Optimizing Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy in Breast Cancer: An Evidence-Based Synthesis of Contemporary ASCO Guidelines for Triple-Negative and HER2-Positive Disease

The strategic implementation of neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) has become a cornerstone in the multidisciplinary management of locally advanced and high-risk early-stage breast cancer. Beyond its primary objective of tumor downstaging to facilitate breast-conserving surgery, the achievement of a pathologic complete response (pCR), defined as the absence of invasive carcinoma in the breast and axillary lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis ypN0), has emerged as a critical prognostic surrogate for long-term survival outcomes. This paradigm is particularly salient in biologically aggressive subtypes, where the therapeutic landscape is rapidly evolving. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has systematically developed evidence-based guidelines to standardize and optimize the selection of NST regimens, thereby addressing significant practice variation. This analytical review synthesizes the 2021 ASCO recommendations, with a focused examination on their application to triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and HER2-positive disease. For patients with high-risk TNBC, the guidelines strongly endorse the incorporation of platinum salts, specifically carboplatin, into anthracycline- and taxane-based chemotherapy backbones, given the robust association between BRCA pathway deficiency and enhanced platinum sensitivity, which consequently elevates pCR rates. Concurrently, for HER2-positive breast cancer, the standard of care unequivocally involves dual HER2-targeted blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab administered alongside taxane-based chemotherapy, a strategy founded on the pivotal NeoSphere and TRYPHAENA trials. The critical role of post-neoadjuvant therapy is also emphasized; for TNBC patients with residual disease, adjuvant capecitabine is recommended to mitigate recurrence risk, while for their HER2-positive counterparts, the antibody-drug conjugate T-DM1 (trastuzumab emtansine) is the established standard. In conclusion, the contemporary ASCO guidelines provide a structured, biomarker-driven framework for NST, effectively tailoring therapeutic intensity to tumor biology. This precision approach maximizes the likelihood of pCR, refines prognostication, and dictates subsequent adjuvant strategies, ultimately aiming to improve survival in the most challenging breast cancer subtypes.
