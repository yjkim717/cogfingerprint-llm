This review examines the 2021 NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer, focusing on adjuvant systemic therapy for early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. The guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical management, incorporating recent advances in genomic profiling and risk stratification. The updates emphasize personalized treatment approaches, including the integration of multi-gene assays and clinicopathological factors to inform decisions on chemotherapy and endocrine therapy. By synthesizing current evidence, this review aims to elucidate the implications of the NCCN Guidelines for optimizing adjuvant systemic therapy in this patient population.
