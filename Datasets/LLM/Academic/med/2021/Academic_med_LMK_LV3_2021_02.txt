Title: Plasma Phosphorylated Tau231 as a Diagnostic Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease: A Validation Study

Abstract:

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The early detection of AD pathology is crucial for timely intervention and disease management. Recent studies have identified plasma phosphorylated tau231 (p-tau231) as a promising biomarker for AD. This study aimed to validate the diagnostic accuracy of plasma p-tau231 in detecting incipient AD pathology and differentiating it from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders.

In this prospective cohort study conducted in 2021, we analyzed plasma samples from 250 participants, including 100 patients with AD, 50 patients with non-AD neurodegenerative disorders, and 100 healthy controls. Plasma p-tau231 levels were measured using a highly sensitive and specific immunoassay. The diagnostic performance of p-tau231 was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and compared with established biomarkers, including Aβ42/40 ratio and total tau.

Our results demonstrate that plasma p-tau231 levels were significantly elevated in AD patients compared to non-AD neurodegenerative disorders and healthy controls. ROC curve analysis revealed that p-tau231 had a high diagnostic accuracy for AD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96). The optimal cutoff value for p-tau231 yielded a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90% in distinguishing AD from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, plasma p-tau231 levels correlated with Aβ positivity and neurodegeneration, as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

The findings of this study validate plasma p-tau231 as a novel and accurate biomarker for detecting incipient AD pathology. The high diagnostic performance of p-tau231, combined with its accessibility and relatively low cost, makes it an attractive tool for clinical practice and research settings. The use of plasma p-tau231 as a biomarker has the potential to improve the early detection and diagnosis of AD, enabling timely intervention and disease management. Future studies should investigate the longitudinal changes in plasma p-tau231 levels and its utility in monitoring disease progression and treatment response.
