A 2021 cross-sectional epidemiological investigation was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of malocclusion and quantify orthodontic treatment needs among a pediatric population of Syrian refugees residing within the Zaatari camp in Jordan. This study, involving a systematic clinical examination of 606 children, employed the standardized Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN) to objectively assess dental health and aesthetic components. The findings revealed a profoundly high malocclusion prevalence of 83.8%, indicating that the overwhelming majority of the sampled cohort presented with dentofacial anomalies. Further analysis using the IOTN demonstrated that 67.7% of these children were categorized as having a definitive need for orthodontic intervention, falling within the moderate to severe spectrum of the index.

These results underscore a critical and previously under-quantified oral health burden within this vulnerable, displaced population. The observed high prevalence is likely multifactorial, attributable to a complex interplay of genetic predispositions, nutritional deficiencies, and a near-total absence of preventive and interceptive dental care both pre- and post-displacement. The disruption of public health infrastructure and the focus on acute medical needs within humanitarian crises often marginalize essential dental services, allowing conditions like malocclusion to proliferate unchecked. The significant treatment need identified extends beyond mere aesthetics; severe malocclusion is a documented risk factor for dental caries, periodontal disease, functional impairments in mastication and speech, and can contribute to psychosocial distress and reduced quality of life.

Consequently, this research provides compelling evidence for the urgent implementation of targeted, comprehensive oral health programs. Such initiatives must integrate interceptive orthodontics and preventive strategies into the existing humanitarian health response framework. Addressing this substantial need is not only a matter of clinical imperative but also a crucial step toward upholding the overall health and well-being of a generation of children growing up in protracted displacement.
