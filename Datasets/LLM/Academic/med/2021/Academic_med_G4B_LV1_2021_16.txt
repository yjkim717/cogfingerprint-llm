**Plasma p-tau231 as a Novel Biomarker for Early Alzheimer’s Disease Detection via Single-Molecule Array Analysis**

**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) necessitates the development of robust and readily accessible biomarkers for early detection and improved patient stratification. This study investigated the diagnostic potential of plasma phosphorylated total tau protein at residue 231 (p-tau231) utilizing a novel single-molecule array (SMA) technology. We hypothesized that elevated plasma p-tau231 levels correlate with the early pathological hallmarks of AD. A cohort of [Insert Cohort Size – e.g., 200] individuals, including individuals with diagnosed AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and age-matched healthy controls, underwent plasma collection and subsequent p-tau231 quantification via SMA. 

Results demonstrated a statistically significant increase in plasma p-tau231 concentrations in individuals with AD compared to both MCI and healthy controls (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the SMAs exhibited high sensitivity and specificity in differentiating AD patients from other neurological conditions. These findings strongly validate plasma p-tau231 as a promising biomarker for early AD detection, potentially facilitating earlier intervention and improved clinical trial outcomes. Further longitudinal studies are warranted to establish the predictive value of plasma p-tau231 for disease progression within neurodegenerative disorders.

**Notes on Customization:**

*   **Cohort Size:**  I’ve included a placeholder for the cohort size. Replace this with the actual number of participants in the study.
*   **Specific SMA Details:** Consider adding a brief, technical detail about the SMA method used (e.g., the specific platform or assay) if relevant for the journal’s audience.
*   **Statistical Details:** Replace the “p < 0.001” with the actual p-values and statistical tests used.
*   **Journal Style:** Adjust the wording slightly to align with the specific style guidelines of the target journal.
