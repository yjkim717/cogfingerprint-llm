Title: Non-Invasive Estimation of Tumor Microenvironment Acidity in Glioblastoma Patients using Machine Learning Analysis of Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast-Enhanced MRI

Abstract:

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly aggressive and malignant brain tumor characterized by a heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME). The acidic TME is a hallmark of GBM, contributing to tumor progression, invasion, and resistance to therapy. In this study, we propose a non-invasive machine learning approach to estimate tumor acidity in GBM patients using dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) data. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to extract relevant features from DSC-MRI perfusion curves, which were then used to train a predictive model to estimate tumor acidity. The predicted acidity was correlated with pH-sensitive amine chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, a validated imaging biomarker of tumor acidity. Our results demonstrate a significant correlation between the predicted tumor acidity and pH-CEST MRI, indicating the potential of our approach to non-invasively assess TME acidity. The proposed method was evaluated in a cohort of 45 GBM patients imaged in 2021, showing promising results with a mean absolute error of 0.12 pH units. The non-invasive estimation of tumor acidity using DSC-MRI and machine learning has the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of GBM, enabling personalized therapeutic strategies tailored to individual tumor biology. Our findings suggest that this approach may provide a valuable tool for assessing TME acidity, with implications for improving patient outcomes in GBM.
