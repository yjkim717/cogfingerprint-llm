**Abstract**

The increasing utilization of food enzymes within processed foods necessitates robust regulatory oversight to ensure consumer safety. In 2021, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) issued revised scientific guidance pertaining to the assessment and authorization of food enzyme applications under European Union regulations. This updated framework emphasizes a tiered approach to safety evaluation, predicated on comprehensive toxicological data and a detailed consideration of dietary exposure. Specifically, the guidance mandates the generation of detailed risk assessments, incorporating potential genotoxic, carcinogenic, and immunological effects. Furthermore, it necessitates quantification of consumer exposure via diverse dietary scenarios.  Successful regulatory submission now requires demonstrating not only the inherent safety of the enzyme itself, but also a thorough understanding of its potential impact within the final food product.  These revisions reflect an evolving understanding of enzyme-related risks and underscore the importance of proactive data generation to facilitate compliant market access.
