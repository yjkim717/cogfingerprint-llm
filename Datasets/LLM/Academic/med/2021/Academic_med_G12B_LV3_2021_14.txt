**Prevalence and Orthodontic Treatment Needs in Syrian Refugee Children and Adolescents Residing in the Zaatari Camp, Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study**

**Abstract:** The escalating global refugee crisis presents unique challenges to oral health, particularly concerning malocclusion and the subsequent need for orthodontic intervention. This cross-sectional study, conducted in 2021, aimed to determine the prevalence of malocclusion and quantify orthodontic treatment needs (IOTN) within the Syrian refugee population residing in the Zaatari refugee camp, Jordan. A representative sample of children and adolescents (ages 8-17 years) were clinically examined using standardized diagnostic criteria for malocclusion and the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). Results revealed a notably high prevalence of malocclusion, with [insert specific prevalence percentage here – e.g., 68.7%] exhibiting some form of malocclusion.  Furthermore, a considerable proportion of the sample demonstrated a significant need for orthodontic treatment, categorized using the IOTN system. Specifically, [insert specific IOTN categories and percentages here – e.g., 22.4% requiring extensive treatment, 18.9% requiring moderate treatment, etc.]. These findings underscore a substantial unmet orthodontic need within this vulnerable population, potentially impacting psychosocial well-being and long-term oral health. The study highlights the critical need for culturally sensitive and accessible orthodontic care programs tailored to address the specific needs of displaced refugee children and adolescents, emphasizing the importance of integrating oral health considerations into humanitarian aid initiatives. Further research is warranted to investigate the etiological factors contributing to the observed prevalence and to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.
