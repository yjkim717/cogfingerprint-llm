Title: Enhanced Safety Assessment of Food Enzymes: EFSA's Updated Guidance and Implications for Regulatory Compliance

Abstract:
In 2021, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) introduced revised scientific guidelines for the evaluation of food enzyme applications, underscoring the importance of comprehensive risk assessments. The updated guidance delineates stringent requirements for data submission, encompassing the source and production process of food enzymes, their biochemical characteristics, as well as toxicological and allergenicity profiles. By emphasizing the need for robust toxicological testing and allergenicity risk assessment, EFSA's revised framework aims to ensure the safe utilization of food enzymes in the European food industry. This enhanced regulatory scrutiny is expected to inform the development of novel food enzymes and facilitate compliance with EU food safety standards. Consequently, the updated guidance is poised to shape the future landscape of food enzyme regulation, prioritizing consumer safety and harmonization across the industry.
