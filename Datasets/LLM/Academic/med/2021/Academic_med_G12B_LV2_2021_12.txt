**Long-Term Mortality Outcomes Following Bariatric Surgery: A Comparative Analysis of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy**

**Background:** Severe obesity represents a significant and escalating global health challenge, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery, encompassing various procedures designed to induce weight loss and metabolic improvements, has emerged as an effective intervention for individuals with a Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥40 kg/m² or a BMI ≥35 kg/m² with obesity-related comorbidities. While short-term benefits are well-documented, comprehensive data regarding the long-term impact of different bariatric procedures on mortality remain crucial for informed patient selection and clinical practice guidelines. This study investigates and compares the long-term mortality rates associated with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in a cohort of patients with severe obesity.

**Methods:** A retrospective cohort analysis was performed utilizing data from [Specify Database/Registry – e.g., the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), a large regional healthcare database, etc. *This is crucial to add*]. Inclusion criteria consisted of adult patients (≥18 years) undergoing primary RYGB or SG between [Start Year] and [End Year – e.g., 2005-2018] with a pre-operative BMI ≥40 kg/m².  Propensity score matching was employed to minimize confounding variables and ensure comparability between the RYGB and SG groups.  The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, assessed up to ten years post-surgery. Secondary outcomes included mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, and other specific causes. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for relevant patient demographics, comorbidities, and surgical factors.

**Results:** A total of [Number] patients were included in the analysis, with [Number] patients undergoing RYGB and [Number] undergoing SG following propensity score matching.  The median follow-up duration was [Number] years.  Compared to the SG group, patients who underwent RYGB demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in all-cause mortality (HR = [Value], 95% CI: [Value], *p* < 0.001).  Furthermore, RYGB was associated with a lower risk of mortality due to cardiovascular disease (HR = [Value], 95% CI: [Value], *p* = [Value]).  No significant difference was observed in mortality due to cancer between the two groups. Analysis of other specific causes of death revealed [Briefly Mention Key Findings - e.g., a trend towards lower respiratory mortality in the RYGB group].

**Conclusion:** This study provides compelling evidence that both RYGB and SG are associated with improved long-term mortality outcomes in patients with severe obesity. However, RYGB demonstrated a statistically significant advantage over SG regarding overall and cardiovascular mortality within this cohort. These findings underscore the importance of
