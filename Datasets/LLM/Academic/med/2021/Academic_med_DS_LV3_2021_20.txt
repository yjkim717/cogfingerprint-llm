**Abstract**

The publication of the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline on neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer represents a pivotal advancement in the standardization of preoperative systemic treatment. This comprehensive, evidence-based framework underscores a paradigm shift from a one-size-fits-all approach towards a meticulously tailored, multidisciplinary management strategy. The guideline's core tenet is the critical stratification of therapeutic regimens based on tumor biology, specifically molecular subtype, disease stage, and hormone receptor status, to optimize oncologic outcomes and enhance the potential for curative intervention.

For patients with high-risk, early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the guideline strongly endorses the incorporation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary objective in this aggressive subtype is the achievement of a pathologic complete response (pCR), a well-validated surrogate endpoint strongly correlated with improved long-term event-free and overall survival. The recommended regimens are intensive, often combining anthracyclines, taxanes, and, for select patients, platinum agents or immune checkpoint inhibitors, reflecting the evolving clinical trial evidence from the preceding years. The emphasis on pCR as a treatment goal facilitates the critical evaluation of therapeutic efficacy and provides a rationale for subsequent treatment modifications in the adjuvant setting for those with residual disease.

Conversely, for HER2-positive breast cancer, the neoadjuvant approach is fundamentally centered on dual or multi-agent anti-HER2 targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy. The 2021 guideline consolidates the standard of care involving taxane-based chemotherapy concurrent with dual HER2-blockade (trastuzumab and pertuzumab). Achieving pCR in this subtype is similarly prognostic and is used to guide post-neoadjuvant management. For patients who do not attain pCR, the guideline supports the administration of adjuvant trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate, based on landmark trial data demonstrating a significant reduction in the risk of recurrence.

Ultimately, the 2021 ASCO guideline formalizes neoadjuvant therapy not merely as a means of tumor downstaging but as an in vivo sensitivity assay. It mandates a cohesive, multidisciplinary team involving medical oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, and pathologists to interpret response, plan subsequent local therapy, and determine the need for escalated or de-escalated adjuvant strategies. This structured, biomarker-driven approach aims to maximize the therapeutic index, minimize overtreatment, and improve survival rates across biologically distinct breast cancer populations.
