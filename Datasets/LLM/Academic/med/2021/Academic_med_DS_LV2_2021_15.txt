This case report examines a 44-year-old female presenting with atypical symptomatic pulmonary hamartoma, a typically asymptomatic benign lung neoplasm. Clinical evaluation revealed persistent cough and localized wheezing, prompting radiographic and histopathological assessment. Diagnostic confirmation was achieved via CT-guided biopsy, demonstrating characteristic mesenchymal and epithelial components. The patient underwent successful video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical excision, with resolution of symptoms and no recurrence at six-month follow-up. This case underscores that while pulmonary hamartomas are generally incidental findings, they can manifest with obstructive symptoms necessitating intervention, highlighting the importance of individualized diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in benign pulmonary lesions.
