**Abstract**

Pulmonary hamartomas represent a relatively common, yet often under-recognized, benign neoplasm. This case report presents a unique presentation of a symptomatic pulmonary hamartoma in a 44-year-old female patient, emphasizing the importance of considering atypical manifestations during diagnostic evaluation. The patient initially presented with persistent cough and intermittent shortness of breath, prompting investigation for more serious respiratory pathology.  Radiological imaging revealed a well-defined, solitary pulmonary hamartoma.  Despite its benign nature, the patient’s symptoms necessitated a comprehensive assessment, including bronchoscopy and further imaging to rule out alternative diagnoses.  This case underscores the potential for pulmonary hamartomas to cause significant respiratory distress and highlights the need for clinicians to maintain a broad differential diagnosis when evaluating patients presenting with non-specific pulmonary symptoms.
