Title: Investigating the Efficacy of Personalized Immunotherapy in Modulating Tumor Microenvironment for Enhanced Cancer Treatment Outcomes

Abstract:

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in cancer progression and therapeutic response. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach to modulate the TME and enhance anti-tumor immunity. However, its efficacy remains variable due to inter-patient heterogeneity. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of personalized immunotherapy in modulating the TME and improving cancer treatment outcomes. We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 120 patients with advanced-stage cancer, who received tailored immunotherapy based on their unique tumor immunophenotypes. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence, we analyzed the TME before and after treatment. Our results showed that personalized immunotherapy significantly increased the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and decreased the frequency of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells within the TME. Furthermore, patients who received personalized immunotherapy exhibited improved overall survival rates and enhanced objective response rates compared to those receiving standard treatment. Our findings suggest that personalized immunotherapy is a viable strategy for modulating the TME and improving cancer treatment outcomes, warranting further investigation in larger-scale randomized controlled trials.
