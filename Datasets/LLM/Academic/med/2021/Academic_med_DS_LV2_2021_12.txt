**Abstract**

**Background:** Severe obesity, a chronic and recalcitrant disease, confers a substantially elevated risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. While bariatric surgery has been established as the most effective intervention for achieving significant and sustained weight loss, comprehensive long-term data comparing the mortality benefits of the two most prevalent contemporary procedures—Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG)—against non-surgical management remain a critical area of investigation. The objective of this study was to determine the long-term impact of RYGB and SG on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in a severely obese cohort.

**Methods:** We conducted a retrospective, propensity-matched cohort study utilizing data from a large, integrated healthcare system. A total of 15,000 patients with severe obesity (Body Mass Index ≥40 kg/m² or ≥35 kg/m² with significant comorbidities) who underwent either RYGB (n=7,500) or SG (n=7,500) between 2010 and 2014 were identified. These surgical patients were exactly matched 1:1 with nonsurgical control patients based on demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medication use, and healthcare utilization. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints included mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Follow-up was conducted through December 2020, ensuring a minimum of 6 years of observation.

**Results:** Over a median follow-up of 8.2 years, both surgical procedures demonstrated a profound and statistically significant reduction in mortality risk compared to nonsurgical care. The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.48–0.63; p<0.001) for the RYGB cohort and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.52–0.67; p<0.001) for the SG cohort versus their respective matched controls. Cause-specific mortality analyses revealed significant risk reductions for deaths from cardiovascular disease (RYGB HR=0.51; SG HR=0.58), cancer (RYGB HR=0.62; SG HR=0.65), and diabetes (RYGB HR=0.31; SG HR=0.36). The absolute risk reduction for all-cause mortality was 4.1% for RYGB and 3.6% for SG. No statistically significant difference in all-cause mortality was observed between the RYGB and SG surgical groups (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.92–1.25; p=0.36).

**Conclusion:** In this large, matched cohort study with extended follow-up, both Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass and Sleeve Gastrectomy were associated with a substantially lower risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality compared to nonsurgical management in patients with severe obesity. These findings provide robust, long-term evidence supporting the mortality benefit of modern bariatric surgery and suggest comparable survival outcomes between the two most commonly performed procedures. This reinforces the role of metabolic surgery as a pivotal, life-extending intervention for this high-risk patient population.
