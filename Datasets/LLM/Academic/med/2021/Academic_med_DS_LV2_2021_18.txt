This systematic review critically examines the 2021 NCCN Guidelines updates for adjuvant systemic therapy in early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. We analyze the refined recommendations for chemotherapy use, duration of endocrine therapy, and the integration of genomic assays to guide treatment decisions. The objective is to synthesize the evidence-based rationale for these updates, emphasizing their impact on de-escalation strategies and personalized risk assessment. These guidelines provide a crucial framework for optimizing oncologic outcomes while mitigating treatment-related toxicity in this prevalent patient population.
