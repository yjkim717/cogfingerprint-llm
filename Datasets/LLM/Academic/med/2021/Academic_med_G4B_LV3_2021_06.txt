**Abstract**

Contemporary management of early-stage breast cancer increasingly prioritizes neoadjuvant chemotherapy strategies to optimize local control and improve patient outcomes.  The 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guideline advocates for a multidisciplinary care team-directed approach to neoadjuvant therapy, recognizing the heterogeneity of breast cancer and necessitating individualized treatment plans. Specifically, the guideline details tailored regimens for subtypes characterized by aggressive behavior, notably inflammatory breast cancer and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).  TNBC, frequently exhibiting poorer prognoses, demands heightened consideration of intensified chemotherapy schedules.  Furthermore, the guideline acknowledges the significance of incorporating patient-specific risk factors, including tumor grade and proliferation markers, to refine treatment intensity.  This shift towards precision medicine underscores the critical role of collaborative oncology expertise in maximizing the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and ultimately, improving survival rates within this patient population.
