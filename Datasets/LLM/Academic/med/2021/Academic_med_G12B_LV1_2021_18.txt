**Contemporary Adjuvant Systemic Therapy Strategies for Early-Stage, Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative Breast Cancer: An Evidence-Based Review Informed by NCCN Guidelines**

The management of early-stage, hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer remains a cornerstone of oncologic practice. This review synthesizes recent refinements in adjuvant systemic therapy strategies, drawing heavily on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines as of 2021.  The evolving landscape is characterized by a shift toward endocrine-based therapies, with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) representing a standard of care for postmenopausal patients.  The incorporation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, particularly in combination with endocrine therapy, has demonstrated significant improvements in disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with high-risk features.  For premenopausal patients, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy remains dependent on factors such as Oncotype DX Recurrence Score and menopausal status, with sequential or combined endocrine and chemotherapy approaches being considered.  This review outlines the current recommendations, highlights areas of ongoing investigation, and emphasizes the importance of individualized treatment planning based on patient-specific prognostic factors and genomic profiling to optimize outcomes. Further research into novel targeted agents and de-escalation strategies remains critical.
