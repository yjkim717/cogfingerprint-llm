**Abstract**

The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a complex interplay between genetic predisposition and modifiable vascular risk factors. This study investigated the synergistic relationship between these factors and the progression of neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in a cohort of individuals identified as having preclinical AD. Utilizing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and longitudinal cognitive assessments, we examined the impact of established vascular risk factors – including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes – on early disease manifestations.

Our findings demonstrate a significant, non-linear association between elevated vascular risk scores and accelerated neurodegenerative processes. Specifically, individuals exhibiting multiple vascular risk factors demonstrated a markedly increased rate of amyloid plaque deposition and tau protein pathology, as evidenced by CSF analysis. Critically, this acceleration was observed even in individuals without clinically evident cognitive impairment, suggesting a preclinical stage of vulnerability. 

Furthermore, we observed a concurrent and statistically significant decline in cognitive function, measured via standardized neuropsychological testing, within this high-risk subgroup. These results highlight a critical synergistic effect wherein vascular risk factors exacerbate underlying neurodegenerative pathways, potentially initiating or accelerating the cascade leading to AD. The identification of this interaction provides a novel target for preventative interventions focused on mitigating vascular risk to delay or attenuate the onset of cognitive decline in preclinical AD.  Future research should explore the specific pathophysiological mechanisms driving this observed synergy and assess the efficacy of targeted vascular management strategies.
