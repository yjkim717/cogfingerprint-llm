Title: Assessing Malocclusion and Orthodontic Treatment Needs among Syrian Refugee Children and Adolescents: A Cross-Sectional Study

Abstract:

Background: Forced migration due to conflict has led to a significant influx of Syrian refugees into neighboring countries, resulting in a myriad of health challenges, including dental health issues. Malocclusion, a prevalent dental condition, can have profound effects on an individual's oral health, self-esteem, and overall quality of life. 

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of malocclusion and orthodontic treatment needs among Syrian refugee children and adolescents, comparing the findings with existing data on the host population and other refugee groups.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 500 Syrian refugee children and adolescents aged 8-18 years, residing in refugee camps in Jordan. A calibrated orthodontist performed dental examinations to assess malocclusion using the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need (IOTN). The IOTN scores were categorized into three grades: 'no/slight need,' 'moderate/borderline need,' and 'great/definite need' for orthodontic treatment. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics and chi-square tests to compare the prevalence of malocclusion and treatment needs across different age groups and genders.

Results: The results showed a high prevalence of malocclusion among the study population, with over 70% of participants having some degree of malocclusion. The IOTN scores indicated that 40.2% of the participants had a 'great/definite need' for orthodontic treatment, 25.1% had a 'moderate/borderline need,' and 34.7% had 'no/slight need.' The prevalence of malocclusion was significantly higher among females (p<0.05) and increased with age (p<0.01).

Conclusion: The findings of this study highlight the substantial orthodontic treatment needs among Syrian refugee children and adolescents, underscoring the necessity for targeted dental health interventions within this population. The high prevalence of malocclusion and the associated treatment needs call for the integration of orthodontic services into the primary healthcare provided to refugees. Policymakers and healthcare providers should consider the oral health needs of refugee populations when designing health services, ensuring equitable access to necessary care.

This study contributes to the growing body of research on the health challenges faced by refugee populations and has implications for the planning and delivery of dental health services in humanitarian settings. Future research should focus on the long-term oral health outcomes of refugee children and adolescents and the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving their dental health.
