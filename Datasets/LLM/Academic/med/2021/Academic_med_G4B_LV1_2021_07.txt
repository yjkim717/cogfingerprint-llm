**Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profiling Predicts Prognosis and Treatment Response in IDH-Mutant Anaplastic Gliomas**

Anaplastic gliomas represent a particularly aggressive and challenging subset of gliomas, often exhibiting somatic mutations in *IDH1* and *IDH2*. Despite advancements in treatment, patient prognosis remains variable, highlighting the need for improved stratification and predictive biomarkers. This study employed a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to characterize epigenetic landscapes within a cohort of 85 IDH1/2-mutant anaplastic gliomas, with the aim of identifying novel prognostic factors and potentially informing therapeutic strategies. Utilizing whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, we mapped methylation patterns across the entire genome and correlated these with clinical data, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). 

Our analysis revealed significant differential methylation signatures associated with OS and PFS. Notably, hypermethylation within the *MGMT* promoter region was strongly correlated with increased temozolomide sensitivity, supporting existing evidence. Furthermore, methylation patterns at intergenic loci demonstrated a robust association with patient outcome.  Specifically, increased methylation at several previously uncharacterized loci was predictive of a shorter OS. These findings suggest that genome-wide DNA methylation represents a valuable and readily accessible biomarker for refining patient classification and predicting response to standard chemotherapy, temozolomide, in IDH-mutant anaplastic gliomas. Future research should focus on validating these methylation signatures in larger cohorts and exploring their potential in personalized treatment selection.
