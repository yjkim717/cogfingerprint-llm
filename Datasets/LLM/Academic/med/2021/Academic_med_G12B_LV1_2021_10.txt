**Abstract**

Glioblastoma (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumor, exhibits a complex and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly impacting treatment response and prognosis.  Intratumoral and peritumoral acidosis is a recognized feature of GBM, contributing to therapeutic resistance and tumor progression. While invasive pH measurements remain the gold standard, they are impractical for routine clinical assessment. Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast (DSC)-MRI, a widely available clinical imaging modality, provides information on tumor vascularity and permeability, parameters potentially linked to microenvironmental pH. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing Principal Component Analysis (CEST-epi) of DSC-MRI data to non-invasively estimate tumor pH, with a particular focus on the peritumoral region.  A retrospective analysis of DSC-MRI data acquired from [mention number] GBM patients was performed.  PCA was applied to the time-series data, and resulting principal components were correlated with independently measured extracellular pH values obtained via [mention method, e.g., microdialysis or ex-vivo measurements] from a subset of patients.  Results demonstrate a significant correlation (r = [mention correlation coefficient], p < 0.05) between the first principal component derived from DSC-MRI and measured pH, particularly within the peritumoral region defined as [mention region definition]. These findings suggest that PCA-based analysis of routine DSC-MRI can provide a valuable, non-invasive assessment of tumor pH, potentially enabling improved characterization of the TME and facilitating the development of targeted therapeutic strategies for GBM. Future work will focus on validating these findings in a larger cohort and exploring the clinical utility of pH mapping for predicting treatment response.

**Notes on Reasoning & Choices:**

*   **Formal Tone:** I used formal language ("feasibility," "retrospective analysis," "significant correlation," etc.) and avoided conversational phrasing.
*   **Precise Terminology:** I incorporated all the provided keywords and ensured accurate use of medical terminology (e.g., "glioblastoma," "tumor microenvironment," "Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast," "peritumoral").
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a clear structure:
    *   **Background:** Establishes the problem (GBM, tumor microenvironment, acidosis) and its importance.
    *   **Rationale:** Explains why the study is needed (limitations of current pH assessment methods).
    *   **Methods:** Briefly describes the approach (retrospective analysis, PCA, DSC-MRI, correlation with pH measurements).  I added placeholders for specifics like sample size and pH measurement technique, as those would depend on the actual study.
    *   **Results:**  Presents the key finding (correlation between PCA and pH). Includes a placeholder for the correlation coefficient and p-value.
    *   **Conclusion:**  Interprets the results and suggests potential implications and future directions.
*   **Year Context (2021):** The phrasing and focus are consistent with the types of research being conducted in 2021 (
