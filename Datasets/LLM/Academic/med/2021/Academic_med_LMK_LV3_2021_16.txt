Title: Plasma P-Tau231 as a Potential Early Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease Pathology


#### Abstract

Alzheimer's disease (AD), a complex neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. The identification of reliable biomarkers for early detection and monitoring of AD pathology is crucial for timely intervention. Recent advancements in ultrasensitive immunoassays have enabled the quantification of specific tau phosphorylation sites in plasma, offering a promising avenue for non-invasive diagnosis. This study investigates the diagnostic potential of plasma p-tau231, a phosphorylation site on tau protein, as an early biomarker for AD pathology.


In a cohort of 2021 participants, including individuals with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal controls, plasma p-tau231 levels were measured using a novel single-molecule array (Simoa) assay. The results demonstrated that plasma p-tau231 concentrations were significantly elevated in AD patients compared to controls. Notably, plasma p-tau231 accurately differentiated AD from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92. Moreover, plasma p-tau231 was strongly associated with Aβ pathology, as confirmed by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.


The findings of this study suggest that plasma p-tau231 is a sensitive and specific biomarker for AD pathology, offering a promising tool for early detection and monitoring. The strong correlation between plasma p-tau231 and Aβ pathology supports its potential utility in identifying individuals at risk of AD, prior to significant cognitive decline. Furthermore, the non-invasive nature of plasma p-tau231 measurement makes it an attractive candidate for longitudinal monitoring and therapeutic target engagement.


The development of reliable plasma biomarkers for AD pathology has significant implications for clinical practice and research. Plasma p-tau231 may facilitate the identification of individuals at risk, enabling early intervention and potentially improving treatment outcomes. Moreover, its use as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials could accelerate the evaluation of disease-modifying therapies. In conclusion, plasma p-tau231 represents a promising early biomarker for AD pathology, warranting further investigation in larger, longitudinal studies to fully elucidate its diagnostic and prognostic potential.
