The 2021 update to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Colon Cancer represents a pivotal shift in the systemic management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), moving towards a more biomarker-driven therapeutic paradigm. This evolution is underscored by the first-line recommendation of immune checkpoint inhibitors for tumors exhibiting mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), a landmark change that leverages the high mutational burden of these tumors to elicit robust anti-tumor immunity. Concurrently, the guidelines mandate comprehensive biomarker profiling, expanding beyond traditional markers like RAS to include HER2 amplification and the BRAF V600E mutation. This refined diagnostic framework enables the precise application of targeted therapies, such as dual HER2-targeted regimens and BRAF/MEK inhibitor combinations, for defined molecular subsets. Consequently, these updated recommendations fundamentally restructure the treatment algorithm for mCRC, prioritizing molecular stratification to optimize therapeutic efficacy and personalize patient care, thereby improving clinical outcomes in a historically difficult-to-treat malignancy.
