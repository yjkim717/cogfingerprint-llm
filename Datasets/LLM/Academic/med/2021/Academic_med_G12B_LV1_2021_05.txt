>## Evolving Systemic Therapies in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer: An Update Reflecting Biomarker-Driven Approaches and Immunotherapy Integration

**Abstract:** The management of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has undergone a paradigm shift in recent years, driven by advancements in targeted therapies and the integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This review synthesizes current evidence and reflects the updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as of 2021, highlighting the crucial role of biomarker testing in guiding therapeutic decision-making. Traditionally, treatment has been predicated on fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, often in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan. However, the identification of *KRAS*, *NRAS*, *BRAF*, and *MSI* status has enabled personalized therapeutic strategies, with targeted agents demonstrating efficacy in specific molecular subtypes. Furthermore, the emergence of ICIs, particularly in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) mCRC, has expanded treatment options and improved survival outcomes. This analysis explores the evolving landscape of systemic therapies, including the introduction of biosimilars, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive biomarker profiling to optimize treatment selection and ultimately improve patient prognosis.  We discuss the current NCCN recommendations and consider future directions within this rapidly evolving field, including the exploration of novel combinations and predictive biomarkers beyond those currently utilized.
