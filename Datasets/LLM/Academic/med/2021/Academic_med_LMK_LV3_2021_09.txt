Title: Investigating the Causal Link between Diurnal Preference and Major Depressive Disorder using Mendelian Randomization

Abstract:

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric condition with a multifactorial etiology, affecting millions worldwide. Recent studies have suggested an association between diurnal preference, a trait characterized by an individual's propensity for morning or evening activity, and the risk of developing MDD. However, the causal nature of this relationship remains unclear due to potential confounding variables and reverse causality. To address this knowledge gap, we employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to examine the causal effect of diurnal preference on MDD risk.

Using summary-level data from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in 2021, we identified genetic variants associated with diurnal preference and MDD. We selected 12 genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) for diurnal preference, which were significantly associated with sleep timing and morningness-eveningness. The IVs were then used to estimate the causal effect of genetically proxied diurnal preference on MDD risk using a two-sample MR framework.

Our results indicate that a genetically proxied earlier diurnal preference is causally associated with a lower risk of MDD (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.95, P = 0.009). This finding suggests that individuals with a natural inclination towards morningness may be less likely to develop MDD. The observed causal relationship remained robust after accounting for potential pleiotropy using sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression and weighted median estimation.

Our study provides evidence for a causal link between diurnal preference and MDD risk, highlighting the importance of sleep timing and circadian rhythm regulation in the etiology of depression. The findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting diurnal preference and sleep-wake cycles in the prevention and treatment of MDD. Furthermore, this research underscores the utility of MR in disentangling the complex relationships between behavioral traits and psychiatric disorders.

By elucidating the causal mechanisms underlying the association between diurnal preference and MDD, our study contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular and behavioral pathways involved in the development of depression. As such, this research has the potential to inform the development of personalized interventions and improve treatment outcomes for individuals at risk of or affected by MDD.
