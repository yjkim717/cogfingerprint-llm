Title: Investigating the Causal Relationship between Diurnal Preference and Major Depressive Disorder using Mendelian Randomization Analysis

Abstract:

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness and loss of interest in activities. Recent studies have suggested that disturbances in sleep timing and diurnal preference may be associated with an increased risk of developing MDD. However, the causal nature of this relationship remains unclear due to the presence of confounding variables and reverse causation. To address this limitation, we employed a Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis to investigate the causal effect of diurnal preference on the risk of MDD.

Using summary-level data from large-scale Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), we identified 351 independent genetic variants associated with diurnal preference, which were used as instrumental variables in our MR analysis. The genetic associations with MDD were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis comprising 45,591 cases and 97,674 controls. We applied a two-sample MR design, where the genetic associations with diurnal preference and MDD were estimated in separate samples.

Our results indicate that a genetically proxied morning diurnal preference is associated with a lower risk of MDD (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.73-0.90, p = 1.3 × 10^(-4)). The causal effect was consistent across different MR methods, including the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method (β: -0.21, SE: 0.05, p = 1.1 × 10^(-4)) and the weighted median estimator (β: -0.23, SE: 0.07, p = 1.2 × 10^(-3)). Sensitivity analyses revealed no evidence of horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity among the genetic variants.

Our findings provide strong evidence for a causal relationship between diurnal preference and MDD, suggesting that a morning diurnal preference may be protective against the development of MDD. The results are consistent with previous observational studies and provide a potential mechanistic insight into the relationship between sleep timing and depression. The use of MR analysis minimizes the impact of confounding variables and reverse causation, strengthening the inference of causality.

The study's findings have implications for the prevention and treatment of MDD. Interventions aimed at promoting a morning diurnal preference, such as morning light therapy or adjusting sleep schedules, may be effective in reducing the risk of MDD. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms and to explore the potential therapeutic applications of targeting diurnal preference in the context of MDD.

In conclusion, our MR analysis provides robust evidence for a causal relationship between diurnal preference and MDD, highlighting the importance of considering sleep timing and diurnal preference in the prevention and treatment of depression.
