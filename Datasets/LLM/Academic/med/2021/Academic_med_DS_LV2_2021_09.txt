**Title:** The Causal Effect of Morning Diurnal Preference on Major Depressive Disorder Risk: A Mendelian Randomization Study

**Abstract**

**Background:** Observational epidemiology has consistently identified an association between an individual's diurnal preference (chronotype) and the risk of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), with evening types exhibiting a higher prevalence. However, the causal nature and direction of this relationship remain uncertain due to potential confounding and reverse causation inherent in observational studies. We aimed to investigate the potential causal effect of genetically proxied diurnal preference on MDD risk.

**Methods:** We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to estimate the causal association between diurnal preference and MDD. Genetic instruments for diurnal preference, defined by self-reported sleep midpoint (with a preference for morningness), were obtained from a large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of over 700,000 individuals from the UK Biobank and 23andMe cohorts. Summary-level data for MDD were sourced from an independent GWAS meta-analysis including over 500,000 participants. The primary analysis utilized the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, with sensitivity analyses conducted using MR-Egger, weighted median, and MR-PRESSO to assess and correct for potential pleiotropy and heterogeneity.

**Results:** Genetically instrumented morning diurnal preference was significantly associated with a reduced risk of MDD. The IVW estimate indicated that a one-standard deviation increase in genetic predisposition towards morningness was associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.77 for MDD (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.73 to 0.82; p = 4.1 x 10^-14). This corresponds to a 23% lower relative risk of developing MDD. Sensitivity analyses yielded consistent directional estimates, with the weighted median method producing a similar effect size (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.85), and MR-Egger regression indicating no significant evidence of directional pleiotropy (p-intercept = 0.42).

**Conclusion:** Our findings provide robust evidence from genetic data supporting a causal, protective relationship between a morning diurnal preference and a lower risk of Major Depressive Disorder. This suggests that an individual's innate circadian tendency is an independent risk factor for MDD. These results underscore the importance of considering circadian biology in public health strategies for mental health and highlight the potential of chronotherapeutic interventions for depression prevention and management.
