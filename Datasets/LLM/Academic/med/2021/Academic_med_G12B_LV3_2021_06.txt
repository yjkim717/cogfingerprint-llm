**Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer: A Synthesis of ASCO Guideline Recommendations and Evolving Therapeutic Landscape (2021)**

The management of locally advanced and early-stage breast cancer has witnessed a paradigm shift towards neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), increasingly recognized for its ability to assess pathological response and potentially optimize surgical strategies. This review synthesizes the key recommendations outlined in the 2021 ASCO guideline regarding NAC, contextualizing them within the rapidly evolving therapeutic landscape. The guideline underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, integrating surgical oncology, medical oncology, and radiation oncology to tailor treatment regimens. Crucially, patient selection for NAC remains a central consideration, factoring in tumor stage, receptor status (ER, PR, HER2), genomic profiling, and patient comorbidities. The integration of endocrine therapy and targeted therapies, such as HER2-targeted agents, alongside cytotoxic chemotherapy represents a significant advancement. Specifically, the guideline highlights the utility of sequential or concurrent endocrine therapy in hormone receptor-positive disease, and the imperative for HER2-positive tumors to receive trastuzumab-based regimens. Furthermore, the evolving role of immunotherapy, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, is acknowledged, emphasizing the need for ongoing clinical trials to define optimal sequencing and patient populations. This analysis emphasizes that adherence to ASCO guideline recommendations, coupled with continuous adaptation to emerging data regarding novel therapeutic agents and biomarkers, is vital for optimizing patient outcomes in breast cancer treated with NAC.
