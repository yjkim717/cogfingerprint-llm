**Abstract**

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treatment paradigms have undergone substantial evolution, as reflected in the 2021 NCCN Guidelines. This study examines the integration of novel therapeutic approaches, primarily centered on checkpoint inhibitors, alongside the increasing clinical significance of biosimilar formulations.  Strategic biomarker testing, including assessment for HER2 amplification and BRAF V600E mutation, now dictates personalized treatment strategies within mCRC.  The utilization of checkpoint inhibitors, often in combination with targeted therapies, represents a cornerstone of contemporary mCRC management. Furthermore, the introduction of biosimilars offers a pathway to improve treatment accessibility and cost-effectiveness.  Continued research focusing on predictive biomarker panels and optimized sequencing strategies is essential to maximize patient outcomes and refine the current standard of care for this challenging disease.
