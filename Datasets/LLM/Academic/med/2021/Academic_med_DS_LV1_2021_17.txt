**Title:** The Synergistic Impact of Vascular Risk Burden on Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Trajectories in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease

**Abstract**

**Background:** The classical amyloid cascade hypothesis has been increasingly integrated with evidence implicating vascular dysregulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. While both cerebrovascular disease and AD pathology frequently co-occur, the nature of their interaction, particularly during the extended preclinical phase, remains a critical area of investigation. This study posits that aggregate vascular risk burden (VRB) does not merely represent a comorbid condition but acts synergistically with core Alzheimer's pathophysiology to accelerate the trajectory of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline.

**Methods:** We conducted a longitudinal analysis of 450 cognitively unimpaired older adults from the prospective Neurovascular Aging Cohort (mean age 68.5 ± 5.2 years; 58% female). Participants underwent comprehensive baseline assessments, including the Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular risk score to quantify VRB, lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of amyloid-β (Aβ42) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine hippocampal volume and cortical thickness. Annual follow-ups over 36 months included detailed neuropsychological testing. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to examine the interaction between VRB and AD biomarkers on rates of regional brain atrophy and cognitive change.

**Results:** After adjusting for age, sex, and APOE ε4 status, a significant interaction was observed between VRB and CSF p-tau on longitudinal cognitive decline (β = -0.24, p < 0.001) and hippocampal atrophy (β = -0.18, p = 0.005). Specifically, individuals with elevated VRB and pathological AD biomarkers exhibited a 2.5-fold faster rate of global cognitive decline and a 35% greater rate of medial temporal lobe atrophy compared to those with pathological biomarkers alone. VRB showed a weaker, non-significant interaction with Aβ42, suggesting its primary synergistic effect may be through tau-related neurodegeneration pathways.

**Conclusion:** Our findings, current to 2021, provide robust evidence that vascular risk factors potentiate the deleterious effects of Alzheimer's pathology, specifically tau, in the preclinical stage. This synergy significantly accelerates both structural brain integrity loss and cognitive deterioration. These results underscore the imperative for multimodal intervention strategies that concurrently target vascular health and AD pathophysiology, even in asymptomatic at-risk populations, to mitigate disease progression.
