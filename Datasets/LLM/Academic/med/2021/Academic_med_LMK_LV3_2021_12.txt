Title: Comparative Analysis of Long-term Mortality Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Bariatric Surgery for Severe Obesity

Abstract:

Severe obesity is a chronic condition associated with increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Bariatric surgery has emerged as an effective treatment modality for managing severe obesity and its related comorbidities. This retrospective cohort study aimed to investigate the long-term mortality outcomes in patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) compared to nonsurgical controls.

The study cohort comprised adults with severe obesity who underwent either RYGB or SG between 2005 and 2015. Nonsurgical controls were matched based on demographic and clinical characteristics. Long-term mortality data were obtained from national registries and analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models.

The results demonstrated that both RYGB and SG were associated with significantly lower long-term mortality compared to nonsurgical controls. After adjusting for potential confounders, RYGB was associated with a 42% reduction in mortality risk (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.45-0.75, p < 0.001), while SG was associated with a 35% reduction in mortality risk (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.52-0.82, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that the mortality benefits were consistent across various age groups and in patients with and without comorbidities.

These findings suggest that bariatric surgery is an effective treatment strategy for reducing long-term mortality in patients with severe obesity. While both RYGB and SG were associated with improved survival outcomes, RYGB demonstrated a more pronounced mortality benefit. These results have significant implications for clinical practice and healthcare policy, highlighting the importance of considering bariatric surgery as a treatment option for patients with severe obesity.

The study's findings are consistent with the existing literature, which has shown that bariatric surgery is associated with improved long-term outcomes in patients with severe obesity. The results of this study provide further evidence to support the use of bariatric surgery as a treatment modality for severe obesity and highlight the need for continued research into the long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that RYGB and SG are associated with significantly lower long-term mortality compared to nonsurgical controls in patients with severe obesity. The findings of this study have important implications for clinical practice and healthcare policy, and highlight the need for further research into the long-term outcomes of bariatric surgery. As the prevalence of severe obesity continues to rise, the results of this study underscore the importance of considering bariatric surgery as a treatment option for patients with severe obesity.
