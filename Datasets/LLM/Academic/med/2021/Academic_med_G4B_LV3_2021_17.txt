**Abstract**

Emerging evidence increasingly implicates vascular risk factors as potent modulators of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. This study investigates the interplay between traditional vascular risk profiles and the progression of cognitive impairment, specifically focusing on individuals exhibiting clinically normal cognition. Utilizing longitudinal data and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, we observed a statistically significant synergistic effect wherein elevated levels of established vascular risk factors – including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes – were associated with accelerated neurodegeneration, as evidenced by decreased CSF amyloid-β42 and increased CSF neurofilament light chain (NfL). These findings suggest that vascular pathology may represent an early and critical driver of AD development, potentially preceding the onset of overt cognitive decline.  Consequently, targeting vascular risk factors represents a promising avenue for preventative and therapeutic interventions, warranting the exploration of combined pharmacological and lifestyle strategies to mitigate the risk of neurodegenerative disease.
