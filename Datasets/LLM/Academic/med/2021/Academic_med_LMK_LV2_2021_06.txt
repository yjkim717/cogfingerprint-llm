**Title:** Optimizing Neoadjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review and Guideline Recommendations

**Abstract:**

Neoadjuvant therapy has become a cornerstone in the management of breast cancer, offering the potential to downstage tumors and improve surgical outcomes. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has developed guideline recommendations to inform optimal neoadjuvant treatment strategies for breast cancer patients. Based on a systematic review of 41 eligible articles, this guideline aims to provide evidence-based recommendations for the use of targeted therapy, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy in the neoadjuvant setting. The review encompasses a comprehensive analysis of clinical trials and observational studies published up to 2021, evaluating the efficacy and safety of various neoadjuvant regimens in different breast cancer subtypes. The guideline recommendations emphasize the importance of tumor biology and receptor status in guiding neoadjuvant treatment decisions. For patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer, endocrine therapy is recommended as a neoadjuvant option. In contrast, patients with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer are advised to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with the addition of targeted therapy for those with HER2-positive disease. The guideline also highlights the need for careful consideration of patient comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and treatment goals when selecting a neoadjuvant regimen. By synthesizing the available evidence and providing actionable recommendations, this ASCO guideline aims to promote personalized and effective neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer patients.
