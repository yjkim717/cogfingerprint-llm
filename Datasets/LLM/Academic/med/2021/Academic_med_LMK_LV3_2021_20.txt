Optimizing Neoadjuvant Therapy for Breast Cancer: A Multidisciplinary Approach Guided by Tumor Biology and ASCO Recommendations

In 2021, the management of breast cancer continues to evolve with the integration of neoadjuvant therapy, a treatment strategy that has shown significant promise in improving patient outcomes. Neoadjuvant therapy, administered before the main treatment (usually surgery), aims to reduce tumor size, address potential micrometastases, and assess the tumor's responsiveness to systemic treatments. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has issued guidelines to standardize and optimize the use of neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer, underscoring the importance of a multidisciplinary approach tailored to individual tumor characteristics.

The ASCO guideline emphasizes the role of chemotherapy and targeted therapy in neoadjuvant regimens, recommending their use based on the molecular subtype of breast cancer. For instance, HER2-positive breast cancers are advised to receive HER2-targeted therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy, while the utility of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy is considered for hormone receptor-positive tumors. This personalized approach is supported by evidence suggesting that the response to neoadjuvant therapy can predict long-term outcomes and guide adjuvant treatment decisions.

Multidisciplinary care, involving surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, and radiologists, is crucial in the implementation of neoadjuvant therapy. This collaborative model ensures that treatment plans are comprehensive, taking into account not only the tumor's biological characteristics but also the patient's overall health and preferences. The assessment of tumor response to neoadjuvant therapy is facilitated by advancements in imaging techniques and pathological evaluation, allowing for real-time adjustments to the treatment plan.

By adopting the ASCO guideline recommendations and fostering a multidisciplinary care environment, clinicians can enhance the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer. This tailored approach, informed by the latest evidence and guided by tumor biology, has the potential to improve patient outcomes, increase the rate of breast-conserving surgery, and provide valuable prognostic information. As the landscape of breast cancer treatment continues to evolve, the integration of neoadjuvant therapy into clinical practice, supported by ASCO guidelines and a multidisciplinary team, represents a significant step forward in the quest for personalized medicine.
