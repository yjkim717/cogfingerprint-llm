Title: Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profiling Reveals Prognostic Biomarkers in IDH1/2-Mutant Anaplastic Astrocytoma

Abstract:

Anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) is a malignant glioma characterized by high heterogeneity and poor prognosis. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of IDH1/2 mutations in AA, which are associated with distinct molecular and clinical features. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the variable outcome in IDH1/2-mutant AA patients remain poorly understood. To address this question, we conducted a comprehensive genome-wide DNA methylation analysis using Illumina EPIC arrays on a cohort of 75 IDH1/2-mutant AA samples. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to identify genetic alterations. Our results revealed distinct DNA methylation profiles associated with clinical outcome. Unsupervised clustering analysis identified three distinct methylation subgroups, which correlated with differences in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that DNA methylation-based subgroups were independent predictors of OS and PFS, even after adjusting for established clinical and molecular covariates, including temozolomide treatment. Furthermore, integration of NGS data revealed that the methylation subgroups were associated with distinct genetic alterations, including mutations in genes involved in cell cycle regulation and DNA repair. Our findings highlight the potential of genome-wide DNA methylation analysis to identify prognostic biomarkers in IDH1/2-mutant AA and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying treatment response and resistance. The identification of molecularly defined subgroups may inform personalized treatment strategies for this patient population.
