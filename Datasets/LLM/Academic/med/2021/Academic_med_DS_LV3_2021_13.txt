The 2021 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) guidance document establishes a comprehensive framework for the safety evaluation of food enzymes, representing a significant advancement in regulatory toxicology. This systematic approach mandates rigorous characterization of enzyme sources, including microbiological strains, alongside detailed toxicological profiling to identify potential hazards. The guidance specifies requirements for genotoxicity studies, subchronic oral toxicity testing in rodents, and allergenicity assessments to address protein-specific risks. A cornerstone of this methodology is the refined estimation of dietary exposure, integrating consumption data with proposed technological uses across food categories. By synthesizing toxicological data with exposure estimates, the guidance enables robust risk characterization, ensuring that enzyme applications pose no safety concerns under defined conditions of use. This science-based paradigm strengthens the pre-market authorization process, providing a harmonized EU-wide standard for protecting consumer health while facilitating innovation in food manufacturing technologies. The implementation of this framework demonstrates EFSA's commitment to evidence-based food safety assessment in an evolving regulatory landscape.
