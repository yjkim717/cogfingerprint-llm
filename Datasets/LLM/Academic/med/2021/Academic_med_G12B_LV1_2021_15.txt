**An Atypical Presentation of a Symptomatic Pulmonary Hamartoma: A Case Report**

**Abstract**

Pulmonary hamartomas are typically asymptomatic benign lung lesions discovered incidentally on imaging. We report a rare case of a 44-year-old female presenting with persistent cough and recurrent episodes of hemoptysis, ultimately attributed to a symptomatic pulmonary hamartoma. Computed tomography revealed a 3.2 cm lesion in the right lower lobe demonstrating characteristic hamartomatous features. Bronchoscopic examination confirmed mucosal irregularity adjacent to the mass. Following initial conservative management including cessation of smoking and observation, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy due to persistent symptoms and concerns regarding potential malignant transformation. Histopathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of a bronchial hamartoma, exhibiting a disorganized proliferation of cartilage, smooth muscle, and respiratory epithelium. This case highlights the atypical presentation of pulmonary hamartomas, emphasizing the importance of considering them in the differential diagnosis of patients with chronic respiratory symptoms and illustrating the role of VATS in definitive diagnosis and treatment when symptoms persist despite initial management.
