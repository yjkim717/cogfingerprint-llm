**Abstract**

The interplay between vascular risk factors and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology represents a critical, yet incompletely understood, contributor to neurodegenerative progression. This retrospective cohort study, conducted in 2021, investigated the synergistic effects of cumulative vascular risk burden on cognitive trajectory and neurodegeneration in a population of cognitively unimpaired individuals. Utilizing longitudinal data, we assessed the impact of established vascular risk factors – including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity – on markers of AD pathology and cognitive performance. Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant acceleration of neurodegenerative processes, as evidenced by [mention specific neuroimaging or biomarker data, e.g., increased amyloid deposition or hippocampal atrophy], in individuals exhibiting a high vascular risk factor burden. Furthermore, this elevated risk profile was associated with a demonstrably steeper decline in cognitive function, specifically impacting [mention specific cognitive domains, e.g., executive function or episodic memory]. These results suggest that vascular risk factors do not merely act as independent contributors to cognitive decline, but rather synergistically exacerbate AD-related neurodegeneration within the preclinical phase. Consequently, this study underscores the potential for targeted therapeutic interventions that simultaneously address both vascular health and AD pathophysiology, representing a promising avenue for mitigating disease progression and delaying the onset of clinical AD.
