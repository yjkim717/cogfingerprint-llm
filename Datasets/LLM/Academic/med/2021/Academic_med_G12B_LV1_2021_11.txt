## Engineering Enhanced T-Cell Immunotherapies: CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated TCR and CAR Modification for Cancer Treatment

**Abstract:** Adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT), particularly chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has revolutionized treatment for hematological malignancies. However, efficacy remains limited in solid tumors and is often hampered by challenges including T-cell exhaustion, off-target effects, and limited tumor infiltration. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology offers unprecedented opportunities to rationally engineer T-cells, enhancing their therapeutic potential and addressing these limitations. This review examines recent progress utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 for targeted modification of T-cell receptors (TCRs) and CAR constructs within the context of ACT for cancer immunotherapy. We discuss strategies for knocking out inhibitory receptors (e.g., PD-1, CTLA-4) to reinvigorate exhausted T-cells, improving persistence and anti-tumor activity. Furthermore, we explore approaches to enhance CAR T-cell specificity and reduce off-target toxicity through precise editing of CAR sequences and targeting moieties.  We also highlight emerging techniques involving CRISPR/Cas9-mediated insertion of novel functionalities, such as cytokine secretion domains or enhanced signaling motifs, to further augment T-cell effector functions. While early clinical trials utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-modified T-cells have demonstrated encouraging results, significant hurdles remain, including efficient delivery of CRISPR components, ensuring genomic stability, and accurately predicting long-term clinical outcomes. This review concludes by outlining future directions for this rapidly evolving field, focusing on strategies to optimize CRISPR/Cas9-mediated T-cell engineering for improved efficacy and safety in diverse cancer settings, particularly in solid tumors.
