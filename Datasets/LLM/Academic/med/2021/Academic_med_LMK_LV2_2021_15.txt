Title: A Rare Case of Symptomatic Pulmonary Hamartoma: Clinical Presentation and Management

Abstract:
Pulmonary hamartomas are typically benign lung tumors often discovered incidentally. We present a rare symptomatic case in a 44-year-old woman, highlighting its unusual clinical features. The patient presented with persistent cough and dyspnea, and imaging revealed a large lung mass. Histopathological examination confirmed a pulmonary hamartoma. Surgical resection was performed, and the patient showed significant improvement post-operatively. This case underscores the importance of considering pulmonary hamartoma in the differential diagnosis of symptomatic lung masses, warranting timely intervention to alleviate symptoms and improve outcomes.
