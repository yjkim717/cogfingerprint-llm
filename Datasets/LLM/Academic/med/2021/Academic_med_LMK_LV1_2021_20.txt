**Neoadjuvant Therapy in Breast Cancer: A Review of Current Recommendations and Tumor Subtype-Specific Considerations**

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, comprising distinct molecular subtypes with varying prognostic implications. Neoadjuvant therapy, or the administration of systemic treatment prior to definitive surgery, has become an integral component of breast cancer management. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) has issued guidelines recommending neoadjuvant therapy options based on tumor characteristics and patient factors. This review aims to summarize the current recommendations and discuss subtype-specific considerations for neoadjuvant therapy in breast cancer.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression, is often associated with a higher risk of recurrence and poorer overall survival. For patients with TNBC, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care, with a preference for anthracycline- and taxane-based regimens. Recent studies have explored the addition of immunotherapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC, demonstrating promising results.

In contrast, hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, which accounts for approximately 70% of all breast cancer diagnoses, is often treated with neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. The choice of endocrine therapy depends on menopausal status, with aromatase inhibitors preferred in postmenopausal women and tamoxifen or ovarian suppression plus aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen in premenopausal women.

HER2-positive breast cancer, characterized by overexpression or amplification of the HER2 gene, is typically treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 therapy, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab. The addition of anti-HER2 therapy has significantly improved pathological complete response (pCR) rates and overall survival in this subtype.

The ASCO guidelines recommend that neoadjuvant therapy decisions be guided by tumor biology, patient comorbidities, and treatment goals. For patients with stage II-III breast cancer, neoadjuvant therapy is recommended to improve surgical outcomes and assess tumor responsiveness to systemic treatment. In conclusion, neoadjuvant therapy is a crucial component of breast cancer management, with subtype-specific considerations playing a critical role in guiding treatment decisions. As our understanding of breast cancer biology continues to evolve, further research is needed to optimize neoadjuvant therapy approaches and improve patient outcomes.
