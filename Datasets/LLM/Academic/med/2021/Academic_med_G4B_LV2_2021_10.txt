**Abstract**

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents a formidable challenge in neuro-oncology, characterized by aggressive proliferation and a complex tumor microenvironment. Accurate assessment of tumor acidity is increasingly recognized as a critical factor influencing treatment response and prognosis. This study investigates the application of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI and principal component analysis (PCA) to quantitatively assess tumor acidity within GBM. Utilizing a dataset acquired via DSC MRI, we implemented PCA to extract key principal components reflecting variations in contrast enhancement, effectively deconvoluting the complex signal profiles. Our results demonstrate a significant and robust correlation between the derived principal components and established pH estimates obtained through independent methods. Specifically, the first principal component exhibited a strong positive association with decreasing tumor acidity. These findings suggest that PCA of DSC MRI provides a sensitive and reliable method for characterizing the tumor microenvironment in GBM.  Further investigation employing cest-epi analysis, potentially integrating these quantitative metrics with clinical data, is warranted to elucidate the mechanistic role of tumor acidity in GBM progression and inform targeted therapeutic strategies.
