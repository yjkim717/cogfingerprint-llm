**Abstract**

The 2021 NCCN Guidelines represent a pivotal update to systemic adjuvant therapy protocols for patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. Specifically, these guidelines provide refined recommendations for individuals presenting with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) and HER2-negative tumors.  Driven by a multidisciplinary panel consensus, the revisions incorporate emerging clinical trial data and address nuances in patient stratification.  Adherence to NCCN guidelines is increasingly recognized as crucial for optimizing post-operative outcomes and minimizing disease recurrence.  Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these updated strategies within diverse patient populations, ensuring consistent and evidence-based care.
