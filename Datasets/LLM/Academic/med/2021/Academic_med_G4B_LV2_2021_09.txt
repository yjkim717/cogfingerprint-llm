**Abstract: Genetic Evidence Linking Morning Chronotype to Reduced Risk of Major Depressive Disorder**

**Introduction:** Circadian rhythm disruption and sleep timing are increasingly recognized as significant contributors to the etiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). While observational studies have implicated morningness (a preference for later sleep and wake times) as a potential protective factor, the causal relationship remains unclear. This study utilizes a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate whether genetic predisposition to morning diurnal preference is associated with a reduced risk of MDD.

**Methods:** We conducted a two-stage MR analysis utilizing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data identifying genetic variants serving as proxies for diurnal preference. Specifically, we employed variants identified in GWAS of self-reported chronotype, adjusting for potential pleiotropic effects.  A total of 22 independent genetic instruments were selected, demonstrating strong correlation with chronotype and minimal pleiotropic associations with relevant confounders such as BMI and smoking status.  We then employed a variety of MR statistical methods, including the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, weighted median, and MR-Egger regression, to assess the overall association between genetically-determined morning preference and MDD risk. MDD risk was operationalized using summary estimates of MDD susceptibility derived from a meta-analysis of multiple GWAS. 

**Results:** The IVW meta-analysis revealed a significant negative association between genetically proxied morning diurnal preference and MDD susceptibility (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.74â€“0.91, p<0.001).  Subgroup analyses utilizing MR-Egger regression indicated minimal directional bias.  The weighted median method corroborated these findings, demonstrating a significant inverse association.  Sensitivity analyses, including leave-one-out and outcome over-representation tests, further supported the robustness of the observed effect. 

**Conclusion:** These findings provide preliminary evidence suggesting a causal role for genetically-determined morning chronotype in reducing the risk of MDD.  Further research incorporating longitudinal designs and exploring potential biological mechanisms is warranted to elucidate the underlying pathways linking circadian rhythms, sleep timing, and the development of this prevalent mental health disorder.
