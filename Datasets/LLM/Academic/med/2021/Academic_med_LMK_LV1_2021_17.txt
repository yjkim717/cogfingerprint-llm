Title: Synergistic Effects of Vascular Risk Burden and Alzheimer's Disease Pathophysiology on Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Decline in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease


#### Abstract

The interplay between vascular risk factors and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of preclinical AD. As the global population ages, understanding the complex interactions driving neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in cognitively unimpaired individuals is crucial for the development of effective prevention and intervention strategies. This study investigates the hypothesis that vascular risk burden synergistically interacts with AD pathophysiology to accelerate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in preclinical AD.


A comprehensive review of existing literature reveals a significant correlation between vascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia, and an increased risk of AD. Furthermore, studies employing neuroimaging and biomarker analysis have demonstrated that cognitively unimpaired individuals with high vascular risk burden exhibit increased amyloid-β deposition, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration, hallmarks of AD pathophysiology.

To elucidate the synergistic effects of vascular risk burden and AD pathophysiology, we analyzed data from a cohort of 500 cognitively unimpaired subjects, aged 60-80 years, enrolled in a longitudinal aging study. Participants underwent comprehensive cognitive assessments, neuroimaging (MRI and PET), and biomarker analysis (APOE genotyping, amyloid-β, and tau protein quantification). Vascular risk burden was quantified using the Framingham Risk Score (FRS).

Our results demonstrate a significant positive correlation between FRS and amyloid-β deposition, tau pathology, and neurodegeneration, as measured by hippocampal atrophy and cortical thinning. Moreover, cognitively unimpaired individuals with high FRS and AD pathophysiology exhibited accelerated cognitive decline, as assessed by longitudinal cognitive assessments. Multivariate analysis revealed that the interaction between vascular risk burden and AD pathophysiology significantly predicted neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, independent of age, APOE genotype, and other confounding variables.

This study provides compelling evidence that vascular risk burden and AD pathophysiology interact synergistically to accelerate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in preclinical AD. Our findings underscore the importance of managing vascular risk factors in older adults to mitigate the risk of AD and promote healthy aging. Future research should focus on developing targeted interventions aimed at reducing vascular risk burden and AD pathophysiology in preclinical AD to prevent or delay the onset of cognitive decline.
