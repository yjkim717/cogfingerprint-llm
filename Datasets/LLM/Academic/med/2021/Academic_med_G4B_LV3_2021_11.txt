**Abstract:**

Recent progress in cancer immunotherapy has increasingly leveraged adoptive T-cell therapy, yet challenges remain in achieving sustained efficacy and minimizing off-target effects. This study synthesizes recent developments integrating CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing with adoptive T-cell strategies. Specifically, modifications to T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences and the burgeoning field of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell engineering are now routinely employed to enhance specificity and reduce tumor escape. Clinical trials utilizing CRISPR-modified CAR T-cells demonstrate promising early results, particularly in solid tumor indications. However, issues surrounding on-target toxicity, donor-derived cell depletion, and the complex immunogenicity of gene-edited constructs necessitate continued investigation. Future research must prioritize robust safety profiles and standardized protocols to fully realize the translational potential of this innovative approach within cancer immunotherapy.
