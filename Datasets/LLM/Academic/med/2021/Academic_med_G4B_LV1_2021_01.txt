**Abstract**

Pulmonary hamartomas represent a relatively common, yet often underrecognized, benign neoplasm. This case report presents a unique instance of a symptomatic pulmonary hamartoma encountered in a 44-year-old female patient, necessitating detailed investigation and subsequent management. The patient presented with a primary symptom of persistent cough and intermittent shortness of breath, atypical manifestations for this lesion.  Radiological imaging revealed a well-defined, solitary pulmonary hamartoma exhibiting characteristics suggestive of atypical presentation.  Given the patient’s symptoms and the indeterminate nature of the lesion, a comprehensive workup including bronchoscopy and tissue sampling was undertaken.  This case underscores the importance of considering pulmonary hamartomas in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with non-specific respiratory complaints, particularly when symptoms such as cough and dyspnea are prominent. Further research is warranted to fully elucidate the spectrum of clinical presentations and optimal management strategies for these benign tumors.
