**Abstract**

Emerging evidence increasingly implicates early neurodegeneration as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Consequently, the identification of reliable biomarkers capable of detecting preclinical disease is a paramount objective. This study investigates the utility of plasma phosphorylated total tau protein at residue 231 (p-tau231) as a novel diagnostic tool. Utilizing data from multiple independent cohorts assessed in 2021, we demonstrate the development of a robust and sensitive plasma p-tau231 assay.  Our findings reveal a strong correlation between elevated p-tau231 levels and the presence of incipient AD pathology, effectively differentiating AD from other neurodegenerative conditions such as frontotemporal dementia. Notably, p-tau231 exhibited significant concordance with established neuropathological assessments – including Braak staging – prior to the detection of amyloid-β deposition via positron emission tomography (PET). These results suggest that plasma p-tau231 represents a promising biomarker for early detection and risk stratification in AD, warranting further investigation in longitudinal clinical trials.
