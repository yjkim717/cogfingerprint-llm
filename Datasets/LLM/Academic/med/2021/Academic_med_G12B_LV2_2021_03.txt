**Synergistic Impact of Vascular Risk Factors on Neurodegenerative Progression in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease: A Longitudinal Observational Study**

**Abstract**

The pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increasingly recognized as a complex interplay between amyloid-β deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, and cerebrovascular dysfunction. While amyloid and tau pathologies are hallmarks of AD, evidence suggests that vascular risk factors (VRFs) significantly contribute to disease onset and progression, particularly in the preclinical phase. This longitudinal observational study investigated the synergistic relationship between VRFs and neurodegenerative processes in individuals diagnosed with preclinical AD (defined as amyloid positivity without overt cognitive impairment).  A cohort of [Insert Sample Size Here] participants with confirmed amyloid positivity, assessed via [Specify Amyloid PET Tracer and Protocol or CSF Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio], underwent comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analysis (Aβ42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau) at baseline and annually for a period of [Insert Duration Here].  VRFs, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking history, were assessed using standardized clinical questionnaires and laboratory data.

Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant acceleration of both neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in individuals with preclinical AD who exhibited multiple VRFs compared to those with fewer or no VRFs (p < 0.01).  Specifically, longitudinal analysis of CSF biomarkers revealed a steeper decline in Aβ42 and a more pronounced increase in total tau and phosphorylated tau levels in the multi-VRF group. Furthermore, subtle but significant declines in executive function and memory performance, as measured by [Specify Neuropsychological Tests Used], were observed earlier and at a faster rate within this subgroup. Mediation analysis indicated that VRFs indirectly influence neurodegeneration by modulating the levels of CSF biomarkers.  These results support the hypothesis that VRFs do not merely exacerbate existing AD pathology, but actively contribute to its progression within the preclinical stage.  Targeting modifiable VRFs represents a potentially critical strategy for delaying disease onset and slowing cognitive decline in individuals at risk for AD, offering a promising avenue for preventative interventions. Further research is warranted to explore the specific mechanisms underlying this synergistic relationship and to evaluate the efficacy of targeted VRF management in clinical trials.
