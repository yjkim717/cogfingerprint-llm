**Abstract: Advancing Systemic Therapy in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer â€“ A 2021 Perspective**

Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) represents a significant therapeutic challenge, necessitating individualized treatment strategies. Recent advancements in systemic therapy, particularly the incorporation of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs), have dramatically altered patient outcomes. However, optimal CPI utilization remains contingent upon comprehensive biomarker testing, including microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB). This review synthesizes updated 2021 NCCN guidelines, emphasizing the evolving role of CPIs alongside targeted therapies within mCRC regimens. Furthermore, the increasing availability of biosimilars for established oncology agents presents opportunities to optimize cost-effectiveness and accessibility.  Strategic biomarker-driven approaches, coupled with careful consideration of treatment sequencing and potential resistance mechanisms, are crucial for maximizing patient benefit and achieving durable responses. Continued research focusing on predictive biomarkers and novel combination strategies is paramount for refining mCRC management.
