**Abstract**

Adjuvant immunotherapy represents a promising avenue for improving outcomes in esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancers. This study examines the impact of adjuvant nivolumab, following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, on disease-free survival (DFS) within the context of surgically resected tumors. Leveraging data from the Phase 3 CheckMate 577 trial (2021), we observed a statistically significant extension of DFS in patients receiving nivolumab compared to those receiving a placebo control arm. These findings strongly suggest that early post-surgical immune modulation can substantially mitigate the risk of local and distant recurrence.  

Specifically, the observed benefit in DFS underscores the potential of nivolumab to transform standard-of-care practices for this challenging malignancy. Further investigation into optimal dosing regimens and patient selection criteria is warranted.  The implications of this research extend beyond esophageal cancer, potentially informing the development of similar adjuvant immunotherapy strategies for other high-risk solid tumor types.  Continued monitoring of long-term outcomes will be crucial to fully elucidate the durability of this response.
