**Title:** The Synergistic Interplay of Vascular Risk Burden and Alzheimer's Pathology in Preclinical Neurodegeneration and Cognitive Decline

**Abstract**

Emerging evidence increasingly posits that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not a monolithic entity but rather the product of a complex interplay between core amyloid and tau pathology and comorbid conditions, most notably cerebrovascular disease. While the independent contributions of cerebral amyloidosis and vascular brain injury to cognitive impairment are well-documented, the nature of their interaction, particularly during the protracted preclinical phase of AD, remains a critical area of investigation. This review synthesizes recent longitudinal biomarker and neuroimaging studies to elucidate the hypothesis that vascular risk burden acts synergistically, rather than merely additively, with AD pathology to accelerate both neurodegeneration and cognitive decline in at-risk individuals. We argue that this synergy is mechanistically plausible through several pathways. First, conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia induce chronic cerebral hypoperfusion and endothelial dysfunction, which compromise the integrity of the blood-brain barrier. This breach facilitates the aberrant clearance of amyloid-Î² and potentially amplifies neuroinflammatory cascades, thereby exacerbating amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. Second, the metabolic stress imposed by vascular risk factors reduces the brain's resilience and computational reserve, lowering the threshold at which AD pathology becomes clinically manifest. Consequently, individuals with elevated vascular risk profiles exhibit a steeper trajectory of gray matter atrophy, particularly in vulnerable regions like the medial temporal lobe, and demonstrate more rapid decline on sensitive measures of episodic memory and executive function, even when amyloid load is equivalent to that of their healthier counterparts. This synthesis of evidence underscores that the preclinical phase of AD represents a critical window for intervention. The findings compellingly advocate for a paradigm shift in AD risk stratification and prevention, moving beyond a sole focus on amyloid-centric therapies toward integrated, multimodal approaches that aggressively manage midlife vascular health to mitigate downstream neurodegenerative consequences.
