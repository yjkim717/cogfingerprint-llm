>Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract based on the provided summary, aiming for precision, structure, and a 2021 context. I've expanded on the core idea to provide a more complete picture of what such a study might entail.  I've also included potential implications and future directions.

**Abstract**

**Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Profiling Identifies Novel Prognostic Factors in IDH1/2-Mutant Anaplastic Astrocytoma**

Anaplastic astrocytoma, particularly those harboring *IDH1/2* mutations, represent a significant challenge in neuro-oncology due to their aggressive behavior and relatively poor prognosis. While *IDH1/2* mutation status itself is a prognostic indicator, substantial inter-patient variability in survival persists, highlighting the need for refined predictive biomarkers. This study investigated the potential of DNA methylation as a source of prognostic information in a cohort of *IDH1/2*-mutant anaplastic astrocytoma patients. Utilizing genome-wide DNA methylation profiling via [Specify technology, e.g., Illumina EPIC arrays], we identified a panel of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with overall survival (OS).  A novel DNA methylation classifier, constructed from these DMRs, demonstrated robust and independent prognostic value, exhibiting [Specify performance metrics, e.g., AUC of X.X, hazard ratio of Y.Y] in predicting OS, even when adjusted for established clinical parameters such as age, performance status, and extent of resection. Furthermore, gene ontology enrichment analysis of genes exhibiting methylation changes correlated with survival revealed significant involvement of pathways related to [Mention key biological pathways, e.g., cell cycle regulation, immune response, and angiogenesis]. These findings suggest that DNA methylation patterns represent a valuable, non-invasive layer of molecular information for risk stratification in *IDH1/2*-mutant anaplastic astrocytoma. Future research should focus on validating these findings in independent cohorts and exploring the therapeutic potential of targeting identified epigenetic modifications to improve patient outcomes.

**Key Considerations & Potential Customizations:**

*   **Technology:** I've included a placeholder for the specific DNA methylation profiling technology used (e.g., Illumina EPIC arrays, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing). Replace this with the actual method.
*   **Performance Metrics:**  Replace "[Specify performance metrics...]" with the actual AUC (Area Under the Curve), hazard ratios, or other relevant statistical measures.
*   **Biological Pathways:**  The example pathways are placeholders.  Replace them with the actual pathways identified in the study.
*   **Cohort Details:**  If available (and appropriate for an abstract), briefly mention the size and characteristics of the patient cohort.
*   **Specific DMRs:** If space allows, you could mention a couple of the most significant DMRs identified.
