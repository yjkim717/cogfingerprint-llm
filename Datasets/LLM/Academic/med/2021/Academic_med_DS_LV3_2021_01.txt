This 2021 case report delineates an atypical symptomatic manifestation of pulmonary hamartoma in a 44-year-old female, challenging its conventional characterization as an asymptomatic, incidentally discovered benign neoplasm predominantly in elderly males. The patient presented with persistent cough and localized chest discomfort, prompting comprehensive diagnostic evaluation through computed tomography and subsequent histopathological confirmation via biopsy. This exceptional symptomatic presentation underscores the diagnostic challenges in pulmonary medicine, necessitating heightened clinical suspicion for benign tumors even in younger demographics with respiratory symptoms. Management involved successful video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical resection, highlighting the efficacy of minimally invasive techniques for symptomatic pulmonary hamartomas. The case emphasizes the expanding clinical spectrum of this entity and reinforces the importance of individualized diagnostic approaches in pulmonary oncology.
