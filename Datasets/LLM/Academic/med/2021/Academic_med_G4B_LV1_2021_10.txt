**Abstract**

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) represents a particularly aggressive primary brain tumor characterized by a highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. Accurate assessment of this microenvironment is crucial for therapeutic response prediction and monitoring. This study investigated the potential of dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI, coupled with principal component analysis (PCA), to provide a quantitative measure of tumor acidity within GBM. Utilizing a retrospective dataset of DSC MRI scans, we performed PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify key features indicative of local pH variations.  Our analysis revealed a robust correlation between the principal components derived from DSC data and established pH measurements obtained via intraparenchymal probes. Specifically, PCA identified distinct clusters of voxels exhibiting consistent patterns of DSC signal intensity, strongly associated with regions of lower pH. These findings suggest that PCA of DSC MRI offers a sensitive and potentially non-invasive method for characterizing the dynamic tumor microenvironment in GBM.  Further investigation utilizing cest-epi, a novel approach to epistasis analysis, may be warranted to elucidate the complex interplay of factors contributing to regional pH heterogeneity and its impact on treatment outcomes.
