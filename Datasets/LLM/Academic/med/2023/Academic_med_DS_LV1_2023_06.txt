**Title:** The 2023 ASCO-CAP Guideline Update: Refining HER2 Testing Paradigms in the Era of Novel Antibody-Drug Conjugates

**Abstract:**

The 2023 update to the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer represents a critical evolution in diagnostic standardization. While the core algorithmic framework for defining HER2-positive disease (immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or IHC 2+/in situ hybridization [ISH]-positive) remains firmly upheld to ensure patient eligibility for traditional HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab, the guideline introduces a pivotal nuance. It formally acknowledges the growing clinical significance of accurately distinguishing between the lowest expression levels: HER2 IHC 0 and HER2 IHC 1+. This refinement is driven by the proven efficacy of next-generation antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), such as fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-DXd), in treating HER2-low breast cancers, a category encompassing the IHC 1+ and IHC 2+/ISH-negative subgroups.

This paradigm shift underscores the necessity for heightened precision in immunohistochemical interpretation at the lower end of the expression spectrum. Pathologists must now exercise meticulous discernment to avoid the misclassification of true IHC 1+ cases as IHC 0, as such an error could preclude patients from accessing potentially life-extending ADC therapies. The 2023 guidelines thus reinforce the importance of robust, reproducible IHC methodologies, optimal tissue fixation, and the use of validated assay controls. Furthermore, they implicitly call for continued education and potential proficiency testing to ensure diagnostic consistency across laboratories. In conclusion, the 2023 ASCO-CAP update marks a transition from a binary (positive/negative) to a more nuanced, continuum-based model of HER2 evaluation, directly aligning diagnostic criteria with therapeutic advancements and solidifying the pathologist's role in enabling precision oncology for a broader patient population.
