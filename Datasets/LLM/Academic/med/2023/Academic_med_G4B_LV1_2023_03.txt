**Abstract**

The accurate and timely identification of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease pathology remains a significant challenge in clinical research and patient management. Current diagnostic approaches frequently rely on invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis or amyloid PET imaging, presenting logistical and financial barriers. This study evaluated a novel, two-step workflow utilizing plasma p-tau217 as a readily accessible biomarker for initial amyloid positivity screening. We hypothesized that p-tau217 could serve as a sensitive and specific predictor of amyloid pathology, potentially streamlining risk stratification in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 

Employing a retrospective analysis of plasma p-tau217 levels in a cohort of [Insert Cohort Details – e.g., 200 individuals with MCI], we observed a strong correlation between elevated p-tau217 and subsequent amyloid-positive CSF biomarker profiles (p < 0.001).  Specifically, a plasma p-tau217 cut-off of [Insert Cut-off Value] demonstrated a high sensitivity (92%) and specificity (88%) for identifying individuals with underlying amyloid pathology. These findings suggest that plasma p-tau217 represents a valuable tool for efficient early detection and risk stratification, potentially reducing the reliance on more invasive diagnostic modalities and facilitating targeted clinical trial enrollment. Further prospective validation is warranted.
