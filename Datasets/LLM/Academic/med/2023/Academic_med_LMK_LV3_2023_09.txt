Title: Leveraging Mendelian Randomization to Inform Drug Target Identification: A Human Genetics Perspective

Abstract:
The integration of human genetics into drug development has revolutionized the field, enabling the identification and validation of novel therapeutic targets. Mendelian randomization (MR), a statistical framework that exploits genetic variation to infer causality, has emerged as a powerful tool in this context. By analyzing genetic associations with disease outcomes, MR studies can provide insights into the causal relationships between putative drug targets and disease etiology. As of 2023, the application of MR in drug target identification has gained significant traction, with numerous studies demonstrating its utility in prioritizing therapeutic targets and predicting treatment outcomes. This review examines the current state of MR in drug development, highlighting its strengths and limitations, and discusses its potential to accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutics by leveraging human genetic data.
