Title: Leveraging Human Genetics for Drug Target Identification: A Mendelian Randomization Approach

Abstract:
The integration of human genetics into the drug development pipeline has revolutionized the identification and validation of therapeutic targets. Mendelian randomization (MR), a statistical framework that exploits genetic variation as a natural experiment, has emerged as a powerful tool in this endeavour. By utilizing genetic variants as instrumental variables, MR enables the inference of causal relationships between modifiable risk factors and disease outcomes, thereby informing the development of targeted therapies. Recent advances in genomic research have yielded a wealth of genetic data, facilitating the application of MR to identify and validate putative drug targets. This approach has shown considerable promise in prioritizing novel therapeutic targets and predicting their efficacy and potential adverse effects. As the field continues to evolve in 2023, the strategic incorporation of MR into drug development paradigms is poised to enhance the discovery of effective treatments and streamline the development process.
