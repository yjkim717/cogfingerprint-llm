**Abstract**

**Objective:** Pediatric brain gliomas present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges compared to their adult counterparts, characterized by distinct molecular profiles and anatomical presentations. The accurate segmentation of these tumors from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a critical prerequisite for surgical planning, treatment monitoring, and response assessment. This study details the methodology and findings of the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge, established to benchmark the efficacy of automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in segmenting pediatric glioma sub-regions.

**Methods:** We curated a large, multi-institutional mpMRI dataset of pediatric patients with gliomas, annotated by an international panel of expert neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons to establish reference standard segmentations for the enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor core, and peritumoral edematous regions. A diverse array of competing segmentation algorithms, primarily based on deep convolutional neural networks, was evaluated on a held-out validation cohort using standardized metrics, including the Dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance.

**Results:** The top-performing algorithms demonstrated robust segmentation accuracy, approaching expert-level performance in delineating critical tumor sub-compartments. However, significant performance variance was observed across different tumor grades and anatomical locations, highlighting specific domains requiring further algorithmic refinement.

**Conclusion:** The BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge provides a foundational benchmark for the development of AI-driven tools in pediatric neuro-oncology. The successful application of these algorithms holds significant promise for standardizing quantitative tumor assessment, thereby enhancing the rigor of clinical trials and ultimately informing personalized therapeutic strategies for pediatric patients.
