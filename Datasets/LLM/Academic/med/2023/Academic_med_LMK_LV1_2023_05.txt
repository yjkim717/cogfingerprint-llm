**Optimizing Management of Anal Carcinoma: An Update on NCCN Guidelines**

Anal carcinoma, predominantly squamous cell carcinoma, is a rare malignancy that requires multidisciplinary management. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. This review summarizes the current NCCN guidelines for anal carcinoma management. Chemoradiation remains the standard of care for localized disease, with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and concurrent chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C. Systemic therapy is recommended for metastatic or recurrent disease, with options including chemotherapy and targeted therapy. The NCCN guidelines emphasize the importance of accurate staging, including imaging and pathological assessment. Follow-up recommendations include regular clinical evaluation and imaging to monitor for recurrence. Adherence to NCCN guidelines is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes. This review provides an update on the current management of anal carcinoma, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach and the role of chemoradiation and systemic therapy. (2023)
