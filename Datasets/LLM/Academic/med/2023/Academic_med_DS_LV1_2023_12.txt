**Abstract**

**Background:** Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) represents a cornerstone intervention for severe obesity and its comorbidities. While its efficacy for substantial and durable weight loss and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remission is well-established, the long-term management of postoperative sequelae remains a critical area of clinical focus.

**Objective:** This review synthesizes contemporary evidence (2018-2023) to evaluate the long-term benefits and risks of MBS, with a specific emphasis on cardiovascular outcomes and micronutrient status.

**Methods:** A systematic literature review was conducted, analyzing longitudinal studies and meta-analyses concerning Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy.

**Results:** MBS is associated with a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and mortality. Concurrently, T2D remission rates are substantial, though heterogeneous. However, these benefits are counterbalanced by a high prevalence of acquired nutritional deficiencies—particularly of iron, vitamin B12, and vitamin D—and an elevated risk of subsequent substance use disorders, necessitating continuous clinical vigilance.

**Conclusion:** MBS confers profound metabolic and cardiovascular advantages but mandates a paradigm of lifelong, multidisciplinary follow-up to mitigate nutritional and psychiatric complications, ensuring net long-term patient benefit.
