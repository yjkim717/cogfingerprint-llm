## Abstract: Evolving Systemic Therapy Recommendations for Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer: An Analysis of NCCN Guidelines Updates (2023)

This report analyzes recent revisions to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines pertaining to the systemic treatment of patients diagnosed with Stage IV (M1) metastatic breast cancer, reflecting the rapidly evolving landscape of therapeutic options. The analysis focuses on key updates published in 2023, examining changes in treatment algorithms for hormone receptor-positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2+), and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. Specific attention is given to the incorporation of novel targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and antibody-drug conjugates, alongside established cytotoxic agents. Furthermore, the report assesses modifications to sequencing strategies, maintenance therapy recommendations, and considerations for specific metastatic sites and patient performance status. These updates aim to optimize patient outcomes through personalized treatment approaches, incorporating evidence from recent clinical trials and refining the application of established best practices in the management of advanced breast cancer. This analysis provides a concise overview of the current NCCN recommendations, offering valuable guidance for clinicians navigating complex treatment decisions for patients with metastatic disease.
