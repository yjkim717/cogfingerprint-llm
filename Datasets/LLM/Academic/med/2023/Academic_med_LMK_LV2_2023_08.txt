"Advances in Systemic Therapy for Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers: A Focus on Biomarker-Driven Targeted Therapies"

Esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancers pose significant therapeutic challenges, particularly in the context of recurrent or metastatic disease. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines provide evidence-based management strategies for these malignancies, emphasizing the importance of systemic therapy. Recent breakthroughs in biomarker testing have enabled the identification of actionable molecular alterations, informing the development of targeted therapies. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the role of biomarker-driven targeted therapies in the management of esophageal and EGJ cancers. We examine the clinical utility of biomarkers such as HER2, PD-L1, and NTRK, and discuss emerging therapeutic targets. The integration of biomarker testing into clinical practice is crucial for optimizing treatment selection and improving patient outcomes. As the therapeutic landscape continues to evolve, ongoing research is needed to refine the use of targeted therapies and to identify novel biomarkers, ultimately enhancing the care of patients with esophageal and EGJ cancers.
