**Abstract**

Recent advancements in targeted therapies for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer necessitate refined diagnostic approaches. This 2023 update to the ASCO-CAP guideline on HER2 testing reflects a critical re-evaluation of immunohistochemistry (IHC) interpretation, specifically addressing the clinical implications of differentiating between IHC 0 and 1+ results. Historically, IHC 1+ staining has been considered indeterminate, often requiring additional testing such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). However, the approval and demonstrated efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan, a targeted antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with low levels of HER2 expression (including IHC 1+), has fundamentally altered the treatment landscape. The updated guideline reinforces the importance of consistent and accurate IHC assessment, emphasizing that IHC 1+ should no longer be automatically subjected to FISH. This nuanced approach aims to optimize patient selection for trastuzumab deruxtecan, maximizing therapeutic benefit while mitigating unnecessary testing and associated costs. The guideline underscores a shift towards a more personalized management strategy for breast cancer, leveraging the precision of HER2 testing to guide treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.
