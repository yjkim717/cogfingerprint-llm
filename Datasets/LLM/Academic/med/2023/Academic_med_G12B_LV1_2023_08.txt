**Abstract**

The management of recurrent or metastatic esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancers presents a significant clinical challenge. This review synthesizes current best practices and emerging therapeutic strategies within the context of the updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, reflecting the evolving landscape of precision oncology in 2023. Esophageal cancer encompasses distinct histopathological subtypes—squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma—each with varying etiologies and responses to treatment. While surgical resection and chemoradiation remain cornerstones of initial management, the recurrence or metastatic disease necessitates a multidisciplinary approach integrating systemic therapies, locoregional interventions, and palliative care.  This update underscores the critical role of comprehensive biomarker testing, including PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and actionable genomic alterations (e.g., *HER2*, *FGFR2*) to guide targeted therapeutic selection. Novel immunotherapy combinations, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), and targeted small molecule inhibitors are increasingly incorporated into treatment algorithms, particularly for adenocarcinoma.  However, for SCC, therapeutic options remain limited, highlighting the need for further research into novel targets and immunotherapeutic strategies.  The NCCN guidelines emphasize individualized treatment plans based on disease stage, histological subtype, performance status, and biomarker profile, with a focus on maximizing patient survival and quality of life.  Future directions include expansion of clinical trials evaluating personalized therapeutic approaches and the development of predictive biomarkers to optimize treatment selection in both SCC and adenocarcinoma.
