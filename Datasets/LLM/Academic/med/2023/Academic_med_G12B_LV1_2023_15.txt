Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in the style expected in a medical/psychological research context for 2023.  I've aimed for precision and a structured argument.  Following the abstract, I'll include notes on the rationale behind some of the choices I made.

**Prevalence and Psychological Distress in High School Athletes: A Call for Integrated Mental Health Support**

**Abstract**

**Background:** Participation in high school athletics is often viewed as fostering physical and social development; however, the potential for concomitant psychological distress remains a significant, and often under-recognized, concern. This study investigated the prevalence of stress and associated mental health needs among high school athletes, recognizing the potential impact on both athletic performance and overall well-being.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional survey was administered to a convenience sample of high school athletes (N= [Insert Sample Size Here – e.g., 350]) across [Mention Geographic Region if applicable – e.g., a multi-county school district] during the 2022-2023 academic year. The survey assessed perceived stress levels using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and included questions regarding pressure related to athletic performance, fear of failure, and willingness to seek professional mental health services.  Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and correlational analyses to examine the relationships between stress levels, reported pressures, and help-seeking intentions.

**Results:** Findings revealed a strikingly high prevalence of stress among surveyed athletes, with 91% reporting experiencing stress related to sports participation.  Significant positive correlations were observed between perceived stress and reported pressure from coaches, parents, and self-imposed expectations (p < 0.001).  Furthermore, a considerable proportion (68%) of athletes indicated a desire for professional mental health support to manage these stressors, yet reported barriers including stigma, lack of awareness of available resources, and financial constraints.

**Conclusion:** The exceptionally high prevalence of stress in this population underscores the urgent need for integrated mental health support within high school athletic programs.  Future interventions should focus on destigmatizing mental health care, increasing athlete awareness of available resources, and providing accessible, evidence-based psychological support services. Addressing these factors is crucial for promoting athlete well-being and optimizing performance outcomes.
