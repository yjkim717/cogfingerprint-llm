Title: Assessing the Mental Health Needs of High School Athletes: A Cross-Sectional Study on Stress Management and Support Accessibility

Abstract:

High school athletes are increasingly recognized as a vulnerable population in the context of mental health, with the pressures of competitive sports exacerbating adolescent stress. This cross-sectional study, conducted in 2023, investigates the prevalence of stress among high school athletes and their utilization of mental health support services. A sample of 200 high school athletes participated in the study, revealing that 91% reported experiencing stress directly attributable to their involvement in sports. Notably, despite the high prevalence of stress, a significant proportion of athletes expressed a desire for professional help, which remained largely unmet. The findings underscore the imperative for accessible and tailored mental health support services within the sports psychology framework. The study's results highlight the need for stakeholders, including coaches, educators, and mental health professionals, to collaborate in developing targeted interventions that address the unique stressors faced by high school athletes. Furthermore, the study suggests that integrating sports psychologists into school athletic programs could enhance support accessibility and promote a culture of mental health awareness among young athletes. The outcomes of this research contribute to the growing body of evidence emphasizing the importance of prioritizing mental health in adolescent athletes, informing policy and practice in sports psychology and adolescent mental health. Ultimately, this study advocates for a proactive approach to mitigating the mental health risks associated with competitive sports participation among high school athletes.
