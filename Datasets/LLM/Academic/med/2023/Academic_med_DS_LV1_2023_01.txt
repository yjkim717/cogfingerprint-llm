**Title:** Prevalence and Correlates of Unmet Mental Health Needs Among Adolescent Athletes: A Cross-Sectional Analysis

**Abstract:**

**Background:** The unique biopsychosocial demands placed on adolescent athletes create a high-risk environment for mental distress, yet the prevalence of unmet needs for psychological support within this cohort remains inadequately characterized. **Objective:** This 2023 cross-sectional study aimed to quantify the prevalence of sports-related stress and evaluate the discrepancy between the perceived need for and actual utilization of mental health services among competitive high school athletes. **Methods:** A stratified sample of 1,200 high school athletes across diverse sports completed validated psychometric scales assessing perceived stress, anxiety, and help-seeking behaviors. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression to identify predictors of service non-utilization. **Results:** Analysis revealed a striking 91% prevalence of clinically significant, sports-attributable stress. A substantial majority (78%) concurrently endorsed the belief that psychological intervention would be beneficial for their well-being and performance. However, a significant treatment gap was identified, with only 22% of these individuals having accessed a qualified mental health professional. Regression models indicated that stigma, perceived time constraints, and lack of accessible, sport-integrated resources were significant barriers to care (p < .01). **Conclusion:** Findings indicate a critical public health disparity, wherein a near-universal experience of stress among adolescent athletes is met with a profound lack of professional support, despite positive treatment beliefs. This underscores an urgent need for systemic interventions to destigmatize and integrate mental healthcare within scholastic athletic infrastructures.
