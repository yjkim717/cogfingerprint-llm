**Abstract**

The accurate and automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors is paramount for effective clinical management and the advancement of therapeutic trials. This study investigates the performance of segmentation algorithms within the context of the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge, a benchmark designed to evaluate methodologies applied to multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) data. Specifically, the focus lies on the segmentation of pediatric gliomas, a prevalent and heterogeneous group of brain tumors affecting children. Utilizing a diverse dataset of mpMRI scans, participating algorithms were assessed based on established volumetric segmentation metrics, including Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance.  The challenge’s objective is to foster innovation and promote the development of robust, clinically-viable tools for delineating tumor volumes with enhanced precision. Improved segmentation fidelity directly translates to more accurate treatment planning, enhanced monitoring of tumor response, and ultimately, optimized patient outcomes.  The findings from BraTS-PEDs 2023 will contribute significantly to the ongoing efforts to refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for pediatric glioma patients.
