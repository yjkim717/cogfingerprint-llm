**Abstract**

The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs), notably ChatGPT, presents a novel and potentially transformative opportunity within healthcare education. This study investigates the efficacy and inherent limitations of utilizing ChatGPT across medical, dental, pharmacy, and public health curricula.  Our research explored the utility of this artificial intelligence (AI) tool as a supplementary learning resource, focusing specifically on the role of prompt engineering in maximizing its pedagogical value. 

Preliminary findings indicate that ChatGPT demonstrates considerable promise in facilitating formative assessment, generating case studies for clinical reasoning practice, and providing immediate feedback on student responses. However, significant concerns regarding accuracy, potential for bias embedded within the model’s training data, and the risk of over-reliance on AI-generated content were identified.  Specifically, the study highlights the critical need for robust validation of ChatGPT’s responses within a clinical context and emphasizes the importance of explicitly teaching students critical evaluation skills when employing such tools. 

Furthermore, we examined the impact of varying prompt structures on the quality and relevance of ChatGPT’s outputs, suggesting that carefully designed prompts, incorporating specific learning objectives and constraints, are paramount to achieving desired educational outcomes.  Future research should prioritize the development of standardized evaluation metrics and explore the ethical implications of integrating LLMs into medical education, ensuring responsible and effective utilization to augment, rather than replace, traditional pedagogical approaches.
