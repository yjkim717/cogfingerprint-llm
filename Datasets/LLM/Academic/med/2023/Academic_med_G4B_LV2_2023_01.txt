**Prevalence and Psychological Distress in High School Athletes: Implications for Healthcare Access**

This study investigated the prevalence of stress and associated mental health challenges within a cohort of high school athletes, revealing a significant burden of psychological distress. Findings indicate that approximately 91% of participants reported experiencing stress directly related to their participation in competitive sports.  A primary driver of this stress was identified as heightened fear of failure, frequently manifesting as performance anxiety and contributing to a demonstrable impact on overall well-being.  

The research underscores a critical gap in current healthcare provision for young athletes.  The widespread experience of stress necessitates a proactive and accessible mental health support system.  Specifically, the study highlights the urgent need for integrated medical services tailored to the unique pressures faced by this population.  Further investigation is warranted to explore the nuanced relationship between stress, athletic performance, and the prevalence of anxiety disorders within high school athletes.  Recommendations include implementing standardized screening protocols, promoting mental health literacy among athletes and coaching staff, and advocating for increased access to qualified mental health professionals within school-based healthcare settings.  These interventions are crucial for mitigating negative psychological outcomes and optimizing athletic potential.
