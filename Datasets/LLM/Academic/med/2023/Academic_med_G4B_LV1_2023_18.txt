**Abstract**

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines represent a cornerstone of evidence-based practice in oncology. This report details significant revisions to the 2023 NCCN Guidelines for metastatic breast cancer (m1 disease), specifically concerning systemic therapy regimens. Recent updates emphasize a refined approach to initial treatment strategies for Stage IV breast cancer, acknowledging the evolving landscape of targeted therapies and immunotherapies.  Recommendations now incorporate more granular stratification based on biomarker status and tumor evolution, alongside expanded utilization of endocrine therapy combinations.  Furthermore, the document clarifies optimal sequencing of chemotherapy and novel agents.  Adherence to these updated NCCN guidelines is crucial for ensuring patients with Stage IV breast cancer receive optimal, individualized care and improved clinical outcomes.
