## Advancing Pediatric Brain Tumor Segmentation: The CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs 2023 Challenge

**Abstract:** Accurate and automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors remains a critical challenge in neuro-oncology, directly impacting treatment planning, prognosis assessment, and longitudinal monitoring. This work introduces the CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge, a novel initiative designed to benchmark and accelerate advancements in this field. Building upon the established Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) framework, BraTS-PEDs specifically focuses on the complexities of pediatric brain tumor imaging, incorporating multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) data – including T1-weighted, T1-contrast-enhanced, T2-weighted, and FLAIR sequences – from a diverse cohort of pediatric patients. 

The challenge provides a standardized dataset and evaluation protocols, emphasizing the segmentation of key tumor components: edema, tumor core, and enhancing tumor. Participants are tasked with developing and refining algorithms capable of robustly delineating these structures, accounting for the inherent anatomical and imaging variability present in pediatric populations.  Performance is rigorously assessed using standard metrics like Dice score, sensitivity, and specificity, fostering a competitive environment for algorithm development. This initiative seeks to drive innovation in deep learning, machine learning, and other computational approaches, ultimately translating to improved clinical workflows and enhanced patient outcomes in the management of pediatric glioma and other brain neoplasms.  The results of the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge will provide valuable insights into the current state-of-the-art and identify future research directions in pediatric brain tumor segmentation.
