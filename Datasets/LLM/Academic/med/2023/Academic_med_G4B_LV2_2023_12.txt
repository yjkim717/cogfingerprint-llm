**Abstract**

The escalating prevalence of obesity necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of long-term treatment strategies. This review synthesizes current evidence regarding the sustained outcomes following metabolic and bariatric surgical interventions, focusing on the evolving landscape of obesity management within 2023. While bariatric surgery represents a significant advancement in obesity treatment, offering substantial weight loss and improvements in associated comorbid conditions – including type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia – it is crucial to acknowledge potential long-term complications. 

Specifically, this analysis explores the durability of these therapeutic benefits, examining rates of weight regain, nutrient deficiencies, and the emergence of new health challenges. Furthermore, the importance of diligent, extended postoperative patient follow-up, incorporating both medical and psychological support, is underscored.  The review posits that a holistic approach, integrating surgical intervention with comprehensive lifestyle modifications, is paramount for optimizing long-term success.  Ultimately, this paper advocates for a nuanced understanding of the risks and rewards associated with metabolic and bariatric surgery to inform individualized treatment decisions and improve patient well-being.
