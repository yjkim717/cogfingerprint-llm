**Abstract**

Accurate interpretation of plasma biomarkers in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is currently hampered by a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding biological variation. This study, conducted in 2023, addresses this critical gap by examining the inherent variability within AD-associated plasma biomarkers and its implications for individual patient data analysis. We highlight the need for robust methodologies to account for pre-analytical and analytical factors contributing to biological variation. Improved characterization of these variances is essential for enhancing the clinical utility of blood-based biomarkers in AD diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring treatment response, ultimately facilitating more personalized and effective patient management strategies.
