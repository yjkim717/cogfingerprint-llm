**Abstract**

The escalating incidence of esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers (EGJ cancers) necessitates refined therapeutic strategies, particularly in the context of recurrent or metastatic disease.  This report examines the 2023 NCCN guidelines, which prioritize systemic therapy as the cornerstone of management.  Central to these recommendations is the integration of comprehensive biomarker testing – including PD-L1 expression and microsatellite instability (MSI) status – to inform targeted therapy selection.  Specifically, the guidelines advocate for the utilization of agents demonstrating efficacy in these patient populations. Furthermore, a multidisciplinary team approach, encompassing medical oncology, radiation oncology, and surgical specialists, is underscored to optimize treatment sequencing and minimize treatment-related toxicities.  Ultimately, adherence to these updated NCCN guidelines aims to improve patient survival and enhance quality of life for individuals diagnosed with advanced esophageal and EGJ cancers, reflecting a shift towards precision medicine in oncology.
