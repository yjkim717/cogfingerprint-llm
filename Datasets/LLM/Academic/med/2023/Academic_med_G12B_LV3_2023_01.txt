**Abstract**

Recent investigations into the psychological well-being of adolescent athletes underscore a significant public health concern. A cross-sectional study conducted in 2023 assessed stress levels among 200 high school athletes, revealing a prevalence of sport-related stress affecting 91% of the cohort. Qualitative analysis identified a pervasive fear of failure as a primary etiological factor. These findings suggest a critical need for proactive mental health interventions tailored to the unique pressures faced by young athletes. Failure to address this pervasive stress may contribute to the development of anxiety and depressive disorders, potentially impacting both athletic performance and long-term psychological health. This research advocates for increased accessibility to mental health resources within athletic programs and schools, emphasizing preventative strategies to mitigate adverse outcomes and promote holistic athlete well-being.
