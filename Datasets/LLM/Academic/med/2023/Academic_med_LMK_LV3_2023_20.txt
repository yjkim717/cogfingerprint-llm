Title: Revisiting HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer: Implications of Updated ASCO-CAP Guidelines and Emerging Therapeutic Paradigms

Abstract:

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) have released updated guidelines for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer, reaffirming the 2018 recommendations while acknowledging the evolving therapeutic landscape. This update is particularly significant in light of the recent approval of trastuzumab deruxtecan, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that has shown remarkable efficacy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The updated guidelines underscore the importance of accurate and reliable HER2 testing in identifying patients who may benefit from trastuzumab deruxtecan and other HER2-targeted therapies.

The ASCO-CAP guidelines emphasize the need for standardized HER2 testing protocols, including immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment selection. The updated guidelines also acknowledge the emergence of novel therapeutic strategies, including ADCs like trastuzumab deruxtecan, which have expanded treatment options for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. By providing a framework for HER2 testing and interpretation, the updated guidelines aim to optimize patient selection for HER2-targeted therapies and improve treatment outcomes.

The introduction of trastuzumab deruxtecan has marked a significant shift in the treatment paradigm for HER2-positive breast cancer, offering a new therapeutic option for patients who have progressed on or after previous HER2-targeted therapies. As the therapeutic landscape continues to evolve, the updated ASCO-CAP guidelines provide a timely and important framework for clinicians and pathologists to navigate the complexities of HER2 testing and treatment selection. By ensuring accurate and reliable HER2 testing, clinicians can optimize patient care and improve treatment outcomes in this rapidly changing field. As the management of breast cancer continues to advance, the updated guidelines will play a critical role in shaping clinical practice and informing future research directions.
