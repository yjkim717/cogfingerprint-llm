**Title:** The Double-Edged Scalpel: Evaluating the Impact of Large Language Models like ChatGPT on Personalized Healthcare Education and Clinical Reasoning Acuity

**Year:** 2023

The rapid integration of large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, into medical pedagogy presents a paradigm shift with significant, yet ambivalent, implications. This 2023 analytical review critically examines the dualistic impact of these artificial intelligence platforms, focusing on their potential to foster personalized learning against their capacity to inadvertently erode foundational clinical reasoning skills. We posit that while LLMs offer an unprecedented capacity for generating dynamic, adaptive educational content—tailoring explanations of complex pathophysiological mechanisms or generating bespoke clinical vignettes—this very utility harbors inherent risks. The core of the dilemma lies in the model's operational mechanics: its ability to provide immediate, synthesized answers can circumvent the essential cognitive processes of hypothesis generation, differential diagnosis formulation, and iterative knowledge refinement that are central to developing diagnostic acumen. This can lead to a phenomenon we term "cognitive offloading," where the learner's engagement with the material becomes passive, potentially resulting in a measurable deterioration of critical thinking and metacognitive self-regulation. Furthermore, the persistent challenge of algorithmic hallucination and the generation of plausible but factually inaccurate content poses a direct threat to knowledge integrity and patient safety. Consequently, this analysis argues that the responsible assimilation of LLMs into healthcare curricula is contingent upon the development of robust pedagogical frameworks. These must explicitly train students in the critical appraisal of AI-generated content and strategically deploy these tools not as primary sources of knowledge, but as adjuncts to stimulate, rather than supplant, the complex, effortful cognitive processes that underpin expert clinical judgment. The future of medical education hinges on navigating this dichotomy to harness the power of AI without compromising the intellectual rigor essential to the profession.
