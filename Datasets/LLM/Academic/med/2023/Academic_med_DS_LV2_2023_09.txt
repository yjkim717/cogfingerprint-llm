**Abstract**

The high rate of late-stage failure in pharmaceutical development underscores a critical need for improved target validation. This review synthesizes evidence supporting the application of Mendelian randomization (MR) as a pivotal methodology for de-risking this process. MR leverages naturally occurring genetic variants that mimic the pharmacological modulation of a drug target, thereby providing a robust framework for inferring causal relationships between a target and a disease outcome. We delineate how genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide the requisite genetic instruments for these analyses, enabling the identification of novel therapeutic targets and the prioritization of existing ones. Furthermore, we discuss how MR can predict on-target efficacy and potential adverse effects by examining the lifelong "exposure" to genetic proxies. The integration of human genetic data through MR represents a paradigm shift, moving drug development away from targets with only correlative support toward those with a genetically validated, causal link to disease, thereby enhancing the probability of clinical success.
