**Evolving HER2 Testing Strategies in Breast Cancer: Re-evaluating the Clinical Significance of Heterogeneous Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Results in the Era of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan**

**Abstract**

The landscape of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer treatment has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), particularly trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). While established guidelines from organizations like the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) currently dictate HER2 testing methodologies, the increasing clinical efficacy observed with T-DXd in patients with traditionally considered “low” HER2 expression (IHC 0 or 1+) necessitates a re-evaluation of these practices. This review synthesizes current data and examines the implications of applying existing HER2 testing algorithms to patients exhibiting heterogeneous IHC results, specifically focusing on the IHC 0 and 1+ staining patterns.  Emerging evidence suggests that a subset of patients with IHC 0 or 1+ tumors, particularly those demonstrating HER2-amplification via *in situ* hybridization (ISH), may derive substantial benefit from T-DXd therapy. Maintaining strict adherence to historical IHC cutoffs risks denying potentially effective treatment to this vulnerable population. We propose that clinicians and pathologists engage in collaborative discussions regarding assay standardization, the interpretation of heterogeneous results, and the potential utility of incorporating ISH confirmation in select cases of IHC 0 or 1+ expression.  Future research should prioritize the development of refined HER2 assessment strategies incorporating both IHC and ISH, alongside predictive biomarkers, to optimize patient selection and ensure the appropriate application of T-DXd in the evolving breast cancer treatment paradigm.

*   **Specific Clinical Trial Data:** Cite specific trials (e.g., DESTINY-Breast03) that demonstrate the benefit of T-DXd in IHC 0/1+ populations.
*   **Heterogeneity & Tumor Microenvironment:** Briefly discuss the role of tumor heterogeneity and the influence of the tumor microenvironment on HER2 expression and T-DXd response.
*   **ISH Techniques:** Specify the ISH methodologies (e.g., FISH, DCP) and their nuances in assessing HER2 amplification.
*   **Standardization Challenges:** Expand on the challenges in standardizing IHC assays across different laboratories.
*   **Future Biomarkers:** Mention potential future biomarkers beyond HER2 amplification that could predict response to T-DXd.
