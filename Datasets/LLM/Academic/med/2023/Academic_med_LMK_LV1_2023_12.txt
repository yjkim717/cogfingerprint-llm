Title: Evaluating Long-Term Outcomes of Metabolic/Bariatric Surgery in Obesity Treatment: A Critical Review

Abstract:

Metabolic/bariatric surgery has emerged as an efficacious treatment modality for obesity, yielding substantial weight loss and significant improvements in obesity-related comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes. However, the durability of these outcomes and the potential for postoperative complications necessitate longitudinal follow-up. This review synthesizes current evidence on the long-term outcomes of metabolic/bariatric surgery, with a particular emphasis on weight loss maintenance, glycemic control, and complication mitigation. A comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that, while metabolic/bariatric surgery is associated with sustained weight loss and improved metabolic profiles, lifelong surveillance is required to prevent and manage potential complications, such as micronutrient deficiencies and gastrointestinal disorders. The findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to postoperative care, highlighting the need for continued research into optimizing long-term outcomes in this patient population. As the prevalence of obesity continues to rise, elucidating the long-term efficacy of metabolic/bariatric surgery remains crucial in 2023.
