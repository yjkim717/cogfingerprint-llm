Title: Revisiting HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer: Implications of Updated ASCO-CAP Guidelines on Antibody-Drug Conjugate Therapy


#### Abstract

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) periodically update guidelines for HER2 testing in breast cancer to incorporate emerging evidence and novel therapeutic strategies. The recent updates, released in 2023, reflect the expanding role of HER2-targeted therapies, particularly with the advent of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) such as trastuzumab deruxtecan. This review examines the implications of the revised ASCO-CAP guidelines on HER2 testing and its impact on the management of breast cancer patients eligible for ADC therapy.


The updated guidelines emphasize the importance of accurate HER2 status determination through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or in situ hybridization (ISH). The revisions are largely driven by clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2-positive and certain HER2-low breast cancers, previously considered HER2-negative. The expanded indication for trastuzumab deruxtecan necessitates a more nuanced understanding of HER2 expression levels, as patients with low HER2 expression (IHC 1+ or 2+ without ISH positivity) may now be considered candidates for this therapy.

The ASCO-CAP updates provide clear guidance on HER2 testing algorithms, emphasizing the use of validated IHC assays and ISH techniques to accurately categorize HER2 status. The guidelines also address the issue of HER2 heterogeneity within tumors, recommending careful consideration of tumor sampling and interpretation of test results. Furthermore, the updates highlight the need for laboratories to adhere to stringent quality assurance and quality control measures to ensure the reliability of HER2 testing.

The revised guidelines have significant implications for clinical practice, as accurate HER2 testing will be critical in identifying patients who may benefit from trastuzumab deruxtecan and other emerging HER2-targeted ADCs. The updates underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between pathologists, oncologists, and surgeons to ensure that patients receive optimal care based on their tumor's HER2 status. As the therapeutic landscape for breast cancer continues to evolve, adherence to the updated ASCO-CAP guidelines will be essential for providing high-quality, evidence-based care to patients with HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancers.
