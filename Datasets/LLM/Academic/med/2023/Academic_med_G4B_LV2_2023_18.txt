**Abstract**

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines represent a cornerstone of evidence-based clinical practice for breast cancer management. This report synthesizes recent revisions to the NCCN Guidelines pertaining specifically to Stage IV metastatic breast cancer, published in 2023.  Emphasis is placed on evolving systemic therapy recommendations, reflecting advancements in targeted therapies and immunotherapy. Current guidelines increasingly prioritize biomarker-driven approaches, advocating for genomic profiling to inform treatment decisions.  Specifically, the updated recommendations delineate preferred regimens for patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease, alongside strategies for those with triple-negative breast cancer.  Furthermore, the document addresses considerations for managing treatment-related toxicities and incorporates strategies for palliative care integration.  Continued adherence to these evolving NCCN guidelines is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and ensuring consistent, high-quality care for individuals diagnosed with Stage IV breast cancer.
