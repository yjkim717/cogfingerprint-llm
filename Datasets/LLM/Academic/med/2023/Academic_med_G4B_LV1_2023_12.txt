**Abstract**

The escalating prevalence of obesity necessitates comprehensive evaluation of long-term surgical interventions. This study investigates the sustained impact of metabolic and bariatric surgery on patient outcomes, focusing on weight management and associated comorbid conditions. Utilizing a retrospective cohort analysis of patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy between 2018 and 2022, we assessed weight loss trajectories, glycemic control (HbA1c), lipid profiles, and blood pressure over a five-year period. Preliminary findings indicate significant and durable weight reduction in both surgical groups, alongside marked improvements in metabolic health markers. However, a notable proportion of patients experienced postoperative complications including nutritional deficiencies and gallstone formation, requiring ongoing monitoring and multidisciplinary management.  Further research is crucial to refine patient selection criteria and optimize surgical techniques to maximize long-term benefits while mitigating potential adverse effects, ultimately informing evidence-based clinical decision-making regarding bariatric interventions for obesity and its associated comorbidities.
