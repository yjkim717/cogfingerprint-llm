**Abstract**

Anal carcinoma management has undergone a significant refinement with the publication of the 2023 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. These guidelines advocate for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary strategy, prioritizing tailored treatment regimens dictated by AJCC staging and disease characteristics. Notably, chemoradiation remains a cornerstone of therapy, particularly for localized and regionally advanced disease. However, the guidelines increasingly incorporate systemic therapies, reflecting advancements in oncology.  The management of metastatic anal carcinoma is specifically addressed, emphasizing the role of agents targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other relevant pathways.  Careful consideration of patient comorbidities and performance status is underscored.  Further, adherence to NCCN recommendations facilitates standardized care and aims to optimize patient outcomes. Continued research evaluating the efficacy of novel systemic agents in combination with chemoradiation is warranted to refine treatment protocols for all stages of this challenging malignancy.
