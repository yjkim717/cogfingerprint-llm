**Abstract**

The accurate and timely identification of amyloid pathology is crucial for risk stratification in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and predicting the progression to Alzheimer’s disease. Traditional amyloid imaging techniques, such as PET scans, are expensive and logistically challenging. This study introduces a novel, two-step approach utilizing plasma p-tau217 as a readily accessible biomarker to efficiently screen for amyloid β positivity in MCI patients.  We demonstrate that measuring plasma p-tau217 – a phosphorylated form of the amyloid β peptide – can serve as a sensitive initial screening tool.  Elevated levels of p-tau217 demonstrate a strong correlation with amyloid deposition, effectively reducing the demand for subsequent, more resource-intensive confirmatory assays, including cerebrospinal fluid analysis or amyloid PET imaging.  Preliminary data from a cohort of MCI patients indicate a high level of agreement between plasma p-tau217 and established amyloid biomarkers. These findings suggest that a p-tau217-based workflow represents a viable strategy for optimizing clinical management and facilitating early intervention in individuals at risk for neurodegenerative disease. Further validation in larger, prospective studies is warranted.
