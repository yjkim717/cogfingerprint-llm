Title: Long-term Outcomes of Metabolic/Bariatric Surgery in Obesity Treatment: A Comprehensive Review

Abstract:
Metabolic/bariatric surgery has emerged as a highly effective treatment modality for obesity, yielding substantial weight loss and significant improvements in obesity-related comorbid conditions. As the prevalence of obesity continues to escalate globally, the importance of evaluating the long-term outcomes of surgical interventions has become increasingly paramount. This comprehensive review examines the current evidence on the efficacy of metabolic/bariatric surgery in achieving sustained weight loss and mitigating comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The findings underscore the necessity of lifelong follow-up to monitor and manage potential complications, including nutritional deficiencies and metabolic disorders. By synthesizing existing research, this review provides a nuanced understanding of the benefits and challenges associated with metabolic/bariatric surgery, informing clinical practice and policy development in obesity treatment as of 2023.
