Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a medical journal publication, based on your provided keywords and summary, and framed within a 2023 context. I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and a tone appropriate for the field.  I've also included a few potential areas for expansion if you want to provide more detail.

**Abstract**

**Evolving Management Strategies for Recurrent and Metastatic Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers: An Update Informed by Biomarker Testing and Multidisciplinary Collaboration (2023)**

The management of recurrent or metastatic esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancers presents a significant clinical challenge. This abstract summarizes key updates to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, reflecting advancements in targeted therapies and a reinforced emphasis on multidisciplinary care approaches as of 2023. Historically, treatment options for advanced disease have been limited, primarily relying on palliative chemotherapy regimens. However, increasing understanding of the molecular drivers underlying both squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma subtypes has facilitated the development and integration of targeted agents and immunotherapies.

This guideline update highlights the critical role of comprehensive biomarker testing, including but not limited to PD-L1 expression, microsatellite instability (MSI), and tumor mutational burden (TMB), to guide treatment selection.  Stratification of patients based on these biomarkers informs the potential for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and other targeted therapies. Furthermore, the guidelines underscore the importance of collaborative decision-making involving medical oncology, surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and gastroenterology, ensuring a patient-centered approach to therapeutic planning. Novel combination strategies, incorporating targeted agents with chemotherapy or immunotherapy, are increasingly considered within the framework of clinical trial data. Finally, the abstract acknowledges the ongoing need for research evaluating predictive biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets to improve outcomes for patients with these aggressive malignancies.

**Notes & Potential Expansion Points:**

*   **Specific Biomarkers:** I've mentioned a few common biomarkers. If the NCCN update emphasizes specific emerging biomarkers, those should be included.
*   **Specific Targeted Therapies:** If the update highlights specific drugs or drug classes, adding those would strengthen the abstract. (e.g., "incorporating EGFR inhibitors...")
*   **Clinical Trial Data:** Referencing key trials that influenced the update would add significant weight.
*   **Quality of Life:** Mentioning consideration of quality of life in treatment decisions aligns with modern oncology practice.
