Title: Revisiting HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer: Implications of Updated ASCO-CAP Guidelines and Emerging Therapies


#### Abstract

The American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) has released an update to their guidelines for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer, reaffirming the core recommendations established in 2018. This revision acknowledges the evolving landscape of HER2-targeted therapies, notably the advent of trastuzumab deruxtecan, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that has demonstrated significant efficacy in patients with HER2-positive and certain HER2-low breast cancers. The updated guidelines underscore the continued importance of accurate HER2 status determination in guiding treatment decisions, particularly with the expanding therapeutic options for patients with HER2-altered tumors.


The ASCO-CAP update reflects a nuanced understanding of HER2 testing, incorporating insights from recent clinical trials and emerging data on ADCs. Trastuzumab deruxtecan, with its innovative mechanism of action and bystander effect, has shown remarkable activity across a spectrum of HER2 expression levels, challenging traditional binary categorizations of HER2 status. Consequently, the revised guidelines emphasize the need for precise and standardized HER2 testing methodologies to inform treatment eligibility, especially for therapies like trastuzumab deruxtecan that have broadened the therapeutic landscape for patients with HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer.

The implications of these updated guidelines are multifaceted. Firstly, they reinforce the critical role of pathology in oncology, highlighting the need for rigorous quality assurance and control in HER2 testing to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Secondly, they underscore the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between pathologists, oncologists, and researchers in navigating the complexities of HER2-targeted therapy. Lastly, the recognition of trastuzumab deruxtecan and other ADCs within the guidelines signals a shift towards more personalized and targeted therapeutic strategies, potentially redefining treatment paradigms for breast cancer patients with varying levels of HER2 expression.

As the therapeutic landscape for HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer continues to evolve, the 2023 ASCO-CAP guidelines provide a timely and evidence-based framework for clinicians and researchers. By integrating the latest evidence on HER2 testing and targeted therapies, these guidelines are poised to enhance patient outcomes and inform future research directions in the realm of precision oncology.
