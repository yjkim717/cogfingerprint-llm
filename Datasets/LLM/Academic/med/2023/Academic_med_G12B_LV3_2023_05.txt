**Abstract**

Contemporary management of anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASC) increasingly relies on adherence to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines. This review examines the evolving therapeutic landscape for ASC, particularly concerning patients with metastatic disease, as reflected in the 2023 NCCN updates. The guidelines underscore a multidisciplinary strategy integrating definitive chemoradiation, surgical resection, and, critically, systemic therapies. Recent revisions incorporate the 8th edition of the AJCC staging system, enabling more precise risk stratification and personalized treatment planning. Furthermore, the expanding role of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies demonstrates a shift towards improved outcomes in patients with distant metastases, necessitating ongoing research to optimize sequencing and combination regimens within the NCCN framework.
