Title: Exploring Stress Management in High School Athletes: Prevalence, Impact, and Help-Seeking Behaviors

Abstract:

High school athletes are a unique population that faces a multitude of stressors, including academic pressures, social expectations, and sports-related demands. The confluence of these stressors can have a profound impact on their mental health and overall well-being. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and impact of stress experienced by high school athletes, as well as their attitudes towards seeking professional help for stress management.

A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis methods. A sample of 250 high school athletes completed a standardized stress assessment questionnaire, while 20 athletes participated in semi-structured interviews to provide in-depth insights into their stress experiences.

The results revealed a high prevalence of stress among high school athletes, with 75% of participants reporting moderate to severe stress levels. Sports-related stressors, such as competition anxiety and injury concerns, were identified as significant contributors to overall stress. Moreover, the qualitative findings highlighted the impact of stress on athletes' mental health, including symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Despite the high prevalence of stress, a significant proportion of athletes (60%) reported being unlikely to seek professional help for stress management, citing stigma and lack of access to resources as major barriers. The findings underscore the need for evidence-based stress management interventions tailored to the unique needs of high school athletes. By promoting athlete mental health and well-being, we can optimize their performance and overall quality of life. This study contributes to the growing body of research on athlete mental health and highlights the importance of addressing stress management in this population.
