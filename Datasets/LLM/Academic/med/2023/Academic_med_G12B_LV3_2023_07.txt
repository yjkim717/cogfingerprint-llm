**Abstract**

The treatment landscape for low-grade gliomas harboring *IDH1* or *IDH2* mutations has undergone a significant advancement with the recent publication of data from a pivotal phase 3 clinical trial evaluating vorasidenib. This study, completed in 2023, demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) in patients diagnosed with IDH1- or IDH2-mutant grade 2 gliomas treated with vorasidenib compared to placebo. Vorasidenib, an oral selective inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2), targets the metabolic dysregulation characteristic of these tumors. The observed benefit extends beyond PFS, with a notable delay in the need for subsequent anticancer interventions, including surgical resection and systemic chemotherapy. These findings suggest that vorasidenib represents a meaningful therapeutic option for patients with this historically challenging malignancy, potentially altering standard of care. Further investigation is warranted to assess the long-term efficacy and safety profile of vorasidenib, as well as to identify predictive biomarkers that may stratify patients most likely to benefit from this targeted therapy. The implications of this trial extend to the broader field of precision oncology, highlighting the potential of metabolic targeting in glioma management.
