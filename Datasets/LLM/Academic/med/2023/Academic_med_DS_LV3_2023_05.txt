The 2023 clinical management paradigm for squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) is fundamentally characterized by a consolidated, multidisciplinary approach. This strategy is codified in the latest National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, which establish definitive chemoradiation as the cornerstone of primary, non-metastatic disease management. A critical update in this therapeutic framework is the mandatory adoption of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 9th edition staging system, which refines prognostic stratification and enhances the precision of treatment allocation. For patients presenting with or progressing to metastatic disease, the guidelines delineate a structured algorithm for systemic therapy, underscoring the integration of novel agents and personalized treatment sequences. This evolution in management reflects a concerted effort to optimize oncologic outcomes through standardized, evidence-based protocols that harmonize local control with systemic efficacy, thereby addressing the complex pathobiology of SCCA through a unified clinical pathway.
