The 2023 iteration of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers represents a paradigm shift towards precision oncology, fundamentally anchored by rigorous histological subtyping. The critical distinction between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) dictates subsequent diagnostic and therapeutic pathways. For patients with recurrent or metastatic disease, comprehensive biomarker testing is now a mandatory standard, enabling the stratification for targeted therapies against actionable molecular alterations such as HER2 amplification, PD-L1 expression, and microsatellite instability. This biomarker-driven approach necessitates a deeply integrated, multidisciplinary management model, coordinating medical, radiation, and surgical oncology with specialized pathology and gastroenterology. The guidelines underscore that this tailored strategy, moving beyond a one-size-fits-all chemotherapeutic regimen, is pivotal for optimizing clinical outcomes, including progression-free survival and overall response rates. Consequently, the contemporary management of advanced esophageal malignancies is characterized by an initial, precise histopathological diagnosis followed by systematic molecular profiling to guide targeted intervention within a collaborative care framework.
