Title: Investigating Stress Prevalence and Coping Mechanisms among High School Athletes: A Cross-Sectional Study

Abstract:

The mental health of high school athletes has garnered significant attention in recent years, with sports-related stress emerging as a pressing concern. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of stress among high school athletes and explore their coping mechanisms. A cross-sectional design was employed, surveying 250 high school athletes (mean age: 16.4 Â± 1.2 years) from 15 schools in the United States. The Athlete Stress Questionnaire (ASQ) and the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) were utilized to assess stress levels and coping strategies, respectively. Results indicated that 70.4% of participants reported moderate to high levels of stress, with 45.6% experiencing stress-related symptoms such as anxiety and depression. The primary sources of stress were competition-related (64.8%), followed by academic pressures (21.2%) and coach-athlete relationships (10.4%). Athletes predominantly employed emotion-focused coping strategies (55.2%), while task-oriented coping was less common (30.4%). Notably, athletes with access to sports psychologists or mental health professionals reported significantly lower stress levels (p < 0.01) and more effective coping mechanisms (p < 0.05). The findings underscore the need for increased access to medical professionals trained in stress management and athlete mental health. Implementing evidence-based interventions and providing resources for stress management may mitigate the negative impacts of sports-related stress on high school athletes' mental health and overall well-being. As such, this study highlights the imperative for schools and sports organizations to prioritize athlete mental health support.
