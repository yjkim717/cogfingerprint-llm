**Abstract**

The timely and accurate identification of individuals at elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a critical priority in the face of an aging global population and the increasing availability of disease-modifying therapies. Traditional diagnostic workflows for AD often rely on costly and invasive procedures, including amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET) scans or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker analysis, limiting their accessibility and scalability for widespread screening. Recent advances in ultra-sensitive immunoassay technology have enabled the quantification of phosphorylated tau protein at position 217 (p-tau217) in plasma, exhibiting remarkable correlation with Aβ pathology in the brain [1]. This study investigates a novel two-step screening workflow integrating plasma p-tau217 as a primary indicator of Aβ burden, with the aim of optimizing resource allocation and minimizing the need for confirmatory Aβ imaging or CSF analysis.

We retrospectively analyzed data from [Number] participants enrolled in the [Study Name] cohort, a longitudinal observational study investigating biomarkers of AD. Participants underwent plasma p-tau217 measurement, followed by Aβ PET imaging (using [Radiotracer]) in a subset deemed p-tau217-positive. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine optimal p-tau217 cut-off values for predicting Aβ PET positivity. Furthermore, we assessed the incremental diagnostic value of p-tau217 compared to established cognitive assessments (e.g., Mini-Mental State Examination, Montreal Cognitive Assessment) in identifying individuals with evidence of Aβ pathology.

Our findings demonstrate that a p-tau217 concentration exceeding [Cut-off Value] accurately predicted Aβ PET positivity with a [AUC Value] area under the ROC curve.  This approach resulted in a [Percentage]% reduction in the number of participants requiring confirmatory Aβ PET imaging. Moreover, p-tau217 demonstrated a significant incremental diagnostic value beyond standard cognitive assessments in predicting Aβ pathology, suggesting its potential to refine risk stratification in individuals with mild cognitive impairment or early AD.  These results support the implementation of plasma p-tau217 as a valuable screening tool for Aβ positivity, offering a less invasive, more accessible, and potentially more cost-effective strategy for identifying individuals who may benefit from further diagnostic evaluation and participation in clinical trials [2]. Future research will focus on validating this two-step workflow in prospective cohorts and evaluating its utility in diverse populations.
