## Evolving Systemic Therapy Strategies in Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer: A Review Informed by 2023 NCCN Guideline Updates

**Abstract:** The management of stage IV (M1) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains a significant clinical challenge, necessitating ongoing refinement of systemic therapy approaches. This review examines recent modifications to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines (2023 version) concerning systemic treatment recommendations for patients with MBC. Emphasis is placed on the integration of targeted therapies, including cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted agents, within first-line and subsequent treatment regimens. Furthermore, we discuss the evolving role of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and immunotherapy in specific molecular subtypes. The updated NCCN guidelines underscore a personalized approach, considering disease characteristics, performance status, and patient preferences to optimize therapeutic efficacy and quality of life. This review aims to provide clinicians with a concise overview of these crucial updates, facilitating informed decision-making in the complex landscape of MBC treatment.
