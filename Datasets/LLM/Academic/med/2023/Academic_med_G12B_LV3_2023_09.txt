ml: Mendelian randomization (MR) has emerged as a powerful tool in translational medicine, offering a novel approach to bolster drug development pipelines. This review examines the burgeoning application of MR, utilizing human genetic variation as an instrumental variable to assess the causal relationship between modifiable risk factors and disease outcomes, thereby facilitating therapeutic target identification. Traditional drug development faces challenges in establishing causality, often hampered by confounding and reverse causation. MR circumvents these limitations by exploiting naturally occurring genetic variants associated with modifiable exposures, mimicking a randomized controlled trial. We discuss the methodological considerations inherent in MR analyses, including selection of appropriate genetic instruments, assessment of pleiotropy, and interpretation of results within the context of complex disease etiologies. Furthermore, we highlight recent successes and ongoing challenges in applying MR to validate drug targets across various therapeutic areas and predict clinical trial efficacy, ultimately aiming to improve the efficiency and success rate of drug development in 2023 and beyond.
