Title: Advancements in the Management of Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers: A Paradigm Shift towards Targeted Therapies

Abstract:
The management of esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers has undergone a significant transformation with the advent of targeted therapies and biomarker testing. As emphasized by the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines, a multidisciplinary team approach is crucial in optimizing patient outcomes. The integration of targeted therapies has improved treatment modalities, enabling personalized medicine based on specific molecular profiles. Biomarker testing has emerged as a critical component in identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from these therapies. Furthermore, palliative management has become an essential aspect of comprehensive care, focusing on enhancing the quality of life for patients with advanced disease. This review highlights the current landscape of targeted therapies and biomarker testing in esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers, underscoring their role in shaping modern oncological practice.
