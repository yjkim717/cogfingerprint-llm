**Abstract**

Pediatric brain gliomas represent a histologically and molecularly heterogeneous group of central nervous system malignancies, posing significant challenges in accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and longitudinal monitoring. The precise delineation of tumor sub-regions—including the enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor core, and peritumoral edematous tissue—from multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a critical prerequisite for these clinical tasks. However, the development of robust automated segmentation algorithms has been historically constrained by a scarcity of large-scale, annotated pediatric neuro-oncologic imaging data, leading to models often optimized for adult disease phenotypes. To address this translational gap, we present the BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge, a large-scale benchmarking initiative. This challenge leverages a multi-institutional, international dataset of mpMRI scans from pediatric patients with gliomas, curated with expert neuroradiological annotations. The primary objective is to catalyze the development of advanced, pediatric-specific segmentation algorithms by providing a standardized platform for training and validation. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art computational methodologies submitted by the international research community, assessing their efficacy in segmenting key tumor sub-compartments across a diverse pediatric cohort. The benchmarking results demonstrate notable progress in automated segmentation performance, yet also highlight persistent challenges in handling the unique anatomical and pathological characteristics of the developing brain. The BraTS-PEDs 2023 dataset and findings establish a critical foundation for future research, with the ultimate aim of refining computational tools to support clinical decision-making and improve outcomes for pediatric neuro-oncology patients.
