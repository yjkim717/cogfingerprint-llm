**Abstract**

The protracted and costly nature of conventional drug development underscores the need for robust, human-validated target identification strategies. Mendelian randomization (MR), an epidemiological approach leveraging naturally occurring genetic variants as instrumental variables, has emerged as a powerful tool for de-risking this process. By mimicking the intended effect of a pharmacological intervention on a specific protein or pathway, MR provides evidence for a causal relationship between a drug target and a disease outcome, thereby strengthening the therapeutic hypothesis prior to clinical trials. This review synthesizes recent advances from 2023, highlighting how large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and proteomic datasets are refining MR applications. We discuss the integration of colocalization analysis to confirm shared genetic signals and address key methodological challenges, including horizontal pleiotropy and instrument strength. The growing application of MR for drug repurposing and the assessment of on-target side effects is also examined. We conclude that the systematic incorporation of human genetic evidence through MR frameworks holds significant promise for enhancing the efficiency and success rate of therapeutic development pipelines.
