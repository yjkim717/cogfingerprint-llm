**Abstract:**

Recent advances in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research increasingly rely on plasma biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic assessment. However, the extent of biological variation affecting these biomarkers remains incompletely characterized. This 2023 study by Ashton addresses this critical gap, exploring sources of inter-individual variability in plasma biomarker measurements. Improved understanding of this variation is essential for robust data interpretation and accurate clinical application within AD research.
