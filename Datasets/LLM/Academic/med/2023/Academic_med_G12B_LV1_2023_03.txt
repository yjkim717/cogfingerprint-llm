**Plasma p-tau217 as a Predictive Biomarker for Amyloid-β Positivity and Reduced Need for Cerebrospinal Fluid Assessment in Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment**

**Abstract**

**Background:** Accurate and accessible diagnostic tools are crucial for early and reliable identification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition is a key hallmark of AD, typically assessed through amyloid PET imaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. However, these methods present logistical and cost-related barriers to widespread clinical implementation. Recent advances in proteomics have highlighted the potential of plasma p-tau217 as a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for Aβ pathology. This study investigates the utility of a two-step diagnostic workflow incorporating plasma p-tau217 levels to predict Aβ positivity and subsequently minimize the requirement for invasive CSF analysis in individuals presenting with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

**Methods:** A retrospective analysis was performed on data from [Specify study cohort – e.g., a longitudinal cohort of individuals with MCI recruited from memory clinics]. Plasma p-tau217 concentrations were measured using [Specify assay – e.g., ultrasensitive single molecule array (Simoa) technology].  Aβ positivity was defined as [Specify Aβ positivity criteria - e.g., positive amyloid PET scan or Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio below a defined threshold in CSF].  Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine optimal p-tau217 cut-off values for predicting Aβ positivity.  Furthermore, a two-step workflow was evaluated, wherein individuals with p-tau217 levels above the established cut-off underwent CSF analysis for confirmation, while those below the cut-off were considered unlikely to exhibit Aβ pathology.

**Results:**  The study population comprised [Specify N] participants with MCI.  Plasma p-tau217 demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy in predicting Aβ positivity (AUC = [Report AUC value], p < 0.001). An optimal cut-off of [Report Cut-off value] pg/mL yielded a [Report Sensitivity and Specificity values] sensitivity and specificity.  Implementation of the proposed two-step workflow resulted in a [Report percentage reduction] reduction in the need for CSF analysis while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy for Aβ positivity.

**Conclusion:**  This study provides robust evidence supporting the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 as a predictive biomarker for Aβ pathology in MCI.  The proposed two-step workflow offers a potentially transformative approach to AD diagnostics, streamlining patient evaluation, reducing invasive procedures, and enabling improved risk stratification for individuals at risk of developing AD. Further prospective validation is warranted to confirm these findings across diverse populations.
