**Abstract**

Anal carcinoma represents a significant oncological challenge, necessitating a refined and coordinated treatment strategy.  The 2023 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines advocate for a multidisciplinary approach, prioritizing chemoradiation as the foundational therapeutic modality for localized and regional disease.  However, the guidelines increasingly recognize the critical role of systemic therapy, particularly chemotherapy and targeted agents, in managing metastatic disease.  This shift reflects advancements in understanding the biological heterogeneity of squamous cell carcinoma, the predominant subtype of anal carcinoma.  Furthermore, the updated staging criteria, aligned with the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, provides a more accurate assessment of disease extent, directly informing treatment decisions and prognosis.  Successful management demands collaboration between surgical oncology, radiation oncology, medical oncology, and pathology, ensuring patient-centered care and optimized outcomes. Continued research focusing on biomarkers and novel therapeutic combinations remains paramount to improving survival rates in patients with advanced anal carcinoma.
