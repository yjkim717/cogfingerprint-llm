**Abstract**

**Background:** The escalating global burden of severe obesity and its associated comorbid conditions necessitates effective, durable interventions. Metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) has emerged as a principal therapeutic modality, yet long-term data on its efficacy and safety profile are critical for clinical decision-making.

**Objective:** This review synthesizes the contemporary evidence from 2023 and prior longitudinal studies to evaluate the long-term outcomes of MBS, focusing on sustained weight reduction, remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and the mitigation of other obesity-related comorbidities.

**Methods:** A comprehensive analysis of peer-reviewed literature and major clinical trials was conducted, examining outcomes beyond five years post-procedure, including percentage of total weight loss (%TWL), glycemic control parameters, and cardiovascular risk factors.

**Results:** MBS demonstrates robust efficacy in achieving significant and durable weight loss (>20% TWL at 10 years) and high rates of T2DM remission and improvement. Furthermore, substantial amelioration of other conditions, including hypertension and dyslipidemia, is consistently reported. However, these metabolic benefits are contingent upon lifelong, structured postoperative care to monitor for and manage potential complications, such as nutritional deficiencies, anastomotic issues, and need for revisional surgery.

**Conclusion:** MBS is a definitive treatment for severe obesity, offering profound and sustained metabolic advantages. Its success is predicated on a paradigm of lifelong multidisciplinary follow-up to ensure optimal outcomes and patient safety, underscoring its role as a chronic disease management strategy rather than a one-time intervention.
