The NCCN Guidelines Version 4.2023 for metastatic breast cancer delineate a paradigm shift in systemic therapy for Stage IV disease. Emphasizing biomarker-driven stratification, these evidence-based recommendations prioritize sequential treatment algorithms tailored to tumor biology. This precision oncology framework integrates novel targeted agents and optimized chemotherapy sequences, substantially improving progression-free survival. The guidelines underscore the critical importance of molecular subtyping—including hormone receptor and HER2 status—in therapeutic decision-making, thereby advancing personalized medicine in advanced breast cancer management.
