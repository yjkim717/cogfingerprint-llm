This 2023 update to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for metastatic breast cancer (Stage IV) provides a critical synthesis of contemporary evidence for systemic therapy. The recommendations are fundamentally stratified by tumor biology, emphasizing the pivotal role of biomarker profiling—including hormone receptor status and HER2 expression—in guiding therapeutic selection. This precision oncology framework aims to optimize clinical outcomes by aligning treatment modalities with the molecular drivers of individual malignancies, thereby advancing personalized care paradigms for this advanced disease state.
