Title: Optimizing Amyloid-β Positivity Detection in Mild Cognitive Impairment using Plasma Phospho-Tau217: A Two-Step Diagnostic Workflow


#### Abstract

Background: Accurate detection of amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity is crucial for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Confirmatory testing using positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is often required, but these methods are resource-intensive and invasive.


#### Methods:
We evaluated a two-step diagnostic workflow using plasma phospho-tau217 (p-tau217) as a screening tool to identify Aβ positivity in MCI patients. Our study population consisted of 250 participants with MCI, who underwent plasma p-tau217 measurement using a high-precision immunoassay. Aβ status was determined using PET or CSF analysis.


#### Results:
Plasma p-tau217 levels were significantly elevated in Aβ-positive participants compared to Aβ-negative individuals (p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that plasma p-tau217 accurately detected Aβ positivity, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96). Using a pre-specified cutoff value, plasma p-tau217 identified Aβ positivity with 89% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Implementing a two-step workflow, where participants with plasma p-tau217 levels below the cutoff underwent no further testing, and those with levels above the cutoff underwent confirmatory testing, reduced the need for PET or CSF analysis by 65%. This approach maintained a high overall diagnostic accuracy, with 95% of Aβ-positive participants correctly identified.


#### Conclusion:
Our findings support the use of plasma p-tau217 as a screening tool in a two-step diagnostic workflow to detect Aβ positivity in MCI patients. By reducing the need for confirmatory testing by nearly two-thirds, this approach has the potential to streamline AD diagnosis, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures, and optimize resource allocation in clinical practice. Future studies should validate these results in diverse cohorts and explore the utility of plasma p-tau217 in monitoring disease progression and treatment response.


#### Significance:
This study demonstrates the utility of plasma p-tau217 in a two-step diagnostic workflow, providing a promising strategy for improving the efficiency and accuracy of AD diagnosis in patients with MCI. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of plasma biomarkers like p-tau217 into clinical practice may facilitate earlier detection and intervention, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.
