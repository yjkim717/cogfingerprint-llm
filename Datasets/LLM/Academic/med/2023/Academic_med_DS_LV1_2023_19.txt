**Abstract**

The contemporary management of squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCA) is a paradigm of multidisciplinary care, predominantly centered on definitive chemoradiation (CRT) as established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. This review synthesizes the 2023 standard of care, emphasizing the critical integration of the updated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system (8th edition) for precise prognostication and treatment stratification. While organ preservation with CRT remains the cornerstone for localized disease, significant therapeutic evolution has occurred for metastatic SCCA. Recent evidence has reshaped the systemic therapy landscape, moving beyond traditional cisplatin/5-fluorouracil regimens to incorporate novel agents and immunotherapies, thereby improving outcomes for patients with advanced-stage disease. This article delineates these evidence-based advancements, providing a structured framework for the comprehensive management of SCCA across its disease spectrum.
