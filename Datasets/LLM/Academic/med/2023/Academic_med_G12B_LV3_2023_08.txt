**Abstract**

The 2023 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines reflect evolving approaches to managing recurrent or metastatic esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancers. Recognizing the heterogeneity of these malignancies, the updated recommendations underscore the critical role of comprehensive biomarker testing to guide therapeutic decision-making. Specifically, the guidelines emphasize the implementation of targeted therapies, including those tailored to squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma subtypes, to optimize treatment efficacy. Furthermore, the document advocates for a patient-centered approach integrating robust palliative care strategies alongside multidisciplinary team management. This holistic framework aims to improve quality of life and overall survival outcomes for patients facing advanced disease. The guidelines represent a shift toward precision oncology in esophageal and EGJ cancers, prioritizing individualized treatment plans based on molecular profiling and integrated supportive care.
