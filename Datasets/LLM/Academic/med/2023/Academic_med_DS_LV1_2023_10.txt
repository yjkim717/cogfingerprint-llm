**Abstract**

The accurate segmentation of pediatric brain tumors, particularly high-grade gliomas (HGGs), from multi-parametric structural magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is a critical prerequisite for precise diagnosis, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. However, the development of robust automated segmentation techniques for this population has been hindered by the distinct pathophysiological and radiological characteristics of pediatric neoplasms compared to their adult counterparts, compounded by a scarcity of large, annotated, multi-institutional datasets. This study presents the methodology and findings of the Brain Tumor Segmentation in Pediatrics (BraTS-PEDs) 2023 challenge, an international benchmarking initiative designed to address this gap. The challenge provided a curated, multi-institutional mpMRI dataset of pediatric patients with HGGs to the global computational research community. We evaluated a diverse array of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms submitted by participants, assessing their performance in delineating tumor sub-regions, including the enhancing tumor, peritumoral edematous tissue, and necrotic core. The results demonstrate significant advancements in algorithmic generalizability and segmentation accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for the field. This initiative provides a foundational resource and a standardized framework to catalyze future research, with the ultimate objective of translating these computational tools into clinical practice to improve oncological care for pediatric patients.
