Title: Contemporary Management of Anal Carcinoma: An Overview of NCCN Guidelines and Recent Advances

Abstract:

Anal carcinoma, predominantly squamous cell carcinoma, presents a complex management challenge due to its rarity and nuanced treatment requirements. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines provide a framework for evidence-based management. As of 2023, the guidelines recommend chemoradiation as the primary treatment modality for localized disease, with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) enhancing precision and reducing toxicity. Recent updates to the guidelines reflect advances in staging, incorporating high-resolution imaging and pathological assessment to inform treatment stratification. Systemic therapy recommendations have also evolved, with an increasing emphasis on targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches for advanced or recurrent disease. This overview synthesizes current NCCN guidelines and recent advances, highlighting the importance of multidisciplinary care in optimizing outcomes for patients with anal carcinoma. Ongoing research will continue to refine treatment paradigms.
