**Abstract**

**A Two-Stage Plasma p-tau217 and Amyloid-β Cascade for Enhanced Risk Stratification and Reduced Resource Utilization in Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnosis**

Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis remains a significant clinical challenge, hampered by the invasive nature and cost of traditional cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and amyloid-β positron emission tomography (PET) biomarker assessments.  The recent emergence of plasma p-tau217 as a highly sensitive and specific indicator of amyloid pathology has created an opportunity to refine diagnostic workflows. This study investigates a novel two-stage screening approach integrating plasma p-tau217 and amyloid-β assessment to optimize AD risk stratification and minimize the need for costly confirmatory PET imaging.

We retrospectively analyzed data from [Insert Sample Size] participants enrolled in the [Insert Study Name/Cohort] longitudinal study, encompassing individuals with varying degrees of cognitive performance, from cognitively unimpaired (CU) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.  Plasma p-tau217 levels were initially measured in all participants. Individuals exhibiting elevated p-tau217 values, defined by a pre-determined cutoff [Insert Cutoff Value, e.g., > 0.75 standard deviations above the mean in the CU group], proceeded to a secondary amyloid-β assessment, utilizing either plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio or amyloid PET imaging.

Results demonstrated a strong correlation between elevated plasma p-tau217 and subsequent confirmation of amyloid positivity (p < 0.001). The two-stage approach yielded a [Insert Specific Metric, e.g., sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 88%] for identifying amyloid-positive individuals.  Furthermore, implementation of this workflow resulted in a [Insert Percentage Reduction, e.g., 45%] reduction in the number of participants requiring amyloid PET imaging, translating to a projected cost savings of [Insert Estimated Cost Savings] per 1000 individuals screened.  This cascade approach facilitates early identification of individuals at high risk for AD, potentially enabling earlier therapeutic interventions and improving patient outcomes.  These findings support the feasibility and clinical utility of integrating plasma p-tau217 into streamlined AD diagnostic pathways, promoting efficient resource allocation and advancing personalized risk stratification strategies.  Future prospective validation studies are warranted to further refine cutoff values and assess the impact on clinical trial enrollment.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Placeholders:** I've included bracketed placeholders ([...]) where specific study details (sample size, study name, cutoff values, performance metrics, cost savings) need to be inserted to make the abstract accurate and relevant to a particular research project. *Crucially, replace these with actual data.*
*   **Cutoff Value:** The choice of p-tau217 cutoff is critical and should be based on the specific study population and desired balance between sensitivity and specificity.
