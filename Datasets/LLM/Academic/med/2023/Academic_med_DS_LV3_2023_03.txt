**Abstract**

The escalating global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) underscores an urgent need for accessible and cost-effective diagnostic pathways, particularly in the stratification of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The current diagnostic standard, which often relies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSL) analysis or amyloid-β (Aβ) positron emission tomography (PET), is limited by its invasiveness, high cost, and restricted scalability. This study, conducted in 2023, evaluates a novel two-step risk stratification workflow that leverages the emerging blood-based biomarker, plasma phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), in conjunction with established risk factors. We hypothesized that integrating plasma p-tau217 levels with age and APOE ε4 carrier status could accurately triage MCI patients for Aβ pathology, thereby optimizing the use of confirmatory testing.

A prospective cohort of 550 MCI patients underwent initial plasma p-tau217 quantification, followed by classification using a validated algorithm incorporating biomarker status, age, and APOE genotype. The primary outcome was the workflow's accuracy in predicting cerebral Aβ positivity, as definitively determined by CSF Aβ42/40 ratio. Our results demonstrate that this integrated model achieved high diagnostic performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94. Crucially, the algorithm successfully identified a large subset of patients with a very low probability of Aβ pathology, obviating the need for confirmatory CSF testing in 73.5% of the cohort. This strategic triage resulted in an overall reduction of 61.2% to 85.9% in required CSF procedures, while maintaining a robust sensitivity of 92.0% and a specificity of 88.2% for detecting underlying AD.

These findings affirm that a precision medicine approach, centered on plasma p-tau217, enables highly accurate and efficient risk stratification in the MCI population. The proposed workflow presents a paradigm shift towards a more scalable and cost-effective diagnostic framework for AD, facilitating earlier and more targeted patient management and therapeutic intervention in routine clinical practice.
