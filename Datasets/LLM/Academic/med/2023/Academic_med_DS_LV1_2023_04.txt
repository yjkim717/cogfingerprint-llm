This 2023 update to the NCCN Guidelines for metastatic breast cancer (Stage IV) refines systemic therapy recommendations based on emerging clinical evidence. Key revisions address the integration of novel targeted agents and immunotherapies, emphasizing biomarker-driven treatment selection. The guidance underscores the importance of personalized therapeutic strategies, including CDK4/6 inhibitors in HR+/HER2- disease and antibody-drug conjugates in triple-negative subtypes. These evidence-based refinements aim to optimize clinical outcomes by aligning systemic treatment regimens with specific molecular profiles and prior therapy history, thereby enhancing the precision oncology approach for advanced breast cancer management.
