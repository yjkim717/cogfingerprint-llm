Title: Contemporary Management of Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers: Emphasis on Systemic Therapy and Targeted Therapies

Abstract:

The management of esophageal and esophagogastric junction (EGJ) cancers has evolved significantly, with a growing emphasis on systemic therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease. The 2023 NCCN Guidelines underscore the importance of biomarker testing in informing treatment decisions, facilitating the use of targeted therapies. For patients with advanced esophageal and EGJ cancers, systemic therapy has become a cornerstone of care, with options including chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted agents. The integration of biomarker-driven targeted therapies has improved treatment outcomes, with HER2-directed therapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors demonstrating significant clinical benefit. This review highlights the current landscape of systemic therapy and targeted therapies for esophageal and EGJ cancers, with a focus on the role of biomarker testing in guiding treatment selection and optimizing patient outcomes. Ongoing research is expected to further refine the management of these complex malignancies.
