**Abstract**

The utility of plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis and monitoring is increasingly recognized; however, the extent of biological variation within apparently healthy cohorts remains incompletely characterized. This study addresses this critical gap by examining inter-individual variability in key AD-related plasma biomarkers – including amyloid-β and phosphorylated tau isoforms – within a well-defined, cognitively normal population. Rigorous statistical analyses were employed to quantify the range and distribution of biomarker values, accounting for potential confounding factors. Understanding this baseline biological variation is essential for establishing robust diagnostic cut-offs, improving assay standardization, and ultimately, for accurate interpretation of longitudinal changes in individuals at risk for AD, particularly within the context of emerging therapeutic interventions.
