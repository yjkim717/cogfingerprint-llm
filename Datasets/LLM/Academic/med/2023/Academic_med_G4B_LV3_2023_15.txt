**Abstract**

The escalating participation rates of adolescent athletes necessitate a critical examination of the associated psychological burdens. This study, conducted in 2023, investigated the prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms within a cohort of 200 high school athletes. Findings revealed that an alarming 91% reported experiencing sport-related stress, frequently attributed to fear of performance failure and internalized self-imposed pressure.  Quantitative analysis utilizing the Perceived Stress Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale indicated a significant correlation between these stressors and heightened anxiety levels (p<0.01).  Furthermore, preliminary data suggest a potential association between chronic stress and depressive symptomatology. These results underscore the urgent need for proactive mental health support systems within high school athletic programs, including accessible counseling services and strategies promoting psychological resilience. Future research should explore longitudinal effects and identify specific risk factors contributing to adverse mental health outcomes in this vulnerable population.
