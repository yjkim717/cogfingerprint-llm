**Abstract:**

The field of pediatric neuro-oncology faces persistent challenges in accurate tumor characterization and volumetric assessment, hindering progress in clinical trial design and ultimately, patient outcomes. Addressing this critical need, the inaugural CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs 2023 challenge represents a significant advancement in the benchmarking of automated brain tumor segmentation algorithms. Utilizing multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) data, this challenge specifically targets the complexities of pediatric brain tumor imaging, a domain often underrepresented in broader BraTS initiatives. The objective is to foster the development and validation of robust segmentation techniques capable of precisely delineating tumor regions, accounting for age-related anatomical variations and heterogeneous tissue characteristics. Successful algorithm development through this challenge is anticipated to directly contribute to improved clinical trial stratification, enhanced treatment response monitoring, and ultimately, more personalized and effective therapeutic strategies for pediatric brain tumor patients.
