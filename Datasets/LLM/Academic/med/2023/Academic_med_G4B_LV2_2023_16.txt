**Abstract**

The interpretation of plasma biomarker data in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) research is frequently hampered by substantial biological variation. This study addresses this critical challenge by examining the intra-individual variability of a panel of plasma biomarkers within a cohort of healthy controls. Utilizing advanced statistical methods, we quantified the extent of variation observed across multiple measurements, considering factors potentially influencing biomarker profiles.  Understanding this inherent biological variation is paramount for robust diagnostic and prognostic applications.  Specifically, this research delineates the degree of fluctuation within established biomarkers, informing future studies targeting early AD detection and longitudinal monitoring.  These findings contribute to a more nuanced approach to biomarker interpretation, ultimately enhancing the reliability of AD research in 2023 and beyond.
