**Abstract**

The evolving landscape of anal carcinoma management necessitates updated clinical guidelines, and the 2023 NCCN recommendations represent a significant refinement of current standard of care. This study synthesizes the latest NCCN guidelines, focusing on a multimodal, multidisciplinary strategy for patients diagnosed with anal carcinoma. Particular attention is given to the differential treatment approaches dictated by tumor stage and histologic subtype, notably highlighting the increasing prevalence of squamous cell carcinoma within this cohort.  The guidelines strongly advocate for chemoradiation as the foundational treatment for locally advanced disease, with nuanced adjustments proposed based on performance status and patient comorbidities. Furthermore, the document details evolving protocols for metastatic disease, emphasizing the role of targeted therapies and immunotherapy alongside conventional cytotoxic regimens.  Adherence to these updated NCCN guidelines is crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and improving survival rates within this challenging malignancy.
