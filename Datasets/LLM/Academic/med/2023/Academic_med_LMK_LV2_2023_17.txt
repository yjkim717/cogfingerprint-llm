Title: A Two-Step Workflow Utilizing Plasma Phosphorylated Tau217 to Identify Amyloid-β Positivity in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Enhancing Diagnostic Efficiency in Alzheimer's Disease

Abstract:

The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its early stages remains challenging due to the necessity of invasive and costly confirmatory testing to ascertain amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity. Recent advancements in blood biomarkers have shown promise in streamlining the diagnostic process. This study investigates the utility of a two-step workflow employing plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) to detect Aβ positivity in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a precursor to AD. Our methodology leverages the discriminatory potential of plasma p-tau217, a specific and sensitive biomarker for AD pathology, to pre-select individuals at high risk of Aβ positivity, thereby reducing the need for subsequent confirmatory testing.

Using a cohort of MCI patients, we first established a threshold for plasma p-tau217 that optimally discriminates between Aβ positive and negative individuals as determined by positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. The diagnostic performance of this threshold was then validated in an independent cohort. By applying this two-step workflow, we significantly reduced the proportion of patients requiring confirmatory testing while maintaining a high level of diagnostic accuracy for Aβ positivity.

Our findings demonstrate that the implementation of a plasma p-tau217 threshold in a two-step diagnostic workflow can efficiently identify MCI patients at high likelihood of Aβ positivity. This approach not only streamlines the diagnostic pathway by reducing the number of patients requiring PET or CSF analysis but also has the potential to facilitate earlier intervention in those most likely to benefit from emerging AD therapeutics. The results underscore the value of plasma p-tau217 as a blood-based biomarker in the diagnostic algorithm for AD, offering a more accessible and cost-effective means of identifying individuals with MCI who are likely to be Aβ positive. By enhancing diagnostic efficiency and reducing reliance on invasive and expensive confirmatory tests, this two-step workflow has significant implications for the clinical management of MCI and the early detection of AD.
