**Abstract**

The high-pressure environment of competitive scholastic athletics represents a significant, yet often under-addressed, public health concern. This 2023 study investigates the prevalence of sports-related psychological distress among adolescent athletes and their subsequent access to mental healthcare services. A cross-sectional survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of high school athletes (N=1,200) across diverse sporting disciplines. Quantitative analysis revealed a striking prevalence rate, with 91% of participants reporting clinically significant symptoms of sport-induced stress. This distress manifested across affective, somatic, and cognitive domains, frequently correlating with performance anxiety and academic pressures. A critical finding emerged from the analysis of help-seeking behaviors: despite the high burden of symptomatology, a substantial majority of affected athletes reported a pronounced gap between their perceived need for psychological support and its actual receipt. This treatment gap underscores a systemic failure in the current sports medicine paradigm, which often prioritizes physical health over concurrent mental well-being. These findings necessitate a paradigm shift toward integrated care models within sports medicine. We conclude that urgent institutional reforms are required to implement routine mental health screening and destigmatize, facilitate, and integrate evidence-based psychological interventions as a standard component of athletic healthcare.
