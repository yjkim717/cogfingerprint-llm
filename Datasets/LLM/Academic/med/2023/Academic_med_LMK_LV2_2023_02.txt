This study investigates the biological variation of Alzheimer's disease plasma biomarkers in healthy individuals, addressing a critical knowledge gap. By analyzing fluctuations in blood biomarkers, we elucidate the inherent variability, thereby informing the interpretation of individual-level data and enhancing the utility of plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and monitoring.
