Title: Contemporary Management of Squamous Cell Anal Carcinoma: An Overview of NCCN Guidelines and Recent Advancements

Abstract:
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines provide a framework for managing squamous cell anal carcinoma, a malignancy increasingly prevalent among certain populations. This review summarizes the current NCCN guidelines for anal carcinoma, with a focus on treatment paradigms and recent updates. The standard treatment approach for localized disease involves chemoradiation, with the integration of systemic therapy in select cases. Accurate staging, as per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, is crucial for determining prognosis and guiding treatment decisions. Recent advancements in systemic therapies have expanded treatment options for patients with advanced or recurrent disease. This overview aims to provide a concise summary of the current management strategies for anal carcinoma, highlighting the role of chemoradiation, systemic therapy, and AJCC staging in optimizing patient outcomes.
