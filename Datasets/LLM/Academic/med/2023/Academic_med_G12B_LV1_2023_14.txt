**The Emerging Role of Large Language Models in Health Professions Education: A Scoping Review of Opportunities and Challenges**

**Abstract**

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, presents both transformative potential and substantive challenges for health professions education (HPE). This scoping review examines the nascent integration of LLMs within medical, dental, pharmacy, and public health curricula, analyzing reported advantages and identified limitations as of late 2023. Utilizing a systematic search of peer-reviewed literature and grey literature sources, we synthesized findings across these four disciplines to identify recurring themes. Preliminary evidence suggests LLMs offer opportunities for personalized learning experiences through adaptive questioning, immediate feedback on clinical reasoning, and generation of diverse case studies. Furthermore, their capacity to synthesize complex medical information and automate administrative tasks holds promise for alleviating educator workload and enabling a greater focus on pedagogical innovation. However, critical limitations necessitate cautious implementation. Concerns regarding accuracy and potential for perpetuating biases embedded within training datasets are paramount, potentially impacting the development of equitable and evidence-based clinical decision-making skills. The lack of transparency in LLM algorithmic processes (“black box” effect) raises concerns about pedagogical accountability and the development of critical appraisal abilities vital for future healthcare professionals. Moreover, the potential for academic misconduct, including plagiarism and over-reliance on AI-generated content, poses significant ethical and assessment challenges. This review concludes that while LLMs offer compelling possibilities for enhancing HPE, a robust framework encompassing ethical guidelines, pedagogical best practices, and rigorous evaluation methodologies is essential to mitigate risks and ensure responsible integration. Future research should focus on validating the efficacy of LLM-supported learning interventions, assessing the impact on student competency, and developing strategies for fostering critical engagement with AI tools within the healthcare context.
