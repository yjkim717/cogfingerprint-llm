Title: Stress Prevalence and Support Gaps among High School Athletes: A Cross-Sectional Study

Abstract:

High school athletes are increasingly recognized as a vulnerable population in sports psychology, subject to unique stressors that impact their mental health. This study investigates the prevalence of stress among high school athletes and their utilization of professional support services. A sample of 200 high school athletes participated in a survey assessing their stress levels, sources of stress, and perceived need for mental health support. The results indicate a high prevalence of sports-related stress, with 91% of participants reporting stress attributed to their athletic activities. The primary sources of stress identified were competition pressure, fear of injury, and balancing academic responsibilities with athletic commitments. Despite the high prevalence of stress, a significant gap was observed between the desire for professional help and the actual receipt of such support. The findings underscore the need for enhanced mental health resources tailored to the specific needs of high school athletes. The study's results have implications for sports psychologists, coaches, and policymakers, highlighting the importance of integrating stress management programs into athletic training regimens and improving access to mental health services for young athletes. By addressing these gaps, stakeholders can promote athlete well-being and optimize performance in this critical demographic.
