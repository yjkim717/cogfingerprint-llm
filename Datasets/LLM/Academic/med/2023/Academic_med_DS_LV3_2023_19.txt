The 2023 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) advocate for a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach as the standard of care. Central to the management paradigm is definitive chemoradiation, which remains the cornerstone of treatment for localized disease, aiming for organ preservation and curative intent. The guidelines integrate the updated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Staging System, 9th edition, providing a refined prognostic framework that informs therapeutic stratification. For patients with metastatic disease, the recommendations have been revised to include novel systemic therapy options, reflecting evidence from recent clinical trials. This structured update underscores the critical integration of accurate staging, multimodal therapy, and tailored systemic regimens to optimize oncological outcomes in SCCA.
