**Abstract: Recent Updates to the ASCO-CAP Guidelines for HER2 Testing and the Integration of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan**

The evolving landscape of breast cancer therapeutics necessitates continuous refinement of diagnostic strategies. This abstract summarizes key revisions to the 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology – College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guideline for HER2 testing, specifically addressing the clinical implications of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) approval. While the foundational principles of HER2 status determination remain consistent, the guideline emphasizes the translational significance of immunohistochemical (IHC) results, particularly those classified as IHC 0 and 1+. 

Prior to T-DXd’s introduction, IHC 1+ results typically prompted dual IHC or FISH testing to confirm HER2 amplification. However, the demonstrated efficacy of T-DXd in patients with HER2-positive, IHC 1+ tumors underscores the potential utility of utilizing IHC 1+ results directly for treatment decisions. The updated guideline acknowledges this shift, advocating for a more nuanced interpretation of IHC 1+ findings, considering factors such as tumor heterogeneity and clinical context. 

Furthermore, the document reinforces the established role of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for definitive HER2 amplification assessment, particularly in cases where IHC results are equivocal.  These updates reflect a pragmatic approach to HER2 testing, optimizing patient selection for T-DXd therapy and contributing to improved clinical outcomes within the realm of breast cancer management.
