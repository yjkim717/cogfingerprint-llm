Title: The Prevalence of Stress and Mental Health Concerns among High School Athletes: A Cross-Sectional Study

Abstract:

High school athletes are a vulnerable population susceptible to the pressures of competitive sports, which can have a profound impact on their mental health. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the prevalence of stress and mental health concerns among high school athletes and their desire for professional help. A sample of 200 high school athletes participated in the study, completing a comprehensive questionnaire assessing their stress levels, anxiety, depression, and attitudes towards seeking medical help. The results revealed that 91% of the participants reported experiencing stress due to sports-related factors, with a significant proportion exhibiting symptoms of anxiety (67%) and depression (42%). Notably, the majority of stressed athletes (75%) expressed a desire to receive help from medical professionals to manage their stress and related mental health concerns. The findings of this study underscore the need for sports psychologists and healthcare professionals to develop targeted interventions to mitigate the negative impact of sports-related stress on the mental health of high school athletes. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment that encourages athletes to seek help without fear of stigma or repercussions. The study's findings have significant implications for the development of evidence-based stress management programs and mental health support services for high school athletes. As the mental health of young athletes continues to be a pressing concern in 2023, this study contributes to the growing body of research in the field of sports psychology and athlete mental health.
