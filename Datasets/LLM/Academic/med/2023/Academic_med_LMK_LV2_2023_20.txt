Title: Reaffirmation of HER2 Testing Guidelines for Breast Cancer: Implications for Trastuzumab Deruxtecan Treatment and Immunohistochemistry Interpretation

Abstract:

The updated American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines reaffirm the 2018 recommendations for HER2 testing in breast cancer, underscoring the significance of accurately distinguishing between immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0 and 1+ results. This reaffirmation has substantial implications for the diagnosis and treatment of HER2-low breast cancer, particularly with the advent of novel therapeutic agents such as trastuzumab deruxtecan.

The ASCO-CAP update emphasizes the critical role of HER2 testing in identifying patients eligible for targeted therapies. Trastuzumab deruxtecan, an antibody-drug conjugate, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with HER2-low breast cancer, defined as IHC 1+ or 2+ without gene amplification. The distinction between IHC 0 and 1+ is crucial, as it directly impacts treatment decisions and patient outcomes.

Immunohistochemistry remains a cornerstone in HER2 testing, providing a semi-quantitative assessment of HER2 protein expression. The updated guidelines stress the need for standardized IHC protocols and rigorous quality control measures to ensure accurate and reproducible results. The differentiation between IHC 0 and 1+ requires careful consideration of staining intensity, distribution, and cellular morphology.

The reaffirmation of the 2018 HER2 testing guidelines has significant implications for clinical practice. Accurate HER2 testing is essential for identifying patients who may benefit from trastuzumab deruxtecan and other emerging therapies. The updated guidelines reinforce the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, involving pathologists, oncologists, and clinicians, to ensure optimal patient care.

In conclusion, the updated ASCO-CAP guidelines reaffirm the importance of accurate HER2 testing in breast cancer, highlighting the need for precise distinction between IHC 0 and 1+ results. The emergence of novel therapies such as trastuzumab deruxtecan underscores the significance of standardized IHC protocols and rigorous quality control measures. By adhering to these guidelines, clinicians can ensure that patients receive optimal treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes in the era of precision medicine.
