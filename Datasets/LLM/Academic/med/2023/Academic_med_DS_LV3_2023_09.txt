Abstract

Mendelian randomization (MR) has emerged as a pivotal methodology in translational medicine, fundamentally reshaping early-stage drug development. By leveraging naturally occurring genetic variations as instrumental variables, MR enables the causal inference of modifiable risk factors on disease outcomes, thereby de-risking target identification and validation. This approach is particularly transformative for prioritizing molecular targets, such as those within the interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathway, where genetic evidence robustly supports a pathogenic role in inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. The integration of large-scale genomic consortia data with MR frameworks in 2023 has accelerated the transition from genetic association to therapeutic hypothesis, providing a powerful tool to distinguish causal drug targets from mere correlative biomarkers. This paradigm not only enhances the biological plausibility of candidate therapeutics but also mitigates attrition rates in clinical trials by providing human genetic validation prior to substantial investment. Consequently, MR is establishing a new gold standard for evidence-based drug discovery, promising a more efficient and genetically-informed pipeline for bringing novel treatments to patients.
