**Abstract**

Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease pathology is paramount for effective intervention; however, current diagnostic methods are often invasive and expensive. This study investigates the utility of plasma p-tau217 as a novel biomarker for risk stratification in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and suspected amyloid β (Aβ) deposition. Utilizing a two-step workflow, plasma p-tau217 levels demonstrated a strong correlation with subsequent Aβ positivity, achieving a significant reduction in the reliance on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and amyloid PET imaging.  Specifically, employing plasma p-tau217 prior to confirmatory testing yielded a substantial decrease (35%) in the need for costly and time-consuming diagnostic procedures. These findings suggest that plasma p-tau217 represents a valuable tool for refining risk stratification within this vulnerable population, ultimately facilitating more targeted and efficient clinical trials and personalized therapeutic strategies. Further research is warranted to validate these results across diverse populations and longitudinal studies.
