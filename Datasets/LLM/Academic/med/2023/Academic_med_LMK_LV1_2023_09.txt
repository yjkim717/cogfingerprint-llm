Title: Leveraging Mendelian Randomization to Inform Drug Target Identification: A Human Genetics-Driven Approach

Abstract:
The integration of human genetics into the drug development pipeline has revolutionized the identification and validation of therapeutic targets. Mendelian randomization (MR), a statistical methodology that exploits genetic variation as a natural experiment, has emerged as a powerful tool in this endeavour. By leveraging genetic associations with disease outcomes, MR enables the inference of causal relationships between putative drug targets and disease aetiology. As of 2023, advances in genomic technologies have enabled the generation of vast amounts of human genetic data, facilitating the application of MR to inform drug target identification. This approach has yielded promising results, providing a robust framework for the prioritization of novel therapeutic targets. Here, we discuss the principles of MR and its application in human genetics-driven drug development, highlighting its potential to enhance the efficiency and efficacy of the drug discovery process.
