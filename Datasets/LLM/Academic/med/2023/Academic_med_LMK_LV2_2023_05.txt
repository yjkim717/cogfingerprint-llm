Title: Contemporary Management of Anal Carcinoma: An Overview of the NCCN Guidelines

Abstract:
Anal carcinoma, predominantly squamous cell carcinoma, presents a complex clinical challenge necessitating a multidisciplinary management approach. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines provide a framework for the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of this malignancy. As of 2023, the guidelines underscore the importance of accurate staging and the integration of chemoradiation as the cornerstone of treatment for localized disease. Updates to the guidelines reflect emerging evidence supporting the use of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to optimize locoregional control while minimizing toxicity. Furthermore, the role of systemic therapy in the management of advanced or recurrent disease is highlighted, with a focus on targeted and immunotherapeutic strategies. This review summarizes the current NCCN guidelines for anal carcinoma, emphasizing the nuances of staging and the evolving treatment paradigm that underscores the need for a tailored, multidisciplinary approach to patient care.
