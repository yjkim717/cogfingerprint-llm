Title: Vorasidenib Demonstrates Efficacy in Enhancing Progression-Free Survival in Patients with IDH-Mutant Grade 2 Glioma: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract:

Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations are prevalent in grade 2 gliomas, a subtype of diffuse gliomas characterized by a propensity for malignant transformation. Vorasidenib, a novel dual inhibitor of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, has shown promise in preclinical studies by targeting the underlying molecular pathogenesis of IDH-mutant gliomas. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of vorasidenib in patients with IDH-mutant grade 2 glioma.

Between 2020 and 2022, a total of 240 patients with IDH-mutant grade 2 glioma were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either vorasidenib (n = 120) or placebo (n = 120). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), assessed by blinded independent central review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate, and safety.

The results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS among patients treated with vorasidenib compared to those receiving placebo (median PFS: 21.4 months vs. 11.1 months; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31-0.62; p < 0.001). At 24 months, the PFS rate was 44.7% (95% CI: 35.4-53.6) in the vorasidenib arm versus 23.1% (95% CI: 15.3-31.9) in the placebo arm. Vorasidenib was generally well-tolerated, with the most common adverse events being fatigue (23.3% vs. 15.8%), headache (20.8% vs. 14.2%), and nausea (17.5% vs. 10.8%). Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 15.8% of patients receiving vorasidenib and 10.0% of those receiving placebo.

This study provides robust evidence that vorasidenib significantly improves PFS in patients with IDH-mutant grade 2 glioma, underscoring its potential as a targeted therapeutic strategy for this patient population. The findings support further investigation into the long-term efficacy and safety of vorasidenib, as well as its potential role in the management of IDH-mutant gliomas. As of 2023, vorasidenib represents a promising treatment option for patients with IDH-mutant grade 2 glioma, offering a new avenue for improving patient outcomes in this challenging disease.
