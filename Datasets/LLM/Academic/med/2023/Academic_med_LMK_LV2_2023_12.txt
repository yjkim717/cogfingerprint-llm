Title: Evaluating the Efficacy and Long-term Implications of Metabolic/Bariatric Surgery in Obesity Treatment

Abstract:
Metabolic/bariatric surgery has emerged as a highly effective intervention for achieving substantial weight loss and improving obesity-related comorbidities, particularly type 2 diabetes. As of 2023, the clinical evidence supporting its efficacy is unequivocal, with significant and sustained weight reduction observed in patients undergoing various surgical procedures. Moreover, these interventions have been shown to induce notable improvements in glycemic control, often enabling the remission of type 2 diabetes. However, the success of metabolic/bariatric surgery is contingent upon comprehensive preoperative evaluation and lifelong postoperative follow-up to minimize the risk of complications, including nutritional deficiencies and metabolic derangements. This review synthesizes current evidence on the benefits and potential complications of metabolic/bariatric surgery, underscoring the necessity for multidisciplinary care to optimize patient outcomes and ensure long-term safety and efficacy. Ultimately, this surgical approach represents a valuable therapeutic option for appropriately selected patients with obesity.
