The 2023 update to the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast carcinoma represents a pivotal refinement in diagnostic and therapeutic stratification. While the core algorithmic approach to identifying traditional HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or ISH-positive) disease remains substantively unchanged to ensure continuity and reliability in clinical practice, the guidelines now formally codify the critical distinction between immunohistochemistry (IHC) scores of 0 and 1+. This nuanced differentiation, previously of limited therapeutic consequence, has been propelled to the forefront of breast cancer management by the emergence of novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), most notably trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd). Clinical trial data have unequivocally demonstrated the efficacy of T-DXd in the newly defined "HER2-low" subgroup—encompassing tumors with IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-negative results—revolutionizing treatment paradigms for a substantial cohort of patients previously classified simply as HER2-negative. Consequently, the updated ASCO-CAP recommendations mandate rigorous quality assurance and standardized methodologies to minimize inter-observer variability and pre-analytical inconsistencies that could misclassify a true IHC 0 specimen as 1+, or vice versa. Such a misclassification carries profound implications, potentially denying a patient effective therapy or subjecting them to unnecessary treatment and toxicity. Therefore, this guideline evolution underscores a paradigm shift from a binary HER2 classification towards a more granular, continuum-based model, directly aligning precise pathological assessment with expanding therapeutic options and heralding a new era of personalized medicine for metastatic breast cancer.
