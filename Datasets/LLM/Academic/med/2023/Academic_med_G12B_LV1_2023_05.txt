**Title:** Contemporary Management of Anal Carcinoma: An Evidence-Based Review of NCCN Guidelines and Evolving Approaches to Metastatic Disease

**Abstract:**

Anal carcinoma management has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, necessitating continuous refinement of treatment protocols. This review examines the current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for anal carcinoma, focusing on their evolution and implications for patient care in 2023. The NCCN guidelines emphasize a multidisciplinary approach integrating surgical oncology, radiation oncology, and medical oncology, reflecting a growing understanding of the disease's complex biology.  A critical component of these guidelines is the robust staging system, which informs treatment decisions and prognostication.  While locoregally advanced disease traditionally responds favorably to chemoradiation, the management of metastatic anal carcinoma remains a significant challenge. Emerging data supports the incorporation of systemic therapies, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted agents, particularly in patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors.  This review will discuss the updated recommendations regarding adjuvant therapy, the role of clinical trials investigating novel agents, and the evolving landscape of palliative care for patients with advanced disease. Furthermore, we will explore areas where ongoing research is crucial to optimize treatment strategies and improve outcomes for individuals diagnosed with anal carcinoma, with a specific focus on refining staging accuracy and identifying predictive biomarkers for response to systemic therapies.
