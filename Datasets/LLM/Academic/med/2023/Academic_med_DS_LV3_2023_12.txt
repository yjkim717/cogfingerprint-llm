In 2023, metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) remains the most effective intervention for severe obesity, demonstrating sustained efficacy in longitudinal studies. Contemporary evidence confirms that procedures including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy produce durable weight loss exceeding 20% of total body weight at 10-year follow-up, alongside significant metabolic improvements. Particularly noteworthy is the profound impact on type 2 diabetes mellitus, with numerous randomized controlled trials establishing MBS superiority over intensive medical therapy for achieving glycemic control and diabetes remission. However, comprehensive long-term outcomes analysis reveals critical considerations: patients require indefinite multidisciplinary follow-up to mitigate nutritional deficiencies (particularly iron, vitamin B12, and vitamin D), monitor bone health, and address emerging psychiatric comorbidities including substance use disorders. The evolving risk-benefit paradigm underscores MBS as a transformative yet complex therapeutic strategy, necessitating careful patient selection, lifelong nutritional supplementation, and systematic postoperative surveillance to optimize sustained health benefits while managing procedure-specific sequelae in this unique patient population.
