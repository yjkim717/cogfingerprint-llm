**Abstract**

This study investigates the prevalence of psychological distress within a cohort of high school athletes, examining the correlation between participation in competitive sports and the incidence of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Utilizing data from a 2023 survey of 200 high school athletes, we identified a concerning rate of reported stress – approximately 91% – primarily driven by extrinsic pressures including fear of performance failure and self-imposed academic rigor.  Qualitative analysis revealed a significant association between these stressors and heightened anxiety levels, suggesting a potential vulnerability to developing clinical depression.  These findings underscore the urgent need for proactive mental health interventions within secondary school athletic programs.  Specifically, targeted counseling services and the implementation of sport psychology strategies focused on cultivating resilience and self-compassion are recommended.  Further longitudinal research is warranted to fully elucidate the trajectory of these psychological challenges and to optimize preventative measures aimed at mitigating long-term adverse mental health outcomes in this population.
