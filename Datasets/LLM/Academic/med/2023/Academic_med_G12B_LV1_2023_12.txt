**Title: Durable Metabolic Remission and Long-Term Comorbidity Mitigation Following Bariatric Surgery: A Synthesis of Current Evidence and Future Directions**

**Abstract**

Obesity and its associated metabolic comorbidities, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), represent a significant and escalating global health challenge. Metabolic/bariatric surgery (MBS) has emerged as a potent intervention for achieving substantial and sustained weight loss, translating into improvements in metabolic health. This review synthesizes current evidence regarding the long-term outcomes of MBS, focusing on the durability of weight loss and the mitigation of comorbid conditions beyond T2DM.  While MBS demonstrates remarkable efficacy in achieving metabolic remission of T2DM in a significant proportion of patients, longitudinal data reveal variable rates of weight regain and recurrence of metabolic dysfunction over extended follow-up periods, typically exceeding five years. Furthermore, MBS impacts a broad spectrum of comorbidities including hypertension, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), with varying degrees of resolution or improvement. However, potential surgical and non-surgical complications, alongside the need for lifelong nutritional and behavioral support, underscore the importance of comprehensive patient selection and rigorous post-operative monitoring. Future research should prioritize the identification of predictive factors for long-term success, optimization of post-operative care pathways, and exploration of novel adjunctive therapies to maximize the sustained benefits of MBS and minimize adverse events. Understanding these factors is crucial for refining clinical guidelines and expanding access to this impactful treatment modality.
