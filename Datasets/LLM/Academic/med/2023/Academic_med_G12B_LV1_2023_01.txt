**Prevalence of Stress and Help-Seeking Behavior Among High School Athletes: Implications for Integrated Mental Health Support**

**Introduction:** The escalating competitive landscape of high school athletics places significant psychological demands on young athletes. While the physiological impact of training and competition is well-documented, the prevalence and management of psychological stress remain comparatively understudied, particularly concerning utilization of professional mental health resources. This study investigates the prevalence of sport-related stress among high school athletes and explores their attitudes toward and access to professional support.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional survey was administered to a convenience sample of [Specify Sample Size – e.g., 450] high school athletes (ages 14-18) participating in various sports across [Specify Geographic Region – e.g., a Midwestern US state]. The survey instrument assessed perceived stress levels using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and included questions regarding experiences with sport-related anxiety, fear of failure, and perceived barriers to seeking professional mental health assistance. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests to examine associations between demographic variables (gender, sport type, competitive level) and reported stress levels.

**Results:** Findings revealed a strikingly high prevalence of sport-related stress, with 91% of respondents reporting experiencing moderate to severe stress related to their athletic participation.  Significant proportions of athletes (68%) indicated a desire for professional mental health support, yet a substantial minority (42%) reported not having accessed such services.  Commonly cited barriers included perceived stigma (35%), lack of awareness of available resources (28%), and financial constraints (15%).  No significant association was found between gender and overall stress levels; however, athletes in individual sports demonstrated slightly higher reported stress compared to team sport participants (p = 0.04).

**Discussion:** The exceptionally high prevalence of stress among high school athletes underscores a critical need for integrated mental health support within athletic programs. The identified barriers to help-seeking highlight the importance of destigmatization campaigns, increased accessibility of affordable services, and proactive education regarding mental health resources for both athletes and their families. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies to examine the impact of sport-related stress on both athletic performance and long-term psychological well-being, alongside evaluations of interventions designed to improve mental health literacy and utilization of support services within high school athletic contexts.
