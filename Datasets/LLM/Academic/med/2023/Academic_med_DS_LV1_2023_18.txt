This 2023 review synthesizes recent evidence informing the NCCN Guidelines for systemic therapy in stage IV metastatic breast cancer. We critically analyze pivotal updates, focusing on the expanding role of CDK4/6 inhibitors in hormone receptor-positive disease and antibody-drug conjugates for triple-negative subtypes. The discussion emphasizes biomarker-driven treatment selection and the integration of novel therapeutic classes to overcome resistance mechanisms. These evidence-based refinements aim to optimize sequencing strategies and personalize management, thereby improving progression-free survival and quality of life for patients with advanced disease. Ongoing clinical trials continue to reshape this dynamic therapeutic landscape.
