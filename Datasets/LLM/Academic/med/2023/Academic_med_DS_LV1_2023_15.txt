**Title:** Prevalence and Management of Sports-Related Psychological Distress Among Adolescent Athletes: A 2023 Cross-Sectional Analysis

**Introduction:** The pursuit of athletic excellence in adolescence is increasingly recognized as a significant psychosocial stressor, yet the prevalence of psychological distress and corresponding help-seeking behaviors in this population remain inadequately characterized. This study aimed to quantify the burden of self-reported sports-related stress and evaluate attitudes toward mental health support among high school athletes.

**Methods:** A cross-sectional survey was administered to a nationally representative sample of 1,250 high school athletes across diverse sports disciplines. Instruments assessed perceived stress levels using the Adolescent Athlete Stress Inventory, along with questionnaires on mental health literacy, help-seeking intentions, and previous engagement with psychological services.

**Results:** Analysis revealed a striking prevalence rate, with 91% of participants reporting clinically significant levels of sports-related stress. A strong positive correlation was identified between competitive level and stress severity. Paradoxically, while 87% of distressed athletes acknowledged the potential efficacy of professional psychological intervention, only 18% had accessed such services. Primary barriers included perceived stigma, limited access to sports-informed mental health professionals, and time constraints.

**Conclusion:** These 2023 data indicate a pervasive mental health burden among adolescent athletes, coupled with a substantial treatment gap. The dissonance between recognized benefit and actual utilization of support underscores an urgent need for systemic reforms. Integrating mental health professionals into athletic ecosystems and implementing proactive, destigmatized screening protocols are critical to safeguarding both the psychological well-being and sports performance of this vulnerable cohort.
