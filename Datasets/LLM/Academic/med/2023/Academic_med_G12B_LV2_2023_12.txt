**Abstract**

The escalating global prevalence of obesity and its associated comorbidities, particularly type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), has spurred continued investigation into effective therapeutic interventions. Metabolic/bariatric surgery (MBS) has emerged as a potent strategy for achieving substantial and sustained weight reduction, demonstrating significant improvements in metabolic health parameters, including glycemic control and resolution or remission of T2DM. Longitudinal studies increasingly demonstrate the durability of these benefits, suggesting a paradigm shift in the management of severe obesity and related metabolic dysfunction. However, the long-term outcomes of MBS are not without potential complexities. While effective in addressing several comorbidities such as hypertension and sleep apnea, ongoing monitoring is crucial to mitigate risks including nutritional deficiencies, gastrointestinal complications, and psychological sequelae. Furthermore, heterogeneity in surgical techniques, patient populations, and post-operative care protocols necessitates further research to refine patient selection criteria and optimize long-term outcomes. Current research efforts are focused on elucidating the mechanisms underlying the metabolic benefits of MBS, particularly the role of gut microbiota modulation and hormonal changes, and on identifying strategies for personalized post-operative management to ensure sustained health improvements and minimize adverse events.  Addressing these knowledge gaps is essential to fully realize the potential of MBS as a durable treatment option for individuals with severe obesity and T2DM.

**Notes on Choices Made & Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Expanded on "lifelong follow-up":** I specified *why* lifelong follow-up is needed (potential complications, need for research).
*   **Acknowledged Heterogeneity:**  Added a sentence recognizing the variability in surgical approaches and patient care, which is a key challenge in the field.
*   **Mentioned Mechanisms:** Briefly alluded to ongoing research into mechanisms (gut microbiota, hormones) to demonstrate awareness of current trends.
*   **Formal Tone:** Used precise language and avoided colloquialisms.
*   **Year Context (2023):** The focus on current research trends reflects the 2023 timeframe.
*   **Keywords:** Expanded the keyword list to be more comprehensive.
