**Abstract**

This report synthesizes recent revisions to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines concerning systemic therapy approaches for patients diagnosed with Stage IV (M1) metastatic breast cancer, current as of 2023. The updated guidelines reflect evolving evidence regarding targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and endocrine strategies in the management of this complex disease state. Key areas of focus include the integration of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) into treatment algorithms, refined recommendations for PI3K inhibitors and CDK4/6 inhibitors based on biomarker status (e.g., ESR1 mutations, PIK3CA alterations), and expanded roles for immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly in combination with endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative disease. This summary aims to provide clinicians with a concise overview of these guideline modifications, facilitating informed decision-making and optimized therapeutic strategies for patients with metastatic breast cancer.
