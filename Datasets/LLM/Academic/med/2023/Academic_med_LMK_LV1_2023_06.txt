Title: Revisiting HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer: Implications of Updated ASCO-CAP Guidelines and Emerging Therapies

Abstract:

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) have recently updated their guidelines for HER2 testing in breast cancer, reflecting the evolving landscape of targeted therapies. The revisions are particularly pertinent in light of the introduction of trastuzumab deruxtecan, a novel antibody-drug conjugate that has demonstrated efficacy in patients with HER2-low breast cancer. This update underscores the critical role of accurate HER2 status determination, leveraging immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a primary testing modality.

The revised guidelines emphasize the distinction between IHC 0 and 1+, recognizing the clinical significance of this dichotomy in the context of emerging therapies. Specifically, the updated recommendations aim to standardize the assessment of HER2 expression, facilitating the identification of patients who may benefit from trastuzumab deruxtecan. By refining the criteria for HER2-low classification, the guidelines provide a framework for clinicians to optimize treatment selection.

The updated ASCO-CAP guidelines highlight the importance of precise IHC scoring, as the nuances in HER2 expression can have profound implications for therapy. The IHC 0 vs 1+ distinction is particularly relevant, as it informs the decision to administer trastuzumab deruxtecan. Studies have shown that patients with HER2-low tumors, often characterized by IHC 1+ expression, derive significant benefit from this targeted therapy.

In conclusion, the 2023 ASCO-CAP guidelines for HER2 testing represent a critical update in the field of breast cancer management. By integrating the latest evidence on trastuzumab deruxtecan and refining the criteria for HER2 status determination, these guidelines empower clinicians to deliver personalized care to patients with breast cancer. As the therapeutic landscape continues to evolve, the importance of accurate HER2 testing will remain a cornerstone of effective treatment selection, underscoring the need for ongoing standardization and quality assurance in IHC testing.
