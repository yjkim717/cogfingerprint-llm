**Abstract: Optimizing Treatment Strategies for Recurrent or Metastatic Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers – A Review of Current NCCN Guidelines**

The management of recurrent or metastatic esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers (EGJ) presents a significant clinical challenge. This review synthesizes current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, focusing on evolving treatment paradigms prioritizing targeted therapies and incorporating robust biomarker testing.  Given the heterogeneous nature of these cancers, particularly at the EGJ, a standardized approach necessitates individualized assessments. The NCCN recommendations increasingly advocate for biomarker analysis – including MSI status, PD-L1 expression, and potentially novel liquid biopsies – to guide selection of appropriate targeted agents. 

Specifically, this document highlights the role of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors within the broader context of NCCN protocols. Early molecular profiling remains crucial to predict response and minimize unnecessary toxicity.  Furthermore, this review underscores the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration and adherence to updated NCCN guidelines to maximize patient outcomes and improve quality of life in patients with advanced esophageal and EGJ malignancies.
