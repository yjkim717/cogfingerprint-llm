**Abstract**

The 2023 revision of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for anal carcinoma reflects evolving therapeutic strategies in this complex malignancy. These guidelines underscore a multidisciplinary treatment paradigm, prioritizing definitive chemoradiation for locally advanced, primary squamous cell carcinomas. Management of recurrent or persistent disease continues to involve surgical resection, while the integration of the AJCC 8th Edition Staging System informs prognosis and treatment planning. Notably, updated recommendations now explicitly address systemic therapeutic options for patients presenting with or developing metastatic anal carcinoma, acknowledging the role of novel agents in improving outcomes. This revision represents a crucial resource for clinicians navigating the multifaceted challenges of anal cancer management.
