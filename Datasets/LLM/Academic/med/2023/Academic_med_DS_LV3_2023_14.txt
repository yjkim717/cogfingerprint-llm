**Abstract**

The integration of advanced large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, into healthcare education represents a paradigm shift with profound implications for pedagogical methodologies across medical, dental, pharmacy, and public health disciplines. As of 2023, the nascent application of this technology demonstrates significant potential to revolutionize traditional educational frameworks. Its primary utility lies in facilitating highly personalized learning trajectories; ChatGPT can generate dynamic, case-specific content, provide instant feedback on diagnostic reasoning, and simulate patient interactions, thereby tailoring the educational experience to individual learner proficiency and pace. This capacity for on-demand, adaptive tutoring holds particular promise for enhancing clinical reasoning and diagnostic acumen, allowing students to engage in low-stakes, repetitive practice with complex, multi-system clinical presentations.

However, the rapid adoption of these AI-driven tools is not without substantial ethical and pedagogical challenges that necessitate rigorous scholarly and institutional scrutiny. A paramount concern is the veracity and reliability of the information generated. LLMs are susceptible to "hallucinations"—the generation of plausible yet factually incorrect or fabricated content—which poses a direct threat to patient safety if uncritically integrated into clinical decision-making processes. Furthermore, the convenience of AI-generated summaries and analyses risks engendering a passive learning culture, potentially eroding the foundational development of critical thinking and analytical skills essential for competent healthcare practitioners. Concurrently, the use of these platforms raises critical data privacy issues, as student inputs, including potentially sensitive patient case details, are processed on external servers, creating vulnerabilities for data breaches and non-compliance with regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. Consequently, a measured and critical approach is imperative. The future of ChatGPT in healthcare education hinges on developing robust validation frameworks for AI-generated content, designing pedagogical strategies that leverage AI as a supplement rather than a substitute for deep cognitive engagement, and establishing clear data governance protocols to ensure ethical and secure implementation.
