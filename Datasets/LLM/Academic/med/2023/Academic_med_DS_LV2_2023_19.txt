This 2023 academic review synthesizes the updated National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. The analysis underscores that definitive chemoradiation remains the cornerstone of primary, non-metastatic disease management, aligning treatment intensity with AJCC 8th edition staging for prognostication. For localized disease, the guidelines reinforce concurrent fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiation as the standard-of-care, optimizing locoregional control. The review further details the evolving paradigm for systemic therapy in recurrent or metastatic settings, highlighting the integration of newer agents, including immunotherapy and targeted therapies, into treatment algorithms. These 2023 recommendations reflect a refined, multidisciplinary approach, aiming to personalize therapeutic strategies based on disease stage and patient fitness, thereby improving oncologic outcomes while carefully considering treatment-related toxicities.
