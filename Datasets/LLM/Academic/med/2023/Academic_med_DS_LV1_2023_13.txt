**Abstract**

In 2023, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established a significantly reduced temporary tolerable daily intake (t-TDI) of 0.2 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day for bisphenol A (BPA), a pervasive environmental xenobiotic. This re-evaluation was predicated on a systematic review of emerging evidence, which identified the polarization of T-helper 17 (Th17) lymphocytes as a critical and sensitive endpoint of BPA immunotoxicity. Preclinical investigations consistently demonstrate that low-dose BPA exposure promotes Th17 cell differentiation and the subsequent secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A, thereby disrupting immunoregulatory balance. This Th17-skewed response is mechanistically linked to the exacerbation of autoimmune pathologies and inflammatory conditions in animal models. The newly established TDI, several orders of magnitude lower than previous guidelines, reflects an enhanced understanding of BPA's potent, non-monotonic dose-response effects on the immune system, particularly during critical windows of development. Consequently, EFSA's comprehensive exposure assessment concluded that both mean and high-level dietary exposure across all age groups in Europe exceed this revised TDI, indicating a potential health concern for a significant portion of the population. This paradigm shift in risk assessment underscores the necessity for stringent regulatory measures to mitigate BPA exposure and highlights an urgent need for further epidemiological research to elucidate the clinical implications of BPA-driven immunomodulation on human autoimmune disease incidence and progression. The 2023 opinion marks a pivotal moment in recognizing the immune system as a primary target for this endocrine-disrupting chemical.
