**Abstract**

The pursuit of efficacious and targeted therapeutics necessitates a refined understanding of drug target efficacy and long-term consequences. This review synthesizes the burgeoning application of Mendelian randomization (MR) within modern drug development strategies. MR leverages genetic variation – specifically, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in regions flanking putative drug targets – as instrumental variables to infer causal relationships between targets and clinically relevant outcomes.  By integrating human genetic data with pharmacological hypotheses, MR offers a powerful alternative to traditional randomized controlled trials, particularly where prospective human studies are limited.  

This approach facilitates prediction of potential adverse effects and enhances target selection, improving the efficiency of preclinical and clinical development.  Furthermore, MR’s ability to disentangle correlation from causation is increasingly informing the identification of novel drug targets and refining our understanding of complex disease pathways.  Emerging methodologies, including heterogeneous and weighted MR, are expanding the scope and robustness of these analyses, representing a crucial tool for accelerating drug discovery in 2023 and beyond.
