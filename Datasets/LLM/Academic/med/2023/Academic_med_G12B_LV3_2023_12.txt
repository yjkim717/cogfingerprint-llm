**Abstract**

Metabolic/bariatric surgery has emerged as a pivotal intervention in the management of severe obesity and its associated metabolic complications. This review, conducted in 2023, synthesizes current literature to evaluate the durable clinical outcomes observed following bariatric procedures. Evidence increasingly demonstrates substantial and sustained weight loss, alongside significant improvements in obesity-related comorbidities, notably type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular risk factors. While these benefits are well-documented, the long-term impact on other comorbid conditions, including gastrointestinal health and nutritional deficiencies, warrants continued investigation. Furthermore, this review underscores the evolving landscape of surgical techniques and patient selection criteria. Despite advancements, challenges remain regarding optimizing surgical approaches, mitigating postoperative complications, and ensuring comprehensive, multidisciplinary long-term follow-up care. Future research should prioritize standardized outcome measures and longitudinal studies to inform updated clinical guidelines and refine the role of metabolic/bariatric surgery within a holistic obesity management framework.
