**Abstract**

The accurate interpretation of plasma biomarkers remains a significant challenge in Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) research. This study addresses the critical issue of biological variation within these biomarkers in cognitively healthy individuals.  Recognizing substantial inter-individual differences, we examined the extent of variance observed across a panel of routinely measured plasma biomarkers.  Understanding this inherent biological variation is paramount for robust biomarker validation and prospective AD studies.  By establishing a baseline profile of variability in healthy controls, we aim to refine the sensitivity and specificity of future diagnostic and prognostic applications utilizing blood-based biomarkers for AD detection and risk stratification.
