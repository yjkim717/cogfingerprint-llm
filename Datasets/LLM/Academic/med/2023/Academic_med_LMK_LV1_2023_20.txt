Title: Reevaluation of HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer: Implications of Updated ASCO-CAP Guidelines on Emerging Therapies

Abstract

The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer have been significantly influenced by the advancements in HER2 testing and the subsequent development of targeted therapies. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) periodically update their guidelines to reflect the evolving understanding of HER2 testing and its clinical implications. The latest update, released in 2023, reaffirms the 2018 recommendations and underscores the distinction between immunohistochemistry (IHC) 0 and 1+ results in HER2 testing. This clarification has substantial implications for patient stratification and treatment decisions, particularly in the context of emerging antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) such as trastuzumab deruxtecan.

The updated ASCO-CAP guidelines emphasize the importance of accurate HER2 testing in breast cancer, given its role in predicting response to HER2-targeted therapies. The distinction between IHC 0 and 1+ results is critical, as it influences the classification of patients into HER2-negative or HER2-low categories, respectively. HER2-low tumors, characterized by IHC 1+ or 2+ without HER2 gene amplification, have been found to benefit from certain ADCs, including trastuzumab deruxtecan. This ADC has demonstrated significant efficacy in patients with HER2-low metastatic breast cancer, highlighting the need for precise HER2 testing to identify patients who may benefit from these therapies.

The updated guidelines also reinforce the need for rigorous quality assurance and standardization in HER2 testing, including the use of validated assays and adherence to established testing algorithms. This is particularly important in the context of ADCs, where accurate identification of HER2 expression levels is crucial for determining patient eligibility for these treatments.

In conclusion, the 2023 ASCO-CAP guidelines update for HER2 testing in breast cancer reaffirms the importance of accurate and standardized testing practices. The distinction between IHC 0 and 1+ results has significant implications for patient stratification and treatment decisions, particularly in the context of emerging ADCs like trastuzumab deruxtecan. As the therapeutic landscape for breast cancer continues to evolve, adherence to these guidelines will be essential for ensuring that patients receive optimal care based on their HER2 status.
