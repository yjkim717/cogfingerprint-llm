**Abstract**

The increasing utility of plasma biomarkers in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis and monitoring necessitates a comprehensive understanding of inherent biological variation within apparently healthy individuals. While research has focused primarily on group-level biomarker changes associated with AD pathology, substantial inter-individual variability remains poorly characterized. This study addresses this critical gap by examining the extent of biological variation in key AD plasma biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-β 42/40 ratio, p-tau181) across a cohort of cognitively normal participants. Quantifying this baseline variability is essential for accurate interpretation of longitudinal biomarker trajectories and improved clinical translation in early AD detection and therapeutic monitoring, particularly as novel assays and personalized medicine approaches gain prominence in 2023.
