**Abstract**

The interpretation of plasma biomarker profiles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research is frequently hampered by substantial biological variation. This study examines the extent of this variation within a cohort of healthy individuals, utilizing a panel of established plasma biomarkers. Quantifying inter-individual variability is crucial for establishing reliable thresholds and diagnostic cutoffs.  We employed advanced statistical methods to assess biomarker distribution and correlation, seeking to identify sources of discordance.  These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of biomarker utility and inform the development of improved longitudinal assessment strategies for AD risk stratification in 2023.
