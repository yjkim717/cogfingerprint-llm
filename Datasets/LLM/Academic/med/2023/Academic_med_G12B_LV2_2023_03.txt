**Abstract**

**Optimizing Alzheimer’s Disease Diagnostics: A Two-Step Workflow Integrating Plasma p-tau217 and Amyloid-β Status for Enhanced Efficiency and Reduced Resource Utilization**

The escalating prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the associated cognitive burden necessitate the development of efficient and cost-effective diagnostic strategies. Current diagnostic pathways often involve sequential, resource-intensive procedures including amyloid-β (Aβ) PET imaging or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, followed by tau PET or CSF tau assessment. This study investigates a novel, two-step workflow integrating plasma phosphorylated tau at amino acid 217 (p-tau217) as a primary screening tool to predict Aβ positivity and subsequently refine the need for confirmatory Aβ assessment in patients presenting with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

We hypothesized that plasma p-tau217 exhibits sufficient sensitivity and specificity to accurately identify individuals with underlying Aβ pathology, thereby enabling a targeted approach to confirmatory testing. The implemented workflow involves an initial assessment of plasma p-tau217 levels. Individuals demonstrating elevated p-tau217 are then proceeded with established Aβ biomarker confirmation (e.g., Aβ PET or CSF Aβ42/40 ratio). Conversely, those with low p-tau217 levels are considered unlikely to have significant Aβ pathology, potentially obviating the need for expensive and logistically challenging confirmatory Aβ assessments.

Preliminary results demonstrate that this two-step approach achieves high diagnostic accuracy in identifying Aβ-positive MCI patients. The findings suggest a significant reduction in the overall number of confirmatory Aβ tests required, leading to substantial cost savings and improved resource allocation within clinical settings. Furthermore, this streamlined workflow may facilitate earlier and more accessible AD diagnosis, particularly within resource-limited environments. Future research will focus on validating this approach across diverse patient cohorts, exploring its utility in individuals with atypical AD presentations, and investigating the potential for integrating other plasma biomarkers to further refine diagnostic precision and predictive capabilities.  The implementation of such strategies is crucial for advancing AD research and improving patient care in the context of an aging global population.
