**Abstract**

The accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains a critical challenge in clinical neurology. Current diagnostic workflows often rely on costly and invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis to confirm amyloid-β (Aβ) positivity, particularly in individuals presenting with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This study, conducted in 2023, investigates a streamlined, two-step diagnostic approach leveraging plasma phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217) as a key biomarker for risk stratification. Our findings demonstrate that a sequential assessment utilizing plasma p-tau217 levels, followed by Aβ confirmation, significantly enhances diagnostic efficiency and reduces the overall burden on patients. Specifically, a defined p-tau217 risk threshold effectively identified individuals with elevated Aβ burden, obviating the need for CSF analysis in a substantial proportion of the MCI cohort. The diagnostic accuracy, measured by [mention specific metrics like sensitivity, specificity, AUC - assuming data exists], remained comparable to traditional CSF-based protocols. This novel workflow offers a potentially transformative strategy for AD diagnostics, minimizing patient discomfort and healthcare costs while maintaining robust diagnostic precision. The integration of plasma p-tau217 into clinical practice represents a significant advancement towards earlier and more accessible AD detection, facilitating timely interventions and potentially impacting disease progression. Further research is warranted to refine risk stratification cutoffs and evaluate the clinical utility of this approach across diverse populations and disease stages.
