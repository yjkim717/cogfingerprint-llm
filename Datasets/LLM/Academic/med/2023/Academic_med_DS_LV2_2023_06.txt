**Abstract**

The 2023 update to the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer represents a critical evolution in diagnostic standardization. This guideline reaffirms the foundational role of accurate HER2 status determination, primarily through immunohistochemistry (IHC) for protein expression and in situ hybridization (ISH) for gene amplification, as a prerequisite for effective anti-HER2 therapies. However, a pivotal advancement in this iteration is the formal recognition of the clinical significance in meticulously distinguishing between IHC 0 and IHC 1+ results. This distinction, previously considered diagnostically equivalent as "HER2-negative," is now paramount in the era of novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). Emerging clinical trial data demonstrate that tumors classified as HER2-low (IHC 1+ or IHC 2+/ISH-negative) exhibit significant responsiveness to these next-generation ADCs, which fundamentally alters the therapeutic landscape. Consequently, the updated guidelines emphasize rigorous pre-analytical tissue handling, stringent assay validation, and ongoing laboratory proficiency testing to minimize false-negative IHC 0 categorizations and ensure the reliable identification of the HER2-low population. This refinement underscores a paradigm shift from a binary HER2-positive/negative classification towards a more nuanced, continuum-based model. The 2023 ASCO-CAP update thus serves to harmonize diagnostic precision with therapeutic innovation, ensuring that pathological reporting optimally informs clinical decision-making and facilitates patient access to a new generation of highly effective targeted treatments.
