Of particular concern in adolescent sports medicine is the escalating prevalence of psychological distress among high school athletes. This study investigates the incidence and management of sports-related stress within this demographic. A cross-sectional survey was administered in 2023 to a cohort of 200 high school athletes to quantify stress prevalence and identify gaps in mental health support. The findings reveal a critical public health issue: 91% of respondents reported experiencing significant sports-related stress, indicative of a near-universal challenge. Alarmingly, this high prevalence exists alongside a substantial treatment gap; qualitative data suggest a strong desire for professional psychological intervention that remains largely unmet. These results underscore a systemic failure in current athletic support frameworks, which often prioritize physical health over psychological well-being. The dissonance between the high demand for and low access to mental health services necessitates an urgent paradigm shift. We conclude that integrating standardized, accessible sports psychology and psychiatric resources into secondary school athletic programs is not merely beneficial but essential. Such medical and psychological interventions are critical for mitigating long-term adverse outcomes and safeguarding the holistic health of student-athletes.
