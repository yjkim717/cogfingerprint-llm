**Title:** Refining HER2 Diagnostic Paradigms: A Critical Appraisal of the 2023 ASCO-CAP Guideline Update in the Era of Novel Antibody-Drug Conjugates

**Background:** The classification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in breast carcinoma, traditionally dichotomized as positive or negative, has been fundamentally guided by the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines. This framework, primarily reliant on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH), was designed to predict response to HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab. However, the advent of potent antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), specifically trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), has demonstrated significant efficacy in tumors previously classified as HER2-negative, challenging this binary diagnostic model.

**Methods:** This commentary provides a critical analysis of the 2023 ASCO-CAP guideline update, contextualizing its recommendations within the evolving landscape of metastatic breast cancer therapeutics. We examine the guideline's reaffirmation of existing testing algorithms for classic HER2 positivity alongside its nuanced considerations for the "HER2-low" phenotype.

**Results:** The 2023 iteration maintains rigorous standards for HER2 IHC and ISH testing methodologies and interpretation criteria to ensure diagnostic accuracy and reproducibility. Its pivotal advancement is the formal recognition of the clinical utility in distinguishing IHC 0 (absent) from IHC 1+ (low expression) results. This distinction, while not altering the core diagnostic algorithm, is now acknowledged as critically relevant for patient selection for T-DXd. The guidelines underscore the necessity for pathologists to report these categories with high concordance, as the IHC 1+ subset defines the "HER2-low" population eligible for this transformative therapy.

**Conclusion:** The 2023 ASCO-CAP update represents a paradigm shift, transitioning from a purely binary HER2 classification to a more nuanced continuum. By affirming traditional testing protocols while integrating new clinical imperatives for low HER2 expression, the guidelines ensure diagnostic robustness while enabling precision oncology. This evolution mandates ongoing pathologist education and rigorous laboratory quality assurance to accurately identify patients who may benefit from expanding ADC therapeutic options.
