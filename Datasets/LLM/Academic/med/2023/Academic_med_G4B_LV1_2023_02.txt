**Abstract**

The accurate interpretation of plasma biomarker profiles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research is frequently hampered by significant biological variation. This study aimed to quantify the inter-individual variability observed within a panel of plasma biomarkers in a cohort of healthy controls.  Understanding this baseline variation is crucial for establishing reliable diagnostic thresholds and longitudinal monitoring strategies. Data analysis revealed considerable discordance across measured biomarkers, highlighting the need for standardized collection protocols and larger sample sizes.  These findings underscore the importance of accounting for biological variation when utilizing blood-based biomarkers to facilitate early AD detection and risk stratification by 2023.
