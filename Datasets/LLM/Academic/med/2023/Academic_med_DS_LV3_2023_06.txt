The 2023 update to the American Society of Clinical Oncology-College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast carcinoma represents a significant evolution in biomarker assessment paradigms. While the core algorithmic approach to identifying HER2-positive (IHC 3+ or ISH-positive) disease remains substantively unchanged to ensure continuity and reliability in clinical practice, the guidelines now formally acknowledge the critical distinction between immunohistochemistry (IHC) scores of 0 and 1+. This refinement is driven by the emergence of novel antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), specifically trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), which have demonstrated profound efficacy in the newly defined "HER2-low" metastatic breast cancer populationâ€”a cohort historically classified as HER2-negative. Consequently, the updated recommendations underscore the necessity for stringent pre-analytical tissue handling, robust assay validation, and pathologist training to achieve reproducible discrimination between these subtle IHC expression levels. This paradigm shift elevates the role of precision pathology from merely identifying eligibility for traditional anti-HER2 therapies to enabling patient selection for a broader spectrum of targeted agents. The guidelines thus reinforce the foundational principles of accurate HER2 testing while adapting to the expanding therapeutic landscape, ensuring that pathological reporting directly informs contemporary treatment decisions and optimizes patient access to effective, biomarker-directed therapies.
