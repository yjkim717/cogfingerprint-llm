This document details revisions prioritizing tailored treatment strategies for patients presenting with stage IV (M1) disease. The emphasis now incorporates a more nuanced approach, acknowledging the potential for alternative therapies following initial systemic failure.  Specifically, the guidelines underscore the importance of considering biomarker-driven decisions and integrating novel agents into treatment regimens.  Furthermore, the report highlights evolving standards for supportive care and palliative interventions within this challenging patient population.  Continued monitoring of treatment efficacy and patient-reported outcomes remains crucial to optimizing care pathways for individuals with metastatic breast cancer.
