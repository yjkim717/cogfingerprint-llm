The 2023 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology provide a critical framework for the contemporary management of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus. This analysis synthesizes the guideline recommendations, which advocate for a multidisciplinary approach centered on definitive chemoradiation as the primary treatment modality for localized disease. The regimen typically involves a combination of radiation therapy with concurrent 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin-C. For locally advanced or recurrent tumors not amenable to salvage surgery, as well as for metastatic disease, the guidelines detail the role of systemic therapy, including cisplatin-based combinations. Staging, as per the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) system, remains paramount for risk stratification and therapeutic decision-making. These evidence-based recommendations standardize care, aiming to optimize oncologic outcomes, including organ preservation and survival, while managing treatment-related toxicity.
