**Abstract**

The 2023 update to the jointly developed ASCO-CAP guidelines regarding human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) testing in breast cancer reflects a nuanced evolution in clinical practice. Historically, HER2 status determination has relied on immunohistochemistry (IHC) scoring, with established thresholds guiding treatment decisions. This revision explicitly acknowledges the growing clinical significance of differentiating between IHC 0 and IHC 1+ staining patterns, primarily driven by the recent approval and demonstrated efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) in patients with low HER2 expression. While robust prospective data specifically investigating T-DXd efficacy in IHC 0 breast cancers remain limited, the observed clinical benefit in IHC 1+ tumors has prompted a re-evaluation of the diagnostic and therapeutic implications of this intermediate staining level. The guidelines reaffirm existing recommendations for HER2-positive, HER2-low, and HER2-negative disease, while providing updated guidance on the management of IHC 1+ tumors, emphasizing the need for careful consideration of T-DXd as a treatment option. This update underscores the dynamic nature of breast cancer therapeutics and the importance of continuous guideline adaptation in response to emerging evidence and novel targeted therapies. Further research is warranted to definitively characterize the benefit-risk profile of T-DXd in IHC 0 tumors.
