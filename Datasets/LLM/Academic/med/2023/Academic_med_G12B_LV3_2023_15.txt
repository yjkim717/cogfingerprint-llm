**Abstract**

This study investigated the prevalence and correlates of stress and mental health concerns among high school athletes (n=200) in 2023. Findings indicate a strikingly high prevalence (91%) of sport-related stress, with performance anxiety, particularly the fear of failure, identified as a dominant etiological factor. Notably, a considerable proportion of participants (approximately X%) expressed a desire for professional mental health intervention but reported barriers to access. These results underscore a critical gap in mental health support services for this vulnerable population. The findings advocate for the implementation of accessible and destigmatized mental health resources within athletic programs to mitigate adverse psychological outcomes and optimize athletic performance. Further research should explore specific intervention strategies tailored to the unique stressors faced by high school athletes.
