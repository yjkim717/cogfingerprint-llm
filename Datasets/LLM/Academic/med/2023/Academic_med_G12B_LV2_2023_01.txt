Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract based on the provided summary, written as if from a researcher in 2023, aiming for ~287 words and employing precise terminology.  I've expanded on the initial findings to create a more robust abstract suitable for a medical or sports psychology journal.  I've also included potential implications and future research directions.

**Prevalence of Stress and Mental Health Needs Among High School Athletes: A Cross-Sectional Examination**

**Abstract**

The escalating demands placed on young athletes within the high school competitive landscape necessitate a thorough understanding of the psychological stressors impacting their well-being and performance. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of sport-related stress and associated mental health needs among a sample of high school athletes. Data were collected through anonymous self-report questionnaires assessing perceived stress levels, fear of failure, and help-seeking attitudes. Analysis revealed a strikingly high prevalence of stress, with 91% of participants (n=XXX – *[Researcher would insert actual sample size here]*) reporting experiencing stress related to their athletic participation. A significant proportion (YY% – *[Researcher would insert actual percentage and n here]*) indicated experiencing clinically relevant levels of stress, correlating with elevated scores on the Fear of Failure subscale of the questionnaire.

Further analysis demonstrated a strong association between perceived stress and reported symptoms of anxiety and depressive mood, suggesting a potential pathway to compromised mental health. Notably, a substantial percentage of athletes (ZZ% – *[Researcher would insert actual percentage and n here]*) explicitly expressed a desire for access to and benefit from professional mental health support, highlighting a critical unmet need within this population. These findings underscore the pervasive nature of stress within high school athletics and suggest that fear of failure may be a significant mediating factor impacting both psychological well-being and potentially, sports performance.  The study’s implications point toward the urgent need for integrated mental health services within school athletic programs, including preventative interventions focused on stress management, resilience training, and destigmatization of mental health support. Future research should explore longitudinal effects of chronic stress on athlete development, investigate the efficacy of targeted interventions, and examine the role of coaching practices and parental expectations in contributing to or mitigating athlete stress.

**Important Notes & Customization Points for the Researcher:**

*   **Replace the placeholders:**  `XXX`, `YY%`, and `ZZ%` with the *actual* data from your study. This is crucial for a proper abstract.
*   **Sample Size:** Clearly state the sample size (n=XXX).
*   **Specific Measures:** If you used specific standardized questionnaires (e.g., Perceived Stress Scale, Fear of Failure Scale, GAD-7, PHQ-9), *mention them by name* in the abstract. This adds rigor.
*   **Statistical Significance:** If you performed statistical tests, briefly mention the significance levels (e.g., "a significant positive correlation (p < 0.05) was observed...").
*   **Specific Population:** If your sample was limited to a specific sport or demographic group, mention that.
*   **Journal Target:** Tailor the language slightly to match the style of the
