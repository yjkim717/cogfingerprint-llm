**Abstract**

Recent advances in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) research increasingly rely on plasma biomarkers for early detection and prognosis. However, significant biological variation in these biomarkers presents a substantial challenge. This study examines the extent of this variation across a cohort of individuals, utilizing established blood biomarkers. Understanding and accounting for this biological variation is crucial for robust data interpretation and improved clinical utility of plasma-based AD diagnostics in 2023.
