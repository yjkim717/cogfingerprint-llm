**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in targeted therapies necessitate continued refinement of diagnostic strategies within breast cancer management. This abstract examines the 2023 update to the American Society of Clinical Oncology – College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guideline for HER2 testing, reflecting the evolving clinical landscape. While the guideline maintains established protocols for immunohistochemistry (IHC) utilizing the 0/1+ HER2 cutoff, it increasingly emphasizes the translational significance of these results, particularly in the context of trastuzumab deruxtecan’s approval for patients with tumors exhibiting IHC 0 or 1+ staining.  The incorporation of this novel agent necessitates a nuanced interpretation of HER2 status, moving beyond a strict binary classification.  Further research is warranted to delineate predictive biomarkers within the 1+ HER2 subgroup and to optimize treatment sequencing.  Ultimately, this guideline update underscores the importance of individualized approaches to HER2-positive breast cancer care, aligning diagnostic precision with therapeutic efficacy.
