**Abstract**

The 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology – College of American Pathologists (ASCO-CAP) guidelines for HER2 testing in breast cancer represent a critical refinement of diagnostic protocols. While maintaining established thresholds for HER2-positive status, the updated guidelines increasingly recognize the clinical relevance of immunohistochemical (IHC) 1+ and 2+ results – previously considered equivocal – particularly within the evolving landscape of targeted therapies. Specifically, the incorporation of antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) agents, such as trastuzumab deruxtecan, necessitates a nuanced interpretation of these intermediate IHC findings.  This shift underscores the importance of comprehensive molecular profiling, including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), to definitively establish HER2 status. Consequently, laboratories must ensure adherence to updated ASCO-CAP recommendations to optimize patient management and treatment selection, ultimately improving outcomes for individuals diagnosed with breast cancer.
