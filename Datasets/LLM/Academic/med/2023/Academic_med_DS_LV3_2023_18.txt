The NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer, Version 4.2023, represent a paradigm shift in managing stage IV disease by prioritizing tumor biology to guide systemic therapy selection. This evolution moves beyond a purely anatomic approach, integrating comprehensive biomarker profiling—including hormone receptor status, HER2 expression, and genomic signatures—to stratify patients for targeted interventions. For hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer, the guidelines emphasize CDK4/6 inhibitors combined with endocrine therapy as a cornerstone, while advocating for antibody-drug conjugates in HER2-low disease. In triple-negative subtypes, immunotherapy and PARP inhibitors are highlighted based on PD-L1 and BRCA status. This precision oncology framework facilitates sequential treatment strategies that optimize progression-free survival and quality of life, underscoring the necessity of repeated molecular assessments throughout the disease continuum to adapt therapeutic approaches dynamically.
