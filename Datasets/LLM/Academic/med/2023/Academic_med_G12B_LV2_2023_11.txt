**Abstract**

The accurate and automated segmentation of pediatric brain tumors remains a significant challenge in neuro-oncology, demanding robust algorithms capable of handling the complexities of developing brains and variable tumor presentation. This paper addresses this challenge within the framework of the 2023 BraTS-PEDs (Brain Tumor Segmentation â€“ Pediatric) challenge, a collaborative initiative designed to advance the state-of-the-art in pediatric brain tumor segmentation. The challenge leverages standardized multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) data, specifically encompassing T1-weighted, T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1Gd), T2-weighted, and FLAIR sequences, to facilitate the development and evaluation of novel segmentation methodologies.  The focus is primarily on glioma subtypes prevalent in pediatric populations, necessitating algorithms that can effectively delineate tumor core, edema, and enhancing tumor regions.  The BraTS-PEDs challenge provides a publicly accessible, rigorously curated dataset and a standardized evaluation protocol based on Dice score, sensitivity, and Hausdorff distance, allowing for objective comparison of different approaches. Participation in and analysis of this challenge are expected to yield critical insights into the strengths and limitations of current deep learning-based segmentation techniques applied to pediatric brain tumors, ultimately contributing to improved diagnostic accuracy, treatment planning, and longitudinal monitoring of these complex pathologies.  Future research directions stemming from this effort include exploring methods for incorporating clinical metadata and investigating the transferability of models trained on BraTS-PEDs data to unseen clinical cohorts.
