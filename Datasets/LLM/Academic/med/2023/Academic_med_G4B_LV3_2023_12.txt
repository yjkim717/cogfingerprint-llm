**Abstract**

Metabolic and bariatric surgical interventions are increasingly recognized as a pivotal strategy for managing obesity and its attendant comorbid conditions. Recent longitudinal studies demonstrate sustained improvements in metabolic parameters – including insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and lipid profiles – following surgical procedures. However, the long-term efficacy necessitates careful patient selection and robust post-operative monitoring. This 2023 review synthesizes current evidence, acknowledging both the substantial benefits and inherent risks associated with these techniques. Further research is crucial to refine surgical approaches, optimize patient care pathways, and comprehensively evaluate the evolving impact on long-term health outcomes. Specifically, investigation into the interplay between surgical technique, patient adherence, and the persistence of comorbidities remains a priority for advancing the field and ensuring equitable access to effective obesity management.
