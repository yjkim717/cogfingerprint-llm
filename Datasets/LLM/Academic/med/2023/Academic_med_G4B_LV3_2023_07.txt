**Abstract**

The increasing incidence of IDH-mutant gliomas necessitates novel therapeutic strategies. This study reports on the outcomes of a Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating vorasidenib, a selective IDH inhibitor, in patients with recurrent or residual IDH-mutant grade 2 gliomas. Results indicated a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and a demonstrable delay in disease progression compared to patients receiving a placebo. The trial’s efficacy highlights the potential of targeted IDH inhibition in managing this challenging patient population.  Specifically, the observed benefit appears to be concentrated in individuals harboring *idh1* or *idh2* mutations, suggesting a mechanistic link between these mutations and vorasidenib’s activity. Further investigation into predictive biomarkers and optimal dosing regimens is warranted.  These findings represent a crucial step forward in personalized oncology and contribute to the evolving landscape of treatment options for IDH-mutant glioma patients, with vorasidenib poised for expanded clinical consideration.
