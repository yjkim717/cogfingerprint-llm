**Abstract**

The 2023 CBTN-CONNECT-DIPGR-ASNR-MICCAI BraTS-PEDs challenge represents a significant advancement in the field of pediatric neuro-oncology, specifically targeting the development and validation of automated brain tumor segmentation techniques. Building upon the established Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) framework, this novel initiative addresses the critical need for improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning in pediatric glioma. Utilizing multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, the challenge benchmarks artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms designed for volumetric segmentation of these complex tumors. The primary objective is to accelerate the translation of robust, reproducible segmentation tools into clinical practice, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of clinical trials and contributing to improved patient outcomes. This rigorous benchmarking process fosters innovation in AI-driven medical imaging analysis, providing a crucial platform for evaluating and comparing the performance of diverse segmentation methodologies within the specialized context of pediatric brain tumors.
