## Abstract: Contemporary Management of Anal Carcinoma: An Evidence-Based Review of NCCN Guidelines and Emerging Therapeutic Strategies (2023)

Anal carcinoma, predominantly squamous cell histology, presents a complex therapeutic challenge requiring a multidisciplinary approach. This review examines the current landscape of anal carcinoma management, focusing on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and recent advancements in systemic therapy. The NCCN guidelines provide a framework for accurate staging utilizing the AJCC 8th edition classification, crucial for guiding treatment decisions.  Local disease management primarily involves definitive chemoradiation, with cisplatin-based regimens remaining standard.  However, the evolving understanding of molecular mechanisms and the identification of predictive biomarkers have spurred investigation into novel systemic therapies. This review explores the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors, particularly in mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) tumors, and targeted therapies for specific molecular alterations. Furthermore, we discuss strategies for managing metastatic disease, including palliative chemotherapy regimens and clinical trial opportunities.  The aim is to provide a concise overview of current best practices and highlight areas of ongoing research focused on optimizing treatment outcomes and improving quality of life for patients diagnosed with anal carcinoma.
