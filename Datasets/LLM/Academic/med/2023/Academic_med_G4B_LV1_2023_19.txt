**Abstract**

Squamous cell anal carcinoma (SCAC) presents a complex therapeutic challenge, necessitating integrated management strategies. Recent 2023 NCCN guidelines emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to SCAC, particularly in locally advanced and metastatic disease. The cornerstone of treatment remains chemoradiation, often administered utilizing standardized fractionation schedules and incorporating 5-fluorouracil.  Given the potential for local recurrence, consideration of surgical intervention, typically brachytherapy-boosted resection, is routinely evaluated, especially in patients with favorable margins following initial chemoradiation.  This approach aligns with the NCCN’s focus on minimizing morbidity while optimizing oncologic outcomes.  Further research is warranted to refine individualized treatment plans, particularly regarding sequencing of chemoradiation and surgery, and to better delineate predictive biomarkers for response to multimodal therapy.  Adherence to these evolving guidelines is crucial for improved patient survival and quality of life.
