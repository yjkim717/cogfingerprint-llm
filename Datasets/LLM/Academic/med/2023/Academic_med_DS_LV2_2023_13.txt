**Abstract**

The 2023 re-evaluation of bisphenol A (BPA) by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) represents a paradigm shift in the human health risk assessment of this ubiquitous environmental contaminant. This review critically examines the pivotal scientific evidence underpinning EFSA's decision to drastically lower the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for BPA from a previous temporary level of 4 µg/kg body weight/day to a new, substantially reduced TDI of 0.2 nanograms/kg body weight/day—a four-order-of-magnitude reduction. The primary driver for this unprecedented revision was the identification of novel and robust toxicological data implicating BPA in adverse effects on the immune system. Specifically, evidence from animal models and supporting in vitro studies indicates that low-dose BPA exposure can promote the polarization of T-helper lymphocytes towards a pro-inflammatory Th17 phenotype. This dysregulation of cellular immunity is of significant concern, as it is mechanistically linked to the development and exacerbation of autoimmune pathologies and inflammatory disorders. Consequently, the re-evaluation concludes that the most sensitive endpoint for BPA toxicity is immunomodulation, rather than traditional reproductive or developmental effects. A critical analysis of European dietary exposure data reveals that aggregate exposure from food contact materials and other sources exceeds the newly established TDI by several orders of magnitude across all demographic groups. This profound discrepancy underscores a significant and widespread public health concern, necessitating urgent regulatory action and a re-examination of BPA's permitted uses to mitigate population-level immunological risks.
