Title: Stress Prevalence and Coping Mechanisms among High School Athletes: A Cross-Sectional Analysis

Abstract:

High school athletes are increasingly recognized as a vulnerable population in terms of mental health, with stress being a significant predictor of overall well-being. Despite the growing body of research in sports psychology, the prevalence of stress and coping strategies employed by high school athletes remain underexplored. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the stress levels among high school athletes and their coping mechanisms. A total of 250 high school athletes (mean age: 16.4 Â± 1.2 years) participated in the study, completing a comprehensive questionnaire assessing stress levels, coping strategies, and demographic information. The results showed a high prevalence of stress among the participants, with 70.4% reporting moderate to severe stress levels. The primary sources of stress identified were competition-related pressure (55.2%), academic expectations (31.6%), and coach-athlete relationships (13.2%). The coping mechanisms most frequently employed by the athletes were problem-focused coping (45.6%), emotional regulation (30.4%), and social support seeking (24%). The findings of this study underscore the need for targeted stress management interventions and mental health support services for high school athletes. The results have implications for sports psychologists, coaches, and educators working with this population, highlighting the importance of promoting healthy coping mechanisms and providing resources to mitigate the negative effects of stress on athlete mental health. As the first study to investigate stress prevalence and coping mechanisms among high school athletes in a comprehensive manner, this research contributes significantly to the existing literature in the field of sports psychology.
