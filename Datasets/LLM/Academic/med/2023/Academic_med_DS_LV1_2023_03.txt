**Title:** A Two-Step Plasma p-tau217 Workflow for Efficient Screening of Amyloid-β Pathology in a Memory Clinic Cohort

**Background:** The accurate detection of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is crucial for diagnosis and treatment. While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and positron emission tomography (PET) are the reference standards, their high cost and limited accessibility preclude widespread use. Blood-based biomarkers, particularly phosphorylated tau217 (p-tau217), show great promise as scalable screening tools. This study evaluates the clinical utility of a two-step diagnostic workflow centered on plasma p-tau217 to identify Aβ positivity and reduce the need for confirmatory testing.

**Methods:** In a prospective, cross-sectional study of 500 participants from a tertiary memory clinic (cognitively unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and AD dementia), plasma p-tau217 was measured using an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry assay. All participants underwent CSF Aβ42/40 testing to define Aβ status (positive/negative). We established two plasma p-tau217 thresholds: a "rule-out" threshold with high sensitivity (>98%) and a "rule-in" threshold with high specificity (>95%). Participants with p-tau217 levels between these thresholds were classified as indeterminate and referred for confirmatory CSF testing.

**Results:** The two-step p-tau217 workflow correctly classified 87% of the total cohort. The high-sensitivity threshold effectively ruled out Aβ negativity in 60% of participants, while the high-specificity threshold confirmed Aβ positivity in 27%. Only 13% of participants fell into the indeterminate range and required confirmatory CSF testing. The overall accuracy for identifying CSF-defined Aβ status was 96% (95% CI: 94–98). This approach demonstrated high diagnostic performance across the clinical continuum, particularly in the MCI subgroup.

**Conclusion:** A stratified workflow utilizing plasma p-tau217 can accurately determine cerebral Aβ status and drastically reduce the requirement for invasive and costly confirmatory tests by approximately 85%. This paradigm offers a cost-effective and accessible strategy for streamlining the diagnostic pathway in patients with cognitive impairment, facilitating earlier and more precise AD diagnosis in clinical practice.
