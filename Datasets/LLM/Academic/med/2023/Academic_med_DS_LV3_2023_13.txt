**Abstract**

The 2023 re-evaluation of bisphenol A (BPA) by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) represents a paradigm shift in its toxicological risk assessment, establishing a drastically reduced Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) of 0.2 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day. This revised TDI is predicated primarily on emerging evidence of BPA's adverse effects on the immune system, moving beyond traditional endpoints such as reproductive or developmental toxicity. A critical mechanistic pathway identified involves the dysregulation of T-helper 17 (Th17) cells, a CD4+ T-cell subset pivotal for mucosal immunity and implicated in autoimmune pathogenesis. Experimental data from *in vivo* models demonstrate that low-dose BPA exposure can promote Th17 cell differentiation and the subsequent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A. This immunomodulatory effect is hypothesized to increase susceptibility to inflammatory diseases and reduce resistance to pathogens, establishing a new point of departure for hazard characterization.

Concurrently, comprehensive dietary exposure assessments, which aggregate data from food contact materials and contamination of the food chain, reveal that current population-level exposure, particularly in vulnerable groups, exceeds the newly established TDI by several orders of magnitude. This profound margin of exposure indicates a potential health concern of significant magnitude. The convergence of a hazard driven by specific immunotoxicity and widespread, unavoidable dietary exposure underscores a critical public health challenge. This re-evaluation necessitates an urgent re-examination of regulatory frameworks governing BPA in food packaging and mandates further longitudinal epidemiological studies to correlate these immunotoxicological findings with clinical health outcomes in human populations. The 2023 EFSA opinion thus establishes a new, highly conservative benchmark for BPA risk management centered on preserving immune integrity.
