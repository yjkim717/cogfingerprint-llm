**Abstract**

The accurate volumetric segmentation of pediatric brain tumors, particularly high-grade gliomas, remains a critical challenge in neuro-oncology.  This study examines the evolving landscape of automated segmentation techniques, specifically in the context of the 2023 BraTS-PEDs challenge.  The challenge’s focus on multimodal imaging – incorporating MRI, CT, and PET data – underscores the need for algorithms capable of integrating heterogeneous data sources to achieve robust tumor delineation.  We investigate the application of artificial intelligence, including deep learning models, as a potential solution to improve the precision and efficiency of segmentation compared to traditional manual methods.  Successful algorithm performance within the BraTS-PEDs benchmark directly informs the development of clinically viable tools for enhanced treatment planning, response assessment, and ultimately, improved clinical trial outcomes for pediatric patients.  Further research is warranted to validate these approaches across diverse patient populations and imaging protocols.
