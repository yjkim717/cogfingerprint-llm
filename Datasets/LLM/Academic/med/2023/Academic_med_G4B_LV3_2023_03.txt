**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease necessitates improved diagnostic strategies and efficient risk stratification methods.  This study investigates the utility of plasma phosphorylated total tau protein 217 (p-tau217) as a biomarker for identifying individuals at elevated risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease. Utilizing a novel two-step workflow, plasma p-tau217 levels demonstrated a marked decrease in the reliance on costly and invasive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) investigations for confirming amyloid-beta (Aβ) positivity.  Specifically, elevated plasma p-tau217 levels accurately predicted Aβ-related pathology, effectively streamlining the diagnostic process.  Preliminary data from 2023 suggest that this approach offers a significant advancement in early detection, potentially facilitating targeted therapeutic interventions and personalized patient management. Further validation across diverse populations is warranted to fully establish the clinical utility of plasma p-tau217 in risk stratification for Alzheimer’s disease.
