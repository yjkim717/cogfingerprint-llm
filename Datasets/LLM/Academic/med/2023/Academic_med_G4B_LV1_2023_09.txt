**Abstract**

Mendelian randomization (MR) represents a burgeoning strategy within pharmaceutical research, offering a powerful approach to de-risk early-stage drug development. This review synthesizes current evidence regarding MR’s application in identifying and validating novel drug targets, leveraging the robustness of genetic association data. Specifically, we examine how genetic variation in host factors, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), can be employed to establish causal relationships between modifiable exposures and disease outcomes.  By exploiting instrumental variable analysis, MR can mitigate confounding and reverse causation, providing stronger evidence for target plausibility than traditional observational studies.  The integration of MR with large-scale genomic datasets holds significant potential to prioritize therapeutic interventions within complex inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.  Further research is warranted to refine MR methodologies and incorporate multi-omics data to enhance target validation, ultimately accelerating the discovery of effective and personalized drug treatments in 2023 and beyond.
