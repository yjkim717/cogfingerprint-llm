Title: Quantum Dynamical Insights into Vibrational Polariton Chemistry: Exact Simulations of Cavity-Modified Chemical Reactivity

Abstract:
The emerging field of vibrational polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention due to its potential to manipulate chemical reactivity through vibrational strong coupling (VSC) with infrared cavities. In this study, we employ an exact quantum dynamics approach to investigate the impact of VSC on chemical reaction rates. By simulating the coupled cavity-molecule system, we demonstrate that quantum mechanical effects play a crucial role in determining the cavity-modified rate constants. Our results reveal significant deviations from classical predictions, underscoring the importance of a quantum mechanical treatment. The exact quantum dynamics simulations provide a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the observed changes in chemical reactivity. This work contributes to the fundamental understanding of vibrational polariton chemistry and highlights the potential for VSC to control chemical reactions at the quantum level, with implications for the development of novel reaction pathways.
