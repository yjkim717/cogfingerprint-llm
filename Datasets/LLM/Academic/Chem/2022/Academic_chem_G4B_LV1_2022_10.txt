**Abstract: Genesis of Vinyl and Ethyl Species within the Interstellar Medium – A Radical Addition/Abstraction Framework**

The interstellar medium (ISM) presents a chemically complex environment demanding robust models for molecular formation. This research explores the mechanistic pathways contributing to the observed prevalence of ethyl (C₂H₅) and vinyl (C₂H₃) species, utilizing a kinetic framework predicated on radical addition and abstraction reactions involving acetylene (C₂H₂), ethylene (C₂H₄), and ethane (C₂H₆).  Specifically, we examine the potential for stepwise radical additions of ethane fragments to ethylene, followed by subsequent abstraction steps, generating vinyl intermediates.  Computational analysis, incorporating estimated gas-phase reaction rates derived from established literature, suggests that radical abstraction, facilitated by interstellar UV radiation, plays a critical, yet currently underappreciated, role.  Furthermore, the study considers the influence of H abstraction on acetylene, potentially generating reactive acetyl radicals capable of initiating these complex sequences.  These findings contribute to a refined understanding of the chemical evolution within the ISM, informing spectral interpretations and circumstellar environment modeling, with implications for planetary formation research, particularly in 2022’s expanding dataset of interstellar molecules.
