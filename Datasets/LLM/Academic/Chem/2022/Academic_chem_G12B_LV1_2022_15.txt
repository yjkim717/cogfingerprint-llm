**Abstract**

The escalating demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates continuous innovation in component materials, particularly the separator. Conventional separator manufacturing often involves multi-step processes and complex cell assembly protocols, hindering scalability and introducing potential points of failure. This work introduces a novel approach to separator fabrication utilizing a sequentially deposited alumina (Al₂O₃) coating onto a polymeric substrate, designed to streamline LIB full-cell assembly. The deposition process, optimized via controlled spray pyrolysis, yields a uniform, nanoporous Al₂O₃ layer exhibiting enhanced thermal stability and mechanical robustness compared to traditional polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP) separators.  Electrochemical characterization, including cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, reveals that the modified separator maintains high electrolyte conductivity while simultaneously demonstrating improved ionic transport properties within the electrode-separator interface.  Full-cell testing with a LiFePO₄/NMC811 cathode pairing, conducted at rates up to 5C, reveals a significant enhancement in rate capability and cycling stability—retaining >85% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles—compared to cells employing standard PE separators. These findings suggest that sequential alumina deposition represents a promising strategy for developing advanced separators that facilitate simplified cell manufacturing, enhance battery performance, and contribute to the broader advancement of LIB technology for energy storage applications as of 2022. Further research will focus on optimizing the alumina morphology and exploring its integration with other functional additives to further improve overall cell performance.
