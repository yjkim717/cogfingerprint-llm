The surface mobility of hydroxyl radicals (OH) on interstellar ice analogues governs the formation of key molecular species in cold astrophysical environments, yet quantitative diffusion barriers remain poorly constrained. In this study, we employ temperature-programmed photostimulated desorption to directly measure the activation energy for OH radical diffusion on amorphous solid water (ASW) films under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Our results yield an activation energy of \(0.14 \pm 0.01\) eV, significantly lower than theoretical estimates, indicating highly efficient diffusion even at cryogenic temperatures. This reduced barrier suggests that OH radicals can readily traverse ice surfaces to participate in hydrogen abstraction and addition reactions, thereby accelerating the synthesis of complex organic molecules in dark molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. These experimental constraints provide critical input for astrochemical models, refining predictions of molecular evolution in the interstellar medium.
