The rational design of heterostructured electrocatalysts presents a promising pathway to enhance the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by optimizing interfacial electronic properties. This work investigates the catalytic performance of a novel Ru-RuS2 heterostructure synthesized via a controlled electrochemical deposition technique. Systematic characterization confirms the formation of a well-defined interface, with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicating a significant electronic coupling and a modulated work function at the heterojunction. Electrochemical evaluations reveal that the Ru-RuS2 catalyst exhibits exceptionally low overpotentials of 32 mV and 45 mV to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm-2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M KOH, respectively, outperforming benchmark Pt/C. The superior activity and robust stability across a wide pH range are attributed to the facilitated charge transfer and optimized hydrogen adsorption free energy at the heterogeneous interface. These findings underscore the potential of interfacial engineering in developing high-performance, noble-metal-efficient electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.
