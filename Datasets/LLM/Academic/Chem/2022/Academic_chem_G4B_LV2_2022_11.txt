**Abstract**

The advancement of lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) technology hinges critically on the performance characteristics of its separator component. This study reports the successful development and characterization of a novel, spray-deposited aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) separator specifically tailored for Li-ion battery applications. Utilizing a sequential deposition technique, we achieved uniform and conformal coating of Al₂O₃ onto a porous substrate, resulting in a multilayered separator architecture.  The resulting material demonstrates enhanced electrochemical stability and reduced interfacial impedance compared to conventional separator materials. 

A key innovation lies in the simplified cell assembly process afforded by the spray deposition method, eliminating the need for complex layering techniques and facilitating a streamlined, single-step fabrication protocol. Electrochemical testing of Li-ion cells incorporating this Al₂O₃ separator revealed markedly improved cycling stability, evidenced by sustained capacity retention over extended charge/discharge cycles.  Initial investigations suggest that the multilayered structure contributes to improved lithium-ion transport and reduced electrolyte decomposition.  Further analysis, including scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, confirms the structural integrity and compositional homogeneity of the fabricated separator. These findings represent a significant step forward in developing high-performance, scalable Li-ion battery separators and highlight the potential of spray deposition for advanced materials engineering in energy storage.
