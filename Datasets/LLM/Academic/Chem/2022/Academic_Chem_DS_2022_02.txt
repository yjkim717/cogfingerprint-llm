This study reports the development of a novel photocatalytic system based on copper(II)-based nanostructured assemblies for mediating efficient domino transformations in aqueous media under visible-light irradiation. The designed Cu(II) nanoaggregates exhibit a pronounced ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) band in the visible region, enabling direct photochemical reduction to catalytically active Cu(I) species without the need for exogenous photosensitizers or stoichiometric reductants. This in situ generated Cu(I) catalyst facilitates a tandem azidation-cycloaddition sequence, allowing for the streamlined synthesis of complex heterocyclic scaffolds from simple starting materials. The aqueous reaction environment not only enhances the sustainability profile but also promotes the stability and dispersibility of the catalytic nanoaggregates. Mechanistic investigations confirm the photocatalytic cycle and the role of the nanostructured architecture in stabilizing reactive intermediates. This work establishes a robust, eco-compatible strategy for copper-catalyzed domino processes, merging the advantages of heterogeneous catalysis with the precision of photoredox activation.
