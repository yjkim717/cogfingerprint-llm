**Abstract**

The mobility of hydroxyl (OH) radicals on interstellar ice mantles is a critical, rate-limiting parameter in the formation of complex organic molecules in cold molecular clouds. However, a precise quantification of the associated activation energy barrier for surface diffusion has remained experimentally elusive. In this 2022 study, we employed a combination of photostimulated desorption (PSD) and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) to directly measure the diffusion kinetics of OH radicals on an amorphous solid water (ASW) surface, serving as a high-fidelity interstellar ice analog. Our results yield a diffusion activation energy of \(E_a = 0.14 \pm 0.01\) eV. Application of the Arrhenius equation to this value indicates that significant OH radical mobility, and thus the initiation of key surface-mediated hydrogenation reactions such as water formation, commences at temperatures as low as ~36 K. This finding provides a fundamental kinetic constraint for astrochemical models, reconciling observed molecular abundances with the non-thermal reaction mechanisms prevalent in dark interstellar environments.
