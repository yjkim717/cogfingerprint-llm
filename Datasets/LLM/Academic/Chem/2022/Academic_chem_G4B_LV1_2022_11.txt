**Abstract**

The performance characteristics of lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion) are critically dependent upon the integrity and properties of the separator, a key component mediating ion transport while preventing electrical short circuits. This research investigates a novel approach to separator fabrication utilizing a sequential spray deposition technique for aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃).  Employing a controlled pulsed spray system, we demonstrated the creation of multilayered Al₂O₃ coatings directly onto a porous substrate, mimicking the architecture of conventional separator materials.  Characterization via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) confirmed the formation of vertically aligned, multi-layered structures. Electrochemical testing revealed a significant enhancement in rate capability and cycle stability when utilizing these Al₂O₃-derived separators compared to commercially available polyethylene separators.  These results suggest that precisely engineered multilayered Al₂O₃ coatings, achieved through scalable spray deposition, represent a promising avenue for improving Li-ion battery performance and longevity.
