The development of efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts for reversible oxygen conversion is critical for advancing sustainable energy technologies. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel two-dimensional covalent organic framework (COF) incorporating co-porphyrin motifs linked through redox-active diarylamine derivatives. This structural design enables dual functionality for both the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Electrochemical characterization reveals exceptional catalytic performance, with the diarylamine units facilitating efficient electron transfer and modulating the electronic structure of the porphyrin centers. The framework maintains structural integrity over prolonged cycling, demonstrating remarkable stability in alkaline media. These findings establish diarylamine-functionalized COFs as promising platforms for bifunctional electrocatalysis, offering new insights into the molecular engineering of robust materials for metal-air batteries and fuel cells.
