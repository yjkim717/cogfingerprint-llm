Of particular interest in advancing solid-state lithium-ion battery technology is the development of high-performance ceramic-based separators. This work investigates the electrochemical performance of a sequentially deposited multilayer cell architecture, incorporating a spray-deposited separator composed of Al₂O₃ particles. The ionic conductivity and cycling stability of cells employing a LiFePO₄ cathode and a Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ anode were systematically evaluated against a baseline system with a conventional polypropylene separator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the Al₂O₃-based separator exhibited an ionic conductivity of approximately 1.2 mS cm⁻¹, effectively doubling that of the polypropylene benchmark. Furthermore, galvanostatic cycling tests demonstrated exceptional capacity retention, with the ceramic separator maintaining over 95% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles at a 1C rate, significantly outperforming the organic counterpart. These results, obtained in 2022, underscore the efficacy of spray-deposition for fabricating robust ceramic separators, highlighting a promising pathway for enhancing the energy density and longevity of next-generation lithium-ion batteries.
