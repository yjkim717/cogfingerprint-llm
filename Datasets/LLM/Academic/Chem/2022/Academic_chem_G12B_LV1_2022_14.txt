Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal academic style suitable for a chemistry publication, and reflecting a 2022 context. I've aimed for precision and structured reasoning, targeting approximately 178 words.  Following the abstract, I'll include notes on the choices made.

**Abstract**

The chemical complexity of the interstellar medium (ISM) necessitates a thorough understanding of fundamental reaction pathways contributing to the formation of organic molecules. This work explores the viability of radical addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions involving small hydrocarbon species – specifically, ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂) – as potential sources of vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) radicals within astrochemical environments. Utilizing rate coefficient estimations derived from recent experimental and theoretical studies (2018-2022), we model the impact of hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals on the observed abundances of these unsaturated hydrocarbons. Our simulations indicate that hydrogen abstraction from ethane and ethylene, followed by subsequent isomerization, represents a significant pathway for vinyl radical production.  Furthermore, the reaction of OH radicals with acetylene proves remarkably efficient in generating vinyl fragments. While ethyl radical formation is less dominant, it is demonstrably influenced by the collisional stabilization of vinyl radicals. The presented analysis underscores the relevance of these simple radical reactions in the broader context of interstellar organic chemistry, providing a refined perspective on the chemical evolution of the ISM and potential precursors to more complex molecular systems.

**Notes on Choices and Considerations:**

*   **Formal Tone:** I've used vocabulary like "viability," "necessitates," "demonstrably," and "remarkable" to maintain a formal and scientific tone.
*   **Precise Terminology:**  Terms like "hydrogen abstraction," "radical addition," "isomerization," and "collisional stabilization" are used accurately.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: introduction of the problem, description of the study (modeling with rate coefficients), presentation of key findings, and concluding significance.
*   **Year Context (2022):**  I’ve explicitly mentioned the timeframe of recent studies (2018-2022) to ground the work in the current literature. This is important for demonstrating awareness of the latest research.
*   **Emphasis on H and OH:**  The summary highlighted these radicals, and I’ve given them prominent roles in the abstract’s description of the reactions.
*   **Modeling Aspect:** Although the original summary didn't specify modeling, it's a common approach in astrochemical research, so I've incorporated it to make the abstract more realistic.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for approximately 178 words, which is a typical length for abstracts in many chemistry journals.
*   **Focus on Radicals:** The abstract has a focus on the radical species and their roles in the reactions.
