**Abstract**

Recent advancements in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) have opened new avenues for manipulating chemical reactivity through vibrational strong coupling. This study, conducted in 2022, employs exact quantum dynamics simulations to quantitatively assess the impact of strong coupling between molecular vibrational modes and infrared cavity fields on reaction rates. Our findings demonstrate that the formation of polariton states, arising from the coherent interaction between the molecular vibration and the electromagnetic field, induces substantial alterations to the reaction landscape. Specifically, we observe significant modifications to reaction probabilities linked to the appearance of new quantum state splittings and resonant pathways. These predicted changes align with emerging experimental observations in polariton chemistry, suggesting a robust framework for controlling chemical transformations via light-matter interaction and offering a pathway toward rationally designed light-driven chemical processes.
