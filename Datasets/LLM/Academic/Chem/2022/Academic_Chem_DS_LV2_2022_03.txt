Of growing interest in advanced energy storage is the development of integrated fabrication processes that enhance both performance and manufacturability. This study introduces a novel spray-deposited Al₂O₃ separator for Li-ion batteries, engineered to address the limitations of conventional polyolefin separators, namely suboptimal thermal stability and restricted ionic transport. The sequential deposition methodology enables the direct formation of a mesoporous ceramic layer onto battery electrodes in a single, scalable operation, eliminating the need for separate separator handling. Electrochemical analysis confirms that the Al₂O₃ layer significantly improves lithium-ion transference number and ionic conductivity, attributed to its inherent wettability and stable interface with common carbonate-based electrolytes. Consequently, cells employing this integrated separator demonstrate superior capacity retention and enhanced cycling stability over extended charge-discharge cycles, mitigating common degradation mechanisms. These findings, substantiated in 2022, establish spray-deposited ceramic separators as a promising avenue for streamlining battery assembly while concurrently boosting electrochemical performance, thereby contributing to the pursuit of more efficient and durable energy storage systems.
