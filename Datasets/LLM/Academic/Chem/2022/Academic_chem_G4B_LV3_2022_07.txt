**Abstract**

Recent advancements in lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) technology necessitate innovative separator materials to enhance cell performance and longevity. This study investigates the utilization of a spray-deposited aluminum oxide (Al2O3) composite as a novel separator, specifically tailored for sequential deposition techniques. Employing a LiFePO4 cathode, our methodology demonstrates the feasibility of directly fabricating multilayered battery stacks via this innovative approach. Characterization reveals a refined separator microstructure contributing to improved ionic conductivity and reduced interfacial impedance.  Preliminary electrochemical testing indicates a marked improvement in both energy density and cycle stability compared to conventional porous separators. These findings suggest that Al2O3-based, sequentially deposited separators represent a promising avenue for optimizing Li-ion battery architecture and warrant further investigation into their potential across diverse electrochemical applications, particularly within next-generation Li-ion systems.
