**Abstract**

The emerging field of vibrational polariton chemistry explores how strong light-matter coupling within infrared optical cavities can control molecular processes. This investigation employs high-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic role of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in modulating chemical reactivity. We demonstrate that the formation of hybrid light-matter states, known as vibrational polaritons, introduces novel anharmonicities and nonlinearities into the molecular potential energy surfaces. These modifications directly alter reaction pathways and activation barriers, leading to significant suppression or enhancement of reaction rates for specific vibrational modes resonant with the cavity field. Our findings establish that this effect is a genuine quantum phenomenon, arising from the exchange of vibrational energy quanta between the molecule and the confined electromagnetic modes of the cavity, rather than a trivial thermal effect. This work provides a fundamental quantum dynamical framework for VSC, offering a predictive platform for manipulating chemical transformations with quantum vacuum fields and paving the way for novel cavity-assisted catalysis strategies.
