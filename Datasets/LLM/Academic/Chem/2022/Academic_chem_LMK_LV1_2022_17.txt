Title: Investigating the Mobility of OH Radicals on Interstellar Ice Analogs via Photostimulated Desorption and Resonance-Enhanced Multiphoton Ionization

Abstract:
The mobility of OH radicals on water ice surfaces plays a crucial role in the astrochemical evolution of interstellar ices. In this study (2022), we employed a combination of photostimulated desorption (PSD) and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) to determine the activation energy for diffusion of OH radicals on water ice. Our results indicate that the activation energy for surface diffusion is 0.14 eV, suggesting a relatively low barrier for OH radical migration. This value is consistent with theoretical predictions and has significant implications for understanding the chemical reactivity of interstellar ices. The PSD-REMPI technique provides a sensitive probe of surface dynamics, enabling the investigation of radical mobility on ice surfaces. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex chemistry occurring on interstellar ice grains.
