**Abstract**

The emergent field of polariton chemistry, enabled by cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), presents a paradigm shift in understanding chemical reactivity. This study, conducted in 2022, investigates the impact of vibrational strong coupling on reaction dynamics within the condensed phase, employing exact quantum dynamics simulations. Our findings demonstrate that the observed modifications to reaction rate constants, a hallmark of polariton chemistry, are fundamentally dependent on quantum mechanical treatment. Traditional semiclassical approximations fail to accurately capture the intricate interplay between vibrational modes and the electromagnetic field, leading to significant discrepancies in predicted reaction pathways. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating quantum mechanical effects to fully elucidate and harness the potential of vibrational polariton chemistry for controlled chemical transformations.
