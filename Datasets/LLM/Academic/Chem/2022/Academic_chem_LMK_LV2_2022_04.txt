Title: Quantum Dynamics of Vibrational Strong Coupling in Infrared Cavities: Implications for Chemical Reactivity

Abstract:
The modification of chemical reactivity via vibrational strong coupling within infrared cavities has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this study, we employ an exact quantum dynamics approach to investigate the impact of quantum light-matter interactions on cavity-modified chemical reactions. By directly simulating the coupled dynamics of molecular vibrations and cavity photons, we elucidate the role of vibrational polariton chemistry in shaping reaction pathways. Our results demonstrate that the exact quantum treatment of the light-matter interaction is crucial for accurately capturing the effects of vibrational strong coupling on chemical reactivity. The findings of this work provide new insights into the quantum mechanical origins of cavity-modified chemistry, highlighting the potential for infrared cavities to control and manipulate chemical reactions at the quantum level.
