**Abstract**

The interstellar medium (ISM) represents a chemically rich environment demanding detailed understanding of complex molecular formation pathways. This research explores the radical chemistry underpinning the synthesis of key organic building blocks – vinyl and ethyl molecules – within this context. Specifically, we examine the influence of radical addition and abstraction reactions involving simple hydrocarbon precursors: ethane, ethylene, and acetylene. Utilizing computational modeling and theoretical analysis, we delineate potential reaction sequences, focusing on the energetic feasibility and relative rates of processes such as C-H bond activation and subsequent vinylation/ethylation. 

Our investigation highlights the significance of radical cascades in generating these molecules, suggesting that the observed abundance of vinyl and ethyl species in spectral observations may be intrinsically linked to the prevalent presence of these precursor molecules and their susceptibility to interstellar radical environments.  The study’s findings contribute to a refined theoretical framework for modeling organic complexity within the ISM, particularly concerning the role of low-energy radical processes and the formation of fundamental molecular motifs. Further research will explore the influence of interstellar radiation fields on these reactions.
