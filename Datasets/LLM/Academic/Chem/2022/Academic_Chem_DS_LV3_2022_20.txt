Abstract

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry investigates the manipulation of molecular systems via strong light-matter interactions within optical cavities. This study employs high-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the profound influence of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on fundamental chemical reactivity. Our computational results demonstrate that the formation of hybrid light-matter states, known as vibrational polaritons, induces significant and often non-intuitive modifications to reaction rate constants. These alterations are not merely perturbative but arise from fundamental quantum mechanical phenomena, including the emergence of avoided crossings and resonant interactions between polaritonic states and reactive modes. The observed sharp changes in kinetic profiles underscore the limitations of semi-classical frameworks, which fail to capture the essential quantum coherence and state-splitting inherent to the VSC regime. Consequently, we posit that a fully quantum treatment of both the molecular system and the cavity field is indispensable for the accurate theoretical modeling and predictive design of cavity-modified chemistry. This work, situated in 2022, establishes a critical foundation for harnessing quantum vacuum fields to control molecular transformations with unprecedented specificity.
