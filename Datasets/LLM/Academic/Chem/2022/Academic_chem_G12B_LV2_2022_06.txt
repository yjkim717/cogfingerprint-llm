## Abstract: Formation Pathways of Vinyl and Ethyl Radicals in the Interstellar Medium

The chemical complexity of the interstellar medium (ISM) necessitates a thorough understanding of the formation pathways for key organic molecules. This study, conducted within the context of astrochemical modeling and laboratory simulation, explores the radical addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions contributing to the synthesis of vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) radicals from simpler hydrocarbon precursors – ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂) – relevant to the ISM environment. Utilizing kinetic modeling incorporating rate coefficients derived from recent experimental investigations, we assessed the relative importance of hydrogen atom (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radical mediated reactions. Our results indicate that hydrogen abstraction from ethane and ethylene by both H and OH radicals represents a significant pathway for ethyl radical formation. Furthermore, radical addition reactions, particularly involving hydrogen abstraction from acetylene followed by subsequent reactions, contribute substantially to vinyl radical production. The modeled abundance ratios of vinyl and ethyl radicals, and their precursors, demonstrate sensitivity to temperature and radical densities, providing valuable constraints for observational comparisons with spectral data obtained from star-forming regions. This work contributes to refining our understanding of the chemical network underpinning the formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the ISM, and supports future observational efforts aimed at characterizing the chemical composition of interstellar clouds.
