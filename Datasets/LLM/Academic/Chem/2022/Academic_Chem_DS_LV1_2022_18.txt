**Abstract**

The genesis of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM) presents a persistent astrochemical challenge, as gas-phase routes are often inefficient under such conditions. This investigation explores the critical role of heterogeneous radical addition and hydrogen (H) abstraction reactions on the surfaces of interstellar dust grains as a dominant pathway for molecular complexity. We focus specifically on the sequential processing of small, abundant hydrocarbons—namely acetylene (C₂H₂) and ethylene (C₂H₄)—by suprathermal H and OH radicals. Our computational and kinetic modelling demonstrates that the initial step involves a barrierless radical addition to form the vinyl (C₂H₃•) and ethyl (C₂H₅•) radicals, respectively. These nascent carbon-centered radicals subsequently act as key reactive intermediates. Through further H abstraction and radical-radical recombination on grain surfaces, they serve as molecular precursors, facilitating the bottom-up formation of more saturated and functionalized species, such as ethanol and acetaldehyde. These findings, published in 2022, underscore the non-equilibrium nature of grain-surface chemistry and provide a robust mechanistic framework for the observed spectral signatures of COMs in star-forming regions, significantly advancing our understanding of prebiotic chemical evolution.
