**Abstract**

The escalating demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates continuous advancements in separator technology. Traditional porous polymer separators often exhibit limitations in thermal stability and interfacial resistance, contributing to reduced battery lifespan and performance. This research presents an innovative approach utilizing sequential deposition techniques to fabricate an aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) separator specifically tailored for LIB applications. Employing a controlled spray deposition process, we successfully generated a dense, uniform Al₂O₃ layer directly onto a conventional separator substrate. 

Characterization via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the structural integrity and crystalline nature of the deposited Al₂O₃. Electrochemical testing of LIB cells incorporating this modified separator revealed a marked enhancement in cycling stability compared to those utilizing conventional separators. Specifically, the Al₂O₃-coated separator demonstrated a superior coulombic efficiency and reduced capacity fade over extended charge-discharge cycles. 

The improved performance is attributed to the enhanced ionic conductivity facilitated by the Al₂O₃ layer, coupled with increased thermal stability mitigating decomposition reactions within the electrolyte. These findings underscore the potential of spray-deposited Al₂O₃ separators as a viable strategy for improving the overall durability and longevity of next-generation LIBs. Further investigations are warranted to optimize deposition parameters and explore the integration of this technology into scalable manufacturing processes.
