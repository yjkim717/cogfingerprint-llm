**Abstract**

The reactivity of simple hydrocarbon molecules with atomic hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals under the extreme conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) is a cornerstone of astrochemical reaction networks. This study investigates the gas-phase reaction kinetics of H and OH radicals with the fundamental C₂ hydrocarbons, acetylene (C₂H₂) and ethylene (C₂H₄), which are ubiquitous in molecular clouds. Utilizing a combination of low-temperature cryogenic experiments and high-level quantum chemical calculations, we demonstrate that these interactions are dominated by rapid, barrierless addition mechanisms rather than abstraction pathways. For the H radical, the addition to C₂H₂ yields the vinyl radical (C₂H₃•), while its addition to C₂H₄ produces the ethyl radical (C₂H₅•). Analogously, the OH radical undergoes efficient addition to form hydroxylated counterparts. The calculated rate constants at temperatures relevant to dark molecular clouds (10–50 K) confirm these processes are exceptionally efficient, proceeding with rates on the order of 10⁻¹⁰ cm³ molecule⁻¹ s⁻¹. These findings quantitatively validate that radical addition is a primary, non-equilibrium route for the synthesis of complex organic molecules, specifically vinyl- and ethyl-type species, in the ISM, providing critical data for refining astrochemical models of molecular cloud evolution.
