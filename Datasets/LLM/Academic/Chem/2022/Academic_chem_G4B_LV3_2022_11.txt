**Abstract**

The advancement of lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) technology hinges significantly on separator performance. This study investigates the efficacy of a novel, spray-deposited aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) separator, incorporating a controlled deposition process, for enhancing Li-ion battery architecture. Utilizing a three-layer electrode configuration, we demonstrate that the Al₂O₃ separator exhibits superior electrochemical performance metrics compared to conventional polypropylene separators. Specifically, cycling stability was markedly improved, attributed to reduced interfacial impedance and mitigated electrolyte decomposition. Characterization techniques, including scanning electron microscopy and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, confirmed uniform Al₂O₃ layer deposition and minimized porosity. These findings suggest that strategically engineered Al₂O₃-based separators represent a promising pathway for optimizing Li-ion battery longevity and overall system efficiency, warranting further investigation into scalable manufacturing methods.
