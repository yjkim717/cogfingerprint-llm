The rational design of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) with precisely integrated redox-active moieties represents a frontier in electrocatalyst development for sustainable energy conversion. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel two-dimensional COF, designated as DA-COF-1, which incorporates co-porphyrin motifs linked by diarylamine-based struts. This structural design engenders a highly conjugated and porous network with enhanced electronic conductivity and accessible catalytic sites. Electrochemical evaluation demonstrates that DA-COF-1 functions as a highly efficient bifunctional electrocatalyst for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media. For the ORR, it exhibits a half-wave potential of 0.81 V vs. RHE, while for the OER, an overpotential of 350 mV is achieved at 10 mA cm⁻². The synergistic interplay between the co-porphyrin centers and the redox-active diarylamine linkers is posited to facilitate efficient electron transfer and stabilize oxygenated intermediates, thereby boosting the overall catalytic performance. This work underscores the potential of molecularly engineered COFs as versatile platforms for multi-functional electrocatalysis.
