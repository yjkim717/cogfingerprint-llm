**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry explores the emergent phenomena arising from strong coupling between molecular vibrations and cavity photons. While initial investigations often focused on conceptual demonstrations, a deeper understanding of the underlying quantum dynamics governing cavity-modified chemical reactions remains crucial. This work presents a theoretical investigation employing time-dependent quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the impact of vibrational strong coupling on reaction rates. We consider a prototypical model system undergoing a bimolecular reaction, incorporating a vibrational mode strongly coupled to a resonant cavity field. Our simulations demonstrate that the formation of polaritons – quasiparticles resulting from the coherent superposition of vibrational and photonic states – leads to a non-trivial modification of the reaction dynamics. Specifically, we observe a significant alteration in the population transfer rates between reactant and product states, diverging from predictions based on traditional, non-coupled vibrational treatments. The observed rate enhancements or suppressions are directly attributable to the quantum mechanical interference effects inherent in the polariton framework, influencing both vibrational energy flow and the efficiency of bond breaking/formation. These findings underscore the potential for leveraging vibrational strong coupling to actively control chemical reactivity, opening avenues for the rational design of novel catalytic processes and light-driven chemical transformations.



I aimed to:

*   Use precise terminology (bimolecular reaction, resonant cavity field, population transfer rates, bond breaking/formation)
*   Structure the reasoning with an introduction, methods, results, and implications.
*   Maintain a formal, academic tone.
*   Ground the work in the context of the broader "polariton chemistry" field.
