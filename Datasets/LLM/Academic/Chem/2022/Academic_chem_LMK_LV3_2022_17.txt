Title: Investigating the Surface Dynamics of OH Radicals on Interstellar Ice Analogs

Abstract:
In 2022, a novel experimental approach was employed to elucidate the diffusion dynamics of OH radicals on amorphous water ice surfaces. Utilizing a synergistic combination of photostimulated desorption and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization techniques, the activation energy for OH radical diffusion was quantified as 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV. The results, interpreted through the Arrhenius equation, provide insight into the surface mobility of OH radicals, shedding light on their role in interstellar ice chemistry and the formation of complex molecular species.
