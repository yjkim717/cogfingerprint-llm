We investigate the formation of metastable supramolecular assemblies through dissipative self-assembly in non-equilibrium chemical systems. By modeling the reaction-diffusion dynamics of amphiphilic precursors, we identify a critical fragmentation length scale that governs the spontaneous compartmentalization of the system. This scale determines a minimum assembly size, leading to the formation of discrete, non-covalent nanostructures. Our analysis demonstrates that the collapse of a homogeneous precursor solution can yield a population of well-defined, compact assemblies, analogous to the formation of micellar or vesicular objects. These findings provide a framework for understanding the emergence of structural complexity in driven chemical systems and suggest pathways for the design of non-equilibrium soft materials.
