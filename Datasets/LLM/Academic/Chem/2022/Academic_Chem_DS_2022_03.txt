**Abstract**

The structural characterization of ion association phenomena in concentrated aqueous electrolytes remains a pivotal challenge in physical chemistry, with significant implications for energy storage and biogeochemical processes. This investigation employs a synergistic approach, integrating neutron diffraction with enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations, to elucidate the coordination landscape and propensity for contact ion pair (CIP) formation in concentrated strontium nitrate (Sr(NO₃)₂) solutions. A primary focus is placed on evaluating the role of electronic polarization, incorporated via a Drude oscillator model, in accurately capturing anion-cation interactions that are inherently many-body in nature. Our neutron scattering results provide direct experimental evidence for a distinct, inner-sphere Sr²⁺–NO₃⁻ complex, characterized by a specific Sr–O (nitrate) distance. Comparative analysis with molecular dynamics trajectories reveals that while non-polarizable force fields systematically underestimate the stability of these CIPs, the polarizable model yields a free energy landscape and ion association constants in markedly closer agreement with the experimental data. However, discrepancies persist in the simulated dynamics of water molecules within the primary solvation shell, suggesting that current polarization schemes, though a critical advancement, do not fully capture the concerted electronic response of the condensed phase. This work underscores the necessity of integrating high-fidelity scattering data with advanced computational models that explicitly treat charge anisotropy to achieve a predictive understanding of electrolyte solutions at high concentrations.
