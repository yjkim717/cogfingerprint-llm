**Abstract**

The performance of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) is critically dependent on the integrity and properties of the separator material, which dictates ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. This research details the synthesis and characterization of an aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃)-based separator designed to facilitate simplified cell fabrication and enhance long-term cycling stability. Utilizing a novel sequential deposition technique, a porous Al₂O₃ membrane was constructed, exhibiting controlled porosity and optimized lithium-ion transport pathways. Electrochemical testing of LiBs incorporating this separator demonstrated a significant improvement in cycling performance compared to conventional separators. Specifically, the Al₂O₃ separator exhibited reduced interfacial resistance and mitigated electrolyte decomposition, leading to a sustained capacity retention of [Insert Percentage - e.g., 85%] after 500 cycles at [Insert Current Density - e.g., 1C rate]. These findings suggest that tailored Al₂O₃ separators represent a promising avenue for advancing LiB technology, offering a pathway towards more robust and durable energy storage systems.
