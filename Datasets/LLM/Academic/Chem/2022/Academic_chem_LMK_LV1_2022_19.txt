Title: Enhanced Electrochemical Stability of Li-ion Batteries via Sequential Deposition of Al2O3 Particles on Inorganic Separators

Abstract:
The development of high-performance Li-ion batteries relies heavily on the advancement of separator technology. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the electrochemical stability of Li-ion batteries by employing a sequential deposition method to fabricate Al2O3-coated inorganic separators. The Al2O3 particles were uniformly deposited onto the separator surface, resulting in improved mechanical strength and thermal stability. The fabricated separator was then integrated into a Li-ion battery full cell assembly, demonstrating enhanced cycling stability and rate capability. The Al2O3 coating effectively suppressed the growth of lithium dendrites, reducing the risk of internal short circuits. The improved electrochemical performance was attributed to the synergistic effect of the Al2O3 coating and the inorganic separator, providing a promising solution for high-performance Li-ion battery applications.
