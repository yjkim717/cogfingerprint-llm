**Abstract**

The investigation of hydroxyl radical (OH•) radical dynamics on water ice remains a critical area of research for understanding Martian surface chemistry and icy planetary environments. This study reports experimental determination of the activation energy governing OH• radical diffusion across water ice surfaces, achieved through photostimulated desorption (PSD) techniques in 2022. PSD provides a sensitive method for probing the interfacial mobility of reactive species. Analysis of desorption signal kinetics revealed an activation energy of 0.14 eV, indicative of a relatively low energy barrier to diffusion. This value suggests that OH• radicals readily traverse the ice lattice, potentially facilitating significant chemical reactions. 

The observed activation energy contributes to our understanding of the competitive pathways for OH• radical reactivity on ice, including surface reactions and further diffusion. Further research utilizing isotopic labeling and varying ice temperatures will be crucial to fully elucidate the complex interplay of factors influencing OH• radical transport and subsequent chemical transformations within these icy matrices.
