This study presents a spray-deposited ceramic composite separator for high-performance lithium-ion batteries, addressing interfacial stability challenges in multilayer configurations. We demonstrate a scalable fabrication method where alumina (Al₂O₃) particles are uniformly distributed within a polymeric matrix through optimized suspension spraying parameters. The resulting separator exhibits enhanced thermal stability up to 200°C and superior wettability toward conventional carbonate-based electrolytes, achieving ionic conductivity of 1.2 mS cm⁻¹ at ambient conditions. When integrated into full cells pairing LiFePO₄ cathodes with Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ anodes—selected for their exceptional cycling stability—the composite separator enables improved lithium-ion transport kinetics while effectively suppressing dendritic growth. Electrochemical evaluation reveals capacity retention of 94.5% after 300 cycles at 1C rate, significantly outperforming commercial polyolefin separators. Post-mortem analysis confirms maintained structural integrity and minimal electrode-separator delamination. This work establishes spray deposition as a viable single-step manufacturing strategy for advanced battery architectures, potentially accelerating the development of safer, longer-lasting energy storage systems without compromising power density or fabrication efficiency. The methodology shows particular promise for large-format cell production where interfacial control remains critical.
