This study investigates the electrochromic behavior of nanostructured tungsten oxide (WO₃) thin films synthesized via potentiostatic deposition for integration in dual-electrode configurations. Structural characterization confirms the formation of a porous morphology favorable for ion intercalation. Under cyclic voltammetric testing in a Li⁺-based electrolyte, these electrodes exhibit reversible optical modulation between high transparency (≈80% at 550 nm) and deep blue coloration (ΔT ≈ 65%) with applied potentials of ±1.5 V. The switching kinetics, characterized by a coloration efficiency of 48 cm² C⁻¹ and a response time under 5 seconds, are attributed to efficient Li⁺ insertion/extraction. Long-term cycling stability over 2,000 cycles demonstrates minimal charge capacity decay (<8%), underscoring the potential of these films as robust, low-power electrochromic components for smart window and adaptive optical systems.
