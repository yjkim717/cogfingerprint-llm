**Abstract**

The investigation of hydroxyl radical (OH•) radical dynamics on water ice remains a critical area of research for understanding astrochemical processes and icy planetary environments. This study reports experimental determination of the activation energy governing OH• radical diffusion on water ice at 0.14 eV, achieved through photostimulated desorption (PSD) spectroscopy.  Previous theoretical models have predicted significantly higher activation energies, suggesting a discrepancy between established computational approaches and experimental observation.  PSD, employed under controlled laser irradiation, provided a sensitive probe of OH• radical mobility, allowing for precise measurement of the energy barrier required for diffusion.  These findings challenge prevailing theoretical frameworks and necessitate a re-evaluation of kinetic models describing OH• radical transport within icy matrices. Further investigation, incorporating isotopic substitutions and varying ice temperatures, is warranted to refine our understanding of the complex interplay between photostimulation, diffusion, and activation energy on water ice surfaces.
