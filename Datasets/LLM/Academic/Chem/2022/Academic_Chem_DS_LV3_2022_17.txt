In this study, we experimentally quantify the activation energy for hydroxyl radical (OH) diffusion on interstellar ice analogues, a critical parameter governing the kinetics of surface-mediated astrochemical reactions. Using photostimulated desorption coupled with resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI), we measured the temperature-dependent diffusion rates of OH radicals on amorphous solid water films. The resulting data were fitted to the Arrhenius equation, yielding an activation energy of 0.14 ± 0.01 eV. This low diffusion barrier implies that OH radical mobility and subsequent reactivity with co-adsorbed species, such as CO to form CO₂, become significant at temperatures as low as ~36 K. These findings provide fundamental, experimentally derived constraints for astrochemical models, suggesting that complex organic molecule formation in cold interstellar environments may be more prevalent than previously theorized.
