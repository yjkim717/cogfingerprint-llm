al chemical reactions in the interstellar medium are critical for the synthesis of complex organic molecules. This study, conducted in 2022, explores the dominant chemical routes leading to the formation of vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) radicals – key precursors to larger hydrocarbon structures – within interstellar ice analogs. Our simulations reveal that radical-radical reactions involving hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals with ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂) on dust grain surfaces are demonstrably significant pathways. The observed reaction efficiencies suggest that these processes contribute substantially to the observed interstellar abundance of these species. Understanding these intricate chemical networks is vital for refining astrochemical models and ultimately elucidating the chemical origins of life in star-forming regions.
