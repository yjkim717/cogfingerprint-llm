**Abstract**

Recent advancements in manipulating light-matter interactions have spurred investigation into the influence of engineered optical cavities on chemical dynamics. This study employs quantum dynamics to characterize vibrational strong coupling within an infrared cavity environment, demonstrating a pronounced impact on chemical reactivity. Specifically, we observe significant alterations in reaction rate constants, directly attributable to the generation of quantum mechanical state splittings and resonant phenomena within the coupled system. These observed shifts necessitate a departure from classical descriptions of vibrational polariton chemistry.  Our findings highlight the critical importance of incorporating fully quantum mechanical models to accurately predict and control chemical processes when light fields are strongly coupled to molecular vibrations. Further research will focus on exploring the potential for utilizing these effects in selective catalytic transformations and advanced spectroscopic techniques.
