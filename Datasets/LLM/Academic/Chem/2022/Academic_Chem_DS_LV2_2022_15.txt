**Abstract**

The development of advanced separator architectures is critical for enhancing the performance and safety of lithium-ion batteries. Conventional polyolefin separators often exhibit limitations in thermal stability and electrolyte wettability, which can constrain cell performance. This work introduces a novel, sequentially spray-deposited separator incorporating Al₂O₃ particles as a robust, inorganic scaffold. The fabrication process enables the single-operation construction of multilayer battery configurations, streamlining manufacturing. Electrochemical evaluation confirms that this ceramic-based separator significantly improves ionic conductivity compared to commercial benchmarks, facilitating more efficient lithium-ion transport. Furthermore, the Al₂O3 layer enhances interfacial stability with the electrodes, leading to superior cycling performance with reduced capacity fade over extended cycles. The improved electrochemical stability is attributed to the homogeneous, porous microstructure achieved via spray deposition, which promotes uniform current distribution and suppresses dendritic growth. This study, conducted in 2022, demonstrates that spray-deposited Al₂O₃ separators represent a promising platform for fabricating high-performance, multilayer Li-ion batteries with enhanced reliability and simplified production.
