Title: Quantum Dynamics Insights into Vibrational Strong Coupling-Mediated Chemical Reactivity within Infrared Cavities

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of vibrational polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention owing to its potential in manipulating chemical reactivity through vibrational strong coupling (VSC) within infrared cavities. In this study, we employ an exact quantum dynamics approach to elucidate the cavity-modified chemical reactions under VSC conditions. By treating the coupled cavity-molecule system fully quantum mechanically, we demonstrate the pivotal role of quantum effects in determining the reactivity changes. Our results underscore the limitations of semi-classical approximations in capturing the complex interplay between the cavity photons and molecular vibrations. The insights gained from this work provide a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing VSC-mediated chemical reactivity, paving the way for the rational design of cavity-controlled chemical reactions. Our findings highlight the importance of a fully quantum treatment in VSC chemistry, shedding new light on the intricate dynamics at play in 2022's cutting-edge research.
