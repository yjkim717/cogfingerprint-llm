The rational design of heterostructured electrocatalysts represents a pivotal strategy for enhancing the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). This work investigates the synthesis and electrochemical performance of novel metal-transition metal dichalcogenide interfaces, fabricated via a scalable molten salt approach. By engineering the interfacial electronic structure, we achieve a significant reduction in the kinetic overpotentials required for HER in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Detailed electronic characterization confirms that the constructed heterointerface induces a favorable work-function gradient, facilitating efficient charge transfer and optimizing hydrogen adsorption free energy. The resulting catalyst exhibits exceptional durability and performance metrics that exceed those of benchmark platinum-based systems. These findings underscore the critical role of interfacial engineering in developing high-performance, non-precious metal electrocatalysts for sustainable hydrogen production.
