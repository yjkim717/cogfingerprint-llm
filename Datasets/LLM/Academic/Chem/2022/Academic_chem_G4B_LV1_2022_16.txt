**Abstract**

The interplay between vibrational dynamics and electromagnetic fields increasingly dictates chemical reactivity at the molecular level. This study investigates the impact of infrared cavity fields on chemical reaction rates, leveraging a quantum dynamics framework to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we demonstrate significant rate enhancements observed in model chemical transformations subjected to resonant infrared irradiation within a fabricated dielectric cavity. Our theoretical analysis, employing time-dependent perturbation theory, reveals that the cavity’s presence induces strong coupling between vibrational modes and the quantized electromagnetic field, generating polariton-like states. These hybrid states exhibit altered energy landscapes and enhanced transition probabilities compared to the isolated reactant system. These findings suggest that ‘polariton chemistry’ – the manipulation of chemical reactions via light-matter interactions – represents a novel strategy for accelerating and controlling chemical processes. Further investigation into the precise energy transfer pathways and the influence of cavity geometry is warranted to fully characterize this emergent phenomenon, with implications for catalysis and photochemical transformations.
