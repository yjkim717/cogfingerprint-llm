This study investigates the electrochromic behavior of nanostructured tungsten oxide (WO₃) thin films synthesized via potentiostatic electrodeposition for integration in dual-electrode configurations. Structural characterization confirms the formation of a porous amorphous framework, while cyclic voltammetry reveals enhanced ion insertion kinetics with a coloration efficiency of 48 cm²/C at 630 nm. The films exhibit reversible optical modulation, transitioning between a highly transparent state (75% transmittance) and a deeply colored blue phase (20% transmittance) upon application of ±1.2 V in a Li⁺-based electrolyte. In situ spectroelectrochemical analysis correlates the optical switching with polaron absorption from W⁵⁺ sites, demonstrating stable performance over 5,000 cycles with 92% charge retention. These findings establish the viability of electrodeposited WO₃ as a robust, low-power auxiliary electrode for dynamic glazing and adaptive optical systems.
