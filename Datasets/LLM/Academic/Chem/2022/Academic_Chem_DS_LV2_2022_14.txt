Of particular relevance to astrochemical models of molecular cloud evolution are the formation pathways of complex organic molecules on interstellar grain surfaces. This study employs quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the mechanisms and kinetics governing hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radical reactions with simple C₂ hydrocarbons, specifically acetylene and ethylene, under ultra-low temperature and pressure conditions. We demonstrate that, contrary to the often-assumed dominance of hydrogen abstraction (H-abstraction) channels, the primary reaction pathway proceeds via barrierless radical addition. For H radical interactions, this results in the efficient formation of vinyl and ethyl radicals, key precursors to larger saturated and unsaturated carbon chains. Similarly, OH radical addition proceeds with negligible activation barriers, yielding hydroxylated derivatives. These addition processes are characterized by computed rate constants exceeding 10⁻¹¹ cm³ molecule⁻¹ s⁻¹, confirming their rapid nature and thus their viability within the short timescales of radical diffusion on icy grain mantles. Our findings necessitate a revision of current gas-grain chemical networks, underscoring that fast addition reactions are a critical, previously underappreciated source of molecular complexity in the interstellar medium.
