Title: Radical-Mediated Formation of Vinyl- and Ethyl-Bearing Molecules in Interstellar Environments

Abstract:
The interstellar medium (ISM) is characterized by a rich chemistry, with unsaturated hydrocarbons playing a crucial role in the formation of complex molecules. This study (2022) investigates the radical addition and H abstraction reactions involving C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6, key precursors to vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecules. Using a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, we elucidate the reaction mechanisms and kinetics governing the formation of these species. Our results indicate that radical-mediated reactions are efficient pathways for the synthesis of vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecules in the ISM. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of interstellar chemistry, particularly in the context of astrochemical modeling. The proposed reaction networks provide a framework for interpreting observational data from current and future telescopes, shedding light on the complex chemistry underlying the formation of complex molecules in interstellar environments.
