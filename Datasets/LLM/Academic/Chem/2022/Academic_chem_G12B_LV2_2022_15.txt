**Abstract**

The ongoing demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates advancements in all cell components, particularly the separator, which significantly impacts electrochemical stability and ionic conductivity. Conventional separator fabrication methods often involve multi-step processing and complex cell assembly procedures. This work introduces a novel approach to separator design utilizing a spray-deposited alumina (Al₂O₃) film, demonstrating a pathway toward simplified, single-step full-cell construction. The fabricated Al₂O₃ separator exhibits a finely controlled morphology and demonstrates enhanced mechanical robustness compared to polymeric counterparts. Electrochemical characterization reveals improved cycling stability in LIBs employing the spray-deposited separator, evidenced by reduced capacity fade over extended charge-discharge cycles.  Furthermore, ionic conductivity measurements indicate competitive performance relative to commercially available separators, suggesting the potential for maintaining efficient lithium-ion transport. The sequential deposition technique employed allows for precise control over film thickness and density, which are crucial parameters for optimizing separator performance. This methodology represents a significant step towards streamlined LIB manufacturing processes and offers a promising avenue for developing high-stability, high-performance energy storage devices. Future research will focus on further optimizing the deposition parameters and exploring the incorporation of functional additives to enhance both ionic conductivity and interfacial compatibility within the LIB architecture.
