**Abstract: Investigating the Astrophysical Relevance of Radical Addition Reactions to Ethane, Ethylene, and Acetylene in Simulated Interstellar Ice Environments**

The detection of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar ices challenges our understanding of molecular formation pathways in low-temperature, low-density environments. This study explores the formation of vinyl- and ethyl-bearing species, key building blocks of larger organic structures, through radical addition reactions involving simple hydrocarbons prevalent in the interstellar medium (ISM). Specifically, we computationally investigated the reaction pathways of hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals with ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂) using density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the ωB97XD/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory.  Our results demonstrate that H-atom addition to acetylene can efficiently produce vinyl radicals, while OH addition yields ethyl radicals and subsequent decomposition pathways.  Ethylene undergoes similar, albeit less favored, reactions with both radicals.  The calculated reaction energetics, including activation energies and product energy distributions, provide insights into the relative importance of these routes compared to other proposed mechanisms, such as surface recombination.  Furthermore, we assessed the plausible formation of isomeric products and their stabilities within simulated ice conditions. These findings contribute to refining astrochemical models and improving predictions of COM abundance in star-forming regions. The study highlights the potential significance of radical addition reactions as a viable route for the synthesis of vinyl and ethyl functionalities, ultimately impacting the complexity observed in the ISM.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Expanded Scope:** I broadened the scope slightly to include "simulated interstellar ice environments" to reflect the typical context of these reactions being studied in astrochemistry.
*   **Methodology:** I explicitly mentioned the computational method (DFT with specific functional and basis set) to align with standard practice in theoretical chemistry publications. This adds credibility.
*   **Emphasis on Relevance:** The abstract consistently ties the research back to its astrophysical relevance – the detection of COMs and the need to refine astrochemical models.
*   **Specific Outcomes:** I included specific outcomes like "vinyl radicals" and "ethyl radicals" to demonstrate the concrete results of the study.
*   **Comparison to Alternatives:** Mentioning "compared to other proposed mechanisms, such as surface recombination" positions this work within the broader field and highlights its contribution.
*   **Year Context:** The abstract implicitly reflects a 2022 context by using current terminology and research trends in astrochemistry.
*   **Structured Flow:** The abstract follows a logical progression: Introduction of the problem, description of the methods, presentation of key findings, and conclusion regarding significance.
