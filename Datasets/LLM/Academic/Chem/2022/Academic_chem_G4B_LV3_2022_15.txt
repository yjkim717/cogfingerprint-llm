**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) technology necessitate improved separator materials to enhance cell performance and longevity. This study reports on the fabrication and characterization of a novel, spray-deposited aluminum oxide (Al2O3) separator incorporating a sequential deposition technique. Specifically, a layered architecture utilizing Al2O3 was integrated into a three-layer cell configuration employing lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) electrodes. Comparative electrochemical testing revealed that the Al2O3 separator demonstrated a marked improvement in cycle stability and reduced interfacial impedance compared to conventional polypropylene separators.  The enhanced performance is attributed to the superior ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness afforded by the Al2O3 layer, effectively mitigating electrolyte decomposition. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing high-performance Li-ion batteries utilizing advanced ceramic separator materials, with implications for sustainable energy storage solutions.
