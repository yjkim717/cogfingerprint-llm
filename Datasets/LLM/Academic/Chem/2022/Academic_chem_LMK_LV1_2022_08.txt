Title: Quantum Dynamical Insights into Vibrational Polariton Chemistry: Exact Simulations of Infrared Cavity-Modified Chemical Reactivity

Abstract:
The emerging field of vibrational polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention due to its potential to manipulate chemical reactivity through vibrational strong coupling (VSC) with infrared cavities. In this study, we employ an exact quantum dynamics approach to investigate the impact of VSC on chemical reaction rates. Our simulations reveal significant modifications to rate constants, driven by quantum effects arising from the non-perturbative treatment of cavity-vibrational interactions. By directly solving the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation for a model system, we demonstrate that the cavity-modified reaction kinetics can be attributed to the formation of vibrational polaritons, which alter the quantum dynamical pathways. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating quantum effects in the theoretical description of VSC-modified chemistry, providing a rigorous foundation for understanding the underlying mechanisms and guiding future experimental investigations in this rapidly evolving field (2022).
