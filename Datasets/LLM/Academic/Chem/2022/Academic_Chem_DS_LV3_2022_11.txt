In this study, we report the fabrication and electrochemical evaluation of a sequentially integrated LiFePO₄/Al₂O₃/Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ full cell architecture for advanced Li-ion batteries, with a primary focus on the role of the spray-deposited Al₂O₃ separator. Conventional polypropylene separators, while widely used, often exhibit limitations in thermal stability and electrolyte wettability, which can compromise long-term cyclability. Our methodology employed a scalable spray-deposition technique to create a conformal, microporous Al₂O₃ ceramic layer directly onto the electrodes, promoting intimate interfacial contact and a homogeneous electrolyte distribution. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed a notable enhancement in ionic conductivity compared to conventional cells, attributed to the superior liquid electrolyte uptake and Lewis acid-base interactions of the Al₂O₃ coating. Furthermore, galvanostatic cycling tests demonstrated exceptional capacity retention of 96.3% after 400 cycles at 1C rate, significantly outperforming reference cells with commercial separators. These results, obtained in 2022, underscore the efficacy of integrated, ceramic-based separator designs in mitigating capacity fade and advancing the development of high-performance, durable energy storage systems.
