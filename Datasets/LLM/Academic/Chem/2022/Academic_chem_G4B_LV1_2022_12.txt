**Influence of Infrared Cavity Modes on Chemical Reaction Dynamics via Polariton Chemistry**

Recent experimental findings in chemical reactivity have necessitated a refined understanding of the role of vibrational modes in influencing reaction pathways. This work presents a quantum dynamics investigation employing a model incorporating infrared (IR) cavity interactions to elucidate these effects. We demonstrate that embedding a chemical system within an IR cavity generates strong coupling between vibrational modes and the electromagnetic field, leading to the formation of polariton states.  These polariton states significantly alter the timescale and efficiency of chemical transitions, effectively mediating novel reaction dynamics.  Specifically, our simulations reveal a demonstrable enhancement in reaction rates for certain pathways, correlating with observed experimental trends.  The theoretical framework accounts for both radiative and non-radiative decay processes inherent in the cavity environment.  This approach provides a predictive tool for understanding and controlling chemical reactivity in systems with strong vibrational coupling, offering a pathway toward more accurate interpretation of complex spectroscopic data and potentially enabling targeted chemical transformations.
