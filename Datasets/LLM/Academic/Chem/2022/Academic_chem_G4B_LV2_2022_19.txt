**Abstract: Enhanced Li-ion Battery Performance via Spray-Deposited Al₂O₃ Separators**

The escalating demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates continuous advancements in separator technology. Conventional polymeric separators often exhibit limitations in thermal stability and ionic conductivity, impacting overall battery longevity and energy density. This study reports on the development and characterization of a novel spray-deposited aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) separator designed to address these challenges. Utilizing a precisely controlled spray deposition technique, we fabricated a uniform, porous Al₂O₃ layer onto a substrate, creating a functionally enhanced separator for LIB electrode assembly. 

Electrochemical testing of assembled cells utilizing the Al₂O₃ separator revealed a significant improvement in both cycle stability and rate capability compared to cells employing a standard polyethylene separator. Impedance spectroscopy indicated enhanced electrolyte conductivity within the separator matrix, facilitating improved lithium-ion transport. Furthermore, thermal gravimetric analysis confirmed superior thermal stability of the Al₂O₃ separator, mitigating the risk of thermal runaway. These findings suggest that spray-deposited Al₂O₃ represents a viable pathway towards developing next-generation LIB separators with superior performance characteristics. The demonstrated improvements underscore the potential for tailored ceramic separator architectures to fundamentally enhance the operational attributes of advanced Li-ion battery systems.
