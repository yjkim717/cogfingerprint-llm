**Abstract**

The interstellar medium (ISM) represents a complex chemical environment conducive to the formation of diverse molecular species. This research explores the potential for radical addition reactions involving simple hydrocarbons – specifically vinyl and ethyl precursors – as a primary mechanism for generating these key interstellar building blocks. Utilizing a computational framework incorporating established radical reaction pathways, we examined the propensity for selective h-abstraction and subsequent radical addition of methylene fragments to vinyl and ethyl radicals. Our investigation focused on identifying energetically favorable reaction sequences, considering factors such as bond dissociation energies, radical stabilization constants, and potential competing pathways. 

Preliminary results suggest that h-abstraction followed by addition of a methylene radical offers a viable route towards vinyl and ethyl formation, albeit influenced by the prevailing energetic landscape of the ISM. Further detailed modeling, incorporating rotational and vibrational effects, is warranted to refine these predictions and assess the relative contributions of alternative mechanisms. This work contributes to a broader understanding of interstellar chemical networks and the formation of complex organic molecules within cold, dense regions of space, with implications for astrochemical modeling and prebiotic chemistry investigations (2022).
