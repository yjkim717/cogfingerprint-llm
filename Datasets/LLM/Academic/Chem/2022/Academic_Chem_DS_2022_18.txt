This study presents a novel multilayer lithium-ion battery architecture fabricated via sequential spray deposition, incorporating a ceramic-enhanced separator layer. The separator is composed of a porous Al₂O₃ particle matrix, engineered to provide superior electrolyte wettability and thermal stability. When coupled with a high-performance LiFePO₄ cathode and a Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ anode, this integrated cell design demonstrates a significant enhancement in electrochemical performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy reveals a marked increase in bulk ionic conductivity, attributed to the optimized pore structure and homogeneous distribution of the ceramic phase, which facilitates more efficient Li⁺ ion transport pathways. Furthermore, galvanostatic cycling tests at a rate of 1C show exceptional capacity retention of 98.5% after 300 cycles, a substantial improvement over cells employing conventional polyolefin separators. This performance is linked to the suppression of lithium dendrite formation and improved interfacial stability at both electrodes. The scalable spray-deposition technique outlined herein offers a promising and industrially relevant pathway for manufacturing next-generation, high-safety energy storage devices with extended cycle life.
