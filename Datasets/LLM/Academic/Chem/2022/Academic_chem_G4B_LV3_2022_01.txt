**Abstract**

The heterogeneous chemistry of interstellar ices represents a critical yet incompletely understood component of star-forming regions. This study investigates the diffusion of hydroxyl (OH) radicals on water ice, a fundamental process governing the chemical evolution of these environments. Utilizing photostimulated desorption coupled with resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (PRIME) spectroscopy, we experimentally determined the activation energy for OH diffusion on water ice to be 0.14 ± 0.01 eV.  These findings reveal a significant discrepancy between the measured activation energy and prevailing theoretical models, suggesting limitations in current kinetic theory applied to ice surface diffusion.  The observed value implies a relatively high energy barrier for OH migration, potentially influenced by ice grain boundaries and surface morphology.  Further investigation into the specific mechanisms governing this diffusion, including vibrational modes and surface reorganization, is warranted to refine our understanding of complex ice chemistry and its implications for prebiotic molecule formation within interstellar ices.
