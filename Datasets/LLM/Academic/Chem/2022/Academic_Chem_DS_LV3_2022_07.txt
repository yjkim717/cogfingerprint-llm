The strategic implementation of sequential deposition protocols for fabricating integrated cathode–inorganic separator–anode multilayers represents a significant advancement in Li-ion battery architecture. This study demonstrates that employing a spray-deposited Al₂O₃-based separator markedly enhances electrochemical performance and thermal stability compared to conventional polyolefin separators. The Al₂O₃ layer functions as a robust thermal barrier and facilitates homogeneous Li-ion flux, mitigating parasitic side reactions at electrode interfaces. Electrochemical evaluation reveals exceptional cycling stability, with spray-deposited cells achieving 96.3% capacity retention after 400 cycles—substantially outperforming conventional counterparts (79.2%). Furthermore, thermal abuse tests confirm the inorganic separator's efficacy in suppressing thermal runaway propagation up to 200°C. These findings, documented in 2022, establish spray-deposited ceramic separators as a scalable manufacturing solution for developing high-safety, high-energy-density storage systems, addressing critical challenges in electric vehicle and grid storage applications through materials engineering and processing innovation.
