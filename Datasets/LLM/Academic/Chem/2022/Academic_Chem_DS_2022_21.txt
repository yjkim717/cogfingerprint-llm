**Abstract**

The nondetection of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing heterocyclic molecules in the TMC-1 dark cloud presents a significant astrochemical paradox, given their prevalence in terrestrial biochemistry. To quantitatively constrain their abundances, we employed a comprehensive radiative transfer model coupled with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, utilizing deep, unbiased spectral line surveys from the GOTHAM project at the Green Bank Telescope. Our analysis establishes stringent upper limits (≤ 1 × 10⁻¹²) on the column densities of key five- and six-membered heterocycles. These results imply that either gas-phase formation routes for these complex aromatic systems are highly inefficient under cold core conditions, or that rapid destructive processes dominate their chemical evolution. The absence of these structurally simple, yet biologically relevant, scaffolds in a chemically rich source like TMC-1 challenges existing astrochemical networks and underscores the unknown prebiotic pathways for aromatic molecular assembly in the interstellar medium.
