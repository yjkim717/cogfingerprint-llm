**Abstract**

The performance of lithium-ion batteries is critically dependent on the properties of the separator, which governs ionic transport and electrochemical stability. Conventional polyolefin separators, while mechanically robust, often exhibit limited electrolyte wettability and thermal resilience. This study investigates the efficacy of a novel, spray-deposited ceramic separator composed of Al₂O₃ particles for use in high-performance cells featuring a LiFePO₄ cathode and a Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ anode. The fabrication process enabled the creation of a thin, uniform, and mechanically integrated Al₂O₃ layer directly onto the electrode surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that this ceramic separator possesses an ionic conductivity of 4.15 mS cm⁻¹, approximately double that of a commercial polypropylene (PP) separator under identical conditions, attributed to enhanced electrolyte uptake and superior pore structure. Galvanostatic cycling tests demonstrated exceptional capacity retention, with the Al₂O₃-based cell maintaining 98.2% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles at 1C, significantly outperforming the PP counterpart. These results, from 2022, underscore the potential of spray-deposited ceramic separators to enable safer and more durable lithium-ion batteries with high-power electrodes by facilitating superior lithium-ion kinetics and interfacial stability.
