**Abstract**

The performance and longevity of lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion) are critically dependent upon the integrity and properties of the separator material. This work investigates a novel approach to separator fabrication utilizing sequential deposition of alumina (Al₂O₃) via spray-coating techniques.  A key challenge in conventional Li-ion battery design lies in achieving uniform separator thickness and minimizing interfacial impedance. Our research demonstrates that a controlled, layered Al₂O₃ deposition process significantly enhances separator characteristics.  Scanning electron microscopy reveals a porous, conformal coating, improving electrolyte accessibility and reducing contact resistance between the electrodes. Electrochemical testing of cells incorporating this spray-deposited Al₂O₃ separator reveals a marked improvement in both capacity retention and cycle stability, exhibiting a 15% increase in coulombic efficiency after 100 cycles. These findings suggest that scalable spray deposition offers a promising route to advanced separator materials for next-generation Li-ion battery technology.
