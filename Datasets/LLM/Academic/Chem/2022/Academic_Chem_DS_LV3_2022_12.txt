The emerging paradigm of polariton chemistry, mediated by vibrational strong coupling (VSC) within infrared optical cavities, represents a transformative frontier for controlling chemical reactivity. In this work, we employ high-dimensional quantum dynamical simulations to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms by which VSC modulates reaction pathways. Our results demonstrate that the formation of hybrid light-matter states, vibrational polaritons, induces significant alterations to potential energy surfaces. This leads to the emergence of quantum mechanical resonances and state splittings that directly govern reaction kinetics. Critically, we observe that these effects manifest as sharp, non-monotonic changes in reaction rates under specific resonance conditions, a phenomenon that classical or semi-classical treatments fail to capture. These findings underscore the indispensable role of a fully quantum mechanical framework for the accurate prediction and interpretation of cavity-modified chemical processes. This work establishes a foundational quantum dynamical perspective for the targeted manipulation of molecular transformations through tailored photonic environments.
