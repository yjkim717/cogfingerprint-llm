**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry explores the manipulation of chemical processes by coupling molecular vibrations to the quantized electromagnetic modes of an optical cavity, a phenomenon known as vibrational strong coupling (VSC). While experimental evidence has demonstrated altered chemical reactivity under VSC, the precise quantum mechanical mechanisms governing these changes remain a subject of intense investigation. This study employs high-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the fundamental effects of VSC on a prototypical chemical reaction. Our results demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—significantly modifies the anharmonic potential energy surfaces governing nuclear motion. This modification leads to the suppression of specific vibrational modes that constitute the reaction coordinate, thereby altering the effective reaction barrier. Furthermore, we identify the critical role of cavity loss rates and the collective coupling strength in determining the magnitude of the kinetic effect. These findings provide a rigorous, quantum-mechanical rationale for VSC-mediated control of chemistry, moving beyond phenomenological models and establishing a foundational framework for the targeted design of cavity-modified reactions.
