**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM) presents a significant astrochemical challenge, as conventional thermal reaction pathways are kinetically inhibited. This study investigates the non-equilibrium reaction dynamics of H and OH radicals with small, unsaturated C₂ hydrocarbons, specifically acetylene and ethylene, under ISM-relevant conditions (T ≈ 10–50 K). We demonstrate that the dominant mechanism for molecular growth is not direct hydrogen abstraction but rather a barrierless or low-barrier radical addition to the π-system, leading to the formation of vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) radical intermediates. Crucially, the subsequent isomerization and dissociation steps of these energized adducts, which possess significant activation barriers, are shown to proceed efficiently via quantum tunneling. High-level ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) simulations confirm that tunneling dramatically enhances the rate constants for these H-migration and H-elimination steps by several orders of magnitude compared to classical predictions. Our results provide a robust, tunneling-driven framework for the gas-phase synthesis of vinyl-bearing molecules and their oxygenated analogues, resolving key inconsistencies between existing astrochemical models and observational data from millimetre-wave telescopes. This work underscores the necessity of incorporating quantum effects in modelling the chemical evolution of prebiotic systems in the ISM.
