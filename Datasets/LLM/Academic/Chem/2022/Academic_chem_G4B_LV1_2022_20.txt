**Abstract**

The influence of non-equilibrium electromagnetic fields on chemical reactivity remains a compelling area of investigation. This work presents a quantum dynamical study exploring the impact of infrared cavity fields on chemical reaction rates, specifically examining instances of vibrational strong coupling. Utilizing a time-dependent Schrödinger equation approach, we model the interaction between a reactant molecule and an embedded infrared cavity, predicting alterations to the vibrational energy levels and subsequent changes in reaction pathways. Our simulations demonstrate that resonant excitation within the cavity can induce significant rate enhancements, attributable to the formation of polariton-like states. These emergent states effectively mediate vibrational energy transfer, circumventing traditional energy barriers and accelerating chemical transformations.  The observed modifications highlight the potential for manipulating chemical reactivity through tailored infrared cavity designs, offering a novel avenue for controlled chemical synthesis and reaction optimization. Further research will explore the generality of these findings across diverse molecular systems and reaction types.
