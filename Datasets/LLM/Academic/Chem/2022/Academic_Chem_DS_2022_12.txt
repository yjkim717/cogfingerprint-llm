The integration of photoresponsive molecular switches into supramolecular polymers has unlocked unprecedented capabilities for spatiotemporal control over material properties and functions. This burgeoning field leverages light as a non-invasive stimulus to modulate intermolecular interactions, thereby directing supramolecular polymerization processes and inducing macroscopic changes in soft matter systems. Key advances in 2022 have focused on the rational design of chromophores—including azobenzenes, diarylethenes, and spiropyrans—that undergo reversible conformational or electronic transitions upon irradiation. These photo-induced alterations directly impact monomer binding affinities and packing parameters, enabling dynamic, out-of-equilibrium assemblies. Consequently, researchers have successfully engineered light-driven soft actuators, reconfigurable gels, and self-erasing optical materials that exhibit complex, life-like motions and adaptive behaviors. Current challenges involve enhancing photostationary states, achieving multi-wavelength addressability, and translating these systems into robust, energy-efficient devices. The continued synergy between molecular synthesis, theoretical modeling, and materials engineering promises to yield increasingly sophisticated photoresponsive platforms for applications in targeted drug delivery, soft robotics, and sustainable technologies.
