Title: Exploring Radical-Mediated Pathways to Vinyl and Ethyl-bearing Molecules in Interstellar Environments

Abstract:
The interstellar medium (ISM) is a complex chemical factory where various molecular species are synthesized through diverse reaction pathways. This study (2022) investigates the role of radical reactions involving C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 on interstellar dust grains in forming vinyl and ethyl-bearing molecules. Employing a combination of theoretical chemical kinetics and astrochemical modeling, we elucidate the mechanisms of radical addition and H abstraction reactions that govern the formation of these species. Our results indicate that these reactions are efficient pathways to producing vinyl and ethyl-bearing molecules, thereby contributing to the rich interstellar chemistry observed in various astrophysical environments. The findings highlight the significance of grain-surface chemistry in shaping the molecular composition of the ISM and provide new insights into the astrochemical processes that underpin the formation of complex organic molecules.
