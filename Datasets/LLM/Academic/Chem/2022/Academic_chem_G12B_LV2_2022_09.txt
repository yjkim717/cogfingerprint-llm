**Abstract**

Hydroxyl (OH) radicals are crucial reactive species in interstellar environments, mediating complex chemical pathways within icy grain mantles. Understanding the dynamics of OH diffusion within these ices is essential for accurately modeling interstellar chemistry. This study presents experimental measurements of the activation energy (Ea) for OH radical diffusion on interstellar ice analogs, employing a photostimulated desorption (PSD) technique. Specifically, we investigated the thermally activated release of OH following UV irradiation of frozen water ice. Analysis of the PSD spectra revealed a characteristic temperature dependence consistent with a thermally-driven diffusion process. From this, we have determined an activation energy of 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV for OH diffusion. This value is significantly lower than previously estimated, suggesting a more facile mobility of OH within interstellar ice than previously considered. The implications of this finding for the overall reaction rates and efficiency of radical-mediated processes in cold molecular clouds are discussed, highlighting the need for updated astrochemical models.
