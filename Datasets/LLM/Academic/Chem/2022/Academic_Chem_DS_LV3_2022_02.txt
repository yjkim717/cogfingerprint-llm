In the astrochemical context of 2022, the synthesis of complex organic molecules in the cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM) presents a significant kinetic challenge. This study computationally investigates the critical gas-phase pathways for the formation of vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecules, which are key precursors to molecular complexity. We demonstrate that radical addition reactions to small unsaturated hydrocarbons like C₂H₂ and C₂H₄, coupled with subsequent hydrogen (H) abstraction steps, provide efficient low-temperature routes to these species. Our quantum chemical calculations, incorporating tunneling corrections, reveal that reactions with atomic hydrogen and the hydroxyl (OH) radical are particularly potent. The exceptionally low activation barriers for these processes, when augmented by significant quantum tunneling effects, enable rapid molecular growth even at temperatures as low as 10-50 K. These non-equilibrium kinetics are crucial for explaining the observed abundances of species such as vinyl cyanide (C₂H₃CN) and ethyl cyanide (C₂H₅CN) in dark molecular clouds like TMC-1. Our results underscore that radical-driven surface chemistry, followed by desorption, is not a prerequisite for this molecular diversity, establishing robust gas-phase mechanisms that significantly advance our understanding of prebiotic chemistry in the ISM.
