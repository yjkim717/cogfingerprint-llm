**Abstract**

The intricate interplay between quantum dynamics and chemical reactivity is increasingly recognized as a critical factor governing reaction pathways, particularly in systems exhibiting strong coupling between vibrational modes and electromagnetic fields. This research investigates the impact of an infrared cavity on chemical reaction rates, leveraging quantum dynamics modeling to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we demonstrate substantial alterations in rate constants observed within a chemically reactive system when subjected to resonant infrared field modification. Our simulations reveal that quantum light-matter interactions, manifested through the formation of polariton states, significantly alter the vibrational landscape and subsequent transition probabilities. 

The observed rate constant shifts are attributed to the enhanced coupling between the reactant molecules and the cavity field, effectively promoting or suppressing specific reaction pathways.  These findings contribute to a growing understanding of ‘polariton chemistry,’ where light and matter co-exist and influence chemical processes.  The results, presented in 2022, underscore the potential for utilizing engineered optical cavities to precisely control and manipulate chemical reactivity at the quantum level, offering novel avenues for catalyst design and reaction optimization.
