In this study, we present the first experimental quantification of the activation energy for OH radical surface diffusion on interstellar ice analogs, a critical parameter governing low-temperature astrochemical reactivity. Utilizing temperature-programmed desorption and precise Arrhenius analysis, we determine an activation energy of 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV. This exceptionally low barrier implies that OH diffusion becomes significant at approximately 36 K, a temperature prevalent in cold molecular clouds. Our findings fundamentally revise existing models of interstellar chemistry, demonstrating that key radical-mediated surface reactions, previously assumed to be dormant, can proceed efficiently in these frigid environments. This work, conducted in 2022, provides the foundational kinetic data required to accurately simulate complex molecule formation in dark interstellar regions, with profound implications for understanding the molecular origins of life.
