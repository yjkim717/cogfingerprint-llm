In this study, we experimentally quantify the activation energy for surface diffusion of hydroxyl (OH) radicals on interstellar ice analogues under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Utilizing photostimulated desorption coupled with resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization techniques, we measured the diffusion kinetics and derived an activation energy of 0.14 ± 0.01 eV. This value, interpreted through the Arrhenius equation, implies that OH radical mobility and subsequent surface reactions can initiate at temperatures as low as ~36 K. These findings provide critical kinetic parameters for astrochemical models, suggesting that radical-driven chemical networks in cold interstellar environments—such as molecular clouds—may be more active than previously assumed, with significant implications for the synthesis of prebiotic molecules in space.
