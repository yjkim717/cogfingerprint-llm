Title: Investigating the Formation of Vinyl-Bearing Molecules on Interstellar Dust Grains via Radical Addition and H Abstraction Reactions

Abstract:

The interstellar medium (ISM) is characterized by a complex chemistry involving the interaction of gas-phase species with interstellar dust grains. This study (2022) focuses on elucidating the formation mechanisms of vinyl-bearing molecules, crucial precursors to complex organic molecules, on these dust grains. Utilizing a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches, we investigate the role of radical addition and H abstraction reactions in the synthesis of vinyl and ethyl molecules. Our results indicate that the vinyl radical can be formed through the addition of C2H to simple hydrocarbons adsorbed on dust grains, while subsequent H abstraction reactions facilitate the formation of vinyl-bearing molecules. The findings provide new insights into the astrochemical processes governing the formation of complex molecules in the ISM, shedding light on the molecular evolution of the universe. The study's outcomes have significant implications for understanding the chemistry of interstellar dust grains and the origins of complex organic molecules.
