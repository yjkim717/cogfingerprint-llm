In 2022, the burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has been fundamentally reshaped by theoretical advances in quantum dynamics. Our research demonstrates that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) within infrared optical cavities provides a powerful mechanism for manipulating chemical reactivity. Through high-dimensional quantum wavepacket simulations, we elucidate that the formation of hybrid light-matter states, known as vibrational polaritons, induces significant modifications to potential energy surfaces. This work establishes that the observed sharp changes in reaction rates are not merely spectral effects but arise directly from quantum mechanical state splittings and resonant interactions between molecular vibrations and the cavity vacuum field. These non-intuitive quantum effects, including the suppression or enhancement of specific reaction pathways, offer a robust theoretical framework that reconciles prior experimental observations of cavity-modified chemistry. Consequently, this study provides a foundational principle for the emerging paradigm of cavity quantum electrodynamics as a tool for controlling molecular transformations, with profound implications for catalysis and quantum-controlled synthesis.
