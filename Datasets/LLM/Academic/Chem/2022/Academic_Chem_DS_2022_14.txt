**Abstract**

The structural characterization of concentrated aqueous electrolytes remains a pivotal challenge in physical chemistry, with significant implications for energy storage and biogeochemical processes. While molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are indispensable for interpreting experimental scattering data and elucidating ion solvation phenomena, the quantitative accuracy of these models, particularly regarding ion-pairing dynamics, is often inadequate. This investigation employs a combined approach of neutron diffraction with isotopic substitution (NDIS) and advanced MD simulations to probe the microstructure of concentrated magnesium bromide (MgBr₂) solutions. A central focus is the critical evaluation of non-polarizable force fields against their polarizable counterparts, which explicitly account for electronic response. Our NDIS results provide direct, experimental determination of Mg²⁺–water and Br⁻–water coordination numbers and distances, serving as a benchmark for computational validation. Comparative analysis reveals that while inclusion of electronic polarization within the MD framework yields a marked improvement in reproducing the experimentally observed weakening of ion hydration shells and the propensity for contact ion-pair formation, persistent discrepancies remain. Specifically, standard polarizable models overestimate the stability of solvent-separated ion pairs while underestimating the spatial extent of ion-induced water structuring. These findings, contextualized within the year 2022, underscore that even state-of-the-art polarizable force fields do not fully capture the many-body electronic effects and charge transfer phenomena inherent in concentrated, strongly interacting ionic solutions. This work highlights the necessity for next-generation models that move beyond mean-field polarization to achieve quantitative agreement with experimental structural data.
