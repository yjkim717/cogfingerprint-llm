**Abstract**

The emergence of polariton chemistry as a distinct field necessitates a deeper understanding of how strong coupling between molecular vibrational modes and cavity photons impacts chemical reaction dynamics. This work investigates the influence of vibrational strong coupling on reaction rates using quantum dynamics simulations. We demonstrate that the formation of polaritons, arising from the coherent interaction between a molecular vibration and an electromagnetic field confined within an optical cavity, leads to a significant modification of the systemâ€™s energy landscape. This modification manifests as the splitting of vibrational energy levels and the creation of new resonant pathways not accessible in the free molecule. Specifically, we explore model chemical reactions and show that the presence of polaritons alters the vibrational dynamics, influencing both the rate of product formation and the distribution of product vibrational states. Our simulations reveal that the degree of rate enhancement or retardation is critically dependent on the polariton energy matching with reactive vibrational modes. These findings underscore the potential for cavity-mediated control over chemical reactivity and provide a theoretical framework for the rational design of reactions governed by quantum vibrational strong coupling. The implications of these results extend to the development of novel photocatalytic processes and the fundamental understanding of light-matter interactions in chemical systems.
