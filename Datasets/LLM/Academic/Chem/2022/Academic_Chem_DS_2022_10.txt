A comprehensive spectral line survey of the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC-1) was conducted using the Green Bank Telescope to investigate the prevalence of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing heterocyclic compounds in cold interstellar environments. Through Markov Chain Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling of rotational transitions in the 8-50 GHz range, we establish stringent upper limits (N<10^11 cm^-2) for several five- and six-membered heterocycles including pyrrole, pyridine, and furan derivatives. The non-detections suggest these complex aromatic systems remain below observable abundances despite TMC-1's rich molecular inventory. We propose that the absence of heterocycles may reflect kinetic inhibition in bottom-up formation pathways or rapid hydrogenation under dark cloud conditions. These findings provide critical constraints for astrochemical networks modeling complex organic molecule formation in early star-forming regions.
