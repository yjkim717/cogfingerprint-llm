**Abstract**

The influence of vibrational strong coupling on chemical reactivity within infrared cavity environments represents a burgeoning area of investigation. This work presents a quantum dynamics-based model exploring the modification of reaction rates stemming from robust light-matter interactions. Utilizing a time-dependent Schrödinger equation, we simulate chemical transformations within a condensed phase system incorporating an infrared cavity. Our analysis reveals a pronounced correlation between the strength of vibrational coupling and the magnitude of observed rate constant alterations. Specifically, enhanced vibrational modes, coupled to the cavity field, demonstrate a significant propensity to alter the radiative decay pathways of reactant excited states. 

These modifications, mediated by quantum light-matter interactions, lead to observable shifts in reaction kinetics, effectively demonstrating a ‘cavity effect’ on chemical processes.  The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how tailored spectroscopic environments can be leveraged to control chemical reactivity at the quantum level.  Further research will explore the applicability of these principles across diverse chemical systems and reaction mechanisms, with implications for areas such as photochemistry and catalysis (2022).
