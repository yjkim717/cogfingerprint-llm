Of particular significance in astrochemical reaction networks are the formation pathways of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM). This investigation employs high-level quantum chemical calculations, specifically coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)] with augmented correlation-consistent basis sets, to elucidate the mechanistic details and kinetics of radical addition reactions with fundamental C₂ hydrocarbons. Our results demonstrate that the addition of atomic hydrogen (H•) and the hydroxyl radical (OH•) to acetylene (C₂H₂) and ethylene (C₂H₄) constitutes a dominant low-temperature pathway. These barrierless or minimally barriered reactions efficiently produce vinyl (C₂H₃•) and ethyl (C₂H₅•) radical intermediates, which are critical precursors to larger COMs. Subsequent hydrogen abstraction (H-abstraction) by these nascent radicals from abundant interstellar species like molecular hydrogen (H₂) or water (H₂O) ice mantles facilitates the formation of closed-shell vinyl and ethyl derivatives, including ethene and ethane. The identified pathways, characterized by favorable energetics and rate constants relevant to ISM conditions (~10-50 K), provide a robust non-thermal framework for explaining the observed abundances of these molecules in star-forming regions, thereby advancing our understanding of molecular complexity in space.
