**Abstract**

The investigation of hydroxyl radical (OH•) radical dynamics on water ice remains crucial for understanding astrochemical processes and icy planetary environments. This study reports on a novel experimental determination of the activation energy governing OH• radical diffusion across water ice surfaces, achieved through the technique of photostimulated desorption (PSD) in 2022. PSD, employing focused laser irradiation, induces the desorption of ice fragments containing implanted OH• radicals, enabling quantification of diffusion rates. Analysis of the desorption spectra revealed a distinct correlation between laser fluence and the yield of desorbed species.  Applying transition state theory, we derived an activation energy of 0.14 eV for OH• radical diffusion. This value represents a key parameter for modeling OH• radical transport within icy matrices, influencing chemical reaction pathways and overall ice evolution. Further research employing isotopic labeling and varying ice temperatures will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of this fundamental process.
