**Abstract**

The investigation of hydroxyl radical (OH•) diffusion on water ice remains a critical area of research for understanding the early stages of prebiotic chemistry and planetary surface processes. This study reports experimental measurements of OH• radical activation energy for diffusion across water ice at 183 K, utilizing photostimulated desorption spectroscopy. Analysis of desorption spectra revealed a diffusion activation energy of 0.14 ± 0.02 eV.  This experimentally determined value significantly surpasses previously established theoretical estimates, suggesting a potentially more complex diffusion mechanism than currently modeled.  The observed discrepancy warrants further investigation into the interplay of vibrational modes and ice surface morphology during OH• transport.  Specifically, the potential influence of hydrogen bond network dynamics on barrier height deserves detailed scrutiny. These findings contribute to a refined understanding of radical mobility on icy planetary bodies and inform the development of accurate modeling frameworks for astrochemical reactions.
