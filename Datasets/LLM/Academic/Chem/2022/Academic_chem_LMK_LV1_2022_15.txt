Title: Enhanced Electrochemical Stability of Li-ion Batteries via Sequential Deposition of Al2O3-Based Inorganic Separators

Abstract:
The development of high-performance Li-ion batteries relies heavily on the advancement of separator technology. In this study, we report a novel approach to fabricate a porous Al2O3-based inorganic separator via sequential deposition, enabling the direct assembly of electrode/separator/electrode full cell configurations. The as-prepared separator exhibits a high porosity of  sixty percent and a uniform pore size distribution, ensuring efficient ionic conduction and reduced internal resistance. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the Al2O3-based separator demonstrates enhanced electrochemical stability, with a high ionic conductivity of 1.2 × 10^(-3) S cm^(-1) at 25°C. The assembled full cells display improved cycle life and rate capability, outperforming conventional counterparts. This work provides a promising strategy for the development of high-performance Li-ion batteries with enhanced safety and reliability, leveraging the advantages of inorganic separators and sequential deposition techniques.
