Title: Enhancing Li-ion Battery Performance with Sequentially Deposited Al2O3 Separators

Abstract:
The development of high-performance Li-ion batteries relies heavily on the advancement of separator technology. In this study, we demonstrate the efficacy of a novel Al2O3-based separator fabricated via sequential deposition, exhibiting enhanced electrochemical stability and improved cycling performance. The inorganic Al2O3 separator was deposited onto a conventional polyolefin substrate, resulting in a composite separator with superior wettability and thermal stability. Li-ion battery full cells incorporating the Al2O3 separator exhibited significantly improved capacity retention and coulombic efficiency over 500 cycles, outperforming cells with pristine polyolefin separators. The enhanced electrochemical stability of the Al2O3 separator is attributed to its uniform, dense, and defect-free microstructure, achieved through the optimized sequential deposition process. Our findings highlight the potential of Al2O3-based separators to enhance the performance and lifespan of Li-ion batteries, paving the way for their widespread adoption in energy storage applications.
