The surface mobility of hydroxyl radicals (OH) on interstellar ice analogues is a critical parameter governing the efficiency of solid-state astrochemical reactions. This study quantitatively determines the activation energy barrier for OH radical diffusion on amorphous solid water (ASW) films under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Employing photostimulated desorption (PSD) techniques coupled with temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), we measured the diffusion kinetics across the 20–40 K temperature range. The experimental data were fitted to the Arrhenius equation, yielding an activation energy of 0.14 ± 0.01 eV. This relatively low diffusion barrier implies significant OH mobility on icy grain mantles within cold molecular clouds, thereby facilitating the formation of complex organic molecules like H2O and H2O2 through grain-surface reactions that are central to interstellar prebiotic chemistry.
