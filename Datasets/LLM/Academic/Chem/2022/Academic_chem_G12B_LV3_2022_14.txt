**Abstract**

Laboratory simulations conducted in 2022 explored the chemical pathways leading to vinyl and ethyl radicals within the interstellar medium (ISM). Specifically, this study modeled radical addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions involving prevalent hydrocarbon precursors: ethane, ethylene, and acetylene. Results indicate a critical role for hydroxyl (OH) and hydrogen (H) radicals in facilitating the formation of more complex organic molecules adsorbed on dust grains. These findings contribute to a refined understanding of astrochemistry, suggesting that seemingly simple radical processes significantly impact the observed abundance and complexity of organic species within dense molecular clouds, ultimately influencing the chemical evolution of the ISM.
