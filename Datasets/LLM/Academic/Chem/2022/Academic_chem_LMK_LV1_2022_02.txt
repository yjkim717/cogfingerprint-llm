Title: Radical-Mediated Formation of Vinyl- and Ethyl-Bearing Molecules on Interstellar Dust Grains: A Theoretical Investigation

Abstract:

The interstellar medium (ISM) is characterized by a rich chemistry, with various molecular species detected in the gas phase and on dust grains. Recent observations have highlighted the presence of vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecules, sparking interest in their formation mechanisms. In this study (2022), we employ quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling to investigate the role of radical addition reactions and H abstraction reactions in the formation of these species on interstellar dust grains. Our results indicate that reactions involving C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 with radicals such as H, C, and CH3 can lead to the efficient formation of vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecules via barrierless or low-barrier pathways. The computed reaction rates and branching ratios are used to inform an astrochemical model, which successfully reproduces the observed abundances of vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecules in various ISM environments. Our findings provide new insights into the complex chemistry occurring on interstellar dust grains, shedding light on the molecular precursors to more complex organic species.
