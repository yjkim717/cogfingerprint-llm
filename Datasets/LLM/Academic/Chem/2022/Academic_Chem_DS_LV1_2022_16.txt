**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, wherein molecular ensembles are coherently coupled to confined light modes in optical cavities, presents a paradigm shift for controlling chemical reactivity. While electronic strong coupling has been extensively explored, the influence of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on ground-state reaction dynamics remains a subject of intense debate. Herein, we employ exact quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic role of VSC within infrared cavities on a model proton-transfer reaction. Our results demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—dramatically alters the reaction rate by modifying the potential energy landscape along the reaction coordinate. Specifically, we identify a resonant effect where the cavity frequency, when tuned to a specific molecular vibration, induces a significant suppression of the reaction rate by enhancing quantum mechanical tunneling barriers. This work provides a rigorous, non-intuitive quantum dynamical framework that moves beyond classical transition state theory, establishing VSC as a potent tool for manipulating chemical pathways through targeted quantum interference effects, with profound implications for catalysis and quantum-controlled synthesis.
