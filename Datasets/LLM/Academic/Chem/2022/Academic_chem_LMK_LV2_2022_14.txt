Title: Investigating the Formation of Vinyl and Ethyl Molecules on Interstellar Dust Grains via Radical Addition and H Abstraction Reactions

Abstract:

The interstellar medium (ISM) is a complex environment where various chemical reactions occur on dust grains, influencing the formation of diverse molecular species. This study (2022) focuses on the synthesis of vinyl and ethyl molecules on interstellar dust grains through radical addition and H abstraction reactions. Employing a combination of theoretical models and laboratory experiments, we elucidate the mechanistic pathways underlying the formation of these molecules. Our results indicate that the vinyl-bearing molecules are formed via radical addition reactions involving vinyl radicals and unsaturated hydrocarbons. Conversely, H abstraction reactions facilitate the conversion of ethyl-bearing molecules to vinyl-bearing species. The findings provide new insights into the chemistry of the ISM, shedding light on the role of interstellar dust grains in shaping the molecular composition of the ISM. The study's outcomes have significant implications for understanding the astrochemical processes governing the formation of complex molecules in the ISM.
