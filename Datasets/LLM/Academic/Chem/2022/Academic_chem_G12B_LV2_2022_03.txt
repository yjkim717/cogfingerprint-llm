**Abstract**

The pursuit of high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates advancements in separator technology to enhance ionic conductivity, mechanical integrity, and electrochemical stability. Conventional polymeric separators often exhibit limitations in thermal stability and electrolyte wettability, impacting rate capability and long-term cycling performance. This work introduces a novel separator architecture based on sequentially deposited aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) films, fabricated via a scalable spray deposition technique, designed for direct full-cell assembly. The sequential deposition process allows for controlled manipulation of the Al₂O₃ film morphology and porosity, optimizing electrolyte infiltration and minimizing interfacial resistance. Electrochemical characterization, including cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling, demonstrates significantly improved rate performance and cycling stability compared to commercially available polyethylene separators. Specifically, full-cell configurations employing the Al₂O₃ separator exhibit enhanced capacity retention at elevated current densities.  Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy reveals a reduced charge transfer resistance at the electrode-separator interface. These findings suggest that the controlled microstructure afforded by sequential Al₂O₃ deposition effectively mitigates lithium dendrite formation and facilitates efficient ion transport. This approach represents a promising strategy for developing next-generation LIB separators with improved electrochemical performance and safety characteristics, contributing to the advancement of energy storage technologies in 2022 and beyond.
