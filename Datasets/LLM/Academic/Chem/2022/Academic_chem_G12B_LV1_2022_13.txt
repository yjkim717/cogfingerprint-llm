## Abstract: Experimental Determination of OH Radical Diffusion Activation Energy within Interstellar Ice Analogues

Understanding the dynamics of reactive species within interstellar ices is crucial for accurately modeling astrochemistry and the formation of complex organic molecules in cold molecular clouds. Hydroxyl radicals (OH) play a pivotal role in these processes, facilitating radical recombination and initiating chemical networks. This study, conducted in 2022, presents experimental findings concerning the diffusion of OH radicals within water ice analogues, simulating conditions prevalent in interstellar environments. We employed photostimulated desorption (PSD) techniques to probe the diffusion behavior of OH radicals trapped within frozen water matrices. By analyzing the temperature dependence of the OH desorption rate, we derived the activation energy (Ea) for diffusion. Results indicate an Ea of 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV, consistent with a thermally activated diffusion mechanism. This value was determined by fitting the experimental data to an Arrhenius equation. Our findings contribute to a refined understanding of OH radical mobility within interstellar ices, providing valuable input for chemical kinetics models aimed at predicting the abundance and reactivity of these key species in astrophysical settings. Further research will explore the influence of ice composition and morphology on OH diffusion kinetics.
