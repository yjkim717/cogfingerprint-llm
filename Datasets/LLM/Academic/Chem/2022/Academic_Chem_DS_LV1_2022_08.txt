**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry explores how strong light-matter interactions within optical cavities can control molecular processes. While initial experimental observations of modified chemical reactivity under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) are compelling, a definitive quantum mechanical rationale remains elusive. Here, we employ full-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic origin of VSC-mediated rate modification for a model proton-transfer reaction. Our 2022 study demonstrates that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—fundamentally alters the anharmonic potential energy surface along the reaction coordinate. This restructuring is not a mere transition state stabilization but arises from a cavity-induced suppression of specific reactant normal modes, which concomitantly enhances quantum tunneling probabilities. The simulations reveal a non-intuitive, non-thermal pathway where the vacuum field of the infrared cavity selectively decouples vibrational energy redistribution, thereby steering the reaction dynamics. These findings establish that VSC provides a novel quantum control knob for chemistry, moving beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and opening avenues for manipulating reactions through the design of bespoke electromagnetic environments.
