**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has revealed intriguing interplay between molecular vibrational dynamics and cavity quantum electrodynamics. This work, conducted in 2022, investigates the impact of vibrational strong coupling on chemical reaction kinetics through rigorous exact quantum dynamics simulations. Our findings demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—arising from strong coupling between molecular vibrations and infrared cavity modes—leads to distinct modifications of reaction rate constants. Specifically, the energy level splitting and the emergence of resonant pathways induced by polariton formation significantly alter the population dynamics of reactants and products. These modifications are quantitatively assessed and provide a theoretical framework consistent with recent experimental observations. This study underscores the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics to precisely control and modulate chemical reactivity, offering novel avenues for reaction engineering and fundamentally advancing our understanding of quantum-enhanced chemical processes.
