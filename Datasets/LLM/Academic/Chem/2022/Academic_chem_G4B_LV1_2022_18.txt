**Abstract**

The persistent detection of vinylidene (CH<sub>2</sub>=CH<sub>2</sub>) and ethylidene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) fragments within interstellar molecular clouds presents a significant challenge to prevailing astrophysical models of gas-phase chemistry. This research explores the potential role of radical reactions, specifically radical addition and H abstraction pathways, in generating these key building blocks. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we examined the thermal decomposition of vinyl and ethyl radicals under conditions representative of the interstellar medium (ISM). Our simulations focused on identifying energetically favorable pathways leading to the formation of these unsaturated hydrocarbons. Results indicate that H abstraction from vinyl and ethyl, followed by subsequent radical addition reactions, constitutes a viable mechanism for their observed abundances. Understanding these processes is crucial for refining spectroscopic interpretations and accurately modeling the chemical evolution of interstellar environments, particularly concerning the formation of complex organic molecules.
