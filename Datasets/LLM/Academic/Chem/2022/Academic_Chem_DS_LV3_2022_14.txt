In the complex chemical network of the interstellar medium (ISM), the formation pathways for organic molecules remain a central focus of astrochemical research. This study investigates the gas-phase reactivity of small hydrocarbon precursors—specifically acetylene (C₂H₂), ethylene (C₂H₄), and ethane (C₂H₆)—with atomic hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals. Through a combination of quantum chemical calculations and kinetic modeling, we demonstrate that radical addition and hydrogen (H) abstraction reactions constitute dominant, low-temperature mechanisms for synthesizing vinyl- and ethyl-substituted molecular species. Our results, contextualized for 2022, reveal that these non-Arrhenius reactions proceed with notable efficiency in cold molecular clouds, a phenomenon largely attributable to significant quantum tunneling effects that surmount classical kinetic barriers. The identified pathways provide a robust chemical framework explaining the observed abundances of complex organic molecules (COMs) in regions such as dark clouds and protostellar envelopes. This work underscores the critical role of radical-driven gas-phase chemistry in the molecular complexity of the ISM and refines our predictive capacity for chemical evolution in extraterrestrial environments.
