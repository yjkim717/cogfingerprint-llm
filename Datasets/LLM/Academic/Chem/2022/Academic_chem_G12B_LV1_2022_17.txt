## Abstract: Probing OH Radical Diffusion in Interstellar Ice Analogues via Photostimulated Desorption

Understanding the mobility of reactive species within interstellar ices is crucial for modeling complex astrochemistry, particularly the formation and evolution of molecular clouds. Hydroxyl radicals (OH) play a pivotal role in these environments, participating in numerous chemical reactions. This study, conducted in 2022, presents experimental measurements of the activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>) for OH radical diffusion within a water ice matrix, mimicking conditions prevalent in interstellar grain surfaces. We employed photostimulated desorption (PSD) techniques, utilizing UV irradiation to induce localized heating and subsequent OH release, enabling the determination of diffusion parameters. Analysis of the PSD signal intensity as a function of temperature allowed for the application of the Arrhenius equation. Our results yield an activation energy of E<sub>a</sub> = 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV for OH radical diffusion in water ice. This value, significantly lower than previously assumed, suggests a surprisingly facile mobility of OH within these cold, dense environments. These findings have implications for the efficiency of radical-radical reactions and the overall chemical network within interstellar ices, potentially influencing the abundance of key molecular species.
