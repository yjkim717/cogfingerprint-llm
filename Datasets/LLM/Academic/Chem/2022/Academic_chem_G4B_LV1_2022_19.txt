**Abstract**

The performance characteristics of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are critically dependent upon the integrity and electrochemical stability of the separator component. This study reports on the fabrication and characterization of an alumina (Al₂O₃) separator, produced via a novel sequential deposition technique utilizing a spray-coating methodology.  The resultant Al₂O₃ layer, applied directly onto a conventional polymer separator, exhibited a markedly enhanced barrier effect against electrolyte penetration, mitigating capacity fade during extended cycling. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a porous, hierarchical structure facilitating ionic conductivity while maintaining robust mechanical stability. Electrochemical testing demonstrated a significant improvement in cycling stability, evidenced by a reduced capacity loss over 500 cycles compared to the unmodified polymer separator.  Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy indicated reduced interfacial resistance at the electrode interfaces. These findings suggest that controlled, sequential deposition of Al₂O₃ offers a promising route towards enhancing the longevity and overall efficiency of Li-ion battery systems, warranting further investigation into process optimization and broader material compatibility.
