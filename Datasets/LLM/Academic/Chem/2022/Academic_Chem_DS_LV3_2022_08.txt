In this study, we present comprehensive quantum dynamics simulations demonstrating that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) within infrared optical cavities induces substantial modifications to chemical reaction rates, thereby establishing a novel paradigm in polariton chemistry. By confining molecular systems in resonant infrared cavities, we observe the formation of hybrid light-matter states, known as vibrational polaritons, which split the original vibrational modes and create new quantum mechanical pathways. Our simulations reveal that these state splittings and resonances directly enhance or suppress reaction rates by redistributing vibrational energy and altering transition state dynamics. Crucially, we show that semiclassical approximations fail to capture these effects, underscoring the necessity of a fully quantum treatment for predictive accuracy. These findings, contextualized within 2022 advancements, highlight VSC as a powerful tool for controlling chemical reactivity and provide a foundational framework for future experimental and theoretical explorations in quantum-enhanced catalysis.
