In the complex chemical network of the interstellar medium (ISM), the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) on cold dust grains remains a critical astrochemical process. This study investigates the role of radical addition reactions, specifically involving atomic hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals, as a dominant non-thermal pathway for molecular growth. We demonstrate that these reactions efficiently convert simple precursors, namely acetylene (C₂H₂) and ethylene (C₂H₄), into more complex vinyl and ethyl-bearing species. Critically, our kinetic modelling reveals that quantum tunneling through reaction barriers dramatically enhances the addition rates of H atoms, with calculated rates exceeding 10^4 s^-1 under ISM conditions. This pronounced tunneling effect facilitates the rapid hydrogenation of unsaturated carbon chains, even at cryogenic temperatures where classical reactions are kinetically inhibited. Consequently, radical addition, particularly H abstraction followed by addition, is posited as a fundamental mechanism for the synthesis of prebiotic molecular building blocks in dark molecular clouds. These findings necessitate a revision of current astrochemical models to fully incorporate non-thermal quantum processes, thereby providing a more accurate framework for understanding molecular evolution in the cosmos.
