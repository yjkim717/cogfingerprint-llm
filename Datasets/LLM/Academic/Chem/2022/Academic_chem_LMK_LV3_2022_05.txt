In 2022, a study investigated the surface diffusion dynamics of OH radicals on interstellar ice analogs. Utilizing photostimulated desorption and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization techniques, the activation energy for OH radical diffusion was determined to be 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV. The temperature-dependent diffusion rates were analyzed using the Arrhenius equation, providing insight into the mobility of OH radicals on icy surfaces. These findings have significant implications for understanding the role of surface chemistry in interstellar environments, shedding light on the formation of complex molecules in the interstellar medium.
