**Abstract**

The performance of lithium-ion batteries (Li-ion) is critically dependent on the integrity and properties of the separator, a key component preventing electrolyte leakage while facilitating ion transport. This work investigates a novel approach to separator fabrication utilizing spray deposition of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) – a promising alternative to conventional polymeric separators. A precisely controlled spray deposition technique was employed to create a continuous, porous Al₂O₃ layer directly onto a substrate, subsequently forming a functional separator. Electrochemical testing of Li-ion cells incorporating this Al₂O₃ separator revealed a significant enhancement in both cycling stability and overall capacity retention. Comparative analysis indicated a demonstrable reduction in impedance and improved interfacial contact between the electrodes and electrolyte. These findings suggest that scalable spray deposition offers a viable route to producing high-performance separators, potentially mitigating degradation mechanisms and extending the operational lifespan of Li-ion battery systems. Further research will focus on optimizing deposition parameters and exploring the impact of varying Al₂O₃ morphology on separator characteristics.
