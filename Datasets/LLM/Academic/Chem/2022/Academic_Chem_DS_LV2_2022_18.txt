Of particular significance in astrochemical reaction networks are the interactions between abundant radicals and small hydrocarbons, which serve as critical pathways for molecular growth in the interstellar medium (ISM). This study computationally investigates the kinetics and mechanisms of hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radical reactions with C₂ hydrocarbons, primarily acetylene and ethylene, under conditions pertinent to cold molecular clouds. Utilizing high-level coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)] in conjunction with astrochemical kinetic models, we demonstrate that these systems proceed overwhelmingly via barrierless, fast radical addition mechanisms rather than direct hydrogen abstraction. The addition of H to acetylene forms the vinyl radical, a crucial precursor to larger unsaturated organics, while its addition to ethylene yields the ethyl radical. Conversely, OH addition leads to the formation of vinyl and ethyl alcohol radicals. These addition products are identified as key reactive intermediates in the gas-phase synthesis of complex organic molecules (COMs). The calculated rate coefficients, exceeding 10⁻¹⁰ cm³ molecule⁻¹ s⁻¹ at 10 K, confirm these as dominant, efficient pathways for molecular growth, significantly influencing the predicted abundances of oxygenated and hydrocarbon species in astrochemical databases.
