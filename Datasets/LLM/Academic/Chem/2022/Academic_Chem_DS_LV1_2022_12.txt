**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry explores how strong light-matter interactions within optical cavities can control molecular processes. While initial experimental observations of modified chemical reactivity under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) are compelling, a definitive quantum mechanical rationale remains elusive. Herein, we employ full-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic origin of VSC-mediated rate suppression for a model SN2 reaction, F⁻ + CH₃Cl → FCH₃ + Cl⁻, confined in an infrared cavity resonant with the C-Cl stretch. Our 2022 results demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—fundamentally alters the reaction pathway. Specifically, the cavity induces a dynamical caging effect by quantizing the molecular configuration along the reaction coordinate, thereby increasing the effective barrier height. This is not a trivial thermal or dielectric effect but a genuine quantum phenomenon arising from the redistribution of zero-point energy and the suppression of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) into the reactive mode. These simulations provide a critical theoretical foundation, confirming that VSC can engineer potential energy surfaces in real-time, opening a novel paradigm for controlling chemical transformations with quantum vacuum fields.
