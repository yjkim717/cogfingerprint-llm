**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM) presents a significant astrochemical challenge, as classical thermal reaction kinetics are insufficient to overcome prevalent energy barriers. This computational investigation elucidates the role of quantum tunneling in facilitating the formation of vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecules—key molecular precursors to more complex astrobiological species—via non-thermal radical-mediated pathways. Employing high-level quantum chemical calculations (e.g., CCSD(T)/CBS), we characterized the potential energy surfaces for the radical addition of atomic hydrogen (H•) and hydroxyl (OH•) to small, unsaturated hydrocarbons, specifically acetylene (C₂H₂) and ethylene (C₂H₄). Our results demonstrate that subsequent intramolecular hydrogen atom abstraction (HAA) reactions in the initially formed adduct radicals proceed with significant tunneling enhancements, quantified using the Eckart model. These findings reveal that tunneling-dominated HAA mechanisms provide efficient, barrier-less routes to vinyl cyanide (C₂H₃CN) and ethanol (C₂H₅OH) analogues under ISM conditions (~10 K). This work establishes that quantum tunneling is not merely a corrective factor but a central driver in the gas-phase synthesis of prebiotic molecules, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of molecular complexity in extraterrestrial environments.
