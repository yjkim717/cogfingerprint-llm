**Abstract**

This research investigates an innovative architecture for lithium-ion battery construction, employing a sequential deposition technique to fabricate cells featuring an aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃)-based separator. The methodology prioritizes interfacial engineering to enhance electrochemical performance. Results demonstrate that the Al₂O₃ separator effectively mitigates dendrite formation and suppresses parasitic reactions, leading to markedly improved cycling stability compared to conventional Li-ion battery designs. While exhibiting rate capabilities comparable to established technologies, the presented cell architecture reveals a promising pathway toward extending battery lifespan and improving overall performance, aligning with the growing demand for high-performance and durable energy storage solutions. Further investigations are underway to optimize Al₂O₃ composition for enhanced ionic conductivity.
