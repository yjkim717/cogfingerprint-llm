**Abstract**

The integration of photoresponsive molecular switches into supramolecular polymers has unlocked unprecedented pathways for the spatiotemporal control of nanoscale assembly. This review, contextualized within advances circa 2022, explores the design principles governing these dynamic systems, where noncovalent interactions—such as hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, and metal coordination—are modulated by light. We focus on the strategic incorporation of chromophores, including azobenzenes, diarylethenes, and spiropyrans, which undergo reversible photoisomerization to trigger macroscopic phase transitions, morphological changes, or reversible polymerization/depolymerization cycles. A critical analysis is presented on how the kinetics of these photochemical processes dictate the response times and reversibility of the resulting materials. Furthermore, we highlight emergent applications in light-driven soft robotics and actuation, where controlled, non-contact energy transduction enables complex motion and reconfigurable matter. The discussion extends to adaptive and self-healing materials whose properties can be erased and rewritten on-demand, underscoring the pivotal role of photoresponsive supramolecular polymers in the development of next-generation intelligent soft materials.
