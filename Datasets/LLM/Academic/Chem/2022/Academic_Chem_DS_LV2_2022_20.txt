**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry explores how strong light-matter coupling within optical cavities can control molecular processes. While electronic strong coupling has been extensively studied, the influence of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on ground-state chemical reactivity remains a subject of intense debate. This work employs high-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic role of VSC within infrared cavities. Our results demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—significantly alters the reaction pathways and kinetic rates of fundamental chemical transformations. The simulations reveal that the redistribution of vibrational energy and the modification of the potential energy landscape under strong coupling are the primary drivers of this altered reactivity, rather than simple thermal or cavity heating effects. These findings provide a critical theoretical framework for interpreting recent experimental observations and establish quantum dynamics as an essential tool for disentangling the complex interplay between confined electromagnetic fields and molecular quantum mechanics. This work paves the way for the precise manipulation of chemical reactions using tailored infrared photonic environments.
