Title: Enhanced Electrochemical Stability in Li-ion Batteries via Sequential Deposition of Al2O3-Based Inorganic Separators

Abstract:
The development of high-performance Li-ion batteries relies heavily on the advancement of separator technology. This study presents a novel approach to fabricating Al2O3-based inorganic separators via sequential deposition, enabling the direct assembly of electrode/separator/electrode full cells. The resultant separators exhibit improved electrochemical stability, attributed to the uniform distribution of Al2O3 particles and the optimized interfacial properties. The Al2O3-based separators demonstrate enhanced ionic conductivity and reduced interfacial resistance, leading to improved cycling stability and rate capability in Li-ion battery full cells. The proposed sequential deposition method offers a promising route for the scalable production of high-performance inorganic separators, paving the way for the development of next-generation Li-ion batteries with enhanced safety and energy density.
