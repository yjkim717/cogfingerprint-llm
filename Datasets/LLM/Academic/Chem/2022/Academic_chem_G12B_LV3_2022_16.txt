**Abstract**

Recent advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) have revealed a burgeoning field of “polariton chemistry,” prompting re-evaluation of conventional paradigms governing chemical reactivity. This work, conducted in 2022, investigates the impact of vibrational strong coupling on chemical reaction dynamics through rigorous exact quantum dynamics simulations. Our findings demonstrate that the formation of molecular vibrational polaritons, arising from the strong interaction between molecular vibrations and infrared cavity modes, fundamentally alters reaction pathways. Specifically, the splitting of vibrational energy levels and the emergence of resonant states induce quantifiable changes to reaction rate constants, often deviating significantly from predictions based on standard, non-coupled treatments. This theoretical framework provides a robust explanation for experimentally observed modifications in chemical reactivity under strong coupling conditions and highlights the potential for manipulating reaction efficiencies through tailored cavity design.
