The development of accurate and computationally efficient machine-learned force fields remains a central challenge in computational chemistry. While equivariant neural networks have demonstrated significant promise in modeling atomic systems, conventional approaches relying on two-body message passing often fail to capture complex many-body interactions essential for chemical accuracy. This work introduces a novel architecture that systematically incorporates higher-body-order interactions within an equivariant message-passing framework. By explicitly constructing representations of local atomic environments that encode multi-center correlations, our model achieves a more complete description of chemical bonding and long-range interactions without requiring deep network architectures. Benchmark calculations across diverse molecular and materials systems demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on energy and force predictions while maintaining favorable computational scaling. The method enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations of complex systems previously inaccessible to machine learning potentials, representing a significant advancement toward scalable and chemically accurate force field development for computational chemistry applications.
