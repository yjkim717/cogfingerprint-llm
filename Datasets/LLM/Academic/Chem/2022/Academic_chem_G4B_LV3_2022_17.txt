**Abstract**

The dynamics of hydroxyl (OH) radical diffusion on water ice are fundamental to understanding interstellar chemistry and prebiotic processes. This study presents experimental data characterizing the activation energy governing OH diffusion on solid H₂O ice. Utilizing a temperature-programmed desorption technique, we determined an activation energy of 0.14 ± 0.01 eV. This experimentally observed value deviates substantially from prevailing theoretical models, which predicted a lower activation barrier. The discrepancy suggests a revised understanding of the ice surface structure and its influence on radical mobility.  Further investigation into vibrational modes and surface defects is warranted to reconcile experimental findings with existing theoretical frameworks.  These results highlight the importance of direct experimental validation in complex chemical systems and provide critical constraints for simulating chemical evolution in icy environments, particularly within interstellar molecular clouds.
