Title: Investigating Vinyl and Ethyl Molecule Formation on Interstellar Dust Grains via Radical Addition and H Abstraction Reactions

Abstract:

The interstellar medium (ISM) is characterized by complex chemical processes that govern the formation of diverse molecular species. This study (2022) focuses on the synthesis of vinyl-bearing molecules and their hydrogenated counterparts on interstellar dust grains. Utilizing a combination of theoretical and computational methodologies, we elucidate the role of radical addition and H abstraction reactions in facilitating the formation of these molecules. Our results indicate that the vinyl moiety can be efficiently generated through the addition of C2H radicals to unsaturated hydrocarbons, while subsequent H abstraction reactions enable the formation of ethyl derivatives. The findings provide novel insights into the astrochemical processes governing the ISM, highlighting the significance of interstellar dust grains as catalysts for complex molecular synthesis. The proposed reaction mechanisms offer a robust framework for understanding the observed abundance of vinyl-bearing molecules in various astrophysical environments.
