**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry explores the impact of strong vibrational coupling within cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) on chemical reaction dynamics. This study, employing rigorous exact quantum dynamics simulations, investigates the influence of cQED on chemical reactivity in a condensed-phase environment. Our findings demonstrate that conventional reaction rate theories often fail to accurately predict experimentally observed modifications to reactivity when strong coupling is present. Specifically, the emergence of quantum mechanical resonances, arising from the formation of polariton states, plays a decisive role in mediating reaction pathways and altering reaction timescales. These results highlight the necessity of incorporating quantum dynamical approaches to fully understand and model cavity-modified chemical reactions, emphasizing that vibrational strong coupling fundamentally reshapes the landscape of chemical reactivity and necessitates a shift toward quantum-aware chemical modeling strategies.
