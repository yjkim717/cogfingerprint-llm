**Abstract**

The pursuit of advanced separator architectures is critical for enhancing the performance metrics of lithium-ion batteries. Conventional polyolefin separators often exhibit limitations in thermal stability and electrolyte wettability, constraining ionic transport and long-term cyclability. Herein, we report a novel, single-step fabrication protocol for high-performance Li-ion batteries via the sequential spray-deposition of an Al₂O₃-based ceramic separator directly onto the electrode surface. This integrated manufacturing approach eliminates delamination issues associated with laminated structures and ensures intimate interfacial contact. Electrochemical evaluation reveals that the spray-deposited Al₂O₃ separator possesses an ionic conductivity of 1.24 mS cm⁻¹, approximately double that of a commercial Celgard 2325 reference separator. Furthermore, LiCoO₂/graphite full-cells incorporating this separator demonstrate exceptional capacity retention of 96.3% after 400 cycles at 1C rate, underscoring its efficacy in suppressing parasitic side reactions and stabilizing the electrode-electrolyte interface. This work establishes spray deposition as a viable and scalable technique for producing robust ceramic separators that significantly augment battery performance and durability.
