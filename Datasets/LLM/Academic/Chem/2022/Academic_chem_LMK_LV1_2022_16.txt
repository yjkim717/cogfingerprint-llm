Title: Quantum Dynamics of Vibrational Polariton Chemistry: Insights into Cavity-Modified Chemical Reactivity

Abstract:
The emerging field of vibrational polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention in recent years, with experimental studies demonstrating the potential of vibrational strong coupling to modulate chemical reactivity within infrared cavities. In this work, we employ an exact quantum dynamics approach to investigate the cavity-modified quantum dynamics of a model chemical reaction. Our results reveal significant changes in reactivity due to the interplay between quantum effects and vibrational strong coupling. By analyzing the quantum dynamics of the system, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these changes, highlighting the crucial role of non-adiabatic effects and quantum coherences. Our findings provide new insights into the quantum dynamics of vibrational polariton chemistry, shedding light on the potential of cavity-modified chemistry to control and manipulate chemical reactivity with unprecedented precision.
