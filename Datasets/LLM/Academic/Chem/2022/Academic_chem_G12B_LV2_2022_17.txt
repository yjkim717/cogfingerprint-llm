**Abstract**

Hydroxyl (OH) radicals are pivotal reactive species in interstellar environments, playing a crucial role in the formation of complex organic molecules. Understanding their behavior within icy grain surfaces is therefore critical to astrochemical models. This study presents experimental measurements of the activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>) governing OH radical diffusion on water ice analogs, simulating conditions prevalent in cold molecular clouds. Utilizing photostimulated desorption techniques, we probed the mobility of OH trapped within amorphous H<sub>2</sub>O ice films. Our findings reveal an unexpectedly low activation energy of 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV for OH diffusion. This value suggests a remarkably facile hopping mechanism, potentially driven by the presence of surface defects or a higher degree of ice disorder than previously assumed. These results have significant implications for the predicted abundance and reactivity of OH radicals in interstellar ices, warranting further investigation into the influence of ice composition and structural properties on diffusion kinetics.
