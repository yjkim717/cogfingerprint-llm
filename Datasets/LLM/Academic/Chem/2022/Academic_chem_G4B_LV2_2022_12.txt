**Abstract**

The influence of vibrational strong coupling on chemical reactivity, particularly within the context of infrared (IR) cavity systems, represents a burgeoning area of investigation. This research leverages quantum dynamics to quantitatively assess the impact of an IR cavity on reaction pathways and rates. Utilizing a multi-level quantum mechanical model, we demonstrate that the resonant interaction between cavity photons and reactant vibrational modes induces a pronounced shift in reaction dynamics. Specifically, the formation of polariton states – a hybrid light-matter excitation – significantly alters the timescale of key vibrational transitions, leading to observable rate enhancements. 

Our simulations, conducted in 2022, reveal that the magnitude of these rate changes is critically dependent on the cavity’s spectral overlap with the reactant’s vibrational frequencies and the strength of the coupling. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of polariton chemistry and its potential role in accelerating chemical transformations.  Further investigation into tailored cavity designs and varying molecular environments is warranted to fully exploit this quantum light-matter interaction for controlled chemical reactivity.
