Title: Unveiling the Formation Mechanisms of Vinyl- and Ethyl-bearing Molecules on Interstellar Dust Grains

Abstract:

The interstellar medium (ISM) is known to harbor a diverse array of complex organic molecules, including vinyl- and ethyl-bearing species. The present study investigates the formation of these molecules on interstellar dust grains through a combination of radical addition and H abstraction reactions. Employing a synergy of quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling, we elucidate the reaction pathways governing the formation of vinyl and ethyl derivatives. Our results indicate that the addition of C2H3 and C2H5 radicals to unsaturated hydrocarbons, followed by H abstraction reactions, constitutes a viable mechanism for the synthesis of vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecules. The calculated reaction rates and branching ratios are incorporated into a comprehensive astrochemical model, enabling the simulation of the ISM chemistry. The model predictions are found to be in good agreement with observational data, supporting the proposed formation mechanisms. This study provides new insights into the chemistry of the ISM, shedding light on the molecular processes that underpin the formation of complex organic species in 2022.
