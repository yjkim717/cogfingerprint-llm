**Abstract**

Recent advancements in lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) technology necessitate innovative separator materials to optimize cell performance. This study details the development and characterization of an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> separator fabricated via a novel spray-deposition technique.  The resultant porous Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer, exhibiting controlled deposition morphology, demonstrated a marked improvement in Li-ion battery assembly processes, facilitating direct component integration. Electrochemical testing revealed a substantial enhancement in cell capacity retention and cycle stability – specifically, a 18% increase in coulombic efficiency – compared to conventional polyethylene separators.  Analysis suggests that the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer effectively mitigates electrolyte decomposition and interfacial impedance, contributing to the observed performance gains. These findings underscore the potential of tailored, spray-deposited ceramic separators for next-generation Li-ion battery systems.
