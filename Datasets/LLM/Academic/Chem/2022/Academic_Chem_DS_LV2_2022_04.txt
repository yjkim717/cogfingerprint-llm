**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry explores how strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities can control molecular processes. While electronic strong coupling has been extensively studied, the influence of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on ground-state chemical reactivity remains a subject of intense debate. This work employs high-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic role of VSC within infrared cavities. We demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—fundamentally alters the potential energy landscape experienced by the molecular system. Our simulations reveal that this modification directly impacts reaction pathways and kinetic isotope effects, providing a quantum-mechanical rationale for the experimentally observed suppression or enhancement of reaction rates under VSC. The findings establish that these effects are not merely spectroscopic perturbations but arise from genuine quantum dynamics driven by the exchange of energy between the molecular vibrational modes and the cavity photon mode. This research provides a critical theoretical framework for harnessing quantum vacuum fields to control chemical reactivity with high specificity.
