**Abstract**

The investigation of hydroxyl radical (OH•) dynamics on water ice remains a critical area of research for understanding surface chemistry relevant to planetary environments and astrobiology. This work presents experimental determination of the activation energy governing OH• diffusion across water ice surfaces at cryogenic temperatures. Utilizing photostimulated desorption (PSD) spectroscopy, we quantified the energy barrier required for OH• to traverse the ice lattice. Analysis of desorption onset energies revealed an activation energy of 0.14 ± 0.02 eV.  The observed value suggests a predominantly hopping diffusion mechanism, influenced by localized ice grain boundaries and minimal thermal activation.  These findings contribute to refining models of OH• transport on icy bodies, providing constraints on surface reaction rates and potential prebiotic chemistry. Further investigation into the influence of ice morphology and vibrational modes is warranted to fully elucidate the complexities of OH• diffusion in this fundamental system.
