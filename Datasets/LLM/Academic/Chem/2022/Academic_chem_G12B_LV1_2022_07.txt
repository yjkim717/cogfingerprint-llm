>Okay, here's a formal, academic-style abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written as if it were a 2022 publication. I've aimed for precision, technical language, and a logical structure.  I've also included a few speculative details to flesh it out, consistent with current research trends.

**Abstract**

The ongoing demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates exploration of novel materials and fabrication techniques to enhance electrochemical stability and extend cycle life. This work details the development and characterization of a lithium-ion battery employing a ceramic-polymer composite separator incorporating alumina (Al₂O₃) nanoparticles, fabricated via a sequential deposition method. Traditional polymeric separators often suffer from thermal runaway and limited ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures. The incorporation of Al₂O₃ aims to improve thermal stability and reduce dendrite formation, key factors impacting capacity retention.  The sequential deposition process, involving alternating layers of the ceramic/polymer composite and a lithium-ion conducting electrolyte (a modified ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate blend incorporating lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salt), facilitates enhanced interfacial contact and a more uniform electrolyte distribution within the separator. Electrochemical performance was evaluated using half-cell and full-cell configurations with a graphite anode and a NMC811 cathode. Results demonstrate a significant improvement in capacity retention (up to 92% after 500 cycles at 0.5C) compared to batteries utilizing conventional polyethylene separators (78% retention).  Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and post-mortem scanning electron microscopy reveal a reduction in charge transfer resistance and a minimized formation of lithium dendrites, suggesting a mechanism for the observed performance enhancement. This approach offers a promising pathway for the development of safer and more durable LIBs for next-generation energy storage applications.
