**Abstract**

The diffusion of reactive species within icy grain mantles is a crucial process in interstellar chemistry, influencing the formation of complex molecules and impacting the overall composition of molecular clouds. This study investigates the diffusion kinetics of hydroxyl (OH) radicals within water ice, a prevalent component of interstellar ices. Utilizing a combined desorption and ionization experimental approach, we have directly measured the activation energy (Ea) for OH radical diffusion on water ice surfaces. Our results yield an Ea of 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV, determined through analysis consistent with the Arrhenius equation. This value represents a significant refinement of previous estimates and provides valuable constraints for astrochemical models. The relatively low activation energy suggests that OH radical diffusion occurs readily at astrophysically relevant temperatures, facilitating reactions and potentially contributing to the observed abundance of oxygen-bearing molecules in star-forming regions. These findings enhance our understanding of the chemical evolution occurring within interstellar ices.
