**Abstract**

Understanding the complex chemical evolution of the interstellar medium (ISM) requires elucidating the formation pathways of key organic radicals. This study, conducted within the context of 2022 astrochemical research, focuses on the catalytic production of vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) radicals – crucial building blocks for larger organic molecules – on dust grain surfaces. Through detailed kinetic modeling, we demonstrate that hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals play a pivotal role in facilitating the conversion of smaller hydrocarbon species, specifically ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂), into these unsaturated radicals. These radical reactions, occurring within the heterogeneous ice mantles of dust grains, offer a viable mechanism for increasing the complexity of organic molecules in star-forming regions. The findings contribute to a refined understanding of dust grain chemistry and its implications for prebiotic molecule synthesis in the ISM.
