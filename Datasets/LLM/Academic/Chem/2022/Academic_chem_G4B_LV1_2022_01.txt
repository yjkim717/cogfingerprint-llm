**Abstract**

The investigation of hydroxyl radical (OH•) dynamics on water ice remains a critical area for understanding astrochemical processes and ice surface chemistry. This research presents experimental data characterizing the diffusion of OH• radicals on water ice at cryogenic temperatures, specifically targeting a 0.14 eV activation energy. Utilizing photostimulated desorption spectroscopy, we quantified the energy barrier required for OH• radical migration across the ice surface. Our findings reveal a significantly higher activation energy than previously predicted by simplified kinetic models, suggesting a more complex diffusion mechanism than initially assumed.  These results highlight the importance of considering subtle energetic factors influencing radical transport within ice matrices.  Further investigation into the specific pathways and potential trapping sites contributing to this disparity is warranted, potentially involving isotopic labeling and advanced spectroscopic techniques to refine theoretical representations of OH• diffusion on water ice.
