**Abstract**

The interstellar medium (ISM) represents a chemically complex environment wherein the formation of simple organic molecules, precursors to more intricate compounds, is hypothesized to occur via radical reactions. This research investigates the mechanistic pathways leading to vinyl and ethyl molecule formation within the ISM, focusing on the interplay between simple hydrocarbon substrates and the ubiquitous presence of dust grains. Utilizing computational modeling and analyzing relevant spectroscopic data, we explore the significance of radical addition and abstraction processes – specifically, the formation of vinyl and ethyl species – as critical steps in these interstellar syntheses. 

Our analysis highlights the influence of dust grain surfaces as potential reaction sites, promoting localized concentrations of reactive radicals. The observed propensity for vinyl and ethyl formation suggests a dominant role for chain propagation mechanisms, driven by interstellar photon irradiation.  Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the overall chemical inventory of molecular clouds and the potential delivery of prebiotic molecules to planetary systems.  Further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate the relative contributions of diverse radical pathways.
