**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, wherein molecular ensembles are coherently coupled to the quantized modes of an optical cavity, presents a paradigm shift for controlling chemical reactivity. While initial experimental demonstrations have shown that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in infrared cavities can significantly suppress or enhance reaction rates, the precise quantum mechanical origins of these effects remain a subject of intense debate. In this work, we employ multi-mode quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic role of VSC in a model S<sub>N</sub>2 reaction. Our results demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—fundamentally alters the reaction landscape. Specifically, we identify that the redistribution of vibrational energy into the cavity mode induces a dynamical decoupling of the reactive coordinate from the bath of intramolecular modes, effectively raising the activation barrier. This quantum dynamical bottleneck, rather than a static modification of the potential energy surface, is shown to be the primary driver of the observed rate suppression under strong coupling conditions. These findings provide a crucial theoretical framework for interpreting VSC experiments and pave the way for the rational design of cavity-modified chemical processes.
