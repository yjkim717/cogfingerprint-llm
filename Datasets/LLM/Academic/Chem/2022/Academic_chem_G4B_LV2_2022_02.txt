**Abstract**

The interstellar medium (ISM) represents a chemically complex environment wherein the formation of simple organic molecules, precursors to more complex compounds, is hypothesized to occur via radical mechanisms. This research examines the potential for radical addition and abstraction reactions involving fundamental hydrocarbons – specifically methane and ethane – within the ISM, focusing on the generation of vinylidene and ethyl radicals. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we assessed reaction energetics and transition states for these key processes under simulated ISM conditions, considering the influence of dust grain surfaces.

Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant propensity for ethane abstraction to yield ethyl radicals, alongside a minor, yet observable, pathway for vinylidene formation via methane addition. Crucially, the presence of dust grains was found to substantially alter reaction barriers, favoring ethyl radical formation through a concerted mechanism. These results provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the observed abundance of ethyl species in interstellar spectra and highlight the critical role of heterogeneous catalysis – dust grains – in driving radical chemistry and ultimately, the formation of simple organic building blocks within the ISM. Further investigation is warranted to explore the impact of varying ISM densities and radiation fields.
