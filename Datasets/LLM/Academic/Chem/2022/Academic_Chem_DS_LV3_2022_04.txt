Abstract

The emergent field of polariton chemistry, wherein molecular ensembles are coupled to the quantized electromagnetic modes of an optical cavity, presents a paradigm shift for controlling chemical reactivity. This investigation employs high-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic role of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) within infrared cavities. Our results demonstrate that the formation of hybrid light-matter states, known as vibrational polaritons, induces significant and often non-intuitive modifications to reaction rates. These alterations are not merely perturbative but arise from fundamental changes in the reaction pathway, driven by anharmonic resonances and the redistribution of quantum states within the polaritonic manifold. Crucially, we observe that the experimentally documented sharp transitions in reactivity are a direct consequence of these quantum state splittings, which effectively decouple the reactive mode from the thermal bath. This work underscores that a fully quantum mechanical treatment, which explicitly accounts for the quantized nature of the cavity field and its strong coupling to molecular vibrations, is indispensable. Semi-classical or perturbative approximations fail to capture the essential physics, thereby establishing VSC as a genuine quantum effect with profound implications for the targeted manipulation of chemical transformations.
