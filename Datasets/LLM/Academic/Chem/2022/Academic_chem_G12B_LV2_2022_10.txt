**Abstract**

The chemical complexity of the interstellar medium (ISM) necessitates investigations into the formation pathways of key organic molecules. This study, conducted within the framework of astrochemical modeling, explores the viability of radical-based reactions involving simple hydrocarbons – ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂) – as precursors to vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) species prevalent in interstellar ices and gas phases. Specifically, we examine the efficiency of hydrogen abstraction and radical addition processes mediated by hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals at relevant ISM temperatures (10-100 K). Kinetic calculations, incorporating experimentally derived rate coefficients where available and employing estimations based on analogous reactions where necessary, demonstrate that both H and OH radicals can contribute significantly to the formation of vinyl and ethyl fragments. The relative importance of each pathway is temperature-dependent, with hydrogen abstraction from ethane exhibiting a strong influence on ethyl formation at higher temperatures. Moreover, the subsequent addition of hydrogen atoms to vinyl radicals represents a crucial step in ethyl synthesis. These findings contribute to a refined understanding of the chemical network responsible for the observed abundance of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the ISM and provide constraints for future laboratory studies aimed at validating these reaction pathways under simulated astrophysical conditions.
