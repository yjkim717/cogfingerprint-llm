## Abstract: Enhanced Rate Performance and Simplified Cell Fabrication in Lithium-Ion Batteries via Sequential Deposition of Alumina Coatings on Polyolefin Separators

The increasing demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates advancements in both electrochemical properties and manufacturing efficiency. Traditional LIB assembly involves multiple, complex steps, potentially compromising cell integrity and hindering scalability. This work, conducted in 2022, explores a novel approach to LIB separator design focused on simplifying full cell fabrication while simultaneously enhancing electrochemical performance. We report the development and characterization of a modified polyolefin separator incorporating a thin, conformally coated layer of alumina (Al₂O₃) achieved through a controlled sequential deposition process. This technique allows for direct electrolyte introduction and electrode stacking, circumventing the need for traditional pre-assembly procedures.

The resulting Al₂O₃-modified separator exhibits a significantly reduced interfacial resistance, correlating with an improved electrolyte conductivity compared to uncoated counterparts. Electrochemical testing, encompassing galvanostatic cycling at varying C-rates, demonstrates a marked enhancement in rate capability and cycling stability. Specifically, cells utilizing the modified separator maintain a higher capacity retention over extended cycling periods, particularly at elevated current densities.  These improvements are attributed to the combined effects of the increased ionic conductivity and the robust mechanical properties imparted by the alumina coating, mitigating dendrite penetration and improving overall cell longevity.  This simplified assembly process, coupled with the observed improvements in electrochemical performance, represents a promising pathway towards next-generation, high-throughput LIB manufacturing.
