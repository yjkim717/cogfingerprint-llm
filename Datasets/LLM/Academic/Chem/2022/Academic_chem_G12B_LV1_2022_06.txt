Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by your provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style appropriate for a chemistry publication in 2022, aiming for around 232 words.  I've focused on expanding the scope slightly and suggesting implications for astrochemical models.

**Abstract**

The chemical complexity of the interstellar medium (ISM) necessitates a thorough understanding of the formation pathways of unsaturated organic molecules. This study examines the potential for radical-mediated synthesis of vinyl and ethyl species from simple hydrocarbon precursors – ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂) – relevant to conditions prevalent in dense molecular clouds. Utilizing computational chemistry methods, specifically density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigated the reaction kinetics of hydrogen atom (H•) and hydroxyl radical (OH•) addition to these alkane and alkene substrates. Our investigation focused on both radical addition and hydrogen abstraction pathways, evaluating the energetic barriers and predicted product distributions. Results indicate that H• addition to acetylene is particularly favorable, yielding substantial contributions to vinyl radical formation. Similarly, OH• reactions with ethylene proceed efficiently via radical addition, establishing a competitive route to ethyl radical precursors.  Hydrogen abstraction pathways were also explored, revealing less thermodynamically favorable outcomes for vinyl and ethyl group generation compared to direct radical addition. These findings provide crucial insights into the relative importance of these reactions within astrochemical networks. The derived rate constants and branching ratios are presented, and their implications for refining current chemical models of the ISM are discussed.  Furthermore, this work highlights the potential for these reactions to contribute significantly to the observed abundance of vinyl and ethyl functionalities observed in interstellar ices and gas-phase spectra, offering a pathway to bridging the gap between simple molecules and more complex organic matter.
