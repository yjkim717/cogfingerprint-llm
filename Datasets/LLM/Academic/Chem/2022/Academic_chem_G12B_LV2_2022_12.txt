**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has revealed the potential for strong coupling between molecular vibrational modes and cavity photons to profoundly influence chemical reactivity. This work investigates the impact of vibrational strong coupling on reaction dynamics through rigorous quantum mechanical simulations, addressing a key mechanistic gap in understanding cavity-modified reaction pathways. Utilizing a time-dependent Schrödinger equation approach, we modeled a prototypical chemical reaction exhibiting vibrational strong coupling, demonstrating that the resulting hybrid quasiparticles – polaritons – fundamentally reshape the system's potential energy surface.  Our simulations reveal that the energy landscape distortion induced by strong coupling leads to altered transition state geometries and, consequently, significant modifications to reaction rates compared to the non-coupled molecular system. Furthermore, we observed the emergence of non-intuitive reaction trajectories dictated by polaritonic coherence, highlighting the departure from conventional transition state theory predictions. These findings underscore that quantum mechanical effects, specifically coherence and energy redistribution within polariton modes, play a crucial, and often counterintuitive, role in determining reaction outcomes. This research provides a fundamental theoretical framework for interpreting experimental observations in polariton chemistry and opens avenues for the rational design of light-matter interfaces to control and enhance chemical transformations.
