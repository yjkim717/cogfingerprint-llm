Title: Unveiling the Formation Pathways of Vinyl and Ethyl-Bearing Molecules in the Interstellar Medium through Radical-Mediated Reactions

Abstract:
The interstellar medium (ISM) is a complex environment where various chemical reactions occur on dust grains, influencing the formation of diverse molecular species. This study (2022) explores the role of radical addition and H abstraction reactions involving C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 in the synthesis of vinyl and ethyl-bearing molecules. Through a comprehensive analysis of reaction pathways on interstellar dust grains, we demonstrate that these radical-mediated processes significantly contribute to the formation of complex organic molecules. Our results indicate that the addition of radicals to C2H2 and C2H4 leads to the efficient production of vinyl-bearing species, while H abstraction reactions involving C2H6 facilitate the formation of ethyl-bearing molecules. These findings provide new insights into the astrochemical processes governing the ISM, shedding light on the molecular complexity observed in various astrophysical environments.
