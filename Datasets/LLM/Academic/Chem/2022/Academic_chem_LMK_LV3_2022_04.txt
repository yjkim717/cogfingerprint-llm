Title: Quantum Dynamics of Vibrational Polariton Chemistry: Unveiling the Impact of Vibrational Strong Coupling on Chemical Reactivity

Abstract:
The emerging field of vibrational polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention in recent years, with vibrational strong coupling (VSC) being identified as a key factor influencing chemical reactivity. In this study, we employ an exact quantum dynamics approach to investigate the effects of VSC on chemical reactions within infrared cavities. Our results demonstrate that VSC significantly alters reactivity by inducing quantum mechanical state splittings and resonances. By examining the quantum dynamics of vibrational polaritons, we reveal the underlying mechanisms driving these changes. Our findings provide new insights into the role of VSC in shaping chemical reactivity, highlighting the potential for VSC to be harnessed in the control of chemical reactions. This work contributes to the growing understanding of vibrational polariton chemistry and its implications for the field of chemistry. (2022)
