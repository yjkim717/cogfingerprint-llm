Title: Enhancing Li-ion Battery Performance with Al2O3-Based Inorganic Separators Fabricated via Sequential Deposition

Abstract:
The development of advanced separators is crucial for improving the electrochemical stability and overall performance of Li-ion batteries. In this study, we report the fabrication of a novel Al2O3-based inorganic separator using a sequential deposition method, enabling the creation of integrated cathode-separator-anode multilayers. The Al2O3 separator exhibits enhanced thermal stability and ionic conductivity, resulting in improved cycling stability and rate capability. The sequential deposition technique allows for precise control over the separator's thickness and morphology, ensuring uniform coverage and minimizing defects. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the Al2O3 separator-based Li-ion batteries demonstrate superior performance, with capacity retention exceeding 90% after 500 cycles. This work highlights the potential of Al2O3-based inorganic separators in advancing Li-ion battery technology, paving the way for more efficient and reliable energy storage solutions. (2022)
