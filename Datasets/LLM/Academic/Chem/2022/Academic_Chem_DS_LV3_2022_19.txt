This study demonstrates a sequential spray-deposition methodology for fabricating integrated cathode–inorganic separator–anode multilayers, employing a porous Al₂O₃-based separator, to substantially advance Li-ion battery performance. Conventional battery assembly, involving discrete component fabrication and stacking, often introduces interfacial resistance and mechanical instability. Our approach mitigates these issues by creating a seamlessly integrated multilayer architecture through a scalable spray-deposition process. Electrochemical analysis reveals that this integrated structure doubles the ionic conductivity compared to conventional cells with polyolefin separators, facilitating superior lithium-ion transport kinetics. Furthermore, the robust and electrochemically stable Al₂O₃ layer effectively suppresses parasitic side reactions and lithium dendrite growth. Consequently, the assembled cells exhibit exceptional long-term cyclability, achieving 96.3% capacity retention after 400 cycles at a 1C rate. These findings, obtained in 2022, underscore the profound efficacy of sequential deposition strategies for manufacturing high-performance, durable solid-state-like Li-ion batteries with enhanced interfacial properties and operational longevity.
