**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry explores how strong light-matter coupling within optical cavities can control molecular processes. While electronic strong coupling has been extensively studied, the influence of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on ground-state chemical reactivity remains a topic of intense debate. Herein, we employ high-dimensional quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic role of VSC within infrared cavities. Our results demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—significantly alters the reaction pathways and kinetic rates of fundamental chemical transformations. The observed modifications in reactivity are attributed to the redistribution of vibrational energy and the resultant quantum interference effects, which are inaccessible in the classical regime. This work provides a rigorous theoretical framework that moves beyond phenomenological models, establishing a direct causal link between cavity-induced quantum correlations and chemical kinetics. These findings, from 2022, underscore the potential of VSC as a novel tool for controlling chemistry at the quantum level, paving the way for the design of cavity-modified synthetic protocols.
