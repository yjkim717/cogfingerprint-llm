Title: Quantum Dynamics of Vibrational Polariton Chemistry: Implications for Ground State Reactivity

Abstract:
Recent advancements in vibrational polariton chemistry have underscored the potential of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) to modulate ground state chemical reactivity within infrared cavities. Employing a quantum dynamics approach, our study elucidates the underlying mechanisms by which VSC influences molecular reactivity. We demonstrate that VSC induces significant alterations in the quantum mechanical state landscape, characterized by pronounced state splittings and resonances. These effects, in turn, modulate reaction pathways and kinetics, yielding novel reactivity patterns. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the interplay between VSC and chemical reactivity, shedding light on the quantum mechanical origins of vibrational polariton chemistry. The implications of this work are far-reaching, with potential applications in the rational design of cavity-mediated chemical reactions and the development of novel reactivity paradigms. (2022)
