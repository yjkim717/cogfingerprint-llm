**Abstract: Enhanced Ionic Conductivity and Electrochemical Performance in Lithium-Ion Batteries via Spray-Deposited Al₂O₃-Based Separator Architecture**

The ongoing demand for high-energy density and enhanced safety in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates advancements in separator technology. Conventional separators often present limitations regarding interfacial resistance and electrolyte uptake, impacting overall cell performance. This work introduces a novel separator architecture based on aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) fabricated via a sequential deposition spray pyrolysis technique, designed to facilitate direct electrode/separator/electrode assembly and minimize interfacial impedance. The Al₂O₃ film was deposited onto a porous polymer substrate, optimizing pore size and ceramic loading for enhanced electrolyte accessibility.

Characterization via X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) confirmed the amorphous nature and uniform distribution of the Al₂O₃ coating. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed significantly improved ionic conductivity compared to commercially available separators, attributed to reduced charge transfer resistance at the electrode-separator interface. Specifically, the fabricated separator demonstrated a conductivity of [Insert specific conductivity value here, e.g., 1.2 x 10⁻³ S/cm] at 25 °C.  LiFePO₄/LiTi₅O₁₂ half-cells utilizing the spray-deposited separator exhibited superior rate capability and cycling stability compared to cells employing conventional separators, indicating improved lithium-ion transport and minimized electrolyte decomposition. These findings suggest that sequential deposition of Al₂O₃ offers a promising route to developing high-performance LIB separators, contributing to advancements in energy storage technologies. Further investigations focusing on optimizing the ceramic-polymer composite ratio and exploring alternative deposition parameters are warranted to further enhance separator performance and scalability for industrial application.
