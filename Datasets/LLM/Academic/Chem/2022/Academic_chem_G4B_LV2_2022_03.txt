**Abstract**

The advancement of lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) technology hinges critically on the performance and reliability of its separator component. Conventional polypropylene (PP) separators, while prevalent, are susceptible to degradation under high-voltage cycling and exhibit limitations in thermal stability. This research presents a novel approach to separator fabrication utilizing spray-deposition of aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) as a viable alternative. Specifically, a method for sequential deposition of Al₂O₃ was developed and characterized, resulting in a multilayered separator structure. 

Detailed electrochemical testing of Li-ion cells incorporating the Al₂O₃ separator revealed a marked enhancement in cycling stability compared to cells utilizing PP separators. Impedance spectroscopy analysis indicated reduced interfacial resistance and improved lithium-ion transport within the cell, correlating with observed performance improvements. The Al₂O₃ multilayer structure demonstrated superior resistance to electrolyte penetration and exhibited enhanced thermal stability, mitigating the risk of dendrite formation. 

These findings suggest that strategically engineered Al₂O₃ separators, fabricated via scalable spray-deposition techniques, hold significant potential for bolstering the longevity and safety profiles of Li-ion batteries. Further investigations are warranted to optimize the deposition parameters and explore the integration of additional functional layers within the Al₂O₃ architecture.  This work, completed in 2022, contributes to the ongoing pursuit of advanced separator materials for next-generation energy storage systems.
