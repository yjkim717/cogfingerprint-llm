**Abstract**

The development of advanced separators is critical for enhancing the performance and safety of next-generation lithium-ion batteries. This study investigates the efficacy of a novel, spray-deposited separator composed of Al₂O₃ particles in a full-cell configuration with a LiFePO₄ cathode and a Li₄Ti₅O₁₂ anode. The fabrication process enables the creation of a uniform, mechanically robust ceramic layer directly onto the electrodes. Electrochemical characterization reveals that this Al₂O₃-based separator exhibits an ionic conductivity of 4.2 mS cm⁻¹, which is approximately double that of a conventional Celgard® polypropylene separator under identical conditions. Furthermore, cells incorporating the spray-deposited separator demonstrated exceptional cycling stability, retaining over 95% of their initial capacity after 500 cycles at a 1C rate. The enhanced performance is attributed to the superior wettability and electrolyte uptake of the ceramic layer, which facilitates more efficient Li⁺ ion transport and improves interfacial stability. These findings, from a 2022 perspective, underscore the significant potential of spray-deposited ceramic separators as a viable alternative to polyolefin membranes for high-performance and durable lithium-ion batteries.
