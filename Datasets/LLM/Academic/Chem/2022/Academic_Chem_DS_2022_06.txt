The development of accurate and computationally efficient machine learning force fields remains a central challenge in computational chemistry. While equivariant neural networks have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in modeling molecular interactions, their computational demands often limit practical applications to large-scale systems. This work introduces a novel architecture that systematically incorporates higher-body-order interactions through a multi-scale message passing framework. By explicitly encoding angular and dihedral correlations without requiring successive deep layers, our approach achieves significant improvements in data efficiency and transferability. Benchmark calculations across diverse molecular datasets reveal that our model attains state-of-the-art accuracy with substantially reduced computational overhead, enabling reliable simulations of complex chemical systems previously inaccessible to machine learning potentials. The method establishes a new paradigm for balancing expressivity with computational practicality in learned interatomic potentials.
