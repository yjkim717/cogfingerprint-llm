**Abstract**

The ubiquity of hydroxyl radicals (OH•) within interstellar ices presents a critical challenge for understanding the chemical evolution of star-forming regions. This study investigates the diffusion kinetics of OH• radicals on water ice, a prevalent component of interstellar ices, employing a novel experimental approach utilizing photostimulated desorption and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) spectroscopy. Measurements yielded an activation energy of 0.14 ± 0.01 eV for OH• diffusion, markedly exceeding previously established theoretical estimates based on simple molecular dynamics simulations. These findings suggest a potentially more complex and energetically demanding diffusion mechanism than currently modeled.  The observed disparity highlights the need for refined theoretical frameworks incorporating vibrational and rotational effects within icy matrices.  Further investigation into the interplay between ice structure and radical mobility is paramount to accurately representing OH• chemistry in astrophysical environments and informing our understanding of prebiotic pathways in cold, dark space.
