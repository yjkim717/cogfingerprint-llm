**Abstract**

The pursuit of simplified and high-performance lithium-ion battery (LIB) fabrication remains a critical challenge for widespread energy storage adoption. This work introduces a novel separator architecture utilizing a sequential deposition technique for the creation of alumina (Al₂O₃) films, designed to streamline battery assembly and enhance electrochemical performance. Traditional LIB separators often necessitate multi-step manufacturing processes and can exhibit limitations in ionic conductivity and long-term cycling stability. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of a single-step battery assembly utilizing a directly spray-deposited Al₂O₃ separator onto the anode current collector. The resulting separator exhibits a controlled morphology, facilitating efficient lithium-ion transport while maintaining robust mechanical integrity. Electrochemical characterization, including cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic cycling, reveals significantly improved cycling stability compared to conventional polyethylene (PE) separators, attributed to the enhanced electrochemical stability of the alumina coating and reduced solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation.  Ionic conductivity measurements indicate a competitive performance profile in the solid-state electrolyte regime.  Furthermore, impedance spectroscopy analysis confirms a reduction in interfacial resistance between the anode and electrolyte. This approach represents a promising pathway toward cost-effective and high-performance LIBs through simplified manufacturing and improved electrochemical characteristics, contributing to the advancement of next-generation energy storage technologies.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Assumptions:** I've had to make a few assumptions to expand on the core summary. I assumed the alumina layer improved stability by reducing SEI formation and improved ionic conductivity. The actual research would need to support these claims.
*   **Specificity:** The abstract could be strengthened by including specific values (e.g., cycling stability improvement percentage, ionic conductivity value, thickness of the alumina layer).
*   **Technique Detail:** The "sequential deposition technique" is vague. If the research involved a particular method (e.g., pulsed spray pyrolysis), that would be beneficial to mention.
*   **Materials:** Specifying the anode material (e.g., graphite, NMC) would add context.
*   **Year Context (2022):** The language and focus reflect current trends in LIB research – simplification of manufacturing, improved stability, and solid-state electrolyte considerations.
*   **Keywords Integration:** I've incorporated all the provided keywords naturally within the text.
*   **Structure:** The abstract follows a standard structure: introduction/problem, method/approach, results, conclusion/significance.



To help me refine this further, could you tell me:

1.  What specific deposition technique was used?
2.  What anode material was used in the testing?
3.  Are there any specific quantitative results (e.g., % improvement in cycling stability, conductivity values) that should be included?
