**Abstract**

The interaction between light and matter at the quantum level is increasingly recognized as a potent modulator of chemical reactivity. This work presents a quantum dynamics model investigating the influence of infrared cavities on chemical reaction rates, specifically focusing on vibrational strong coupling regimes. Employing a time-dependent Schrödinger equation approach, we demonstrate that the incorporation of an infrared cavity significantly alters the dynamics of reactant molecules, leading to observable rate enhancements.  Central to this observation is the formation and subsequent manipulation of polariton states – hybrid light-matter quasiparticles – within the cavity environment.  These polaritons mediate enhanced vibrational coherence and facilitate non-radiative energy transfer pathways, thereby circumventing conventional reaction barriers.  Our simulations, conducted in 2022, predict substantial rate acceleration for selected reactions, highlighting the potential for leveraging cavity engineering in controlled chemical transformations and offering a novel framework for exploring polariton chemistry’s role in chemical reactivity.
