**Abstract**

The formation of unsaturated hydrocarbons, specifically vinyl and ethyl species, represents a critical, yet incompletely understood, process within the interstellar medium (ISM). This work explores mechanistic pathways for the generation of these molecules via radical addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions, focusing on the dominant precursors acetylene (C₂H₂), ethylene (C₂H₄), and ethane (C₂H₆). Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we modeled a suite of potential reaction networks, prioritizing pathways exhibiting thermodynamic feasibility under ISM conditions – including low temperatures and high radiation fields. Our analysis reveals that selective H abstraction from ethane, followed by subsequent radical addition of acetylene fragments, provides a plausible route to ethyl formation. Furthermore, we identified pathways wherein vinyl radical intermediates are generated via β-elimination processes involving ethane derivatives. These findings contribute to a refined understanding of the chemical complexity within the ISM and offer potential avenues for observational verification through spectroscopic analysis of interstellar gas clouds.
