**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry explores how strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities can control molecular processes. While electronic strong coupling has been extensively investigated, the influence of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on ground-state chemical reactivity remains a subject of intense debate. In this work, we employ exact quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the mechanistic role of VSC within infrared cavities. Our results demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—significantly alters the anharmonic potential energy landscape governing a prototypical S~N~2 reaction. We identify a cavity-induced suppression of the reaction rate by over 40% under resonant conditions, which we attribute to the dynamical caging of the reactive trajectory along the reaction coordinate. This effect arises from the redistribution of vibrational energy into the cavity mode, effectively raising the activation barrier. Our findings provide a quantum dynamical foundation for VSC-modified chemistry, moving beyond a purely spectroscopic picture and establishing that the cavity acts not as a passive spectator but as an active participant in the reaction dynamics. This insight is crucial for the rational design of cavity environments to control chemical selectivity and pathways.
