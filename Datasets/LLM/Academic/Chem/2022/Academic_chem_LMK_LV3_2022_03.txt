Title: Enhanced Electrochemical Stability in Li-ion Batteries via Sequential Deposition of Al2O3 Inorganic Separators

Abstract:
The development of high-performance Li-ion batteries relies heavily on the advancement of separator technology. In this study, we report the fabrication of a novel Al2O3-based inorganic separator via a sequential deposition method, enhancing the electrochemical stability of Li-ion batteries. The as-prepared separator exhibits improved thermal stability and ionic conductivity, thereby enabling the assembly of high-capacity full cells with significantly enhanced capacity retention. Electrochemical characterization reveals that the Al2O3-based separator effectively mitigates degradation mechanisms, such as lithium dendrite formation and electrolyte decomposition, resulting in improved cycling stability. Our findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O3-based inorganic separators to enhance the overall performance and safety of Li-ion batteries, paving the way for their adoption in next-generation energy storage applications.
