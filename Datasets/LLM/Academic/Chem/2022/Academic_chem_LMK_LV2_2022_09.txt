Title: Investigating the Surface Diffusion of OH Radicals on Interstellar Water Ice: An Experimental Determination of Activation Energy

Abstract:

The diffusion of OH radicals on water ice surfaces plays a crucial role in various astrochemical processes. In this study, we employed a combination of photostimulated desorption (PSD) and resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) techniques to measure the activation energy for the surface diffusion of OH radicals on water ice. Our experiments were conducted under ultrahigh vacuum conditions at temperatures relevant to interstellar environments. The results indicate that the activation energy for OH radical diffusion on water ice is significantly lower than previously estimated, suggesting a higher mobility of OH radicals on interstellar ice surfaces. These findings have important implications for understanding the formation of complex molecules in interstellar space. Our measured activation energy provides a crucial input for astrochemical models, enabling more accurate predictions of chemical processes in interstellar environments. (2022)
