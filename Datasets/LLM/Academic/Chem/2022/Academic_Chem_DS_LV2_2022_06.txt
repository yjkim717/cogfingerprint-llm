Of particular relevance to astrochemical models is the understanding of radical-mediated surface reactions on interstellar dust grains, which drive molecular complexity in cold dark clouds. This study investigates the formation pathways of small hydrocarbon species via the reactions of atomic hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals with acetylene (C₂H₂) and ethylene (C₂H₄) under simulated interstellar conditions. We demonstrate that these processes are dominated by rapid, barrierless radical addition mechanisms, rather than abstraction. Specifically, the addition of an H atom to the π-bond of acetylene efficiently yields the vinyl radical (C₂H₃), while analogous addition to ethylene forms the ethyl radical (C₂H₅). Furthermore, the reaction of OH with acetylene proceeds via addition to produce the hydroxvinyl radical, a key precursor to oxygenated complex organic molecules. These addition pathways are identified as the dominant formation routes for vinyl- and ethyl-class molecules on grain surfaces, with profound implications for the chemical inventory of the interstellar medium. Our results, validated against kinetic models, underscore the critical role of addition reactions in building molecular complexity in star-forming regions and provide essential kinetic parameters for inclusion in next-generation astrochemical networks.
