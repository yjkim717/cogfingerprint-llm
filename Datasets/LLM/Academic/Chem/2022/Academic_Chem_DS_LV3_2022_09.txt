In this 2022 study, we experimentally quantified the activation energy for hydroxyl radical (OH) diffusion on interstellar ice analogues using photostimulated desorption coupled with resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization techniques. The measured value of 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV, derived from Arrhenius equation analysis, reveals that surface diffusion becomes significant at approximately 36 K. This temperature threshold critically informs models of reaction initiation in cold interstellar environments, where OH radicals serve as key precursors to complex organic molecule formation. Our findings demonstrate that non-thermal processes dominate radical mobility at lower temperatures, while thermal diffusion mechanisms activate near this determined boundary. These results provide fundamental kinetic parameters for astrochemical networks, constraining the timescales and pathways of molecular synthesis on icy grain surfaces within dark molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.
