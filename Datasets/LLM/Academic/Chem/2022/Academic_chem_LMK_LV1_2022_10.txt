Title: Investigating the Role of Radical-Mediated Reactions in the Formation of Vinyl-Bearing Molecules on Interstellar Dust Grains

Abstract:
The interstellar medium (ISM) is a complex environment where various chemical reactions occur on dust grains, influencing the formation of complex molecules. This study explores the role of radical-mediated reactions in the formation of vinyl-bearing molecules on interstellar dust grains. Using computational models and laboratory experiments, we investigate the reactions of C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 with radicals, focusing on radical addition and H abstraction pathways. Our results show that the reaction of C2H2 with vinyl radicals leads to the efficient formation of C4H4 and C4H3 species, while the reaction of C2H4 with H radicals yields C2H5. We also examine the effect of grain surface properties on reaction rates and product distributions. Our findings provide new insights into the chemistry of the ISM and the formation of complex molecules on interstellar dust grains, shedding light on the astrochemical processes that shape the molecular composition of the universe.
