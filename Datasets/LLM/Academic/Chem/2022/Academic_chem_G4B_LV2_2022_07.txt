**Abstract**

The advancement of lithium-ion battery (Li-ion) technology hinges critically on separator performance, impacting electrochemical stability and overall cycle life. This research investigates the efficacy of a novel, spray-deposited aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃) separator for Li-ion battery applications, presenting a significant step towards enhanced battery durability. Utilizing a sequential deposition technique, we fabricated a porous Al₂O₃ membrane with controlled microstructure, demonstrating improved barrier properties compared to commercially available polyethylene separators. 

Electrochemical testing with a standard lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cathode and graphite anode revealed a marked improvement in cycling stability – specifically, a 25% increase in coulombic efficiency after 500 cycles – attributable to reduced interfacial impedance and minimized lithium dendrite formation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirmed the formation of a dense, interconnected pore network within the deposited Al₂O₃ layer, facilitating electrolyte penetration while maintaining robust mechanical integrity. 

The observed enhancements suggest that strategically engineered, spray-deposited Al₂O₃ separators represent a viable alternative for next-generation Li-ion batteries. Further investigation into electrolyte compatibility and long-term performance is warranted, but these initial results underscore the potential of this methodology for optimizing separator design and advancing battery technology towards increased energy density and longevity.
