**Abstract**

The performance and safety of lithium-ion batteries are critically dependent on the properties of the separator. Conventional polypropylene (PP) separators, while widely used, often exhibit limitations in thermal stability and electrolyte wettability. This study investigates a novel, sequentially deposited multilayer battery architecture featuring a spray-deposited ceramic separator. The key innovation lies in the fabrication of a uniform, mechanically robust separator layer composed of Al₂O₃ particles directly applied onto the electrode surface. We systematically evaluated the electrochemical performance of cells incorporating this spray-deposited Al₂O₃ separator against counterparts using a commercial PP separator. Our results demonstrate that the ceramic-based separator significantly enhances interfacial stability and lithium-ion transference number. Consequently, cells with the spray-deposited separator exhibited superior cycling stability, retaining over 95% of their initial capacity after 500 cycles at 1C, substantially outperforming the conventional system. This work validates spray deposition as a viable and scalable technique for producing high-performance ceramic separators, paving the way for more durable and safe energy storage devices.
