**Abstract**

The emergence of polariton chemistry as a distinct subfield has highlighted the profound impact of strong coupling between molecular vibrational modes and cavity photons on chemical processes. This study, employing real-time quantum dynamics simulations, investigates the modification of chemical reaction rates induced by vibrational strong coupling, extending beyond previously considered semiclassical approximations. Specifically, we examine a model reaction system subjected to a resonant cavity, demonstrating that the formation of vibrational polaritons fundamentally alters the dynamics of bond breaking and formation. Our calculations reveal that the quantum nature of the polariton quasiparticles—manifesting as coherence and non-classical correlations—leads to rate enhancements or suppressions compared to the non-coupled molecular system. Furthermore, we observe a sensitivity of the reaction kinetics to the polariton dispersion characteristics, indicating a degree of control achievable through cavity design. These findings underscore that vibrational strong coupling is not merely a perturbative effect, but rather actively reshapes the underlying quantum dynamics governing chemical reactivity. This work provides a crucial theoretical framework for the rational design of cavity-modified reactions and advances our understanding of the interplay between quantum mechanics, molecular vibrations, and chemical transformations, paving the way for new avenues in light-driven chemistry.
