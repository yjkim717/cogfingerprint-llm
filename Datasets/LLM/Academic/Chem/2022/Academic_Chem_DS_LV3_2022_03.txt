**Abstract**

The development of high-performance, safe solid-state batteries remains a pivotal challenge in electrochemical energy storage. This study presents a scalable fabrication method for integrated Li-ion cells via the sequential spray deposition of cathode, inorganic separator, and anode multilayers. A key innovation is the implementation of a porous, spray-deposited separator layer composed of Al₂O₃ particles. Electrochemical analysis confirms that this architecture facilitates superior interfacial contact and homogeneous current distribution, leading to a notable enhancement in ionic conductivity compared to conventional bilayer configurations. The integrated cell structure effectively mitigates interfacial resistance and suppresses detrimental side reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface. Consequently, the assembled cells demonstrate exceptional long-term cyclability, achieving a capacity retention of 96.3% after 400 cycles at a 1C rate. These results, obtained in 2022, underscore the efficacy of the sequential spray-deposition technique as a promising, industrially viable route for manufacturing next-generation batteries with robust electrochemical performance and extended operational lifetimes. The Al₂O3-based separator is identified as a critical component in stabilizing the cell architecture and enabling high power density applications.
