## Abstract: Radical Addition Pathways to Vinyl and Ethyl Species in the Interstellar Medium

Understanding the chemical complexity of the interstellar medium (ISM) necessitates investigating the formation routes of key organic molecules. This study, conducted within the context of astrochemistry in 2022, explores the potential for radical addition reactions involving simple hydrocarbons – ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂) – as a crucial pathway to vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) species prevalent in interstellar ices and gas phases. We focus on the role of hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals, both abundant within cold, dense ISM environments, in initiating and propagating these reactions. Our analysis considers the feasibility of both direct and sequential radical additions, assessing the impact of kinetic barriers and potential quantum tunneling effects, particularly at the low temperatures characteristic of the ISM.  Preliminary modeling suggests that H-atom addition to acetylene, followed by isomerization, represents a significant route to vinyl. Furthermore, OH radical additions to ethylene and ethane, potentially coupled with subsequent hydrogen abstraction, contribute to ethyl formation. This work emphasizes the need for laboratory experiments simulating ISM conditions to definitively quantify reaction rates and branching ratios and to further constrain astrochemical models aimed at accurately predicting the observed abundances of vinyl and ethyl compounds within astrophysical sources.
