Title: Quantum Dynamics of Vibrational Strong Coupling in Infrared Cavities: Implications for Chemical Reactivity

Abstract:

The modification of chemical reactions via vibrational strong coupling within infrared cavities has garnered significant attention in the realm of vibrational polariton chemistry. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we employ an exact quantum dynamics approach to investigate the cavity-modified quantum dynamics of molecular systems. Our analysis reveals that a rigorous quantum treatment is essential to accurately capture the complex interplay between the cavity photon mode and the molecular vibrational degrees of freedom. By examining the quantum dynamics of vibrational strong coupling, we demonstrate the significant impact of cavity-induced modifications on chemical reactivity. Our results underscore the importance of considering quantum effects in the theoretical description of vibrational polariton chemistry, providing a foundation for understanding the intricate relationships between cavity quantum electrodynamics and molecular reactivity. This study contributes to the advancement of quantum dynamical understanding in vibrational strong coupling.
