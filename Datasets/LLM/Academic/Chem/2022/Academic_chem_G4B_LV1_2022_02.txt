**Abstract**

The interstellar medium (ISM) presents a chemically complex environment wherein the formation of simple organic molecules from elemental precursors is a fundamental research question. This study examines radical addition and H-abstraction pathways involving acetylene (C₂H₂), ethylene (C₂H₄), and ethane (C₂H₆) as potential mechanisms for generating vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) fragments – key building blocks for larger interstellar molecules. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP level with 6-31G* basis sets, we evaluated the energetics and reaction mechanisms of various proposed pathways. Results indicate that H-abstraction from acetylene by ethylene is a statistically significant route to vinyl formation, while ethane’s reactivity towards acetylene is comparatively lower.  Furthermore, the proposed abstraction of a hydrogen atom from ethylene by acetylene generates ethyl radicals, subsequently enabling ethyl molecule formation. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of the chemical processes governing molecular complexity within the ISM and inform astrochemical models.
