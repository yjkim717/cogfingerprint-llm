>Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, aiming for precision, structure, and appropriate terminology, suitable for a chemistry-focused publication and reflecting a 2022 timeframe. I've aimed for around 231 words and included citations where appropriate to illustrate how a real abstract might be structured.

**Abstract**

The pursuit of high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates advancements in all cell components, particularly the separator, which dictates ion transport and interfacial stability. Conventional separators, typically composed of polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP), often suffer from limitations in mechanical strength and thermal stability, impacting long-term cycling performance [1]. This work introduces a novel approach to separator fabrication utilizing a sequential deposition technique for the creation of an aluminum oxide (Al₂O₃)-based separator. This method allows for the direct deposition of a thin, continuous Al₂O₃ layer onto a porous polymer substrate, facilitating single-step full cell assembly and potentially streamlining battery manufacturing processes.

The resulting separator demonstrates enhanced electrolyte conductivity compared to commercially available PE/PP separators, attributed to the improved wetting characteristics imparted by the Al₂O₃ coating. Electrochemical characterization, including cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, confirms this improved ionic transport. Furthermore, full-cell testing with LiFePO₄/LiCoO₂ cathodes and anodes reveals a significant enhancement in rate performance and cycling stability over cells employing standard separators. Specifically, the fabricated separator exhibits a capacity retention of [insert specific percentage, e.g., 85%] after [insert number, e.g., 100] cycles at [insert current rate, e.g., 2C] rate, a notable improvement compared to control cells. This study highlights the potential of sequential deposition techniques for creating advanced separators, contributing to the development of next-generation LIBs with improved energy density and extended lifespan [2].
