**Abstract**

The chemical complexity observed in interstellar clouds necessitates a thorough understanding of the gas-phase reaction pathways leading to the formation of organic molecules. This study, conducted in 2022, examines the potential for generating **vinyl** and **ethyl** species within the **interstellar medium (ISM)** through radical reactions involving simple hydrocarbons. Specifically, we investigated the reactivity of ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂) with various radicals relevant to astrophysical conditions, including hydrogen and methyl radicals. Utilizing computational chemistry techniques, including density functional theory (DFT) and incorporating **quantum tunneling** effects where appropriate, we modeled potential reaction mechanisms and calculated rate coefficients for key elementary steps.

Our analysis reveals plausible pathways for the formation of both vinyl and ethyl radicals from the parent hydrocarbons. The results indicate that hydrogen atom abstraction from ethane and ethylene can efficiently generate ethyl radicals, which can subsequently undergo further reactions. Acetylene, due to its unique bonding structure, exhibits a different reactivity profile, leading to a greater propensity for vinyl radical formation.  The included consideration of quantum tunneling, particularly at low temperatures characteristic of the ISM, demonstrates a potentially significant impact on reaction rates for certain steps involving light atoms. These findings contribute to a more complete picture of the chemical network responsible for the observed abundance of these functionalities in interstellar environments and provide valuable data for astrochemical models aiming to simulate the chemical evolution of star-forming regions. Future work will focus on refining these models and exploring the role of other relevant radicals.
