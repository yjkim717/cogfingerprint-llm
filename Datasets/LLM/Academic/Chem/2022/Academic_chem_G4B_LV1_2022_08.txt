**Polariton-Mediated Enhancement of Chemical Reactivity via Infrared Cavity Engineering**

Accurate prediction of chemical reaction rates remains a significant challenge in contemporary chemical kinetics. This work presents a novel quantum dynamics framework for investigating the influence of infrared (IR) cavities on molecular reactivity, moving beyond traditional perturbation theory approaches. Utilizing a coupled quantum master equation, we model the interaction between molecular vibrational modes and the IR cavity field, specifically exploring the phenomenon of vibrational strong coupling. Our simulations demonstrate that the formation of polariton-like states – coherent hybrid modes of the molecule and cavity – substantially alters the radiative decay pathways of excited vibrational levels.  This induced modification results in a demonstrable enhancement of reaction rates, offering a compelling alternative to existing computational models.  The observed effects are particularly pronounced for systems exhibiting significant near-field coupling, highlighting the potential of engineered IR cavities as a tool for controlling and accelerating chemical processes.  Further research will focus on quantifying the magnitude of this enhancement across a range of molecular systems and reaction environments.
