**Abstract**

Recent advancements in spectroscopic techniques have illuminated the intricate interplay between light and matter, particularly within the context of vibrational strong coupling. This study investigates the influence of infrared cavities on chemical reactivity, employing quantum dynamics to model the modified reaction pathways. Our findings demonstrate that the introduction of an infrared cavity induces measurable rate constant alterations, primarily stemming from quantum mechanical state splittings and resonant phenomena within the coupled system. Specifically, we observed shifts in vibrational energy levels, leading to enhanced or suppressed chemical reaction rates. These results underscore the limitations of classical approximations in describing such systems and advocate for a comprehensive, quantum treatment of vibrational polariton chemistry.  Further investigation is warranted to fully elucidate the potential of infrared cavities as tunable platforms for controlling chemical reactivity and manipulating light-matter interactions. The observed effects have implications for fields ranging from photochemistry to materials science, demanding a deeper theoretical understanding by 2023.
