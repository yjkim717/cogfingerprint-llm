**Abstract: Investigating Radical-Mediated Formation Pathways of Vinyl and Ethyl Species within Interstellar Dust Grains**

The observed abundance of vinyl and ethyl radicals in interstellar environments, particularly within dense molecular clouds and circumstellar disks, presents a significant challenge to astrochemical models. While gas-phase formation routes are known, their efficiency is insufficient to account for observed concentrations, suggesting substantial solid-phase production within interstellar dust grains.  This study, conducted in 2022, explores the viability of radical addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions as dominant pathways for vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) formation on grain surfaces. We employed computational chemistry methods, specifically density functional theory (DFT), to model the reaction of simple hydrocarbon precursors – ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂) – with various reactive radicals, including hydrogen (H), methyl (CH₃), and formyl (HCO) radicals, relevant to grain surface chemistry.

Our simulations focused on characterizing reaction energetics and identifying plausible reaction networks. Preliminary results indicate that hydrogen abstraction from ethane and ethylene, followed by subsequent radical recombination, can efficiently generate vinyl and ethyl fragments. Furthermore, radical addition to acetylene demonstrates a pathway to ethyl formation under relatively mild conditions.  Crucially, we assess the impact of surface temperature and radical binding energies on reaction yields. This work contributes to a refined understanding of grain surface chemistry and provides a framework for developing more accurate astrochemical models capable of predicting the observed abundances of these key organic molecules in interstellar space, paving the way for future laboratory experiments to validate these predicted pathways.
