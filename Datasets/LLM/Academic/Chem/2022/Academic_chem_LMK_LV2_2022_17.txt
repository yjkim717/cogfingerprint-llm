"Quantifying the Surface Mobility of OH Radicals on Interstellar Water Ice: A Photostimulated Desorption Study"

The surface diffusion of OH radicals on water ice is a crucial process in interstellar chemistry, influencing the formation of complex molecules. Using photostimulated desorption techniques, we investigated the temperature-dependent mobility of OH radicals on amorphous water ice surfaces. By analyzing the desorption yields as a function of temperature, we derived the activation energy for OH radical diffusion. Our results indicate an activation energy of 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV, providing a fundamental parameter for astrochemical models. This study contributes to our understanding of the physicochemical processes governing the chemistry of interstellar ices, shedding light on the role of OH radicals in the formation of complex species in these environments.
