Title: Quantum Dynamics of Vibrational Strong Coupling in Infrared Cavities: Implications for Chemical Reactivity

Abstract:

The manipulation of chemical reactivity through vibrational strong coupling (VSC) within infrared cavities has garnered significant attention in recent years. By harnessing the principles of quantum light-matter interactions, VSC enables the formation of vibrational polaritons, hybrid states arising from the coupling of molecular vibrations with the cavity's electromagnetic field. In this study, we employ an exact quantum dynamics approach to investigate the impact of VSC on chemical reactions within infrared cavities. Our methodology involves a rigorous treatment of the coupled light-matter system, allowing for a detailed examination of the quantum dynamics underlying VSC-modified reactivity.

Our results demonstrate that the quantum light-matter interactions inherent to VSC significantly influence chemical reaction dynamics, leading to modifications in reaction rates and pathways. By analyzing the vibrational polariton states and their role in mediating chemical reactivity, we elucidate the fundamental mechanisms governing VSC-induced changes in molecular reactivity. Our findings underscore the importance of considering the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field in understanding VSC phenomena, highlighting the limitations of classical descriptions in capturing the complex dynamics at play.

This work contributes to the burgeoning field of vibrational polariton chemistry, providing new insights into the quantum dynamics driving VSC-modified chemical reactions. The results presented herein have significant implications for the development of novel cavity-controlled chemistry applications, where precise manipulation of chemical reactivity is paramount. By advancing our understanding of the interplay between quantum light-matter interactions and chemical reactivity, this study paves the way for further exploration of the vast potential offered by VSC in shaping the future of chemical synthesis and reactivity.
