**Abstract**

Recent astrophysical modeling of the interstellar medium (ISM) necessitates a refined understanding of low-temperature radical chemistry. This study examines the dominant pathways for the formation of ethyl and vinyl species within the ISM, focusing on the critical role of H and OH radicals. Utilizing kinetic modeling incorporating ethane, ethylene, and acetylene, we demonstrate that abstraction reactions – specifically, H abstraction from these unsaturated hydrocarbons – are rate-limiting steps.  Calculations reveal significant reaction rates, exceeding previously established thresholds, for these radical cascades. Specifically, the observed formation of vinyl and ethyl correlates strongly with the prevalence of ethyl radical intermediates. These findings contribute to a more accurate depiction of complex organic molecule synthesis within the ISM, suggesting that simple hydrocarbon precursors, under interstellar conditions, can efficiently generate key building blocks for prebiotic chemistry. Further research will explore the influence of density and UV radiation on these fundamental reactions.
