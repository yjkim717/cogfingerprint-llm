This computational investigation employs density functional theory and activation strain analysis to elucidate the divergent elimination kinetics between sulfoxides and telluroxides. Our analysis reveals that the significantly slower elimination rates observed for telluroxides stem from two key factors: enhanced Ï€-donation from oxygen to tellurium strengthens the Te-O bond, while increased Pauli repulsion in the transition state elevates the activation barrier. The activation strain model quantitatively demonstrates that the diminished reactivity originates primarily from greater strain energy development along the reaction coordinate. These findings provide fundamental insights into periodic trends within chalcogen chemistry and establish a predictive framework for manipulating elimination kinetics through chalcogen substitution.
