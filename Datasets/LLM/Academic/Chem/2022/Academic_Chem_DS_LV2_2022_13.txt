The surface diffusion dynamics of hydroxyl radicals (OH) on interstellar ice analogs govern key processes in astrochemical reaction networks. This study quantitatively determines the activation energy barrier for OH radical diffusion through temperature-programmed photostimulated desorption experiments conducted under ultrahigh vacuum conditions representative of interstellar environments. Analysis of the diffusion kinetics via the Arrhenius equation yields an activation energy of 0.14 Â± 0.01 eV, significantly lower than previously estimated values. This reduced barrier suggests enhanced OH mobility at cryogenic temperatures, facilitating hydrogenation reactions and complex organic molecule formation in dark molecular clouds. The experimental methodology establishes a robust framework for characterizing radical mobility on cosmic ice surfaces, with implications for predicting molecular abundances in astrochemical models and understanding prebiotic chemistry in star-forming regions.
