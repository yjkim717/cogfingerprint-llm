This study investigates the thermochemical evolution of dissipative dark matter systems undergoing hierarchical fragmentation in galactic halos. We model the collapse of dark molecular clouds under non-equilibrium conditions, deriving the critical fragmentation scale from cooling instabilities in asymmetric dark sector chemistry. Our analysis reveals that these processes can yield stable, sub-solar mass compact objects through rapid radiative cooling pathways inaccessible to baryonic stellar nucleosynthesis. The minimum fragment mass emerges as a fundamental parameter governing dark structure formation, with implications for gravitational lensing surveys and multi-messenger astronomy. These findings establish a novel framework for interpreting anomalous compact objects beyond standard stellar evolution paradigms.
