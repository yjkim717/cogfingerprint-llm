Title: Unraveling the Formation of Vinyl- and Ethyl-bearing Molecules in the Interstellar Medium through Radical-Mediated Reactions

Abstract:
The interstellar medium (ISM) is a complex environment where various chemical reactions occur on dust grains, influencing the formation of complex organic molecules. This study (2022) investigates the role of radical addition and H abstraction reactions in the formation of vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecules, focusing on the involvement of C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6. Through a comprehensive analysis of reaction pathways and energetics, we demonstrate that these reactions are crucial in the synthesis of complex molecules on interstellar dust grains. Our results indicate that the radical-mediated reactions involving C2H2, C2H4, and C2H6 can efficiently produce vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecules, shedding light on the chemical processes governing the ISM. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the molecular complexity in the ISM, with implications for the origins of complex organic molecules in various astrophysical environments.
