**Abstract**

Recent investigations into chemical reactivity have increasingly explored the influence of non-equilibrium light-matter interactions. This study presents a quantum dynamics framework for understanding the modification of molecular behavior within infrared cavities. Specifically, we demonstrate that the incorporation of molecules into these resonant environments induces vibrational strong coupling, leading to measurable alterations in reaction rates. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques, we observed significant shifts in molecular energy levels, generating quantum mechanical state splittings and resonances that dramatically impact chemical pathways. These findings reveal a previously underappreciated mechanism through which tailored infrared cavities can be employed to control and accelerate specific chemical transformations.  Further research will focus on optimizing cavity design to achieve precise control over reaction kinetics and exploring the broader implications for catalytic processes and novel material synthesis within the context of 2022’s advancements in quantum control.
