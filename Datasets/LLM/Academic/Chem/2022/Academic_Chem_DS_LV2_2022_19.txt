**Abstract**

The development of advanced separator membranes is critical for enhancing the performance and manufacturability of lithium-ion batteries. This study introduces a novel spray-deposition technique for fabricating a ceramic-rich separator, utilizing Al₂O₃ particles, in a single, integrated operation. Conventional polyolefin separators often exhibit limitations in thermal stability and electrolyte wettability, which can constrain ionic conductivity and long-term cycling performance. Our methodology employs a sequential deposition process to create a uniform, mechanically robust Al₂O3-based layer directly onto the electrode. Electrochemical evaluation confirms that this spray-deposited separator possesses superior ionic conductivity, facilitating more efficient Li⁺ transport. Furthermore, cells incorporating this separator demonstrate markedly improved capacity retention and cycling stability over extended charge-discharge cycles, attributed to enhanced interfacial stability and effective suppression of lithium dendrite growth. This work, situated in 2022, establishes spray deposition as a viable and scalable strategy for producing high-performance separators, paving the way for streamlined manufacturing of next-generation energy storage devices with improved reliability and longevity.
