**Abstract**

The influence of quantum dynamics on chemical reactivity, particularly within optical and infrared cavities, represents a burgeoning area of investigation. This research leverages a quantum dynamics framework to model chemical reactions significantly impacted by vibrational strong coupling within an engineered cavity environment. Our simulations demonstrate that the introduction of an optical cavity induces observable rate enhancements and attenuations, directly correlated with the generation of quantum state splittings – phenomena typically absent in conventional, non-cavity systems.  Specifically, we observe a pronounced sensitivity to the cavity’s resonant frequencies, leading to altered transition probabilities and consequently, modified reaction kinetics. These findings suggest that cavity modification can serve as a tunable parameter for controlling chemical processes at the quantum level.  Further investigation is warranted to explore the potential applications of this approach in areas such as selective catalysis and photochemical control.  The observed effects provide a compelling demonstration of the interplay between electromagnetic fields and quantum mechanical behavior in chemical transformations.
