**Abstract:** This research, conducted in 2022, investigates an innovative fabrication method for lithium-ion batteries employing a spray-deposited, three-layer full cell architecture (LiFePO₄/Al₂O₃/Li₄Ti₅O₁₂). A key element of this design is the implementation of a porous alumina-based separator, deposited via spray deposition technique. Electrochemical characterization reveals that batteries utilizing this novel separator exhibit rate performance comparable to those employing conventional polypropylene separators. Critically, the alumina separator demonstrably enhances long-term cycling stability, suggesting a promising pathway for improved Li-ion battery longevity and performance through modified separator technology.
