## Abstract: Investigating Radical-Mediated Ethylene and Ethyl Functionalization Pathways within Interstellar Dust Grains

The formation of organic molecules within interstellar dust grains remains a critical puzzle in astrochemistry. While icy grain surfaces are recognized as sites for complex chemical processing, the detailed mechanisms leading to the observed abundance of ethyl and vinyl functionalities are not fully understood. This study, conducted within a 2022 context of intensified focus on gas-grain interaction models, explores the viability of radical addition and hydrogen abstraction reactions involving simple hydrocarbon precursors – ethane (C₂H₆), ethylene (C₂H₄), and acetylene (C₂H₂) – and reactive hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals (H• and OH•). Quantum chemical calculations, employing density functional theory (DFT) and incorporating dispersion corrections, were performed to assess the energetics and reaction pathways of these processes.  Results indicate that both radical addition to acetylene and hydrogen abstraction from ethane and ethylene can efficiently generate vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) radicals, respectively, under astrophysically relevant conditions (10-20 K).  Furthermore, the subsequent radical recombination pathways were examined, revealing plausible routes to stable ethylenic species. These findings suggest that radical chemistry, often overlooked in favor of surface reactions, may represent a significant, and potentially dominant, pathway for the formation of vinyl and ethyl groups within the interstellar medium, contributing to the observed complexity of interstellar organic matter and warranting further investigation within broader grain chemistry models.
