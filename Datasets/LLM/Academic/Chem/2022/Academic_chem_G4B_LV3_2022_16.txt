**Abstract**

Recent advancements in spectroscopic techniques have highlighted the intricate interplay between light-matter interaction and chemical reactivity, particularly within constrained environments. This research investigates the influence of infrared cavities on vibrational dynamics and subsequent chemical reaction rates, employing a quantum dynamics framework. Our simulations demonstrate that the introduction of an infrared cavity induces significant quantum mechanical state splittings, leading to observable resonances that dramatically alter reaction pathways. These effects, previously underestimated in classical modeling, necessitate a fully quantum treatment to accurately predict reaction kinetics. Specifically, we observed amplified vibrational coupling and altered energy landscapes within the cavity, significantly impacting transition state geometries and activation energies.  The findings underscore the critical role of nanoscale light-matter interaction in modulating chemical processes, with implications for areas ranging from photocatalysis to molecular sensing. Further investigation into cavity design and material selection is warranted to fully exploit these quantum effects.
