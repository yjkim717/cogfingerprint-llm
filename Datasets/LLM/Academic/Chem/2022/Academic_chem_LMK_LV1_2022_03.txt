Title: Enhanced Electrochemical Stability of Li-ion Batteries via Sequential Deposition of Al2O3-Based Inorganic Separators

Abstract:
The development of high-performance Li-ion batteries relies heavily on the advancement of separator technology. In this study, we present a novel Al2O3-based inorganic separator fabricated via a sequential deposition method, enabling the single-operation assembly of Li-ion battery full cells. The as-prepared separator exhibits a uniform distribution of Al2O3 particles, resulting in enhanced electrochemical stability and improved ionic conductivity. The Li-ion battery full cells assembled with the Al2O3-based separator demonstrate superior cycling stability, retaining 85% capacity after 500 cycles at 1C rate. Moreover, the separator's inorganic nature ensures thermal stability and mitigates the risk of thermal runaway. Our findings suggest that the Al2O3-based inorganic separator is a promising candidate for high-performance Li-ion batteries, offering a viable solution for next-generation energy storage applications. The proposed sequential deposition method provides a scalable and cost-effective approach for the fabrication of advanced separators.
