**Abstract**

The chemical complexity of interstellar space necessitates a detailed understanding of low-temperature photochemistry. This research explores the mechanistic pathways governing the formation of vinylidene (vinyl) and ethane derivatives from simple hydrocarbon precursors – acetylene, ethylene, and ethane – under conditions relevant to the interstellar medium. Utilizing a modified H abstraction mechanism, we posit that radical addition reactions, specifically involving selective hydrogen abstraction, play a crucial role in initiating chain propagation. Computational modeling, incorporating rotational and vibrational energy transfer, supports the feasibility of these pathways at interstellar temperatures.  Observed abundances of vinyl and ethyl species are significantly influenced by the relative rates of competing radical reactions and termination steps.  These findings contribute to a refined theoretical framework for predicting the distribution of organic molecules within interstellar clouds, highlighting the importance of concerted radical processes in the synthesis of complex interstellar building blocks. Further investigation into the influence of ionization states is warranted.
