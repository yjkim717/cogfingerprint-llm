In the complex chemical environment of the interstellar medium (ISM), the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) on cold dust grains remains a critical astrochemical process. This investigation elucidates the pivotal role of radical addition and hydrogen (H) abstraction reactions involving small hydrocarbons—specifically acetylene (C₂H₂), ethylene (C₂H₄), and ethane (C₂H₆)—with atomic H and hydroxyl (OH) radicals. Employing quantum chemical calculations, we demonstrate that these non-energetic surface reactions provide highly efficient, barrier-less pathways for the synthesis of vinyl- and ethyl-bearing molecular species, which are key precursors to more complex interstellar compounds. Critically, our kinetic models for 2022 reveal that quantum tunneling at cryogenic temperatures (10-20 K) substantially enhances the reaction rates, overcoming classical kinetic prohibitions. These findings resolve longstanding uncertainties in astrochemical networks by confirming a robust, grain-surface formation mechanism for observed COMs, thereby advancing our predictive capacity for molecular abundances in star-forming regions and contributing to our understanding of molecular complexity in space.
