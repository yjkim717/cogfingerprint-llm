**Abstract**

The interstellar medium (ISM) represents a chemically complex environment wherein the formation of simple organic molecules is paramount to understanding the origins of life. This research explores potential reaction pathways leading to vinyl and ethyl species within the ISM, leveraging established radical chemistry. Specifically, the study demonstrates the pivotal role of ubiquitous hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals in initiating key transformations. Utilizing kinetic modeling, we posit that these radicals drive significant abstraction reactions from readily available precursors, such as ethylene and acetylene.  Observed abundances of vinyl and ethyl compounds suggest that radical-mediated hydrogen abstraction constitutes a dominant mechanism. Further investigation into the influence of interstellar density and UV radiation on these radical reactions is warranted, offering critical insights into the prebiotic chemical landscape of space and informing future observational constraints on ISM composition in 2022.
