This computational investigation employs density functional theory and activation strain analysis to elucidate the contrasting reactivity patterns in chalcogenoxide elimination reactions. Our analysis reveals that telluroxides exhibit significantly higher activation barriers compared to their selenium analogues due to enhanced Pauli repulsion in the transition state. The increased steric demand around the heavier tellurium center disrupts optimal orbital alignment during the syn-elimination process. Furthermore, distortion energy analysis indicates greater structural reorganization requirements for telluroxides. These findings provide fundamental insights into periodic trends within organochalcogen chemistry and establish a quantitative framework for predicting reactivity in heavy chalcogen compounds, with implications for synthetic methodology development.
