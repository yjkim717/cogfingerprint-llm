**Abstract**

The interstellar medium (ISM) represents a fundamental site for the chemical genesis of complex organic molecules. This research explores the mechanistic pathways by which vinyl and ethyl species – key building blocks for larger interstellar compounds – are formed within this environment. Utilizing a detailed examination of radical reactions, specifically focusing on the roles of hydrogen (H) and hydroxyl (OH) radicals, we posit that acetylene and ethylene, prevalent ISM constituents, undergo significant transformation.  Our analysis demonstrates that H and OH radical abstraction initiates a cascade of reactions, ultimately leading to the formation of ethyl and vinyl intermediates.  These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of interstellar chemistry, suggesting that simple, abundant molecules can, through controlled radical processes, yield precursors essential for the formation of complex organics. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the influence of density and temperature variations on these critical pathways.
