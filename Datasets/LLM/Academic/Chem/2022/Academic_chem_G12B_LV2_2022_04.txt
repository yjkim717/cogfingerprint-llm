**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has demonstrated the profound influence of strong light-matter coupling on chemical processes. This work presents a quantum dynamics investigation into the modification of molecular reactivity induced by vibrational strong coupling within infrared optical cavities. Utilizing a time-dependent wavefunction approach, we explore the dynamics of a model molecular system subjected to resonant cavity fields, explicitly accounting for the formation of polaritonic quasiparticles. Our simulations reveal a substantial alteration in reaction probabilities compared to the non-coupled molecular system, arising from the redistribution of vibrational energy and the emergence of novel reaction pathways facilitated by the polariton states. Specifically, we observe a modification of the potential energy surface landscape, leading to a shift in the transition state dynamics and a concomitant change in the activation energy barrier. These findings provide direct insight into the mechanisms underlying cavity-modified chemical reactivity and support the theoretical framework connecting quantum dynamics and polariton chemistry. The results highlight the potential for cavity-based control over chemical reactions by harnessing the unique properties of polaritonic systems, opening avenues for the design of novel catalytic processes and light-driven chemical transformations. Further research is warranted to explore the scalability and generality of these effects across a broader range of molecular systems and cavity geometries.
