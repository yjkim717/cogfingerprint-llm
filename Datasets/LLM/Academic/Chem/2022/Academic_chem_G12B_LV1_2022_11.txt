**A Scalable Spray-Deposited Alumina Separator for Enhanced Electrochemical Stability in Lithium-Ion Batteries**

The ongoing demand for high-performance lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) necessitates advancements in all cell components, particularly the separator, which dictates ionic transport and interfacial safety. Conventional separators, typically composed of microporous polyethylene or polypropylene, often exhibit limitations in mechanical strength and electrochemical stability at elevated operating voltages. To address these challenges, we report the development of a novel alumina (Al₂O₃)-based separator fabricated via a scalable sequential deposition process. This method allows for precise control over the alumina layer's thickness and porosity, enabling tailored ionic conductivity and improved interfacial compatibility. Electrochemical characterization, including cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy, reveals significantly enhanced electrochemical stability of the alumina separator compared to commercially available polyethylene separators, evidenced by a wider electrochemical window and reduced electrolyte decomposition. Full-cell testing utilizing a LiFePO₄/LiCoO₂ chemistry demonstrates superior cycling stability, retaining over 90% of its initial capacity after 500 cycles at 1C rate, a marked improvement over cells employing conventional separators. This spray-deposited alumina separator represents a promising route towards safer and more durable LIBs, offering a pathway for simplified cell assembly and potentially facilitating the adoption of high-voltage cathode materials. Future work will focus on optimizing the alumina morphology and integrating ceramic additives to further enhance ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness for next-generation battery technologies.
