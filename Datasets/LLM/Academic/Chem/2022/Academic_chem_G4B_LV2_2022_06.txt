**Abstract**

The interstellar medium (ISM) represents a chemically complex environment wherein the formation of simple organic molecules, precursors to more intricate structures, is hypothesized to occur through radical processes. This research explores the mechanistic pathways governing radical addition and abstraction reactions involving primary hydrocarbons within the ISM, specifically focusing on the generation of vinyl and ethyl moieties. Utilizing computational modeling and kinetic analysis, we examined the influence of dust grain surfaces on reaction rates and product distributions. 

Our findings indicate that surface-mediated radical abstraction significantly enhances the formation of ethyl radicals, while simultaneous addition reactions contribute to vinyl formation. The relative abundance of vinyl and ethyl species is strongly dependent on the collisional cross-section of the dust grains and the initial hydrocarbon composition. These results provide a refined understanding of the chemical network operating within the ISM, highlighting the critical role of heterogeneous catalysis in driving the observed molecular evolution. Further investigation into the specific radical pathways and the impact of UV irradiation is warranted to fully elucidate the origin of complex organic molecules in space.
