Title: Quantum Dynamics of Cavity-Modified Chemical Reactions: Unveiling the Role of Vibrational Strong Coupling

Abstract:
The manipulation of chemical reactivity via vibrational strong coupling within infrared cavities has garnered significant attention in the realm of vibrational polariton chemistry. Employing an exact quantum dynamics approach, this study provides a comprehensive investigation into cavity-modified chemical reactions. By treating the coupled cavity-molecule system using a fully quantum mechanical framework, we elucidate the intricate dynamics underlying the observed modifications in chemical reactivity. Our results underscore the importance of a rigorous quantum treatment in capturing the subtleties of vibrational strong coupling, thereby providing a nuanced understanding of the interplay between cavity modes and molecular vibrations. The insights garnered from this study contribute to the advancement of vibrational polariton chemistry, shedding light on the potential of infrared cavities to modulate chemical reactions. Our findings have significant implications for the field, highlighting the need for a precise quantum mechanical description.
