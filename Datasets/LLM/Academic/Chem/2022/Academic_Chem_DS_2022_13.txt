This study reports the development of copper(II)-based nanostructured assemblies capable of dual catalytic function under mild aqueous conditions. These materials exhibit pronounced ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) characteristics, enabling efficient activation under visible light irradiation. The photocatalytic properties were leveraged to drive a domino reaction sequence involving azide transfer followed by intramolecular [3+2] cycloaddition, achieving quantitative conversion of propargylic substrates to triazole derivatives. Notably, catalytic efficacy was maintained at remarkably low copper loadings (≤50 ppm), demonstrating exceptional atomic economy. Mechanistic investigations revealed that the nanostructured architecture facilitates both electron transfer processes and substrate coordination, while maintaining structural integrity across multiple catalytic cycles. The operational simplicity of this system—employing water as solvent, ambient temperature, and visible light—represents a significant advancement in sustainable methodology development. This work establishes a platform for photochemical cascade reactions using earth-abundant metal catalysts under environmentally benign conditions.
