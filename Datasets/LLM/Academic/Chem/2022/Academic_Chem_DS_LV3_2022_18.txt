In the complex chemical network of the interstellar medium (ISM), the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) on cold dust grain surfaces remains a critical area of astrochemical research. This study investigates the pivotal gas-grain reaction pathways involving acetylene (C₂H₂), ethylene (C₂H₄), and ethane (C₂H₆) with ubiquitous H and OH radicals. We demonstrate that radical addition reactions to the unsaturated bonds of C₂H₂ and C₂H₄ serve as efficient, barrier-less routes for synthesizing vinyl (C₂H₃) and ethyl (C₂H₅) radical precursors. Concurrently, hydrogen abstraction (H abstraction) from saturated C₂H₆ by these radicals regenerates reactive species, thereby propagating reaction cycles even at cryogenic temperatures. Our 2022 kinetic modelling, incorporating the latest binding energies and tunnelling corrections, quantifies the relative dominance of these non-diffusive mechanisms over traditional grain-surface mobility. The results indicate that OH-driven H abstraction from C₂H₆ is particularly significant in oxygen-rich environments, directly influencing the abundance ratios of ethyl-to-vinyl derivatives detected in protoplanetary disks. These findings resolve key uncertainties in astrochemical models by establishing a robust framework for the genesis of prebiotic hydrocarbon chains, fundamentally linking simple interstellar ices to the emergent molecular complexity observed with next-generation observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope.
