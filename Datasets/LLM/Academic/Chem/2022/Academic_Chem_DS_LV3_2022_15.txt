**Abstract**

The persistent challenge of interfacial instability and sluggish ion transport in conventional lithium-ion batteries necessitates the development of advanced separator technologies. This study investigates a novel sequential spray-deposition technique for fabricating an integrated multilayer architecture, comprising a LiFePO4 cathode, a functional Al2O3 nanoparticle-coated separator, and a Li4Ti5O12 anode. The primary objective was to engineer a cohesive cell structure that mitigates interfacial resistance and enhances electrochemical performance. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy confirmed a marked improvement in ionic conductivity, attributed to the uniform Al2O3 coating which facilitates a more continuous Li+ ion conduction pathway compared to commercial polypropylene separators. Furthermore, galvanostatic cycling tests demonstrated exceptional long-term cycling stability. The assembled cells retained 96.3% of their initial discharge capacity after 400 cycles at 1C rate, significantly outperforming conventional counterparts which exhibited rapid capacity fade. These findings, from our 2022 research, underscore the efficacy of the sequential spray-deposition strategy in creating robust, high-performance solid-state battery interfaces. The integrated Al2O3 separator emerges as a promising avenue for next-generation energy storage systems, offering a direct path to enhanced safety and longevity.
