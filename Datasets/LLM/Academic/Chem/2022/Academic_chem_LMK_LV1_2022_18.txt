Title: Investigating Vinyl and Ethyl Molecule Formation via Radical Addition and H Abstraction on Interstellar Dust Grains

Abstract:
The interstellar medium (ISM) is a complex environment where various chemical reactions occur on dust grains, influencing the formation of complex organic molecules. This study (2022) focuses on the synthesis of vinyl-bearing molecules and their hydrogenated counterparts, ethyl species, through radical addition and H abstraction reactions on interstellar dust grain analogues. Using a combination of experimental and computational methods, we examine the reaction pathways involving vinyl radicals and hydrogen atoms on surfaces mimicking interstellar dust grains. Our results indicate that radical addition reactions are efficient in forming vinyl-bearing molecules, while H abstraction reactions facilitate the subsequent hydrogenation to form ethyl species. The findings provide insights into the chemical processes governing the formation of these molecules in the ISM, shedding light on the role of interstellar dust grains in shaping the chemical complexity of the universe.
