We present a comprehensive chemical analysis of the post-AGB object IRAS 17436+5003, a pre-planetary nebula exhibiting pronounced dual-chemistry characteristics. Through high-resolution molecular line observations, we have identified distinct kinematic components in the circumstellar envelope: a slowly expanding O-rich shell dominated by SiO and Hâ‚‚O emission, and a high-velocity bipolar outflow harboring carbon-bearing species including HCN and CS. The spatial segregation of these chemically distinct outflows suggests recent changes in the system's mass-loss history, potentially triggered by binary interactions. Our chemical modeling indicates non-equilibrium processes are active, with shock-induced sputtering of icy grain mantles releasing both oxygen- and carbon-based molecules into the gas phase. These findings provide critical insight into the rapid chemical evolution occurring during the brief transition from AGB star to planetary nebula, where molecular complexity emerges through competing nucleosynthetic pathways and dynamical processes.
