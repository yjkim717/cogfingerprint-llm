**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium represents a critical stage in prebiotic chemical evolution. A long-standing question in astrochemistry concerns the mechanistic pathways enabling the synthesis of these species under the extreme conditions of molecular clouds. While radical-radical reactions and non-diffusive processes have been proposed, the role of atomic carbon as a mobile precursor has remained inadequately constrained. This study presents experimental evidence, obtained through ultra-high vacuum surface science techniques coupled with temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry, which elucidates the surface diffusion kinetics of carbon atoms on water-dominated interstellar ice analogues. Our results demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on amorphous solid water surfaces at temperatures exceeding 22 K, a threshold significantly lower than previously theorized. This mobility facilitates direct interaction with co-adsorbed species, such as CO, O, and H atoms, initiating a cascade of hydrogenation and carbon-addition reactions. Crucially, we identify that this diffusive behavior is the primary driver for efficient Câ€“C bond formation, the foundational step in building molecular complexity beyond simple carbon chains. The observed pathways lead directly to the synthesis of interstellar COMs like aldehydes and alcohols. These findings, reported in 2023, necessitate a revision of current astrochemical models, establishing surface diffusion of carbon atoms as a dominant non-energetic mechanism for molecular growth in cold interstellar regions and providing a plausible route for the genesis of prebiotic feedstock molecules in star-forming regions.
