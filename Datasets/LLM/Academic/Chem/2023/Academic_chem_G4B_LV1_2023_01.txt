**Abstract: Surface Diffusion and the Genesis of Complex Organic Molecules in Interstellar Ice**

The prevailing paradigms of interstellar chemistry necessitate a robust mechanism for the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the cold, ices-dominated environments of molecular clouds. This study investigates the role of carbon atom diffusion on icy grain surfaces as a critical precursor to COMs synthesis. Utilizing computational modeling and kinetic simulations, we demonstrate that localized, thermally-activated surface diffusion of carbon atoms – facilitated by the heterogeneous surface chemistry of ice grains – significantly enhances the probability of subsequent chemical reactions. 

Specifically, our findings reveal a demonstrable increase in the formation rates of simple aldehydes and ketones when carbon diffusion is incorporated into reaction pathways. These intermediate species subsequently serve as building blocks for larger, more intricate molecules.  The observed diffusion rates are sensitive to ice grain morphology and temperature, suggesting a spatially-dependent chemical landscape.  This research provides a mechanistic framework supporting the hypothesis that surface diffusion on interstellar ice grains represents a fundamental driver in the early stages of cosmic molecular complexity, with significant implications for understanding the origins of prebiotic chemistry and the distribution of organic compounds throughout the galaxy – 2023.
