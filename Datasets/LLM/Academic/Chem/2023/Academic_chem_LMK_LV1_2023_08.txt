Title: Advances in Polariton Chemistry: Bridging Quantum Electrodynamics and Molecular Photochemistry

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has witnessed significant theoretical advancements in recent years, driven by the confluence of quantum electrodynamics (QED) and molecular cavity quantum mechanics. As a result, novel methodologies have emerged to elucidate the complex interplay between light and matter within molecular cavities. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical frameworks that underpin polariton chemistry, with a particular emphasis on the applications and challenges that arise from the manipulation of light-matter interactions.

By integrating principles from cavity QED and molecular quantum mechanics, researchers have developed a deeper understanding of the polaritonic states that emerge within molecular cavities. These hybrid light-matter states have been shown to significantly influence photochemical reactions, enabling the manipulation of reaction pathways and rates. Theoretical models, such as the quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT) and the cavity Born-Oppenheimer approximation (CBOA), have been instrumental in elucidating the underlying mechanisms governing polariton chemistry.

The application of these theoretical frameworks has far-reaching implications for the field of photochemistry, enabling the design of novel molecular systems that can harness the properties of polaritons to control chemical reactivity. However, significant challenges remain, including the need for more accurate and efficient computational methods to describe the complex dynamics of polaritonic systems. This review highlights the current state of the art in polariton chemistry, discussing both the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead for researchers seeking to harness the potential of this rapidly evolving field.
