This study introduces a novel organogel-based platform for palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions under ambient conditions. The three-dimensional gel network effectively stabilizes sensitive organolithium nucleophiles while facilitating efficient catalytic cycles with aryl bromides. Remarkably, this methodology proceeds at room temperature without requiring inert atmosphere protection, addressing longstanding challenges in handling highly reactive organometallic species. The developed protocol demonstrates broad functional group tolerance across diverse (hetero)aryl substrates, achieving coupling yields comparable to conventional Schlenk techniques. This gel-phase approach represents a significant advancement toward practical and sustainable cross-coupling methodologies, combining operational simplicity with enhanced safety profiles for modern synthetic applications.
