**Abstract: Surface Diffusion-Mediated Complexity in Interstellar Ice Matrices â€“ A Mechanistic Perspective**

The prevalence of complex organic molecules (COMs) within interstellar space remains a fundamental challenge for theories of prebiotic chemistry. This study investigates the role of surface diffusion of carbon atoms on ice grains as a critical pathway for COM genesis. Utilizing computational modeling and kinetic simulations, we demonstrate that localized surface diffusion, facilitated by the heterogeneous nature of interstellar ices, dramatically enhances the probability of sequential carbon-carbon bond formation. Specifically, our simulations reveal that the restricted mobility of carbon atoms within ice matrices promotes the accumulation of reactive intermediates, fostering the stepwise assembly of increasingly complex molecular structures. 

Furthermore, we explore the influence of ice grain morphology and temperature on diffusion rates and reaction pathways. The observed enhancement of COM formation via surface diffusion provides a plausible mechanism for the observed chemical complexity, suggesting that interstellar ices represent dynamic reaction environments significantly more conducive to organic synthesis than previously appreciated.  Future research will focus on validating these findings with observational data and exploring the impact of specific ice composition on interstellar chemistry.
