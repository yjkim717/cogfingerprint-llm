**Abstract**

The formation pathways of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments represent a fundamental problem in astrochemistry, with direct implications for prebiotic chemistry. While gas-phase reactions have been extensively studied, the role of carbon atom (C) mobility on the surfaces of interstellar ice mantles remains a critical, yet poorly constrained, parameter in chemical models. This investigation presents experimental evidence demonstrating that surface diffusion of atomic carbon becomes a significant and efficient mechanism for chemical evolution at temperatures exceeding 22 K. Utilizing ultra-high-vacuum cryogenic apparatus to simulate the conditions of dense molecular clouds, we monitored the reactivity of carbon atoms upon amorphous solid water (ASW) ice. Our results indicate a marked increase in reaction efficiency correlated with this diffusion threshold, leading directly to the formation of new carbon-carbon (Câ€“C) bonds. This thermally activated diffusion process provides a robust, non-energetic pathway for synthesizing molecular precursors to COMs, bypassing the kinetic barriers associated with many radiative association reactions in the gas phase. Consequently, our findings necessitate a revision of current astrochemical networks to incorporate this granular surface-mediated mechanism. The identification of a 22 K activation temperature for carbon diffusion refines our understanding of chemical complexity in star-forming regions, suggesting that a rich hydrocarbon chemistry can be initiated earlier and in colder environments than previously theorized. This work, conducted in 2023, establishes a foundational kinetic parameter for modeling the emergence of molecular complexity in the interstellar medium.
