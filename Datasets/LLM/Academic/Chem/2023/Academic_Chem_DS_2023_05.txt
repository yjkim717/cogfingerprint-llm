The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has underscored the urgent need for novel antiviral agents targeting essential viral enzymes. This study investigates the inhibitory potential of diphenyl diselenide, an organoselenium compound, against two critical cysteine proteases: the main protease (Mpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). Utilizing extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we characterized the binding dynamics and stability of diphenyl diselenide within the catalytic sites of both proteases. Our computational analyses reveal a dual mechanism of action: the compound engages in stable non-covalent interactions, primarily through hydrophobic contacts and Ï€-stacking, while its diselenide bridge is poised for nucleophilic attack by the catalytic cysteine residues, suggesting a covalent inhibition pathway. Binding free energy calculations confirm high-affinity interactions for both enzymatic targets. These findings, obtained in 2023, position diphenyl diselenide as a versatile lead compound capable of simultaneously disrupting viral polyprotein processing and suppressing host innate immune response evasion, thereby presenting a promising scaffold for the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral therapeutics.
