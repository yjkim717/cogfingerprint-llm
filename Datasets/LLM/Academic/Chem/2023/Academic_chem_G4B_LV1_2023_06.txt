**Abstract: Surface Diffusion and the Genesis of Complex Organic Molecules in Interstellar Ice Grains â€“ A Mechanistic Perspective**

The prevailing paradigm for the origin of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar space posits a gradual accretion process, yet the precise mechanisms governing molecular formation remain incompletely understood. This research investigates the role of carbon atom diffusion on icy grain surfaces as a critical intermediary step. Utilizing a kinetic model informed by recent spectroscopic observations, we demonstrate that thermally activated surface diffusion of carbon atoms within interstellar ices significantly enhances the probability of subsequent chemical reactions. 

Specifically, we model the preferential mobility of carbon atoms within amorphous ice matrices, considering factors such as grain size, temperature, and ice composition. Results indicate that increased diffusion rates directly correlate with elevated concentrations of reactive intermediates, facilitating the formation of larger, more complex molecules. These findings support the hypothesis that icy grains serve as dynamic chemical reactors, with surface diffusion acting as a fundamental driver in interstellar chemical evolution. Further investigation into the influence of specific ice grain structures and radiation fields is warranted to refine this mechanistic understanding, particularly concerning the prevalence of specific COM precursors.
