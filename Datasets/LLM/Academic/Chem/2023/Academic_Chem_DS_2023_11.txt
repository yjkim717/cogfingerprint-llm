This study investigates the sensitivity of primordial molecular cooling pathways to high-temperature reaction kinetics during adiabatic collapse in early cosmic structures. We present a revised chemical network incorporating corrected rate coefficients for critical endothermic processes, substantially narrowing the parameter space where molecular cooling dominates. Our analysis reveals that while cooling efficiencies are systematically reduced in metal-poor environments, the overall transition to efficient cooling remains robust across cosmologically relevant density regimes. These findings reaffirm molecular cooling's role in facilitating early structure formation despite refined microphysical treatment.
