**Abstract**

The abiotic synthesis of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) is a topic of profound astrochemical significance, bearing directly upon the molecular origins of life. While thermal and non-thermal processes on icy grain mantles are known to foster simple species, the mechanisms enabling the formation of robust carbon-carbon (C–C) bonds—the skeletal framework of organic chemistry—remain inadequately constrained. This investigation employs ultra-high vacuum cryogenic experiments coupled with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to elucidate the role of mobile carbon atoms in COM genesis. We demonstrate that on a water-dominated amorphous solid water (ASW) ice analogue, carbon atoms exhibit significant surface mobility at temperatures exceeding 22 K, a regime pertinent to warm prestellar cores and protostellar envelopes. This thermally activated diffusion facilitates barrier-mediated reactions with adsorbed precursors such as CO, CH₃OH, and H₂CO. Crucially, our results provide direct experimental evidence for the formation of C–C bonds via sequential carbon-atom addition, leading to unsaturated hydrocarbon chains and oxygen-bearing COMs like ketene (H₂CCO) and propenal (C₂H₃CHO). These findings establish the diffusion of atomic carbon as a fundamental and efficient pathway for molecular complexity in the ISM, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of chemical evolution prior to the incorporation of matter into nascent planetary systems.
