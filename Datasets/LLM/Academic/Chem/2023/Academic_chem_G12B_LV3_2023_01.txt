**Abstract**

Recent observations of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments highlight the need for refined models of molecular formation pathways under cryogenic conditions. This study presents experimental evidence demonstrating unexpectedly efficient surface diffusion of individual carbon atoms on amorphous interstellar ice analogs at temperatures as low as 22 K. Utilizing low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed significant atomic mobility, indicating a previously overlooked contribution to carbon-carbon bond formation in dense interstellar media. Our findings suggest that surface diffusion, facilitated by the ice matrix, lowers the effective activation energy required for radical recombination, potentially enabling the synthesis of larger organic molecules within translucent clouds and protoplanetary disks. The implications extend to understanding the chemical complexity observed in star-forming regions, suggesting that even at extremely low temperatures, dynamic surface processes play a crucial role in interstellar chemistry. Further research is warranted to quantify the impact of ice composition and morphology on this diffusion process.
