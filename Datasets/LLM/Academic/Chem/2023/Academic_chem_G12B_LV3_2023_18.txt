**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments remains a central challenge in astrochemistry. While gas-phase reactions are well-studied, the role of surface chemistry on icy grain mantles is increasingly recognized as a crucial pathway for molecular synthesis. This study presents experimental evidence demonstrating unexpectedly efficient surface diffusion of isolated carbon atoms on amorphous ice surfaces at cryogenic temperatures as low as 22 K. Utilizing low-energy atom deposition and temperature-programmed desorption techniques, we observed rapid carbon atom mobility, facilitating atomic-scale mixing and potentially promoting carbon-carbon bond formation. These findings challenge prevailing models of interstellar chemistry, suggesting that surface diffusion may be a more significant mechanism for the generation of larger organic species than previously appreciated, particularly within translucent clouds and the colder regions of protoplanetary disks. The implications of this enhanced mobility extend to understanding the prebiotic chemical evolution and the delivery of organic building blocks to nascent planetary systems.
