**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, operating at the intersection of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and synthetic chemistry, promises unprecedented control over chemical reactivity and material properties. By confining molecular ensembles within optical cavities, hybrid light-matter quasiparticles—polaritons—are formed, fundamentally altering the potential energy landscapes governing molecular processes. This paradigm, however, is fraught with theoretical complexities, particularly concerning the choice of quantum mechanical gauge. The apparent gauge ambiguity in the description of strongly coupled systems presents a significant challenge, as predictions for physical observables, such as reaction rates under vibrational strong coupling (VSC), must be rigorously gauge-invariant. This review synthesizes recent theoretical advances that reconcile these formalisms, demonstrating the mathematical equivalence between the Coulomb, dipole, and multipolar gauges when cavity loss and the dipole self-energy term are properly accounted for. We critically evaluate state-of-the-art computational methodologies, including cavity-born modifications to density functional theory and exact diagonalization approaches, which are essential for simulating the collective, many-molecule nature of these phenomena. The discussion extends to practical applications, highlighting how VSC can selectively suppress or enhance reaction pathways by resonantly targeting specific molecular vibrations, thereby offering a novel tool for driving photochemical transformations and controlling condensed-phase dynamics without external reagents. By establishing a coherent theoretical foundation, this work aims to bridge the gap between abstract quantum optical principles and tangible chemical outcomes, paving the way for the rational design of polaritonic materials and catalytic processes.
