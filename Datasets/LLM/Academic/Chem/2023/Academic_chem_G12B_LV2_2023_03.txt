## Abstract: Directed Synthesis of Low-Symmetry Palladium(II) Cages via Ancillary Ligand Pairing

The burgeoning field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry continues to drive the development of complex, discrete metallacages with tailored functionalities. This work presents a novel synthetic strategy for the construction of heteroleptic palladium(II) cages, leveraging the strategic incorporation of ancillary ligand pairings to achieve unprecedented control over structural outcome. Traditional approaches to palladium(II) cage synthesis often result in symmetry-averaged products, hindering the exploration of unique properties arising from low-symmetry architectures. Herein, we demonstrate a methodology wherein the judicious selection of two distinct ancillary ligands, coordinating to the palladium(II) center, dictates the resulting cage geometry with demonstrable positional and orientational control. This approach circumvented the limitations of prior synthetic routes that relied on more symmetrical ligand systems. 

Specifically, we explore the impact of varying electronic and steric properties within these ancillary ligand combinations, revealing a predictable relationship between ligand characteristics and the final cage topology. Characterization of the resulting assemblies was achieved through a combination of X-ray crystallography and spectroscopic techniques, confirming the designed low-symmetry architectures. This methodology expands the toolkit for the construction of complex metallo-supramolecular structures and provides a foundation for future investigations into the properties and applications of these heteroleptic palladium(II) cages in areas such as catalysis, molecular recognition, and materials science.
