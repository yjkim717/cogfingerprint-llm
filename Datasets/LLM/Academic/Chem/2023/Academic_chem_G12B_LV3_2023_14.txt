**Abstract**

Recent advancements in astrochemistry highlight the critical role of surface processes in the formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments. This study presents experimental findings quantifying the activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>) for carbon atom surface diffusion on interstellar ice analogs. Utilizing low-temperature surface science techniques, we determined E<sub>a</sub> to be 88 meV (1,020 K), a value significantly lower than previously assumed. This revised understanding suggests that carbon addition reactions, facilitated by efficient surface diffusion, represent a previously underestimated pathway for enhancing chemical complexity on interstellar ice grains at temperatures as low as 22 K. The implications of this work extend to models of interstellar chemistry, indicating a potential for accelerated organic molecule synthesis and influencing the observed abundance of complex species in star-forming regions. Further investigation into the diffusion mechanisms of other reactive species is warranted.
