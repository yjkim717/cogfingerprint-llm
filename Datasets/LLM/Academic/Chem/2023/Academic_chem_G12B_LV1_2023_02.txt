**Abstract: Experimental Determination of Carbon Atom Surface Diffusion Activation Energies in Interstellar Ice Analogs and Implications for Complex Organic Molecule Formation**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a fundamental question in astrochemistry. While gas-phase reactions are well-studied, the significant role of surface chemistry on interstellar dust grains remains an area of active investigation. A crucial step in this surface chemistry is the diffusion of atomic species across ice mantles, enabling subsequent chemical reactions. This work presents experimental measurements of the activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>) for carbon atom (C) diffusion on astrophysically relevant ice analogs composed of water ice (H<sub>2</sub>O) at 10 K. Using ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), we monitored the diffusion of C atoms deposited onto H<sub>2</sub>O ice surfaces. The observed diffusion rates were analyzed to determine the E<sub>a</sub>, yielding a value of 0.55 ± 0.08 eV. This value is significantly lower than previously estimated for carbon diffusion in similar systems, suggesting a more facile mobility than previously considered.  The implications of this finding for the efficiency of C-C bond formation on interstellar dust grains are discussed, with a focus on the enhanced probability of polymerization reactions leading to the formation of larger organic molecules, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and potentially prebiotic molecules. These results contribute to a refined understanding of the chemical processes occurring in cold, dense molecular clouds and provide critical data for modeling the formation pathways of interstellar COMs. Future work will investigate the influence of ice composition, including the inclusion of other common interstellar molecules like methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), on the observed diffusion behavior.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Tone & Precise Terminology:** I used phrases like "astrophysically relevant ice analogs," "ultra-high vacuum (UHV)," "temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)," "activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>)," and "polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)" to establish a formal, scientific tone.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: (1) Introduction of the problem (COM formation), (2) Significance of surface chemistry and diffusion, (3) Description of the experimental approach, (4) Presentation of the key result (E<sub>a</sub> value), (5) Discussion of implications, and (6) Future research directions.
*   **Year Context (2023):**  The phrasing reflects current research trends in astrochemistry, which is increasingly focused on refined experimental measurements and modeling of surface reactions. The mention of methanol and ammonia as potential co-ices is consistent with common research directions.
*   **Specificity:** I specified water ice (H<sub>2</sub>O) and a temperature of 10 K to make the experimental conditions clear.
*   **Error Bars:**  Including an error bar (± 0.08 eV)
