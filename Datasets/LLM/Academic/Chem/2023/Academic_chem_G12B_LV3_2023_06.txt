**Abstract**

Recent advancements in astrochemistry highlight the crucial role of surface processes in the formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments. This study presents experimental evidence demonstrating the surprisingly facile diffusion of individual carbon atoms across amorphous ice surfaces at cryogenic temperatures as low as 22 K. Utilizing ultra-high vacuum techniques and temperature-programmed desorption spectroscopy, we observed significant carbon mobility, facilitating carbon-carbon bond formation and the subsequent synthesis of larger organic species. These findings challenge previous assumptions regarding the thermal barriers to C-C coupling in interstellar ices. The implications extend to the chemical evolution of translucent clouds and protoplanetary disks, suggesting that carbon diffusion represents a key pathway for increasing molecular complexity under astrobiologically relevant conditions. Understanding the activation energies governing this process refines models of interstellar organic synthesis.
