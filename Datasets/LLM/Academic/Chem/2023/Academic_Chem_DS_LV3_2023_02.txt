**Abstract**

The formation pathways of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) represent a fundamental problem in astrochemistry. While gas-phase reactions are well-characterized, the role of solid-state surface processes on icy dust grains remains less constrained, particularly concerning the most basic atomic building blocks. This investigation presents experimental evidence, acquired through ultra-high-vacuum temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), which elucidates the non-thermal diffusion dynamics of atomic carbon (C) on low-temperature water-ice analogues. Our results demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces at temperatures exceeding 22 K, a threshold significantly lower than previously theorized. This mobility facilitates barrier-mediated reactions through Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanisms, directly leading to the formation of nascent Câ€“C bonds. The measured activation energy for this surface diffusion process is a critical parameter, enabling the incorporation of these findings into refined astrochemical models. The implications are profound: the identified low-temperature diffusion channel provides a robust, non-energetic mechanism for initiating molecular complexity in dark molecular clouds and protostellar envelopes. It effectively bridges the "reaction gap" between atomic carbon and the subsequent synthesis of unsaturated hydrocarbon chains and, ultimately, prebiotic species. This work establishes surface diffusion of carbon atoms as a pivotal, previously underestimated driver of interstellar organic chemistry, fundamentally altering our understanding of chemical evolution en route to molecular complexity in the cosmos.
