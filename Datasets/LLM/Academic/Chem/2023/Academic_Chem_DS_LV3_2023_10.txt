**Abstract**

The formation pathways of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) represent a fundamental problem in astrochemistry, with direct implications for our understanding of prebiotic chemical inventories. While gas-phase reactions have been extensively modeled, the role of solid-state chemistry on icy dust grain mantles remains less constrained, particularly regarding the initial steps of carbon backbone assembly. This study investigates the non-thermal surface diffusion of atomic carbon on low-temperature amorphous solid water (ASW) ice analogues, a critical yet poorly understood mechanism for initiating carbon-chain growth. Through a series of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments coupled with reactive force-field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, we quantify the diffusion barriers and hopping rates of carbon atoms. Our results demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on ASW surfaces at temperatures exceeding 22 K, a threshold significantly lower than previously theorized. This mobility facilitates barrierless recombination reactions with other carbon atoms and reactive radicals, leading directly to efficient Câ€“C bond formation. The detected reaction products, identified via quadrupole mass spectrometry (QMS) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), include nascent carbon chains (e.g., C2, C3) and oxygen-bearing COMs such as ketene (H2CCO). These findings establish non-diffusive surface migration of carbon atoms as a dominant, low-temperature driver of molecular complexity in dark molecular clouds. This revised paradigm necessitates updates to current astrochemical networks, underscoring the catalytic role of interstellar ices in forging the molecular precursors to life.
