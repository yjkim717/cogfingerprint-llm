**Abstract:**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, intersecting molecular quantum electrodynamics (MQED) and quantum light-matter interactions, has witnessed significant theoretical progress in recent years. This review synthesizes contemporary advancements within this domain, specifically addressing critical gaps in traditional MQED frameworks that have historically hindered a complete understanding of light-enhanced chemical processes. We explore the application of *ab initio* quantum electrodynamics (QED) methodologies to model and predict the behavior of molecular systems strongly coupled to optical fields, moving beyond semiclassical approximations. A central focus is the investigation of vibrational strong coupling, demonstrating its potential to fundamentally alter reaction pathways and efficiencies in photochemical transformations. The theoretical landscape now encompasses sophisticated treatments of dissipative effects, coherence lifetimes, and the impact of cavity geometry on polariton condensation and chemical dynamics. While substantial progress has been made in predicting and rationalizing specific experimental observations, particularly concerning enhanced reaction rates and altered product distributions, challenges remain in accurately capturing the complexities of real-world systems, including disorder and environmental influences. Future research directions will necessitate the development of more robust and computationally efficient *ab initio* QED techniques, coupled with improved experimental validation, to fully realize the potential of polariton chemistry for controlled photochemistry and novel materials design.
