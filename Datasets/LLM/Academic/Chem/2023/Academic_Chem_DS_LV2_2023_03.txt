**Abstract**

The construction of discrete heteroleptic coordination cages with precise spatial control over multiple, chemically distinct ligands presents a significant challenge in supramolecular chemistry, primarily due to the statistical formation of homoleptic species. Herein, we report a rational design strategy for the assembly of low-symmetry palladium(II)-ligand cages comprising four unique, complementary ligands. Our approach circumvents statistical disorder by employing a pair of geometrically and electronically mismatched, ditopic ligands that function as a single, unified "ancillary" panel. This ancillary pair enforces a specific coordination geometry upon the Pd(II) ions, which serve as four-connecting nodes. The pre-organized metal centers subsequently direct the orthogonal binding of two additional, structurally dissimilar ligands to complete the cage architecture. This methodology provides exceptional positional control over each ligand component within the final three-dimensional assembly, effectively programming the heteroleptic outcome. The resulting multicomponent cages were characterized by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, confirming their structural integrity and fidelity. This strategy, leveraging complementary ligand pairings to govern self-assembly pathways, establishes a robust and generalizable platform for constructing intricate, functionally diverse supramolecular systems with potential applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, and compartmentalization.
