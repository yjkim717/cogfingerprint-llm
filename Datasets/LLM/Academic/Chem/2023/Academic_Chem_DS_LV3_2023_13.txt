**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) represents a critical stage in prebiotic chemical evolution. While gas-phase reactions are well-characterized, the role of solid-state chemistry on icy grain mantles remains less understood, particularly concerning the initial steps of carbon backbone assembly. This study investigates the non-thermal surface diffusion of atomic carbon and its catalytic role in C–C bond formation on low-temperature amorphous solid water (ASW) ice analogues. Experimental results obtained via temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on ASW surfaces at temperatures exceeding 22 K. This mobility facilitates direct addition reactions with pre-adsorbed unsaturated species, such as CO and C₂H₂, initiating a carbon-addition chain mechanism. Crucially, our quantitative analysis reveals that this surface diffusion-driven process significantly enhances the production yield of small hydrocarbon chains and oxygen-bearing COMs like ketene (H₂CCO) and propenal (C₂H₃CHO) by circumventing the high activation barriers associated with radical-radical recombination in the ice matrix. These findings, contextualized by recent observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope, provide a robust physicochemical framework for the abiotic synthesis of molecular complexity in dark molecular clouds. We conclude that carbon atom diffusion is a fundamental and previously underestimated driver of molecular complexity, effectively bridging the gap between simple icy precursors and the reservoir of COMs available for incorporation into nascent planetary systems.
