In this study, we report the design and synthesis of a novel class of amine-linked covalent organic frameworks (COFs) engineered for the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). Through a strategic post-synthetic modification protocol, we have successfully incorporated dual functionalities that synergistically enhance catalytic performance. The first modification introduces specific binding sites that significantly increase the local concentration and binding affinity of CO2 molecules within the porous framework. The second modification involves the integration of conjugated molecular units, which substantially improves the bulk electronic conductivity of the material, facilitating efficient charge transfer during electrolysis. Electrochemical evaluation reveals that the dual-modified COF exhibits exceptional activity and selectivity for CO production, achieving a faradaic efficiency of 92% at a moderate overpotential. This represents a marked improvement over its unmodified and singly-modified counterparts. The structural integrity and permanent porosity of the framework were confirmed through comprehensive characterization. Our findings demonstrate that the cooperative effect between optimized CO2 chemisorption and enhanced charge transport is a powerful strategy for developing high-performance, molecularly precise heterogeneous electrocatalysts for sustainable fuel production.
