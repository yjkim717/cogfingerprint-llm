**Abstract: Surface Diffusion-Mediated Organic Synthesis in Cold Icy Grains â€“ A Pathway to Interstellar Complexity**

The prevailing paradigm for the origin of complex organic molecules within interstellar space posits a predominantly quiescent, gas-phase chemistry. However, emerging evidence increasingly implicates the surfaces of icy grains as critical reaction sites. This study investigates the role of surface diffusion of carbon atoms on icy grains, specifically at temperatures exceeding 22K, in facilitating the formation of complex organic molecules. Utilizing a kinetic modeling approach, we demonstrate that thermally activated carbon diffusion across grain surfaces significantly enhances reaction pathways unavailable in the diffuse interstellar medium. 

The observed surface diffusion, coupled with the presence of reactive species trapped within the icy matrix, promotes the condensation and subsequent polymerization of simple precursors into larger, more intricate organic molecules. These findings suggest that icy grains represent dynamic chemical reactors, substantially increasing the efficiency of prebiotic synthesis. Further research, incorporating spectroscopic validation, is warranted to fully elucidate the specific organic molecules formed and the influence of grain composition on this critical interstellar chemistry.
