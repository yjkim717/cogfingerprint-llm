**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry continues to benefit from innovative synthetic strategies for constructing complex coordination architectures. This study presents a refined methodology for the de novo synthesis of heteroleptic palladium(II) cages, leveraging the strategic design of complementary ancillary ligand pairings to exert precise control over ligand positioning and orientation within the resulting assemblies. Departing from traditional approaches, our method utilizes low-symmetry ligands exhibiting distinct coordination preferences, enabling the formation of cages with unprecedented structural complexity. This controlled assembly is facilitated by careful selection of ancillary ligand combinations, influencing both the spatial arrangement and relative orientation of the ligands around the central palladium(II) ion. The implications of this approach extend to the rational design of functional metallo-cages for applications in catalysis, sensing, and materials science. Future research will focus on exploring the scope and limitations of this methodology and investigating the emergent properties of these novel heteroleptic palladium(II) cage structures.
