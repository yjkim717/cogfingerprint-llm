Of particular significance in astrochemical research is the mechanism by which simple carbonaceous precursors evolve into complex organic molecules (COMs) within the low-temperature environment of interstellar ice mantles. While radical-radical reactions have been extensively studied, the role of neutral carbon atom mobility has remained a critical, yet poorly constrained, parameter in reaction network models. Herein, we present experimental and theoretical evidence establishing a temperature threshold of 22 K for the surface diffusion of atomic carbon on amorphous solid water ice. Through ultra-high-vacuum cryogenic experiments coupled with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that this mobility is not merely physical but chemically consequential. The diffusive carbon atoms readily engage with frozen precursors such as CO and CH₃OH, initiating a cascade of hydrogen-abstraction and addition reactions. Crucially, this process directly facilitates C–C bond formation, a fundamental step in molecular complexity. Our results quantitatively show that carbon diffusion significantly enhances the formation rates of key COMs, including acetaldehyde and ethanol, providing a robust, non-radical-driven pathway for interstellar organic chemistry. This work redefines our understanding of chemical complexity in star-forming regions, necessitating the incorporation of mobile carbon atoms into astrochemical models.
