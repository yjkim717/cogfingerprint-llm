**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar space remains a central enigma in astrochemistry. This study investigates the pivotal role of surface diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice grains in facilitating this process, presenting novel findings from 2023. Utilizing theoretical modeling and kinetic simulations, we demonstrate that thermal activation, specifically above 22 Kelvin, significantly enhances carbon-carbon bond formation and subsequent chain elongation on ice surfaces.  The observed surface diffusion rates are intrinsically linked to the crystalline structure of the ice, exhibiting variations dependent on ice composition and grain morphology.  

Our results reveal a mechanistic pathway whereby initially simple carbonaceous species, adsorbed onto ice, undergo repeated surface diffusion events, overcoming kinetic barriers and promoting the aggregation necessary for the synthesis of increasingly complex organic monomers.  These monomers subsequently condense, leading to the formation of larger, more intricate molecules, mirroring the observed distribution of prebiotic building blocks detected in interstellar molecular clouds.  Further investigation is warranted to explore the influence of radiation fields and other interstellar environmental factors on this fundamental process.
