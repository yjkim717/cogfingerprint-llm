**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium represents a critical stage in prebiotic chemical evolution. While gas-phase reactions are well-characterized, the role of solid-state chemistry on icy grain mantles remains less understood, particularly concerning the initial steps of carbon backbone assembly. This study investigates the non-thermal surface diffusion of carbon (C) atoms on low-temperature amorphous solid water (ASW) ice analogues, a process fundamental to Câ€“C bond formation. Experimental results obtained through temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) demonstrate a significant diffusion threshold at approximately 22 K. Below this temperature, C atoms remain immobilized, leading primarily to simple hydrogenation and the formation of volatile species such as methane. However, upon surpassing this critical thermal activation barrier, carbon atoms exhibit marked mobility, facilitating reactive encounters with other carbon-bearing radicals and unsaturated COMs precursors co-deposited on the ice surface. This diffusive behavior directly enables the catalytic synthesis of more complex, carbon-chain-enriched molecules, including acetaldehyde and ethanol, which are identified as key products. These findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed molecular complexity in quiescent clouds and protostellar envelopes, where ice mantles are subject to mild thermal processing. We conclude that carbon atom surface diffusion is a dominant, non-equilibrium driver of molecular complexity in cold interstellar environments, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of astrochemical reaction networks and the cosmic origins of molecular diversity.
