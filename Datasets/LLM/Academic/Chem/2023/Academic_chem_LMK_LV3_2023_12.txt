Title: Exploring the Frontiers of Polariton Chemistry: Simulating Chemical Reactions under Vibrational Strong Coupling

Abstract:
Recent advances in molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics have revolutionized the field of polariton chemistry, enabling the manipulation of chemical reactions through strong light-matter interactions. By harnessing the principles of quantum electrodynamics, researchers can now simulate and control photochemical processes with unprecedented precision. The phenomenon of vibrational strong coupling, in particular, has emerged as a powerful tool for modifying chemical reactivity. As of 2023, theoretical frameworks have been developed to understand the complex interplay between vibrational modes and electromagnetic fields, paving the way for novel applications in photochemistry. This study reviews the current state of polariton chemistry, highlighting the potential of vibrational strong coupling to reshape our understanding of chemical reactions and drive innovation in the field. By exploring the intersection of quantum mechanics and chemistry, we uncover new avenues for controlling chemical reactivity.
