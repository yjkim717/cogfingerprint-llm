**Abstract: Kinetic Surface Diffusion of Carbon on Interstellar Ice Facilitates Complex Organic Precursor Formation**

The genesis of complex organic molecules (COMs) within interstellar space remains a central puzzle in astrochemistry. This study investigates the role of low-energy surface diffusion of carbon atoms on icy grain surfaces as a critical pathway for precursor molecule formation. Utilizing computational modeling and kinetic simulations, we demonstrate that carbon atoms, readily incorporated into interstellar ices, exhibit a surprisingly facile surface diffusion coefficient, driven by a minimal activation energy. 

Specifically, our simulations reveal that this diffusion enables the efficient rearrangement and condensation of carbon fragments onto ice grains, fostering the formation of increasingly complex structures.  The observed kinetics suggest that even at cryogenic temperatures characteristic of interstellar environments, significant surface diffusion occurs, overcoming traditional thermodynamic barriers. These findings highlight the importance of considering surface processes – rather than solely gas-phase reactions – in explaining the observed abundance of fundamental building blocks for potential prebiotic chemistry.  Further research is warranted to investigate the specific ice compositions and grain morphologies influencing this crucial process, particularly within the context of interstellar chemistry observed in 2023.
