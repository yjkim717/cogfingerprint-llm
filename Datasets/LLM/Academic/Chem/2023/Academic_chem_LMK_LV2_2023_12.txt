Title: Advances in Polariton Chemistry and Molecular Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics: Theoretical Perspectives and Emerging Applications

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by the prospect of manipulating photochemical reactions through strong light-matter interactions within optical cavities. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical advancements in polariton chemistry and molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), highlighting the methodologies and applications that have emerged as of 2023. By delving into the intricacies of cavity QED, we elucidate the fundamental principles governing the interaction between molecular systems and quantized electromagnetic fields. The theoretical frameworks discussed herein encompass a range of approaches, from quantum mechanical treatments of molecular polaritons to semiclassical approximations and mixed quantum-classical methodologies. These theoretical tools enable the investigation of various phenomena, including the modification of photochemical reaction pathways, the enhancement of energy transfer processes, and the emergence of novel optical properties. Furthermore, we examine the applications of polariton chemistry in diverse areas, such as controlling photochemical reactions, manipulating molecular dynamics, and designing novel optoelectronic materials. The insights garnered from these theoretical studies not only deepen our understanding of light-matter interactions at the molecular level but also pave the way for the development of innovative technologies that exploit the unique properties of polaritonic systems. By providing a comprehensive survey of the current state of the field, this review aims to stimulate further research and foster advancements in the exciting and rapidly evolving domain of polariton chemistry and molecular cavity QED.
