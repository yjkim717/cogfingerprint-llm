Title: Strategic Self-Assembly of Heteroleptic Pd(II) Cages via Ancillary Pairings with Low-Symmetry Ligands

Abstract:
The synthesis of complex metallo-supramolecular architectures with precise control over their structure and functionality remains a significant challenge in the field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry. This study (2023) presents a novel ancillary pairings approach to construct heteroleptic Pd(II) cages with low-symmetry ligands, achieving positional and orientational control. By carefully designing ligand pairs and exploiting the coordination preferences of Pd(II) centers, we demonstrate the self-assembly of complex cage structures with defined geometries. The ancillary pairings strategy enables the precise placement of functional groups within the cage framework, offering new opportunities for the development of supramolecular materials with tailored properties. Our findings highlight the potential of this approach to expand the scope of metallo-supramolecular chemistry and advance the design of complex architectures for applications in catalysis, sensing, and guest encapsulation.
