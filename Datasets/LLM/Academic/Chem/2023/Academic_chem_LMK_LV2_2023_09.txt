Title: Investigating the Role of Surface Diffusion of Carbon Atoms in the Formation of Complex Organic Molecules on Interstellar Ice

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a topic of significant interest in astrochemistry. Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of surface diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice in facilitating the synthesis of COMs. This study employs quantum chemical calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the surface diffusion of carbon atoms on amorphous water ice surfaces. Our results demonstrate that the surface diffusion of carbon atoms is a key process enabling the formation of COMs through barrierless reactions. The calculated diffusion rates and reaction probabilities are used to inform astrochemical models, providing new insights into the chemistry of interstellar ice mantles. The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of the origins of COMs in interstellar environments and their potential delivery to planetary surfaces. (2023)
