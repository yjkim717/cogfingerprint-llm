This study investigates the sensitivity of primordial gas collapse to high-temperature chemical reaction networks. We present a revised implementation of key molecular cooling pathways in hydrodynamic simulations, addressing previously unphysical discontinuities in reaction rates. Our corrected models demonstrate a 40% reduction in the parameter space permitting adiabatic collapse via H₂ cooling at metallicities Z < 10⁻³ Z⊙. Critically, while the viable formation window for Population III stars narrows, the fundamental transition from atomic to molecular cooling regimes remains robust, preserving established pathways for early structure formation in the universe.
