Title: Strategic Assembly of Heteroleptic Palladium(II) Cages via Ancillary Pairing of Low-Symmetry Ligands

Abstract:

The synthesis of metallo-supramolecular architectures with predefined structures and properties remains a significant challenge in the field of coordination chemistry. Herein, we report a novel approach to access complex heteroleptic palladium(II) cages with high positional and orientational control. By exploiting the complementary steric and electronic properties of carefully designed low-symmetry ligands, we demonstrate the formation of discrete heteroleptic assemblies through ancillary pairings. The judicious selection of ligand combinations enables the precise control over the resulting cage architectures, as confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. This strategic assembly methodology provides a versatile platform for the construction of sophisticated metallo-supramolecular structures, with potential applications in catalysis, guest encapsulation, and materials science. The findings presented in this study underscore the potential of heteroleptic assemblies to expand the scope of metallo-supramolecular chemistry.
