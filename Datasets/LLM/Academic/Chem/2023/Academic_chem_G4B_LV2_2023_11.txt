**Abstract**

The development of structurally complex coordination cages remains a central pursuit within supramolecular chemistry, offering opportunities to explore novel host-guest interactions and catalytic applications. This study details a recently developed methodology for the construction of intricate Pd(II) lantern-shaped cages, leveraging the strategic utilization of ancillary ligand pairings. Employing low-symmetry ligands, we demonstrate a controlled approach to heteroleptic assembly, facilitating precise positioning and orientation of the metal center within the resulting cage architecture.  Specifically, the incorporation of carefully selected ancillary ligands dictates the overall geometry and stability of the Pd(II) core.  Results reveal a robust and predictable pathway for generating these highly symmetrical, yet complex, structures.  The ability to tune ligand selection and subsequently control spatial arrangement represents a significant advancement, paving the way for future investigations into the catalytic properties and guest encapsulation capabilities of these pd(II) cage systems.  Further research will focus on exploring the impact of varying ancillary ligand combinations on cage functionality.
