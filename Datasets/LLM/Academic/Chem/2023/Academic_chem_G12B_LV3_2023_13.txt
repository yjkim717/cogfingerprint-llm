**Abstract**

Recent investigations into interstellar environments highlight the crucial role of surface chemistry in the formation of complex organic molecules. This study presents experimental evidence demonstrating the surprisingly facile diffusion of atomic carbon on astrophysically relevant ice surfaces at cryogenic temperatures as low as 22 K. Utilizing ultra-high vacuum techniques and temperature-programmed desorption spectroscopy, we quantified carbon diffusion coefficients, revealing rates significantly higher than previously predicted by kinetic models. These findings suggest that carbon diffusion represents a previously underestimated activation pathway for incorporating carbon into existing ice mantles, thereby facilitating the synthesis of increasingly complex organic species, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and amino acids. The implications extend to a revised understanding of the chemical evolution of interstellar dust grains and the delivery of prebiotic molecules to planetary systems. Further research is warranted to elucidate the influence of ice composition and morphology on carbon diffusion kinetics and its broader impact on interstellar chemistry.
