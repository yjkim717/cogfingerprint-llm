Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a chemistry-related publication, based on the provided keywords and summary, and written with a 2023 context. I've aimed for precision and a structured argument.  I've also included a few potential journal-specific tweaks at the end.

**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments is a fundamental question in astrochemistry. While gas-phase reactions are well-studied, the role of surface chemistry on interstellar ice grains remains a critical, yet less understood, component of this process. This study presents experimental measurements of the activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>) for the surface diffusion of individual carbon atoms on a simulated interstellar ice analogue composed primarily of frozen water. Utilizing Temperature Programmed Desorption (TPD) coupled with Reflection Absorption Infrared Spectroscopy (RAIRS), we quantified the kinetics of carbon atom mobility as a function of temperature. Our findings reveal an activation energy of [Insert Specific Value, e.g., 0.65 ± 0.05] eV for carbon atom diffusion, significantly influencing the timescale for subsequent chemical reactions.

The observed diffusion rate suggests that carbon atoms can traverse appreciable distances within the ice matrix at astrophysically relevant temperatures (10-30 K), facilitating encounters and promoting carbon-carbon (C-C) bond formation. This supports models proposing that surface diffusion is a key step in the synthesis of larger organic species, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and potentially more complex prebiotic molecules.  The relatively low activation energy indicates that surface diffusion is likely a highly efficient process, contributing substantially to the observed abundance of organic compounds in interstellar ices. This research provides crucial experimental data to refine astrochemical models and improve our understanding of the chemical evolution of icy grains in star-forming regions. Further investigations exploring the influence of ice composition and the presence of other chemical species are warranted to fully characterize the complexity of interstellar surface chemistry.
