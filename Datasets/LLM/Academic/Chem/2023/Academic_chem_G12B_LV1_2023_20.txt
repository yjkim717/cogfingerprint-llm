**Theoretical Frontiers in Polariton Chemistry: Ab Initio Modeling of Quantum Light-Matter Hybrid Systems and Non-Adiabatic Dynamics**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of chemical reactivity, marrying the principles of molecular quantum mechanics with the unique properties of quantum light. This review explores recent theoretical advancements in the modeling and prediction of chemical phenomena arising from strong coupling between molecular excitations and optical photons, forming polariton quasiparticles within optical cavities. Specifically, we focus on the evolution of *ab initio* Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) methodologies capable of accurately describing these light-matter interactions, moving beyond traditional, semi-classical approaches. The core challenge lies in simultaneously accounting for both the molecular electronic structure and the quantized electromagnetic field within a computationally tractable framework.

We detail the progress in developing and refining density-functional theory (DFT)-based and wavefunction-based *ab initio* QED methods that incorporate the quantized electromagnetic field, including advancements in dipole self-interaction corrections and renormalization procedures to accurately represent the polaritonic spectrum. A critical advancement has been the integration of these methods with non-adiabatic dynamics simulations, enabling the study of polariton-mediated reaction pathways and energy transfer processes.  We examine how the formation of polaritons alters the potential energy surfaces of molecular systems, leading to modified reaction rates, altered product distributions, and potentially the emergence of novel chemical transformations inaccessible under conventional conditions.

This review highlights the application of these theoretical tools to several key areas, including photocatalysis, vibronic polariton chemistry, and the control of excited-state dynamics through cavity-mediated coherence. We discuss examples where polariton condensation and Bose-Einstein statistics influence reaction pathways. Furthermore, we critically evaluate the limitations of current theoretical approaches, particularly concerning the accurate description of many-body effects, the treatment of dissipation and decoherence, and the extension of these methods to larger, more complex molecular systems.  The accurate modeling of cavity losses and their impact on polariton lifetimes remains a significant hurdle.  Finally, we outline future directions for theoretical research, including the development of machine learning-assisted approaches to accelerate *ab initio* QED calculations and the exploration of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for simulating the complex dynamics of polariton chemistry in realistic, heterogeneous environments. The convergence of advanced computational techniques and experimental capabilities promises to unlock a deeper understanding of quantum light-matter interactions and their transformative potential in chemistry.
