**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, situated at the confluence of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) and photochemistry, represents a paradigm shift in the control of quantum light-matter interactions. This 2023 review consolidates the foundational theoretical frameworks underpinning this discipline, critically examining the transition from simple quantum optical models to sophisticated *ab initio* quantum electrodynamical approaches tailored for molecular ensembles. A central theme is the rigorous treatment of **gauge ambiguities** inherent in the quantization of the electromagnetic field within optical cavities, a non-trivial challenge that has historically complicated the formulation of a universally consistent Hamiltonian. We elucidate how recent theoretical advances have reconciled these ambiguities, particularly in the context of the dipole gauge and Coulomb gauge, thereby establishing a more robust foundation for predictive simulations.

The review further synthesizes state-of-the-art computational methodologies, including cavity-based time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and configuration interaction (CI) methods, which are instrumental in modeling the emergent hybrid light-matter states—polaritons. A significant focus is placed on the implications of **collective coupling**, where an ensemble of N molecules cooperatively interacts with a confined photonic mode, leading to phenomena such as vacuum Rabi splitting that scales with √N. This collective regime is pivotal for applications in photochemistry, where polariton formation can selectively alter potential energy surfaces, thereby modulating reaction pathways and enhancing reaction yields under vibrational strong coupling (VSC). We critically assess the application of these principles in controlling processes like isomerization and bond dissociation, highlighting the promising yet nascent experimental demonstrations.

Despite these advances, a formidable challenge persists in fully reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations, particularly regarding the precise mechanisms of chemical reactivity modification under VSC. This review concludes by identifying key knowledge gaps, such as the role of dark states and cavity loss channels, and outlines a trajectory for future research aimed at bridging this explanatory divide to unlock the full potential of polaritonic platforms for tailored chemical synthesis.
