Title: Investigating the Role of Surface Diffusion in the Formation of Complex Organic Molecules on Interstellar Ice Surfaces

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a crucial process in understanding the origins of life. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of surface chemistry on interstellar ice grains. Here, we investigate the role of carbon atom diffusion on these surfaces in driving COM formation. Using a combination of density functional theory (DFT) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, we model the diffusion of carbon atoms on amorphous water ice surfaces at temperatures relevant to interstellar environments (10-50 K). Our results show that surface diffusion enables the formation of C-C bonds, facilitating the growth of complex molecules. We identify key reaction pathways and intermediates involved in the formation of COMs, including the formation of C2H2 and C3H4 species. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms governing interstellar organic chemistry and have implications for our understanding of the origins of life in the universe. (2023)
