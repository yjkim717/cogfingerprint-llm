**Abstract**

The construction of discrete heteroleptic metallo-supramolecular architectures represents a significant challenge, particularly when moving beyond highly symmetrical ligand frameworks. This work reports a rational design strategy for the self-assembly of low-symmetry Pd(II)-based coordination cages with precisely controlled heteroleptic compositions. Our approach exploits the principle of complementary ancillary pairings, where judiciously selected ligand sets exhibit orthogonal binding preferences and geometric constraints during metal-directed assembly. By employing a library of ditopic, low-symmetry ligands with differentiated donor sets and backbone angulation, we demonstrate the selective formation of complex cage structures. These assemblies incorporate up to four chemically distinct ligand components in a single, well-defined entity, a feat rarely achieved with traditional self-assembly paradigms. The structural integrity and composition of the resulting heteroleptic cages were unambiguously characterized by a combination of multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction analysis. This methodology provides a robust and generalizable pathway for increasing the structural and functional complexity of supramolecular systems, paving the way for the development of sophisticated molecular flasks and nanoreactors with multi-functional interiors. The ability to programmatically integrate diverse chemical functionalities within a single scaffold opens new avenues for applications in cooperative catalysis and complex guest binding.
