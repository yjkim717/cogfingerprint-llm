**Abstract:**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of photochemistry, leveraging strong light-matter interactions within molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (MCQD) systems. This review synthesizes recent theoretical developments aimed at elucidating and predicting the impact of polariton formation on chemical reaction dynamics. We focus on advancements in *ab initio* quantum electrodynamics (QED) methodologies, specifically those enabling accurate modeling of coupled light-molecule systems at the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. These computational approaches are crucial for moving beyond semiclassical descriptions and capturing the fundamentally quantum nature of polariton-mediated processes.

Current research highlights the potential for polaritonic effects to alter reaction pathways, enhance reaction rates, and impart novel selectivity compared to conventional photochemistry. We examine specific examples where polariton chemistry demonstrates promise, including controlled bond formation, modified energy landscapes, and the potential for new catalytic strategies. Simultaneously, we address the significant challenges that persist in this area. These include the computational cost of accurate *ab initio* QED calculations, the complexity of accurately characterizing polariton states within realistic molecular environments, and the development of robust theoretical frameworks to describe decoherence and dissipation effects. Future directions involve the integration of machine learning techniques to accelerate simulations and the exploration of novel materials and cavity designs to optimize polariton chemistry applications. This review underscores the ongoing evolution of polariton chemistry and its potential to revolutionize synthetic chemistry and light-driven processes.
