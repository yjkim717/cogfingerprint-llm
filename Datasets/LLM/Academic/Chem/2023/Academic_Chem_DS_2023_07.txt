Here we report a modular strategy for the construction of heteroleptic Pd(II)-based coordination cages through the selective integration of four distinct, low-symmetry ditopic ligands. The assembly process is governed by the implementation of complementary ligand pairings, where geometric and electronic disparities between components are exploited to enforce a specific connectivity and suppress statistical scrambling. This approach provides unprecedented positional control over multiple ligand orientations within a single supramolecular architecture, a challenge not readily addressed by conventional self-assembly with symmetric building blocks. The resulting heteroleptic cages were characterized by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography, confirming the formation of discrete, well-defined assemblies. This methodology establishes a new paradigm for increasing the structural and functional complexity of metallosupramolecular systems, paving the way for the design of sophisticated molecular hosts and functional materials with precisely arranged internal environments.
