**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, operating at the nexus of quantum optics and molecular physics, seeks to manipulate chemical reactivity and material properties by coupling molecular ensembles to the quantized electromagnetic fields of an optical cavity. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the theoretical and computational advances that have established the foundation for this nascent discipline. We begin by elucidating the fundamental principles of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), the theoretical framework describing strong light-matter interactions that give rise to hybrid light-matter quasiparticles known as polaritons. A critical examination of the current methodological landscape is presented, with a focus on *ab initio* QED approaches that integrate electronic structure theory with quantized field modes, thereby enabling a first-principles description of polaritonic phenomena. We highlight key applications where theoretical predictions have been most salient, including the suppression or enhancement of reaction rates, control over excited-state dynamics, and the engineering of novel polaritonic phases in organic semiconductors. However, the rapid theoretical progress has also revealed profound challenges. A central theme of this review is the critical issue of gauge ambiguities, where the physical predictions of models can vary drastically depending on the choice of electromagnetic gauge, raising questions about the reliability of certain approximations. We discuss ongoing efforts to resolve these ambiguities and outline other pressing challenges, such as accurately describing collective effects in disordered molecular ensembles and scaling computations to realistic cavity environments. By charting the interplay between methodological development, conceptual challenges, and transformative applications, this review aims to orient researchers and catalyze future work in the quest to harness quantum vacuum fields for chemical control.
