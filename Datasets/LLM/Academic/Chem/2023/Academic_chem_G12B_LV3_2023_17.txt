**Abstract**

Recent experimental studies have illuminated a critical pathway in interstellar organic molecule formation: the surface diffusion of carbon atoms within icy grain mantles. This work investigates the observed unexpectedly facile diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice analogs, demonstrating a remarkably low activation energy of 88 meV. This finding challenges prevailing models of low-temperature interstellar chemistry, suggesting that C-C bond formation and the subsequent synthesis of increasingly complex organic molecules can occur at significantly lower temperatures than previously estimated. The implications extend to understanding the chemical complexity observed in star-forming regions and the potential for prebiotic chemistry in cold molecular clouds. Furthermore, the observed diffusion kinetics provide valuable constraints for developing more accurate astrochemical models, ultimately advancing our comprehension of the chemical evolution of interstellar ices and the origins of life's building blocks.
