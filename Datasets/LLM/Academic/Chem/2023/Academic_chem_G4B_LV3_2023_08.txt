**Abstract**

Recent theoretical investigations into polariton chemistry and molecular cavity QED have witnessed substantial advancements, culminating in a 2023 review dedicated to simulating complex molecule-cavity hybrid systems. This work addresses critical challenges within quantum electrodynamics (QED), specifically resolving gauge ambiguities inherent in describing strong light-matter interactions. Utilizing *ab initio* QED methodologies, researchers are now capable of accurately modeling the dynamic coupling between molecules and photonic modes confined within dielectric cavities.  The implications extend significantly to photochemistry, where these simulations enable a deeper understanding of excited-state dynamics and potential ground-state reaction modifications.  Specifically, the study explores how tailored cavity environments influence photochemical pathways, offering novel strategies for controlling reaction selectivity and efficiency.  Furthermore, the framework developed contributes to the broader field of nanoscale quantum optics, paving the way for the design of advanced light-harvesting systems and quantum-enhanced spectroscopic techniques.  Future research will likely focus on implementing these theoretical insights into experimental validations and exploring applications beyond traditional photochemical processes.
