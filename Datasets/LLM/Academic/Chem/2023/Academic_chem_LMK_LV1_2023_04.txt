Title: Exploring the Frontiers of Polariton Chemistry: Advances in Molecular Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by the prospect of manipulating photochemical reactions through vibrational strong coupling. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical advances in molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics, a crucial framework for understanding the intricacies of light-matter interactions. We examine the methodological developments that have enabled the simulation of polaritonic systems, including the application of quantum electrodynamical density functional theory and the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach.

The integration of quantum electrodynamics with molecular dynamics has facilitated the exploration of vibrational strong coupling regimes, revealing novel insights into the modulation of chemical reactivity. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings of polariton-mediated chemistry, highlighting the role of cavity-induced modifications to the potential energy landscape. Furthermore, we survey the current state of applications in polariton chemistry, including the manipulation of photochemical reaction pathways and the enhancement of energy transfer processes.

Despite the significant progress achieved, several challenges persist, including the need for more accurate descriptions of cavity loss and the development of scalable methodologies for complex systems. We outline the outstanding theoretical challenges and propose future research directions, emphasizing the potential for interdisciplinary collaborations between theoretical chemists, physicists, and materials scientists. By elucidating the fundamental principles governing polariton chemistry, this review aims to stimulate further innovation in the field, with far-reaching implications for the control of photochemical reactions and the development of novel optoelectronic materials.
