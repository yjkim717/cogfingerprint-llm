Of particular significance in interstellar organic chemistry is the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs), a process for which the underlying mechanisms on icy grain surfaces remain incompletely understood. This investigation elucidates the critical role of surface diffusion of atomic carbon as a driver of molecular complexity in cold astrophysical environments. Through kinetic Monte Carlo simulations informed by recent laboratory data, we demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on water-dominated ice mantles at temperatures exceeding 22 K. This mobility facilitates direct encounters with other reactive species, most notably enabling efficient C–C bond formation—the fundamental step for building organic backbones. Our results indicate that this single process can initiate reaction cascades leading to substantial chemical complexity, bypassing previously hypothesized, more restrictive energy barriers. We quantify the diffusion kinetics and incorporate these parameters into a comprehensive astrochemical model. The model successfully reproduces observed abundances of key interstellar COMs, providing a robust, non-energetic formation pathway that operates under typical dark cloud conditions. This work redefines our understanding of carbon reactivity in interstellar ices, establishing thermally activated carbon diffusion as a pivotal and universal mechanism for prebiotic chemistry in the cosmos.
