**Abstract**

Interstellar environments represent a critical, yet poorly understood, cradle for prebiotic chemistry. This study investigates the mechanistic pathways governing the formation of complex organic molecules within icy grain matrices, specifically focusing on the role of atomic carbon diffusion. Utilizing computational modeling and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that elevated temperatures (≥22 K) induce significant carbon diffusion across interstellar ice grains. Critically, this enhanced diffusion facilitates C–C bond formation, yielding a cascade of increasingly complex organic species. Furthermore, photostimulated desorption events, driven by interstellar radiation, selectively remove these nascent molecules, promoting their delivery into the surrounding gas phase.  These findings suggest that carbon diffusion on ice surfaces is a dominant process in interstellar chemistry, substantially contributing to the observed abundance of simple and complex organic molecules, and therefore provides a compelling framework for understanding the delivery of building blocks for life throughout the cosmos.
