**Abstract: Experimental Determination of Carbon Atom Surface Diffusion Activation Energies in Interstellar Ice Analogs and Implications for Organic Complexity**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments remains a central challenge in astrochemistry. While gas-phase reactions are well-studied, the role of surface chemistry on interstellar ice grains – particularly the incorporation of atomic carbon – is increasingly recognized as a crucial pathway to molecular complexity. This study presents experimental measurements of the activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>) for carbon atom (C) surface diffusion on astrophysically relevant ice analogs composed of frozen water (H<sub>2</sub>O) at 10 K. Using Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD) coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry, we monitored the desorption kinetics of C atoms dosed onto H<sub>2</sub>O ice films. Analysis of the TPD profiles yielded an E<sub>a</sub> of 0.55 ± 0.08 eV, significantly lower than previously estimated values based on theoretical models.  This finding suggests that C atoms exhibit unexpectedly facile diffusion within these icy matrices.  The observed low activation energy strongly supports the hypothesis that surface diffusion of atomic carbon facilitates C-C bond formation events, providing a key mechanism for the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other complex organic species in cold, dense molecular clouds. Further investigations exploring the influence of ice composition (e.g., inclusion of CO, CH<sub>3</sub>OH) on C atom diffusion are warranted to refine our understanding of interstellar organic synthesis.
