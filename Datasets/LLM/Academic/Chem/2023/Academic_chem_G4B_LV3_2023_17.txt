**Abstract**

Interstellar environments represent a crucial, yet poorly understood, genesis point for complex organic molecules. This study investigates the mechanistic role of carbon diffusion on interstellar ice grains, specifically at temperatures exceeding 22 K, in facilitating the formation of prebiotic compounds. Utilizing computational modeling coupled with spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that the thermally-activated diffusion of carbon atoms across ice surfaces promotes localized carbon-carbon bond formation.  Crucially, this process is significantly enhanced by photostimulated desorption events, which generate reactive carbon species and lower activation energies for subsequent bonding.  The observed carbon diffusion pathways suggest a prevalent mechanism for the synthesis of simple aromatic hydrocarbons and, potentially, larger, more complex organic molecules within the interstellar medium.  These findings contribute substantially to current theories regarding the delivery of building blocks for life and provide a framework for future investigations into the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks and interstellar clouds.
