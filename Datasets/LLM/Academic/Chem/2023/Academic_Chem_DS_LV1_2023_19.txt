**Title:** Programmable Heteroleptic Assembly of Low-Symmetry Pd(II) Cages via Complementary Ancillary Ligand Pairings

**Abstract:**

The construction of discrete heteroleptic coordination cages with precise positional control over multiple, chemically distinct ligands represents a significant challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Traditional self-assembly strategies, often reliant on high-symmetry building blocks, yield limited structural complexity. Herein, we report a rational design strategy for the synthesis of intricate heteroleptic Pd(II) cages incorporating four different low-symmetry, ditopic ligands. Our approach leverages the principle of steric and electronic complementarity to predefine a set of orthogonal ancillary pairings. By employing a systematic library of unsymmetrical pyridyl-carboxylate ligands with divergent binding angles and steric profiles, we demonstrate that specific ligand combinations undergo integrative self-assembly with Pd(II) ions to form a single, highly complex architecture. Characterization by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction confirms the formation of the target heteroleptic cages with exceptional fidelity and the absence of homoleptic byproducts. This methodology, which provides unprecedented control over the spatial arrangement of functional groups within a three-dimensional scaffold, establishes a new paradigm for the bottom-up fabrication of multifunctional molecular materials for applications in catalysis and selective guest encapsulation.
