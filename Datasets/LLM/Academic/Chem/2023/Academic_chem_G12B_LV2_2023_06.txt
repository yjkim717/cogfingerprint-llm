**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a fundamental question in astrochemistry. While gas-phase synthesis pathways are well-studied, the role of icy grain surfaces as reaction platforms remains a crucial area of investigation. This research presents experimental findings concerning the surface diffusion of individual carbon atoms (C) on astrophysically relevant interstellar ice analogs, specifically frozen water ice at cryogenic temperatures (8 K). Utilizing Reflection-Apparent Angle Correlation Spectroscopy (RACS), we directly measured the diffusion coefficient (D) of C atoms over a range of time scales, providing quantitative data on their mobility within the ice matrix. Our results demonstrate a surprisingly high diffusion coefficient, indicating efficient atomic migration despite the low temperatures. This enhanced mobility is attributed to the presence of pre-existing defects and hydroxyl groups within the ice structure, facilitating C atom hopping. We propose that this facile surface diffusion significantly lowers the activation energy required for carbon atom incorporation into existing organic species, thereby promoting the formation of larger, more complex molecules. Consequently, these findings support a model wherein surface diffusion of atomic carbon plays a key role in the observed abundance of COMs in interstellar ices, offering a pathway complementary to gas-phase reactions. Further investigations focusing on the influence of ice composition and varying irradiation conditions are warranted to fully elucidate the complexity of interstellar organic chemistry.

**Notes and Potential Expansions:**

*   **Specific Ice Analog:** The abstract currently refers to "frozen water ice." A more specific ice analog (e.g., H₂O, H₂O:CO, H₂O:CH₃OH) would strengthen the abstract if known.
*   **RACS Detail:** Briefly explaining *why* RACS is suitable for this measurement (e.g., "allowing for time-resolved observation of atomic motion") would add clarity, although keeping it concise is important.
*   **Quantitative Value:** Including a specific value for the diffusion coefficient (e.g., "with a measured D of X cm²/s") would make the results more impactful.
*   **Activation Energy Estimation:** If the study provided an estimated activation energy, incorporating that value would be valuable.
*   **Irradiation Conditions:** Mentioning whether the experiments were conducted under irradiation (UV, cosmic rays) or in the dark would be relevant, as this dramatically impacts surface chemistry.
*   **Future Work:** Expanding on the "further investigations" section with specific research directions (e.g., studying the effect of grain size, temperature gradients) would reinforce the study's significance and potential.
*   **Citation of Related Work:** In a real abstract, you'd include citations to key prior works in interstellar organic chemistry and surface diffusion.
