**Abstract: Surface Diffusion as a Catalyst for Complex Organic Molecule Formation in Interstellar Ice Matrices**

The prevailing paradigms of interstellar chemistry often struggle to fully account for the observed ubiquity of complex organic molecules (COMs) within molecular clouds. This research posits that surface diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice surfaces, significantly enhanced at temperatures above 22K, represents a critical, hitherto underappreciated mechanism driving the formation of these intricate structures. Utilizing a theoretical framework incorporating kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that localized carbon atom mobility, facilitated by the heterogeneous nature of ice grain boundaries and porosity, promotes condensation and subsequent polymerization reactions. 

Specifically, our model reveals a pronounced increase in the probability of carbon atoms encountering reactive sites, leading to the stepwise assembly of increasingly complex molecular precursors. These precursors, including glycolaldehyde and formyl formate, are identified as key intermediates in the formation of larger, more elaborate organic compounds.  The observed temperature dependence of surface diffusion rates directly correlates with the observed chemical complexity, providing a nuanced understanding of the environmental factors governing interstellar chemical evolution.  This study suggests that icy grain surfaces serve as dynamic reaction zones, fundamentally altering the pathways and efficiencies of COM synthesis within the interstellar medium, and warrants further investigation utilizing observational data to constrain surface properties and diffusion models.
