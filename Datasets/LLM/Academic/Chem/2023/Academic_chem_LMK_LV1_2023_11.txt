Title: Strategic Design of Heteroleptic Palladium(II) Cages via Ancillary Pairings: Expanding Metallo-Supramolecular Complexity

Abstract:

The development of metallo-supramolecular assemblies with predefined structures and properties remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a novel strategy for constructing complex heteroleptic palladium(II) cages by exploiting ancillary complementary ligand pairings. By carefully selecting low-symmetry ligands with tailored ancillary interactions, we demonstrate the formation of discrete heteroleptic assemblies with enhanced structural complexity. The judicious choice of ligand pairings enables the precise control over the resulting cage architectures, allowing for the generation of novel topologies. This approach leverages the synergy between coordination-driven self-assembly and ancillary interactions to access previously inaccessible metallo-supramolecular assemblies. The reported methodology provides a versatile platform for the design of sophisticated heteroleptic cages, underscoring the potential of ancillary pairings in metallo-supramolecular chemistry. Our findings offer new avenues for the development of complex supramolecular architectures with tailored properties.
