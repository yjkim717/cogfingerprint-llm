Title: Strategic Assembly of Heteroleptic Palladium(II) Cages via Complementary Ancillary Ligand Pairings

Abstract:
The strategic exploitation of metallo-supramolecular chemistry principles has enabled the development of a novel methodology for constructing complex heteroleptic palladium(II) cages. By harnessing the potential of low-symmetry ligands and judiciously selected ancillary ligand pairings, we demonstrate a versatile approach to accessing these intricate architectures. The presented methodology leverages the complementary interactions between specifically designed ligand pairs, thereby facilitating the assembly of heteroleptic palladium(II) cages with enhanced structural diversity. Through a systematic investigation of ancillary ligand pairings, we establish a robust framework for predicting and controlling the resulting supramolecular structures. This advancement significantly expands the repertoire of accessible palladium(II) cages, offering new opportunities for applications in catalysis, molecular recognition, and materials science. The findings underscore the power of rational design in metallo-supramolecular chemistry, paving the way for further innovations in the field (2023).
