**Abstract**

Recent advances in metallo-supramolecular chemistry have focused on the construction of complex coordination architectures with tailored functionalities. This study presents a strategy for the de novo synthesis of palladium(II) lantern cages exhibiting heteroleptic coordination environments. By employing specifically designed ancillary ligand pairings, we demonstrate precise control over the positional and orientational arrangement of ligands possessing diverse binding modes. This approach circumvents limitations associated with traditional cage synthesis, enabling the creation of low-symmetry assemblies with potentially unique properties. The resultant heteroleptic Pd(II) cages represent a significant development, opening avenues for investigating structure-property relationships and exploring applications in catalysis and molecular recognition.
