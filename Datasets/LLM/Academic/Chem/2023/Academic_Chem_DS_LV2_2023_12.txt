**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, operating at the nexus of molecular physics and quantum optics, has emerged as a transformative paradigm for controlling chemical reactivity and material properties. By confining molecules inside optical cavities, hybrid light-matter quasiparticles known as polaritons are formed, enabling the manipulation of potential energy landscapes in a non-invasive manner. This review synthesizes and critically evaluates the pivotal theoretical and computational advances that have shaped our understanding of these complex quantum phenomena. A central focus is placed on the development of *ab initio* quantum electrodynamics (QED) methods, which provide a first-principles framework for describing strong light-matter interactions beyond simplistic model Hamiltonians. We meticulously address the critical challenge of gauge invariance in molecular cavity QED, comparing the Coulomb, dipole, and multipolar gauges, and resolving how gauge choices impact the convergence and physical interpretation of computational results. The discussion extends to the dynamical consequences of these interactions, exploring how the formation of vibrational and electronic polaritons can selectively suppress or enhance reaction rates, alter product branching ratios, and facilitate long-range energy transfer. By bridging conceptual breakthroughs with practical computational methodologies, this work not only clarifies the foundational principles of polariton chemistry but also charts a course for its future application in photochemistry, quantum control, and the design of novel quantum materials.
