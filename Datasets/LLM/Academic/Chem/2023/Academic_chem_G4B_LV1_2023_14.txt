**Abstract: Surface Diffusion and the Genesis of Complex Organic Molecules in Interstellar Ice**

The prevalence of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar space remains a fundamental puzzle in astrochemistry. This research posits that surface diffusion of carbon atoms on icy grain surfaces represents a critical, hitherto underappreciated, mechanism for their formation. Utilizing a kinetic model incorporating radiative ice grain temperatures and simplified diffusion coefficients, we simulate the evolution of carbon distribution across icy grain interfaces. Our simulations reveal that localized carbon atom concentration, facilitated by thermally-induced surface diffusion, promotes the stepwise polymerization of reactive intermediates – formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide – into larger, more complex molecular fragments. 

These nascent organic species are then preferentially shielded from destructive UV radiation within the grain’s porous structure.  The resulting distribution of these precursors suggests a significant contribution to the observed abundance of COMs.  Further investigation, incorporating spectroscopic data, is warranted to validate these findings and refine our understanding of the chemical pathways operative in the interstellar medium, specifically focusing on the role of ice grain surfaces as nascent chemical reactors in 2023.
