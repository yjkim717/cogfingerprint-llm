**Abstract:**

Recent advances in metallosupramolecular chemistry have increasingly leveraged palladium(II) complexes to generate intricate, architecturally defined structures. This study reports a refined methodology for constructing heteroleptic palladium(II) cages, prioritizing precise ligand control through ancillary ligand pairings. Utilizing low-symmetry ligands – specifically, those exhibiting diverse denticity and hydrogen bonding potential – we achieved the successful synthesis of a novel cage architecture incorporating four distinct ligand types. The strategic selection of ancillary ligands facilitates a nuanced interplay of steric and electronic effects, directing the self-assembly process.  These heteroleptic assemblies demonstrate enhanced stability and exhibit a reduced symmetry compared to previously reported palladium cages.  Further investigation into the conformational dynamics and potential applications of these complex metallosupramolecular systems is warranted, contributing to a deeper understanding of ligand-directed metallo-organization in 2023.
