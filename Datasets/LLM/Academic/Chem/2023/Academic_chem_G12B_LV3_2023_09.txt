**Abstract**

Recent experimental studies probing the dynamics of carbon diffusion on interstellar ice analogs have yielded critical insights into the chemical evolution of complex organic molecules in astrophysical environments. This work investigates the observed low activation energy (88 meV) for carbon atom diffusion, demonstrating its profound implications for C-C bond formation within these cold, dense media. Our findings suggest that this facile carbon mobility significantly lowers the kinetic barriers associated with the synthesis of increasingly complex organic species on ice surfaces, a process considered pivotal in the prebiotic chemistry of star-forming regions. These results refine current models of interstellar chemistry, highlighting the potential for efficient organic molecule assembly even at extremely low temperatures. The observed activation energy provides a crucial parameter for refining astrochemical models and furthering our understanding of the origin and distribution of organic matter throughout the Universe (2023).
