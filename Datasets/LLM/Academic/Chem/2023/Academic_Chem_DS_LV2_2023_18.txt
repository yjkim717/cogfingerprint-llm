Of particular significance in the field of astrochemistry is the formation pathway of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium. While molecular ices are known reservoirs of chemical complexity, the mechanisms facilitating the synthesis of larger, carbon-bearing species have remained inadequately constrained. This investigation elucidates a critical, non-energetic process for carbon backbone assembly: the thermally activated surface diffusion of atomic carbon on interstellar ice analogues. Through a series of temperature-programmed desorption and reactive scattering experiments, we demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on water-dominated ice surfaces at temperatures exceeding 22 K. This mobility is a prerequisite for the atoms to encounter and react with other carbon-containing radicals and precursor molecules co-adsorbed on the grain mantle. Our results provide direct experimental evidence that this diffusion-mediated process efficiently drives the formation of new carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds, a fundamental step in molecular complexity. We posit that this previously overlooked mechanism is a dominant pathway in cold interstellar environments, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of prebiotic chemical evolution and the molecular inventory available to nascent planetary systems.
