The COVID-19 pandemic continues to necessitate novel therapeutic strategies targeting essential viral enzymes. This investigation evaluates the anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential of diphenyl diselenide ((PhSe)₂), an organoselenium compound, through computational and biochemical approaches. We demonstrate that (PhSe)₂ exhibits dual inhibitory activity against the viral main protease (Mᵖʳᵒ) and papain-like protease (PLᵖʳᵒ). Molecular dynamics simulations, conducted over 200 ns, reveal that the compound engages in stable non-covalent interactions within the catalytic dyad of Mᵖʳᵒ. Concurrently, mass spectrometry and enzymatic assays confirm a covalent modification mechanism, wherein the selenium-selenium bond undergoes nucleophilic attack by the catalytic cysteine thiol, forming a stable selenenylsulfide adduct. This dual-mode action effectively disrupts the proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein, a critical step in viral replication. Our findings, obtained in 2023, position diphenyl diselenide as a promising lead scaffold for developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents, highlighting the therapeutic relevance of organoselenium chemistry in combating coronaviruses.
