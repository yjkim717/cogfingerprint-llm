Title: Advances in Polariton Chemistry: Unveiling the Interplay between Quantum Electrodynamics and Photochemical Processes

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has witnessed significant theoretical advancements in recent years, driven by the intricate interplay between quantum electrodynamics and light-matter interactions. This review aims to summarize the key developments in molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics, with a particular emphasis on the emerging paradigm of vibrational strong coupling. By scrutinizing the theoretical frameworks underpinning polariton chemistry, we elucidate the complex mechanisms governing the modification of photochemical processes under strong coupling conditions.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the hybridization of molecular excitations with cavity modes can profoundly impact the potential energy landscapes of chemical reactions, thereby influencing reaction rates and pathways. The vibrational strong coupling regime, in particular, has been shown to enable the manipulation of molecular reactivity through the modulation of vibrational modes. Our analysis highlights the crucial role of quantum fluctuations and non-adiabatic effects in mediating the observed phenomena.

Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for the development of novel polaritonic materials and the control of photochemical processes. The integration of quantum electrodynamics with molecular quantum mechanics has enabled a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between light, matter, and chemical reactivity. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical advances in polariton chemistry, underscoring the potential of this field to revolutionize our understanding of photochemical processes and inspire innovative applications in chemistry and materials science. As research in this area continues to evolve, we anticipate that the insights garnered from polariton chemistry will have far-reaching implications for the development of novel technologies and materials.
