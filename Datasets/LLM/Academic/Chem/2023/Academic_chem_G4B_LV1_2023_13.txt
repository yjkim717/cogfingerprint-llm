**Abstract: Surface Diffusion and the Genesis of Complex Organic Molecules in Interstellar Ice Grains â€“ A Mechanistic Perspective**

The prevalence of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar space remains a fundamental puzzle in astrochemistry. This work proposes a mechanistic framework wherein carbon atom diffusion on icy grain surfaces emerges as a critical intermediary process in their formation. Utilizing advanced molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the kinetics of carbon diffusion within a model interstellar ice analogue, incorporating vibrational and rotational constraints. Our findings reveal that thermally activated surface diffusion, facilitated by grain morphology and ice crystallinity, significantly enhances the concentration of mobile carbon atoms. Subsequently, these mobile species readily participate in condensation and subsequent chemical reactions, leading to the observed formation of simple and, potentially, more complex organic monomers.  The spatial confinement imposed by ice grains effectively promotes localized chemical synthesis.  This model suggests that the observed abundance of COMs is not solely dependent on interstellar gas-phase chemistry, but is intrinsically linked to the heterogeneous surface environment of interstellar ice grains, representing a pivotal stage in the chemical evolution of planetary systems and the broader interstellar medium.  Further research will focus on incorporating photochemistry within this framework.
