Title: Elucidating the Role of Carbon Atom Diffusion in the Formation of Complex Organic Molecules on Interstellar Ice Surfaces

Abstract:

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a topic of significant interest in astrochemistry. Recent studies have highlighted the crucial role of surface diffusion in facilitating chemical reactions on interstellar ice surfaces. Here, we investigate the diffusion of carbon atoms on these surfaces and its implications for COM formation. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that carbon atom diffusion on amorphous water ice surfaces is a facile process, occurring with a relatively low activation energy barrier. Our results show that the mobility of carbon atoms enables the formation of C-C bonds, a crucial step in the synthesis of COMs. Furthermore, we find that the presence of other surface species, such as H and O atoms, influences the diffusion dynamics of carbon atoms, thereby affecting the chemical complexity of the resulting COMs. This study provides new insights into the mechanistic details of COM formation on interstellar ice surfaces, shedding light on the origins of chemical complexity in the interstellar medium.
