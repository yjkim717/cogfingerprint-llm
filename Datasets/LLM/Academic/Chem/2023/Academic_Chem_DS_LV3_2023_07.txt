Herein, we report a transformative ancillary pairings strategy for the modular construction of heteroleptic Pd(II) lantern-shaped cages, a significant advancement in metallo-supramolecular chemistry. Traditional self-assembly with low-symmetry ligands often yields statistical isomer mixtures, precluding precise structural control. Our methodology overcomes this limitation by employing four distinct, judiciously designed low-symmetry ligands that engage in specific, complementary interactions. This design enforces a programmed assembly pathway, guiding the formation of a single, discrete supramolecular architecture. Crucially, this approach affords unprecedented control over both the positional arrangement and the three-dimensional orientation of each ligand within the final cage framework, a feat previously unattainable in complex heteroleptic systems. Spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses unambiguously confirm the high-fidelity assembly and the defined spatial organization of the components. This work establishes a new paradigm for constructing intricate, multi-component metallo-supramolecular assemblies with atomic-level precision, opening avenues for developing sophisticated functional materials with tailored properties for catalysis, molecular recognition, and beyond.
