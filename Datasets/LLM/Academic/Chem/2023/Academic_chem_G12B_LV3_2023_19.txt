**Abstract:**

The burgeoning field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry continues to drive innovation in the construction of complex molecular architectures. This study reports a refined synthetic strategy for the generation of palladium(II) supramolecular cages exhibiting unprecedented structural complexity. By strategically employing heteroleptic ligand pairings, we demonstrate precise control over the positional and orientational arrangement of low-symmetry ligands within the coordination sphere. This approach culminates in the successful self-assembly of a novel lantern-shaped cage incorporating four distinct ligand functionalities. The methodology presented expands the toolkit for constructing well-defined, multinuclear assemblies and provides a platform for exploring emergent properties arising from tailored ligand environments. Future work will focus on incorporating functional groups within these cages to enable catalytic applications and sensing capabilities.
