**Abstract**

Recent advancements in supramolecular chemistry have increasingly leveraged ligand pairing strategies to dictate the architecture of metal-organic frameworks. This study reports a novel methodology for constructing intricate, low-symmetry Pd(II) cage structures, employing a carefully orchestrated ancillary ligand pairing approach. Utilizing specifically designed low-symmetry ligands, we achieved precise control over both the positional arrangement and relative orientation of metal centers, resulting in the formation of lantern-shaped complexes exhibiting significant structural complexity. The observed heteroleptic assembly demonstrates a compelling strategy for generating metallacycles with tailored geometries.  These results highlight the potential of this technique to expand the accessible structural diversity within Pd(II) chemistry and offer a pathway toward the rational design of supramolecular assemblies with applications in catalysis and sensing. Further investigation will explore the influence of ligand modifications on cage stability and functionality.
