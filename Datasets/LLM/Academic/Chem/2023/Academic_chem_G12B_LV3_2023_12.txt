**Abstract:**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry represents a novel frontier in chemical reaction control and simulation, leveraging the principles of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (MCQD) and strong light-matter coupling. This review synthesizes recent theoretical developments in this area, highlighting the interplay between quantum optics and chemical kinetics. Traditional photochemical processes are fundamentally altered when molecules are embedded within optical microcavities, leading to the formation of polaritons â€“ hybrid quasiparticles arising from the coherent coupling of molecular excitons and cavity photons. In 2023, significant progress has been made in *ab initio* quantum electrodynamics (QED) methodologies capable of accurately describing these complex light-matter interactions at the molecular level. These advancements include refined computational frameworks incorporating multi-configurational approaches and time-dependent density functional theory within the QED formalism.

We critically examine current computational techniques for modeling polariton-mediated photochemistry, addressing challenges related to the accurate treatment of many-body effects and the efficient simulation of dynamic processes. The review further explores several emerging applications, including the enhanced efficiency of photocatalysis, the realization of novel quantum chemical reactions, and the potential for controlling reaction pathways through tailored light fields. Specifically, we discuss the impact of polariton condensation on reaction rates and product selectivity, and the development of strategies for manipulating polariton lifetimes and spatial distributions to achieve desired chemical outcomes. Finally, we outline key outstanding challenges, such as the incorporation of environmental effects (temperature, solvent) and the scalability of current computational methods to larger, more complex molecular systems. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for realizing the full potential of polariton chemistry in the design of advanced materials and chemical processes.
