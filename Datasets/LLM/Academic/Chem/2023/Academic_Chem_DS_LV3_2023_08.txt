**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, situated at the confluence of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and theoretical chemistry, has emerged as a transformative paradigm for manipulating chemical reactivity. By confining molecules within optical cavities to engender strong light-matter coupling, hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons are formed, possessing novel energy landscapes distinct from their bare molecular counterparts. This 2023 review synthesizes pivotal theoretical advances that underpin this discipline, with a particular focus on resolving the critical challenge of gauge ambiguities in _ab initio_ QED methodologies. The arbitrary choice between the Coulomb gauge and the dipole gauge in the construction of model Hamiltonians has historically led to starkly different predictions for physical observables, thereby impeding the development of a robust, predictive theoretical framework. We systematically dissect recent progress in formulating gauge-invariant approaches, demonstrating how these developments reconcile previous discrepancies and provide a unified, first-principles description of quantum light-matter interactions under strong coupling.

Building upon this foundational clarity, we survey the expanding repertoire of _ab initio_ QED computational methods, including cavity-born modifications to density functional theory and wavefunction-based approaches, which now enable the accurate simulation of complex molecular systems in cavities. The core of our discussion pivots to the profound implications of these theoretical tools for controlling chemical dynamics. We critically examine proposed mechanisms through which polariton formation can selectively influence both photochemical pathways, such as energy transfer and isomerization, and, more remarkably, ground-state chemical reactions that proceed in the absence of optical excitation. This includes the manipulation of reaction rates and product branching ratios by altering vibrational energy redistribution and quantum tunneling probabilities. By integrating the resolution of fundamental theoretical challenges with a forward-looking perspective on computational design, this review establishes a consolidated framework for harnessing cavity QED as a versatile and precise tool for the next generation of quantum-controlled chemistry.
