**Abstract**

Interstellar environments represent a critical, yet poorly understood, cradle for complex organic molecule synthesis. This study investigates the role of surface diffusion in carbon chemistry on interstellar ice grains, specifically examining the temperature dependence of C–C bond formation. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic modeling and incorporating kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that carbon diffusion, most effectively above 22 K, is a primary driver of molecular complexity.  The observed enhanced diffusion rates facilitate the interconnected formation of extended carbon chains, ultimately leading to the observed prevalence of larger, structurally diverse organic molecules within translucent molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.  Furthermore, our results suggest that ice grain morphology, influencing surface area and diffusion pathways, plays a modulating role in this process.  These findings underscore the importance of surface chemistry in prebiotic processes and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the chemical evolution of star-forming regions, with implications for astrobiology and the potential for life’s origins.
