**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments remains a central challenge in astrochemistry. Recent experimental investigations reveal a previously underestimated pathway for carbon incorporation into these molecules: surface diffusion of atomic carbon on interstellar ice analogs. This study, conducted in 2023, presents direct evidence demonstrating efficient carbon diffusion across amorphous ice surfaces at cryogenic temperatures as low as 22 K. Utilizing ultra-high vacuum techniques and temperature-programmed desorption analysis, we observed significant carbon mobility, facilitating the formation of carbon-carbon bonds and subsequently, larger organic species. These findings underscore the crucial role of carbon diffusion in enhancing molecular complexity within translucent clouds and protoplanetary disks, contributing to the observed abundance of organic molecules. The observed activation energy for carbon diffusion suggests a facile process, potentially accelerating the synthesis of complex hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) under interstellar conditions. This research highlights the importance of surface processes in driving interstellar chemistry and refining models of prebiotic molecule formation.
