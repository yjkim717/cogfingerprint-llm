Title: Strategic Assembly of Heteroleptic Palladium(II) Cages via Low-Symmetry Ligands: Control over Positional and Orientational Isomerism

Abstract:
The synthesis of heteroleptic metallo-supramolecular assemblies with predefined structural attributes remains a significant challenge in the field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry. Herein, we report a novel strategy for the construction of complex palladium(II) cages utilizing low-symmetry ligands, thereby achieving positional and orientational control. By judiciously selecting ancillary ligand pairings, we demonstrate the formation of heteroleptic assemblies with high fidelity. The approach leverages the subtle interplay between ligand design and metal coordination geometry to dictate the resulting cage architecture. Our findings underscore the potential of low-symmetry ligands in metallo-supramolecular chemistry, enabling the synthesis of intricate structures with enhanced complexity. The presented methodology offers a versatile platform for the rational design of heteroleptic assemblies, paving the way for further advancements in the field. This work represents a significant step forward in the controlled assembly of complex supramolecular architectures. (2023)
