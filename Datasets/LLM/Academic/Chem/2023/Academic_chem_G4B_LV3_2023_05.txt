**Abstract**

Interstellar chemistry represents a critical frontier in understanding the origins of complex organic molecules. Recent investigations utilizing cryogenic techniques have revealed a pivotal role for carbon diffusion on icy grain surfaces within the interstellar medium. Specifically, this study demonstrates that at temperatures exceeding 22 K, the facilitated movement of carbon atoms induces a cascade of C–C bond formations, leading to the genesis of increasingly complex organic structures.  Photostimulated desorption events, acting as a catalytic mechanism, are hypothesized to accelerate this process.  These findings challenge prevailing models of interstellar chemical evolution, suggesting a more dynamic and spatially-dependent pathway for prebiotic molecule synthesis than previously conceived.  Further research, incorporating detailed spectroscopic analysis of these evolved species, is warranted to fully elucidate the prevalence and diversity of these carbon-rich intermediates within interstellar dust clouds, ultimately informing our understanding of the potential for life’s building blocks to arise in space.
