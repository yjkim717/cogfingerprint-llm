**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, situated at the confluence of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum light-matter interactions, represents a paradigm shift for controlling chemical reactivity and material properties. This 2023 review synthesizes the foundational theoretical frameworks underpinning this discipline, critically examining the transition from phenomenological models to *ab initio* QED methodologies. A central challenge addressed is the resolution of gauge ambiguities inherent in the quantization of the electromagnetic field within molecular cavities, which has historically complicated the formulation of a universally consistent Hamiltonian for strongly coupled systems. We systematically delineate the theoretical progress in constructing gauge-invariant frameworks that accurately describe the hybridized light-matter states—polaritons—and their non-adiabatic dynamics.

Concurrently, the review surveys the rapid evolution of computational techniques designed for *ab initio* QED simulations, which are indispensable for bridging theory with experimental observations. These methods, ranging from quantum electrodynamical density functional theory to wavefunction-based approaches, now enable the first-principles prediction of polaritonic potential energy surfaces and the ensuing modifications to chemical pathways. Despite these advances, a significant challenge persists in fully explaining the dramatic effects of vibrational strong coupling on ground-state chemical reactions observed in experimental settings. The discrepancy between theoretical predictions and empirical data highlights critical gaps in our understanding of collective effects, dissipation mechanisms, and the role of disorder in complex molecular ensembles. This work not only consolidates the current state of molecular cavity QED but also identifies these unresolved questions as the primary frontier for future research, aiming to establish a predictive and computationally tractable theory for quantum-enhanced chemistry.
