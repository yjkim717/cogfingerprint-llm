Title: Investigating the Catalytic Activity of Novel Transition Metal Complexes in Cross-Coupling Reactions

Abstract:

In 2023, the development of efficient catalysts for cross-coupling reactions remains a crucial aspect of modern organic synthesis. This study focuses on the design, synthesis, and characterization of novel transition metal complexes bearing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands. The complexes were evaluated for their catalytic activity in Suzuki-Miyaura and Heck-Mizoroki cross-coupling reactions. A series of palladium(II) and nickel(II) complexes with varying NHC ligand architectures were synthesized using a modular approach, allowing for systematic tuning of steric and electronic properties. The complexes were characterized using a range of spectroscopic and crystallographic techniques, including multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Catalytic activity was assessed using a model Suzuki-Miyaura reaction between phenylboronic acid and 4-bromoacetophenone, with the palladium(II) complexes exhibiting superior activity and selectivity compared to their nickel(II) counterparts. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to rationalize the observed trends in catalytic activity, highlighting the importance of ligand steric effects and metal-ligand cooperativity. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the design of next-generation catalysts for cross-coupling reactions, with potential applications in the synthesis of complex molecules and pharmaceuticals.
