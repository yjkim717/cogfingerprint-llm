**Abstract**

The construction of well-defined metallosupramolecular architectures remains a significant challenge in coordination chemistry. This study reports a novel approach leveraging ancillary ligand pairings to generate intricate, heteroleptic Pd(II) cage complexes exhibiting low symmetry and enhanced structural control. Utilizing low-symmetry ligands, we implemented an ancillary pairings strategy to dictate the assembly of palladium centers into lantern-shaped cages. These cages demonstrate a high degree of positional and orientational precision, achievable through strategic selection and coordination of complementary ligand functionalities. 

The resultant structures represent a departure from traditional templated synthesis, instead relying on the cooperative interactions between ligand pairs to direct self-assembly. Spectroscopic and crystallographic data confirm the formation of discrete, complex architectures, showcasing the versatility of this methodology.  This work contributes to the burgeoning field of metallosupramolecular chemistry by providing a robust and adaptable technique for generating sophisticated palladium-based metalloassemblies with tailored geometries. Future research will focus on exploring the incorporation of additional functionalities within these cage frameworks.
