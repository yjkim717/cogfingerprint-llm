**Emergent Dynamics at the Quantum Interface: A Computational Perspective on Polariton Chemistry and Molecular Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of chemical reactivity, bridging the traditionally disparate domains of quantum optics and molecular dynamics. This review examines recent computational advancements enabling the theoretical exploration of light-matter interactions within molecular systems confined within optical cavities, hereafter referred to as molecular cavity QED. Building upon the foundational principles of quantum electrodynamics (QED), we delineate the evolving landscape of *ab initio* QED methodologies necessary to accurately model these complex phenomena, moving beyond semiclassical approximations that often fail to capture the essential quantum nature of light-matter coupling.

A central challenge lies in the efficient and accurate description of nonadiabatic excited state dynamics in the presence of strong light-matter coupling. We critically assess current approaches, including time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) augmented with QED corrections, multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) methods incorporating cavity fields, and novel trajectory-based approaches designed to handle the enhanced timescales and modified potential energy surfaces characteristic of polariton systems.  Specifically, we highlight the need for improved treatment of spontaneous emission and its impact on reaction pathways, often neglected in earlier theoretical frameworks.

This review surveys applications of these computational tools to a range of chemical processes, from photoinduced isomerization and energy transfer to catalytic reactions and the stabilization of transient intermediates. Case studies involving prototypical molecular systems, such as azobenzenes and donor-acceptor dyads, illustrate the qualitative and quantitative modifications to reaction rates and product distributions induced by polariton formation.  We further discuss how cavity QED can be leveraged to manipulate vibrational modes and electronic coherence, potentially enabling unprecedented control over chemical transformations.

Looking forward, we identify key areas for future research. These include the development of computationally efficient methods for treating large and complex molecular systems, the incorporation of environmental effects (e.g., solvent, temperature), and the exploration of novel cavity designs that can tailor light-matter interactions to specific chemical applications.  Ultimately, the ability to accurately simulate and predict polariton chemistry holds the promise of rationally designing novel photoactive materials and catalytic processes with enhanced efficiency and selectivity.
