**Abstract**

The chemical complexity observed in interstellar ices remains a significant challenge in astrochemistry. While gas-phase reactions are known to contribute to the formation of organic molecules in space, the role of surface chemistry on interstellar dust grains is increasingly recognized as crucial for facilitating reactions at the low temperatures characteristic of molecular clouds. This study presents experimental evidence demonstrating that surface diffusion of individual carbon atoms occurs at temperatures as low as 10 K, providing a novel pathway for carbon-carbon bond formation within interstellar ice analogs. Using ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and controlled deposition techniques, we observed the incorporation of atomic carbon onto pre-existing organic ices, leading to a measurable increase in molecular complexity. Specifically, we detected the formation of larger, more complex organic molecules directly attributable to the diffusion and subsequent reaction of carbon atoms.  Isotopic analysis confirmed the origin of the incorporated carbon.  These findings offer a compelling mechanism for the observed build-up of increasingly intricate organic structures within interstellar ices, circumventing kinetic barriers prevalent in the gas phase. The activation energy associated with this surface diffusion process was determined to be [insert value if available from the original text, otherwise omit], suggesting a relatively facile process even at cryogenic temperatures. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the chemical evolution of interstellar grains and the potential for the prebiotic synthesis of complex organic molecules in circumstellar environments.

**Notes on choices made and potential improvements:**

*   **Formal Tone:** I've used vocabulary and sentence structures appropriate for a peer-reviewed publication.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: problem/challenge, approach/method, results, interpretation/significance.
*   **Precise Terminology:** Terms like "interstellar ices," "UHV," "astrochemistry," and "kinetic barriers" are used accurately.
*   **Year Context (2023):** The abstract is written with the understanding that it represents current research.
*   **Placeholder:** I've included a placeholder for the activation energy value.  If that was included in the original text, *definitely* include it for more impact.
*   **Potential Expansion:** Depending on the full paper, you could add a brief mention of the specific ice composition used in the experiment (e.g., H2O, CH3OH).
