The development of sustainable catalytic systems for selective transformations remains a pivotal challenge in synthetic chemistry. Herein, we report the synthesis and application of ligand-free iridium nanoparticles (Ir NPs) as highly efficient catalysts for the regioselective hydrogenation of phosphine oxides under mild conditions. Advanced characterization techniques, including HAADF-STEM and XPS, confirm the formation of well-dispersed metallic Ir NPs with surface defects that serve as active sites. This catalytic system demonstrates exceptional selectivity in the hydrogenation of BINAP oxide derivatives, enabling direct access to H8-BINAP-type ligands without requiring protective groups or stoichiometric reagents. The catalyst exhibits remarkable stability and can be recycled over multiple runs without significant loss of activity. This methodology provides an atom-economical and environmentally benign alternative to conventional synthetic routes, offering new opportunities for the preparation of valuable chiral ligands in pharmaceutical and asymmetric catalysis applications.
