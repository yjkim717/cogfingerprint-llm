**Abstract:**

The emerging field of polariton chemistry represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of light-matter interactions, offering unprecedented opportunities to control and manipulate chemical processes. This review examines recent theoretical progress in molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (MCQD) and its application to polariton chemistry, reflecting developments through late 2023. We synthesize key *ab initio* quantum electrodynamics (QED) methodologies employed to model these complex systems, focusing on techniques capable of accurately describing strong and ultra-strong coupling regimes.  The review details applications spanning photochemical reactions, vibrational energy transfer, and the emergent control of molecular dynamics via coherent light-matter coupling.  Central to this analysis is the exploration of how polariton formation alters reaction pathways and efficiencies, leading to novel chemical transformations unattainable through conventional approaches.  However, significant challenges remain in reconciling theoretical predictions with experimental observations, particularly within the collective coupling regime where many-body effects become dominant. We critically assess current theoretical limitations and highlight future directions needed to fully realize the potential of polariton chemistry, including advancements in computational efficiency, improved treatment of dissipative effects, and the development of robust theoretical frameworks for accurately capturing the intricate interplay between molecular structure, quantum light fields, and chemical reactivity.
