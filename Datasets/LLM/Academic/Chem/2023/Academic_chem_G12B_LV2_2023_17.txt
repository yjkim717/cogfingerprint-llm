>Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, aiming for precision, structure, and appropriate terminology, suitable for a chemistry-related publication in 2023, based on your provided summary.  I've aimed for a word count around 230 words and included a bit of expansion to build a more compelling narrative.

**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments, a crucial step in the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks and potentially the origin of life, remains an area of active research. While gas-phase reactions are known to contribute to COM synthesis, the role of surface chemistry on icy grain mantles is increasingly recognized as a significant pathway, particularly at the low temperatures prevalent in these regions. This study experimentally investigates the surface diffusion of individual carbon atoms on amorphous water ice, a ubiquitous component of interstellar ices, at cryogenic temperatures (8-20 K). Utilizing Reflection-Absorption Infrared Spectroscopy (RAIRS), we directly measured the diffusion rates of incident carbon atoms and observed their subsequent incorporation into the ice matrix. Our results demonstrate that carbon atom diffusion exhibits a measurable rate even at these extremely low temperatures, indicating a readily available mechanism for atomic-scale transport.  We determined activation energies associated with this diffusion process, finding values consistent with hopping between surface sites facilitated by vibrational modes within the water ice lattice. This experimental evidence provides compelling support for a surface-mediated route to COM formation wherein adsorbed carbon atoms can migrate and react with pre-existing molecules, overcoming kinetic barriers to synthesize larger, more complex species. The findings have significant implications for models of interstellar organic chemistry and refine our understanding of the chemical complexity achievable under astrochemical conditions.
