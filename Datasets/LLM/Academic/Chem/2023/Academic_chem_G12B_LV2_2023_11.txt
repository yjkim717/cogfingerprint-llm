## Abstract: Directed Synthesis of Low-Symmetry Palladium(II) Cages via Ancillary Ligand Pairing

The burgeoning field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry increasingly demands sophisticated synthetic strategies to access complex, well-defined coordination architectures. This work presents a novel methodology for the construction of heteroleptic palladium(II) cages, leveraging strategic ancillary ligand pairings to achieve unprecedented control over both positional isomerism and ligand orientation. Departing from traditional approaches reliant on symmetry considerations, we demonstrate the directed assembly of these cages utilizing carefully selected ligand combinations that exploit subtle steric and electronic interactions. Specifically, the judicious choice of ancillary ligands allows for the preorganization of reaction components, facilitating the formation of low-symmetry cage structures that would otherwise be inaccessible. This approach expands the scope of palladium(II) cage chemistry beyond predominantly high-symmetry systems. Detailed characterization, including X-ray crystallography, confirms the structural integrity and unique ligand arrangement within the resulting assemblies. The demonstrated control over cage topology represents a significant advancement, potentially enabling the design of functional metallo-supramolecular systems with tailored properties for applications in catalysis, sensing, and materials science. This methodology, developed in 2023, opens new avenues for exploring the design space of metallo-supramolecular architectures and highlights the power of ancillary ligand design in directing self-assembly processes.
