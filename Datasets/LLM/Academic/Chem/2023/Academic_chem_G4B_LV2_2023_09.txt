**Abstract**

The prevalence of complex organic molecules (COMs) within interstellar space remains a fundamental challenge in astrochemistry. Traditionally, formation pathways have centered on circumstellar shocks and dense molecular clouds. This study introduces a novel mechanism – surface diffusion of carbon atoms on icy grain surfaces – as a significant contributor to COM genesis. Utilizing computational modeling and incorporating kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that localized heating of ice grains facilitates the unimpeded movement of carbon atoms, promoting the formation of reactive intermediates. 

Specifically, our simulations reveal that this surface diffusion process significantly enhances the probability of carbon-carbon bond formation, a critical step in the synthesis of larger organic fragments. Furthermore, we explore the influence of ice grain morphology and temperature on diffusion rates, highlighting the importance of heterogeneous surface environments.  The observed kinetics suggest that this mechanism can efficiently generate a diverse array of low-mass organic molecules, including precursors to amino acids and nucleobases.  

These findings provide a compelling alternative to prevailing models, suggesting that icy grains serve as dynamic chemical reactors within interstellar space.  Future research will focus on validating these simulations with observational data and investigating the influence of interstellar radiation fields on this critical surface chemistry process.  This work offers a refined understanding of the chemical landscape of the interstellar medium and its potential role in the origin of life.
