**Abstract**

Supramolecular chemistry continues to offer compelling routes toward the construction of intricate, architecturally defined metallacycles. This work reports the synthesis and characterization of novel, Pd(II)-based lantern-shaped cages, leveraging the strategic pairing of ancillary ligands to impart precise control over the assembly process. Utilizing low-symmetry ligands, we demonstrate a robust methodology for heteroleptic cage formation, specifically targeting enhanced positional and orientational selectivity. The selection of carefully chosen ligand combinations dictates the final cage topology, enabling the creation of structures with distinct geometric motifs.  Specifically, the incorporation of differing steric and electronic properties within the ancillary ligand set proved crucial in directing the Pd(II) coordination geometry.  These findings contribute significantly to the expanding field of supramolecular catalysis and highlight the potential of ligand pairing as a powerful tool for directing complex metallacycle synthesis. Further investigations will explore the catalytic applications of these newly synthesized cages.
