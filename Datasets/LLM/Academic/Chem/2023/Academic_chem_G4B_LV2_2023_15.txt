**Abstract**

The development of intricate metallosupramolecular architectures continues to drive innovation in coordination chemistry. This work reports a novel strategy for constructing highly defined palladium(II) cage complexes, leveraging ancillary ligand pairings and low-symmetry ligands to achieve precise control over structural geometry. Utilizing a pd(II) cage scaffold, we demonstrate the successful implementation of heteroleptic assembly, incorporating specifically designed ligands to dictate both positional and orientational fidelity. The selection of low-symmetry ligands proved critical in fostering the formation of lantern-shaped cages exhibiting enhanced stability and structural rigidity.  

Detailed analysis of the resulting complexes reveals the significant influence of ancillary ligand pairings on the final assembly, highlighting the potential for tailoring cage topology through strategic ligand selection. These findings contribute to a growing understanding of how subtle variations in ligand design can dramatically impact the self-assembly process.  Future research will focus on exploring the catalytic potential of these well-defined palladium(II) cages and investigating their applications in molecular recognition and sensing.
