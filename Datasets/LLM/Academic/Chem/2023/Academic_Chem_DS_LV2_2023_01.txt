Of particular significance in the field of astrochemistry is the formation pathway of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the frigid, radiation-processed environments of interstellar ice mantles. While the presence of such molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM) is well-documented, the mechanisms facilitating their synthesis under non-thermal, low-temperature conditions remain inadequately constrained. This investigation addresses this critical knowledge gap by examining the surface mobility of atomic carbon on amorphous solid water (ASW) ice analogues. Through a combination of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations, we demonstrate that carbon atoms exhibit significant surface diffusion at temperatures as low as 22 K. This mobility is a prerequisite for reactive encounters with other adsorbed species, such as CO, O, and H atoms. Crucially, our results provide direct experimental evidence that this diffusive behavior is the rate-limiting step for the formation of new carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds, a fundamental process in building molecular complexity. The identified diffusion-mediated pathway offers a robust, non-energetic explanation for the genesis of interstellar COMs, including precursors to prebiotic species, thereby fundamentally reshaping our understanding of chemical evolution in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks prior to the onset of star and planet formation.
