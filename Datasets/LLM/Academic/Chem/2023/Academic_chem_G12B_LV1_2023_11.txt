## Abstract: Directed Synthesis of Asymmetric Palladium(II) Supramolecular Cages via Ancillary Ligand Cooperativity

The burgeoning field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry increasingly demands strategies for the controlled construction of complex, non-traditional coordination architectures. While palladium(II) has proven a versatile metal for cage formation, achieving high levels of structural complexity and asymmetry remains a significant challenge. This study, conducted in 2023, reports a novel synthetic methodology leveraging tailored ancillary ligand pairings to direct the self-assembly of heteroleptic palladium(II) cages exhibiting defined positional and orientational control. We demonstrate that judicious selection of ancillary ligands, differing in steric profile and coordination preferences, induces a cascade of directed interactions leading to the formation of cages with unique structural motifs. Specifically, we explore the influence of distinct ancillary ligand combinations on the resulting cage geometry, observing a transition from more symmetric arrangements to highly asymmetric, low-symmetry structures. Characterization using X-ray crystallography and spectroscopic techniques confirms the successful synthesis and structural integrity of these novel assemblies. This approach, moving beyond traditional monodentate or bidentate ligand strategies, offers a powerful route to precisely engineer the topology and functionality of palladium(II) supramolecular architectures, potentially impacting areas such as catalysis, sensing, and materials science by enabling the design of bespoke metallo-cages with tailored properties. Future work will focus on expanding the scope of this methodology to incorporate reactive functionalities within the cage framework.
