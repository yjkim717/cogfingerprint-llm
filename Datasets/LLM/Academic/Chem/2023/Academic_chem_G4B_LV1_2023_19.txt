**Abstract**

The construction of complex three-dimensional architectures remains a significant challenge in supramolecular chemistry. This study reports the synthesis and characterization of a novel, palladium(II)-based cage structure, designated the ‘pd(ii) cage’, leveraging strategically designed ancillary ligand pairings to dictate its assembly. Utilizing low-symmetry ligands, we employed a heteroleptic approach to induce precise positional and orientational control during the self-assembly process. Computational modeling informed the selection of ligand combinations, predicting favorable coordination geometries and ultimately facilitating the formation of a lantern-shaped cage motif.  The resulting structure demonstrates a distinct lack of symmetry, indicative of the conformational freedom imposed by the ligand pairings.  Detailed spectroscopic analysis, including X-ray crystallography, confirms the successful formation of this intricate supramolecular assembly. This work highlights the potential of tailored ligand design to direct the formation of complex metallacycles, offering a valuable platform for exploring host-guest interactions and catalytic applications in 2023.
