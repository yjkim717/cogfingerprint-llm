Of particular significance in astrochemical research is the mechanism by which simple atomic and molecular precursors evolve into complex organic molecules (COMs) within the cold, dense environments of interstellar ices. While thermal diffusion of heavier species is largely inhibited at cryogenic temperatures, the mobility of light atoms remains a subject of active investigation. This study quantitatively examines the surface diffusion of atomic carbon on amorphous solid water ice, a key non-energetic formation pathway for interstellar COMs. Through a combination of laboratory-based temperature-programmed desorption experiments and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we determine that carbon atoms become mobile on ice surfaces at temperatures exceeding approximately 22 K. This mobility facilitates reactive encounters with other carbon atoms and organic radicals, enabling the formation of carbon-carbon (Câ€“C) bonds. The derived activation energy for diffusion is significantly lower than previously theorized, suggesting that carbon atom diffusion is a more prevalent and chemically significant process in molecular clouds than previously recognized. We conclude that this mechanism represents a fundamental, low-energy driver of molecular complexity, providing a robust non-energetic pathway for the synthesis of organic molecules in the interstellar medium.
