**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, a frontier of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), has unveiled novel pathways for manipulating chemical reactivity and material properties. By confining molecular ensembles within optical cavities, hybrid light-matter quasiparticles known as polaritons are formed, leading to the regime of vibrational strong coupling (VSC). This phenomenon enables the modification of potential energy surfaces and the opening of reaction channels inaccessible in free space, thereby offering a potent tool for quantum control of chemical dynamics. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this control are currently mired in a significant challenge: the gauge ambiguities inherent in the quantization of the electromagnetic field. The choice between the Coulomb gauge (dipole gauge) and the Poincar√© gauge (multipolar gauge) can lead to quantitatively and even qualitatively different predictions for physical observables, such as reaction rates under strong coupling, casting doubt on the robustness of proposed mechanisms. This review synthesizes recent theoretical advances aimed at resolving this foundational issue. We critically examine the fundamental frameworks of molecular cavity QED, highlighting the conditions under which gauge invariance is preserved and identifying common pitfalls in model Hamiltonians. Subsequently, we survey state-of-the-art *ab initio* and model-based computational methods that either enforce gauge invariance or provide a consistent physical picture across gauges. Finally, we discuss the implications of these refined theoretical models for interpreting experimental results and for the predictive design of cavity-modified chemical processes, charting a course toward a unified and reliable theoretical foundation for polariton chemistry.
