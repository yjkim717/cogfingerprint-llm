This investigation employs second harmonic scattering (SHS) to quantitatively probe the structural evolution of the electrical double layer (EDL) surrounding colloidal silica nanoparticles in aqueous electrolyte solutions. By systematically varying the ionic strength of the medium, we monitor the nonlinear optical response, which is exquisitely sensitive to the interfacial potential and the distribution of ions within the diffuse layer. Our SHS measurements reveal a non-monotonic dependence of the effective surface potential on electrolyte concentration, challenging classical mean-field predictions. The data indicate a significant compression of the diffuse layer and a concomitant restructuring of the Stern plane at elevated ionic strengths. These findings provide direct experimental evidence for specific ion effects and ion-correlation phenomena that are not captured by traditional Gouy-Chapman models. This work underscores the utility of SHS as a powerful, in-situ spectroscopic tool for resolving nanoscale electrostatic interfaces under physiologically relevant conditions, with implications for catalysis, energy storage, and biomolecular interactions.
