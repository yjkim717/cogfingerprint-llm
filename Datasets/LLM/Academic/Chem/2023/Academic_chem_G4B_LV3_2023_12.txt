**Abstract**

Recent theoretical investigations into polariton chemistry have unveiled novel pathways for manipulating molecular photochemical processes through sophisticated quantum electrodynamic (QED) simulations. This review synthesizes advancements in *ab initio* QED methodologies, specifically tailored to accurately model the intricate light-matter interactions within molecular cavities. We highlight the growing utility of these techniques in probing ground-state reaction dynamics and predicting modifications to photochemical pathways.  The emergent field of molecular cavity QED provides a framework for understanding collective coupling phenomena, where the quantum states of molecules and the surrounding electromagnetic field become inextricably linked. 

Specifically, we examine how tailored polariton states, arising from strong light-matter coupling, can be engineered to influence reaction rates and product distributions.  Computational studies demonstrate the potential for utilizing these coupled states to selectively enhance or suppress specific photochemical transitions.  Furthermore, the ability to perform *ab initio* QED calculations allows for a detailed assessment of the energy transfer mechanisms involved, providing crucial insights into the fundamental limits of molecular photochemistry.  Looking ahead, this research promises to accelerate the development of targeted photochemistry strategies, with implications ranging from advanced materials design to sustainable chemical synthesis.
