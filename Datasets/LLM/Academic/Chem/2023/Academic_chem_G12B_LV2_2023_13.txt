Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, aiming for precision, structure, and suitable terminology, based on your provided summary and set within a 2023 context. I've aimed for a word count around 214 words.  Following the abstract, I've included some notes on the choices I made and potential areas for expansion if more information were available.

**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar ices remains a fundamental challenge in astrochemistry. While gas-phase synthesis is well-studied, the role of surface reactions on interstellar dust grains is increasingly recognized as crucial for driving molecular complexity. This study experimentally investigates a pivotal step in this process: the surface diffusion of atomic carbon (C) on amorphous water ice (H₂O) at cryogenic temperatures relevant to interstellar conditions. Utilizing a modified ultra-high vacuum scanning tunneling microscope (UHV-STM) setup, we directly observed and quantified the diffusion kinetics of individual carbon atoms across the ice surface. Our measurements provide the first direct determination of the activation energy (Eₐ) for carbon diffusion on ice, yielding a value of [Insert Value Here - e.g., 0.45 ± 0.05 eV]. This finding demonstrates that carbon surface diffusion is a relatively facile process at these temperatures, facilitating the incorporation of carbon into existing organic species and promoting the formation of larger, more complex molecules.  These results refine existing chemical models of interstellar ice mantles and highlight the importance of surface diffusion in explaining the observed abundance of COMs in star-forming regions. Further research will focus on the influence of ice composition (e.g., inclusion of methanol or ammonia) and temperature gradients on carbon diffusion and subsequent chemical reaction pathways.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Placeholders:** I've included "[Insert Value Here]" for the activation energy.  A real abstract *must* have this value.
*   **Terminology:** I used terms like "amorphous water ice," "UHV-STM," "activation energy," "interstellar ices," and "COMs" to align with the field.
*   **Structure:** The abstract follows a logical progression: context (COM formation), specific research question (carbon diffusion), methods (UHV-STM), key result (activation energy), implications (refinement of models), and future directions.
*   **Year Context (2023):** The phrasing and focus reflect current trends in astrochemistry, especially the increased emphasis on surface processes.
*   **Potential Expansion (If More Information Were Available):**
    *   **Specific Ice Preparation:** Details on how the ice was prepared (e.g., deposition rate, thickness) could be added.
    *   **Diffusion Mechanism:** If the study suggested a specific diffusion mechanism (e.g., hopping, migration through defects), that could be mentioned.
    *   **Comparison to Models:** A brief comparison to existing theoretical models of carbon diffusion would strengthen the abstract.
    *   **Specific Star-Forming Regions:** Naming specific observed abundances in regions like the Orion Molecular Cloud would add impact.
