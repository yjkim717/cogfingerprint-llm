We present a comprehensive chemical analysis of the post-AGB object IRAS 17436+5003, a pre-planetary nebula exhibiting a complex bipolar morphology. High-resolution molecular line observations reveal a spatially resolved, dual-chemistry environment characterized by oxygen-rich species such as H₂O and SiO in the equatorial torus, co-existing with carbon-rich molecules like HCN and C₂H in the high-velocity bipolar lobes. This chemical dichotomy implies the recent onset of non-equilibrium, gas-phase chemical processes, likely driven by ultraviolet irradiation from the central star and shock-induced sputtering of dust grains within the accelerating outflow. The observed molecular stratification provides critical constraints on the timescales of the AGB-to-PN transition, suggesting that the circumstellar envelope's chemical reprocessing occurs rapidly during the early post-AGB phase. These findings underscore the role of dynamical outflows in altering molecular inventories, offering a new window into the chemical evolution of circumstellar envelopes.
