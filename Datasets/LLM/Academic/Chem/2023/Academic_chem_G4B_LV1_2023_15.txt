**Abstract: Directed Self-Assembly of Low-Symmetry Palladium(II) Heteroleptic Cages via Ancillary Ligand Pairing**

The construction of complex three-dimensional architectures through supramolecular chemistry remains a significant challenge. This study reports the synthesis of novel, lantern-shaped palladium(II) cages achieved via a directed self-assembly approach, leveraging ancillary ligand pairings and strategically chosen low-symmetry ligands. Utilizing a defined series of bidentate ligands, we demonstrate the ability to precisely control the spatial arrangement and orientation of palladium centers within the resulting heteroleptic cage structure. The incorporation of low-symmetry ligands dictates the overall geometry, fostering the formation of structures exhibiting reduced symmetry.  These cages, characterized by a distinct ‘lantern’ morphology, represent a significant advance in the design of metallosupramolecular assemblies.  Future work will explore the incorporation of guest molecules within the cage cavity and investigate the catalytic potential of these precisely defined palladium(II) frameworks.
