**Abstract**

The construction of discrete heteroleptic coordination cages with precise spatial arrangement of multiple, chemically distinct ligands remains a formidable challenge in supramolecular chemistry, primarily due to the entropic and enthalpic penalties associated with overcoming statistical mixtures. Herein, we report a rational design strategy for the assembly of low-symmetry Pd(II)-based cages incorporating four unique, complementary low-symmetry ligands. Our approach leverages the principle of integrative self-sortment, where carefully selected ligand pairs—comprising a ditopic "panel" ligand and a complementary tritopic "capping" ligand—exhibit high-fidelity narcissistic self-recognition. This specificity is governed by geometric constraints and favorable secondary interactions, which direct the formation of a single, well-defined heteroleptic architecture from a complex mixture of components. The success of the assembly was confirmed through a combination of NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. This methodology provides unprecedented positional control over multiple functionalities within a single supramolecular entity, establishing a robust platform for developing complex chemical systems with applications in cooperative catalysis and sophisticated guest binding.
