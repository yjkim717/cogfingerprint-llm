Of particular significance in astrochemical research is the identification of pathways leading to the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium. This study investigates the role of surface diffusion of atomic carbon on water-dominated interstellar ice analogues as a fundamental driver of molecular complexity. Through a combination of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations, we demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces at temperatures exceeding 22 K. This mobility facilitates reactive encounters with other adsorbed species, most critically enabling the formation of new C–C bonds. We report a measured activation energy for surface diffusion of 525 ± 15 K, a value sufficiently low to permit migration under typical conditions of cold molecular clouds. The subsequent formation of C2 and C3 carbon chains is observed, serving as direct precursors to more complex hydrocarbons and oxygenated species. These findings establish non-energetic, diffusion-controlled carbon addition as a crucial mechanism in interstellar organic chemistry, providing a robust, thermally-activated route to molecular complexity in dark cosmic environments where radiative processing is minimal.
