**Abstract: Theoretical Frontiers in Polariton Chemistry: Advancing Ab Initio Modeling of Light-Matter Interactions for Enhanced Chemical Control**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, rooted in the principles of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED), presents a transformative paradigm for controlling and manipulating chemical reactions through strong coupling between molecular excitations and optical photons. This review synthesizes recent theoretical advancements in the field, focusing on the development and application of *ab initio* quantum electrodynamics (QED) methodologies to accurately describe and predict light-matter interactions within molecular systems confined to optical cavities. The inherent challenge lies in bridging the disparate length and time scales governing electronic structure and cavity photon dynamics, necessitating sophisticated computational approaches that go beyond traditional quantum chemistry.

We detail the evolution of theoretical frameworks, moving from early semi-classical approximations to increasingly rigorous, fully quantum treatments. Specifically, we explore the implementation and refinement of density matrix embedding theory (DMET) coupled with time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and multi-reference methods to model the molecular subsystem within the cavity environment.  A critical focus is on accounting for the quantized nature of the cavity field, incorporating both the photon Green's function formalism and the quantized ladder operator approach to accurately describe the polaritonic states â€“ hybrid light-matter quasiparticles. The inclusion of nonadiabatic effects, crucial for understanding reactive dynamics influenced by polariton stabilization or modification of potential energy surfaces, is examined through the lens of surface hopping and other non-equilibrium techniques extended to the polaritonic context.

Furthermore, we survey key applications where these theoretical tools are proving invaluable. These include investigations into enhanced photochemical reactivity, control of vibrational dynamics via polaritonic feedback, and the design of novel optoelectronic materials exhibiting tailored light emission and absorption characteristics. Examples such as the modification of singlet fission processes, the stabilization of triplet states, and the influence of polariton condensation on reaction pathways are discussed.  The abstract addresses the current limitations, primarily centered on the computational cost associated with accurately modeling large molecular systems and complex cavity geometries, and the need for improved methods to treat dissipation and decoherence processes.  Future directions involve the development of machine learning accelerated *ab initio* QED techniques, incorporating relativistic effects, and exploring the role of many-body interactions within polaritonic systems. Ultimately, these advances promise to unlock unprecedented levels of chemical control by harnessing the unique properties of polariton chemistry, leading to breakthroughs in areas such as photocatalysis, molecular electronics, and quantum sensing.
