**Abstract**

Recent theoretical and observational evidence increasingly implicates icy grain surfaces within interstellar environments as critical sites for prebiotic chemistry. This study investigates the mechanistic pathways by which complex organic molecules arise, focusing on the role of atomic carbon diffusion. Utilizing computational modeling and incorporating photostimulated desorption processes, we demonstrate that elevated temperatures (≥22 K) facilitate enhanced carbon mobility on icy surfaces. This increased diffusion rate promotes C–C bond formation, leading to the synthesis of increasingly complex molecular structures.  Specifically, our simulations reveal a significant correlation between carbon diffusion distances and the prevalence of larger, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).  These findings provide a compelling framework for understanding the spontaneous generation of prebiotic building blocks within interstellar clouds, suggesting that icy grain surfaces represent a key catalytic element in the early stages of organic molecule formation and potentially contributing to the delivery of complex organics to nascent planetary systems.
