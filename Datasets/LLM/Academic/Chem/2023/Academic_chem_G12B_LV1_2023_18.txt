**Abstract: Surface Diffusion of Atomic Carbon as a Driver of Organic Complexity in Simulated Interstellar Ice Analogues**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments remains a fundamental challenge in astrochemistry. While gas-phase reactions are well-studied, the role of grain surfaces, particularly icy mantles on dust particles, is increasingly recognized as a crucial site for molecular synthesis. This study investigates the role of atomic carbon diffusion on amorphous water ice, a prevalent component of interstellar ices, in promoting carbon-carbon (C-C) bond formation – a key step towards larger, more complex organic structures. Using ultra-high vacuum surface science techniques, we observed and quantified the diffusion of atomic carbon (¹²C) deposited onto cryogenic (8-15 K) H₂O ice films.  Time-resolved secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) revealed a non-linear increase in the abundance of multi-carbon species, including acetylene (C₂H₂) and ethylene (C₂H₄), correlating with carbon deposition and diffusion timescales.  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations support the experimental findings, indicating that surface diffusion lowers the activation energy for C-C bond formation by facilitating encounters between adsorbed carbon atoms. Furthermore, we explored the influence of ice morphology and temperature on diffusion rates. These results provide compelling evidence that surface diffusion of atomic carbon on interstellar ice analogues plays a significant role in the observed chemical complexity in star-forming regions, contributing to the prebiotic inventory delivered to nascent planetary systems. Future work will focus on incorporating other interstellar constituents to simulate more realistic icy grain environments.
