**Polariton-Mediated Chemical Control: A Theoretical Exploration of Molecular Cavity Systems**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry presents a novel paradigm for manipulating molecular reactivity, leveraging the strong coupling between light and matter. This review synthesizes recent theoretical developments in simulating and controlling photochemistry within molecular cavity systems, specifically focusing on the emergent phenomenon of polaritons.  We examine the foundational principles of quantum electrodynamics underpinning polariton formation and stability, highlighting the critical role of molecular cavity design in tuning the coupling strength.  

Computational modeling techniques, including time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and polariton dispersion analysis, are employed to investigate the influence of cavity geometry, material composition, and excitation wavelength on polariton properties.  Particular attention is given to scenarios exhibiting strong coupling, where the hybrid polariton state dominates the system’s dynamics.  

Furthermore, we explore theoretical strategies for directing chemical reactions via light-matter interactions mediated by polaritons. This includes simulating Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pathways and investigating the potential for utilizing polariton dynamics to induce selective bond cleavage or formation.  The review concludes by discussing current limitations and future research directions, emphasizing the need for improved experimental validation and the development of sophisticated control mechanisms to unlock the full potential of polariton-mediated photochemistry in 2023 and beyond.
