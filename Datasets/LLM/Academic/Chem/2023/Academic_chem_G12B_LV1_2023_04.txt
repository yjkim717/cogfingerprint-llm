**Emergent Dynamics in Polariton Chemistry: A Computational Perspective on Light-Matter Hybridization and Non-Adiabatic Processes**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, rooted in the principles of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED), represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of chemical reactivity and energy transfer. This review focuses on the theoretical landscape underpinning this rapidly evolving area, outlining recent advancements in *ab initio* quantum electrodynamics (QED) methodologies and their application to simulating light-matter interactions within molecular systems. We critically evaluate current computational approaches, ranging from fully quantum electrodynamic treatments to reduced-order models that incorporate polaritonic effects within established electronic structure frameworks. A significant challenge lies in accurately capturing the strong coupling regime where the energy of the molecular excitation matches that of the cavity mode, leading to the formation of polaritons – hybrid light-matter quasiparticles.  This strong coupling fundamentally alters molecular dynamics, often necessitating a move beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and the consideration of non-adiabatic effects.

Here, we detail how time-dependent Schrödinger equations, coupled with density matrix approaches, are being employed to model non-adiabatic excited state dynamics influenced by polaritonic states.  The impact of varying cavity geometries, mode frequencies, and molecular environments on polariton formation and subsequent chemical processes – including vibrational relaxation, charge transfer, and even bond breaking – is discussed. We highlight the utility of incorporating polarization effects and exploring the role of multipole interactions in describing the intricate light-matter coupling. Furthermore, we address the computational bottlenecks associated with accurately modeling these systems, particularly the exponential scaling of quantum electrodynamic calculations with system size. Recent strategies aimed at mitigating these limitations, such as embedding techniques and efficient basis set representations, are examined. Finally, we outline future directions for theoretical development, emphasizing the need for robust, scalable *ab initio* QED methods capable of predicting and interpreting the complex interplay between light and matter in chemically relevant scenarios, with particular attention to the potential for designing novel photocatalytic materials and controlling reaction pathways through tailored light fields.  The integration of machine learning to accelerate calculations and identify key descriptors for polariton-enhanced reactivity represents a promising avenue for future research.
