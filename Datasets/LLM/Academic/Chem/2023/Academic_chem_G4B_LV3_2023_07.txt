**Abstract**

Recent advancements in supramolecular chemistry have increasingly leveraged palladium(II) complexes for the construction of intricate three-dimensional architectures. This work details a novel synthetic strategy utilizing pd(II) cages, specifically engineered through the implementation of ancillary ligand pairing.  Employing low-symmetry ligands, we demonstrate a pathway to achieve controlled heteroleptic assembly, affording precise spatial arrangement of metal centers within the cage framework. The strategic selection of ligand combinations dictates the resulting complex’s geometry and stability.  Our methodology allows for the incorporation of diverse ligand sets, circumventing traditional limitations associated with symmetrical ligand systems.  The resultant pd(II) cages exhibit unique structural characteristics, offering potential applications in catalysis, molecular recognition, and the development of responsive materials. Further investigation into the influence of ligand field effects is warranted.
