Of particular interest in metallo-supramolecular chemistry is the construction of intricate, three-dimensional architectures with precisely controlled composition. While homoleptic assemblies are well-established, the targeted synthesis of heteroleptic systems, especially those incorporating multiple different low-symmetry ligands, presents a significant challenge due to the potential for statistical ligand scrambling. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a discrete, heteroleptic palladium(II) coordination cage. Our strategy overcomes the inherent entropic and enthalpic penalties of multi-ligand integration by employing a panel of four carefully designed low-symmetry ligands. The successful assembly is predicated on the principle of ancillary complementary pairings, where specific ligand geometries and binding motifs are engineered to favor a single, well-defined product over a mixture of isomers or oligomers. This approach provides unprecedented positional control over each ligand's location within the final Pd(II)₄L₄-type cage framework. The structure was unequivocally characterized by a combination of NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. This work demonstrates a robust synthetic paradigm for achieving complex heterolepticity in supramolecular cages, paving the way for the creation of multifunctional systems with spatially segregated domains for applications in cooperative catalysis and selective guest binding.
