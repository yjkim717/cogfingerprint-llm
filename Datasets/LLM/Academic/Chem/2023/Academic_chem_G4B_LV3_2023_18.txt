**Abstract**

Interstellar chemistry represents a critical frontier in understanding the origins of complex organic molecules. Recent investigations utilizing cryogenic techniques and spectroscopic analysis reveal a pivotal role for surface carbon diffusion on interstellar ice grains in driving molecular complexity. Specifically, this study posits that carbon atom migration, most prominent at temperatures exceeding 22 K, initiates C–C bond formation – a fundamental step in the synthesis of larger, more intricate organic species.  Furthermore, photostimulated desorption events, triggered by interstellar radiation, are hypothesized to enhance this diffusion process, facilitating the release and subsequent reaction of these nascent carbon chains.  The observed prevalence of complex organic molecules within dense interstellar clouds necessitates a detailed examination of these surface chemical pathways.  Future research will focus on characterizing the specific ice grain morphologies and radiative environments impacting carbon diffusion rates, ultimately refining models of prebiotic chemistry in space and informing our understanding of the delivery mechanisms for organic compounds to planetary systems.
