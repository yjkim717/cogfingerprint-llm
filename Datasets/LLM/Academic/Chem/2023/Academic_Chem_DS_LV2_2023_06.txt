Of particular significance to interstellar organic chemistry is the elucidation of pathways leading to complex organic molecules (COMs) in the cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium. While thermal diffusion of light species such as hydrogen atoms on water-dominated ices is well-established, the mobility of heavier atomic carbon—a fundamental building block—has remained a critical, unresolved question. This study investigates the thermally induced surface diffusion of carbon atoms on amorphous solid water (ASW) ice, a proxy for interstellar ice mantles. Through a combination of laboratory-based ultra-high vacuum experiments and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile at temperatures exceeding 22 K. This mobility facilitates direct encounters with other reactive species, such as carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, co-adsorbed on the ice. Crucially, we observe efficient C–C bond formation under these conditions, a step previously thought to be inhibited at such low temperatures without non-thermal processing. Our results establish carbon diffusion as a fundamental driver of chemical complexity, providing a robust, thermally activated mechanism for the bottom-up synthesis of molecular precursors to COMs directly on interstellar ice grains. This paradigm shift underscores the dynamic nature of carbon chemistry in cold cosmic environments.
