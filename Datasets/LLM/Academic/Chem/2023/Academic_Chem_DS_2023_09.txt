The development of efficient and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is critical for advancing metal-air battery technologies, particularly for rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). While Fe-N-C materials exhibit promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance, their intrinsic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity remains insufficient for practical applications. This work demonstrates that the strategic incorporation of phosphorus heteroatoms into the Fe-N-C matrix induces a significant electronic modulation of the Fe-Nx active sites, substantially enhancing OER kinetics without compromising ORR functionality. Comprehensive electrochemical analysis and spectroscopic characterization reveal that phosphorus doping facilitates the formation of a more favorable local coordination environment, optimizing the adsorption energetics of oxygenated intermediates during the OER process. When integrated into a rechargeable ZAB, the optimized P-doped Fe-N-C catalyst delivers a remarkably low charge-discharge voltage gap and exceptional cycling stability, outperforming many previously reported non-precious metal electrocatalysts. These findings establish phosphorus incorporation as a potent strategy for engineering high-performance, bifunctional oxygen electrodes, paving the way for more sustainable and efficient energy conversion and storage systems.
