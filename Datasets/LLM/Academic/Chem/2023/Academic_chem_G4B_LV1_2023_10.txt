**Abstract**

The genesis of complex organic molecules (COMs) remains a central enigma in the study of interstellar chemistry. This research investigates the role of surface diffusion of carbon atoms on icy grain surfaces as a primary mechanism for COM formation. Utilizing computational modeling and kinetic simulations, we demonstrate that localized carbon atom migration, facilitated by the heterogeneous nature of interstellar ices, generates reactive intermediates. Specifically, our models reveal enhanced pathways for the stepwise addition of carbon fragments to existing ices, significantly accelerating the formation of larger, structurally diverse molecules.  The observed diffusion rates are critically dependent on ice grain morphology and temperature, suggesting a spatially varying influence on chemical processing.  Furthermore, we propose that this carbon-driven surface diffusion represents a dominant pathway for the initial condensation of prebiotic building blocks within dense interstellar clouds.  These findings support the hypothesis that icy grain surfaces serve as crucial reaction sites for the early stages of organic molecule synthesis, ultimately contributing to the potential for life’s origins.
