**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, which exploits strong light-matter interactions within optical cavities to manipulate chemical reactivity and material properties, represents a paradigm shift in molecular sciences. This review synthesizes recent theoretical advances that are critical for the rigorous description and predictive modeling of such hybrid quantum systems. We commence by elucidating the fundamental theoretical frameworks of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), highlighting the challenges posed by gauge ambiguities in the quantization of the electromagnetic field when coupled to molecular matter. A central theme of our discussion is the reconciliation of these ambiguities through the development of ab initio QED methodologies, which provide a first-principles, gauge-invariant foundation for describing quantum light-matter interactions. We critically analyze the emergence of collective effects, such as vibrational and electronic strong coupling, and their profound implications for modifying potential energy surfaces, altering reaction pathways, and suppressing or enhancing reaction rates. Furthermore, we survey the current landscape of computational techniques, from model Hamiltonians to fully quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT), assessing their respective capabilities and limitations in simulating realistic molecular systems under strong coupling. The review culminates in a discussion of pioneering applications, demonstrating theoretical predictions of cavity-modified phenomena including energy transfer, photoisomerization, and charge transfer dynamics. By charting the convergence of fundamental theory, computational method development, and emergent applications, this work aims to provide a coherent intellectual framework for the continued advancement of polariton chemistry as a potent tool for quantum control of molecular processes.
