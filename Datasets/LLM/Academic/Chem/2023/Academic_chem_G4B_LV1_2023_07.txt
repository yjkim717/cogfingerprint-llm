**Synthesis and Characterization of Anion-Directed Palladium(II) Cage Assemblies via Ancillary Ligand Pairing**

The construction of complex three-dimensional architectures remains a central challenge in supramolecular chemistry. This work reports a novel strategy for the directed synthesis of palladium(II)-based cage structures, leveraging ancillary ligand pairings to achieve precise control over cage geometry. Utilizing a carefully selected suite of ligands, we demonstrate the formation of lantern-shaped palladium(II) cages exhibiting defined positional and orientational arrangements.  The incorporation of complementary ligands facilitates cooperative self-assembly, driving the formation of these intricate frameworks.  X-ray crystallography confirms the structural integrity of the synthesized cages, revealing the predictable influence of ancillary pairings on the final assembly. These findings provide a valuable template for designing and constructing sophisticated supramolecular systems with tailored properties, opening avenues for applications in catalysis and molecular recognition.
