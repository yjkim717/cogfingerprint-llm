**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, situated at the confluence of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and photochemistry, represents a paradigm shift for controlling quantum light-matter interactions. By confining molecules within optical cavities, hybrid light-matter states—polaritons—are formed, which exhibit novel physicochemical properties distinct from their bare molecular constituents. This 2023 review synthesizes recent theoretical advancements that are critical for the ab initio description and predictive modeling of these complex systems. A central challenge addressed herein is the resolution of gauge ambiguities that arise in the quantization of the electromagnetic field within the cavity. The choice between the Coulomb gauge and the dipole gauge, while equivalent in principle, can lead to significant practical discrepancies in truncated Hilbert spaces, posing a substantial obstacle for reliable computational predictions. We systematically dissect these gauge issues and present modern theoretical frameworks that ensure gauge invariance, thereby establishing a robust foundation for subsequent computational investigations.

Building upon this resolved theoretical footing, we survey the current landscape of ab initio QED methodologies. These approaches seamlessly integrate electronic structure theory, such as density functional theory and wavefunction-based methods, with quantized cavity modes, enabling the first-principles exploration of polaritonic potential energy surfaces and non-adiabatic dynamics. The discussion extends to key applications, particularly in photochemistry, where polariton formation can dramatically alter reaction pathways, suppress or enhance reaction rates, and control product selectivity by manipulating potential energy landscapes. Furthermore, we examine the profound implications of vibrational strong coupling, a regime where the interaction between molecular vibrations and the cavity vacuum field is sufficiently strong to modify ground-state chemical reactivity and vibrational spectroscopy without external pumping.

Despite significant progress, this review concludes by outlining persistent challenges. These include the scalable computational treatment of collective coupling in molecular ensembles, the accurate description of loss mechanisms and dissipation, and the need for experimental validation of theoretically predicted phenomena. By charting the interplay between gauge-invariant theory, advanced computational methods, and emerging applications, this work aims to provide a comprehensive roadmap for the future development of polariton chemistry as a transformative tool for chemical manipulation.
