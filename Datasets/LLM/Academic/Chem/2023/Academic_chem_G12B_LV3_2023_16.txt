**Abstract:**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, intersecting molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (MCQD) and photochemistry, has witnessed significant theoretical progress in recent years. This review examines key advancements in *ab initio* quantum electrodynamics (QED) methodologies enabling increasingly accurate simulations of light-matter interactions within molecular systems confined to optical cavities. We synthesize recent developments in modeling vibrational strong coupling, demonstrating how the coherent exchange of energy between molecular vibrations and cavity photons can fundamentally alter photochemical pathways.  Specifically, we highlight theoretical efforts to predict and interpret the impact of polaritonic effects on reaction rates, product distributions, and energy landscapes, moving beyond simple rate enhancement scenarios.  A central challenge remains in accurately describing collective strong coupling regimes arising from multiple molecular emitters and complex cavity modes.  We discuss current theoretical approaches, including multimode and many-body treatments, and their limitations in fully capturing experimental observations. Finally, we address the critical need for improved theoretical frameworks capable of bridging the gap between sophisticated experimental results and predictive computational models, paving the way for rational design of polariton-enhanced chemical processes. This perspective underscores the transformative potential of quantum light-matter interactions for advancing photochemical synthesis and fundamental chemical understanding.
