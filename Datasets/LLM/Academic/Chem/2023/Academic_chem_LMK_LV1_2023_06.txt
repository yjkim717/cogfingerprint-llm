Title: Unveiling the Role of Carbon Atom Surface Diffusion in Interstellar Ice: Implications for Complex Organic Molecule Formation

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a longstanding enigma in astrochemistry. Recent experimental investigations (2023) have elucidated the pivotal role of carbon atom surface diffusion on interstellar ice surfaces in driving COM formation at low temperatures. Our study demonstrates that the mobility of carbon atoms on amorphous ice surfaces facilitates the formation of C-C bonds, thereby enabling the synthesis of COMs. Through a combination of laboratory experiments and computational modeling, we show that the diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice surfaces is a key factor in determining the efficiency of COM formation. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the origins of COMs in interstellar space and the delivery of prebiotic molecules to early Earth. The results underscore the importance of surface diffusion processes in interstellar ice chemistry, providing new insights into the astrochemical mechanisms governing COM formation.
