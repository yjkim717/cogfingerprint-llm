**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, operating at the confluence of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and quantum optics, has established itself as a transformative paradigm for controlling chemical reactivity. By confining molecules within optical cavities, strong light-matter coupling gives rise to hybrid quasi-particles known as vibrational polaritons, which possess properties distinct from their bare molecular constituents. This phenomenon, vibrational strong coupling (VSC), has been empirically demonstrated to significantly alter reaction rates and product distributions under conditions of thermal excitation, challenging the conventional wisdom of transition state theory. However, the precise quantum mechanical mechanisms underpinning this catalytic control remain a subject of intense theoretical debate. A central point of contention involves the resolution of gauge ambiguitiesâ€”the physical inequivalence between the Coulomb and dipole gauges when constructing the minimal-coupling Hamiltonian for the coupled system. This review synthesizes recent theoretical advances that reconcile these gauge issues, demonstrating that the origin of chemical modification under VSC is not merely an artifact of the chosen gauge but is linked to the dynamical dressing of the molecular potential energy surface by the cavity vacuum field. We critically evaluate emerging computational frameworks, including exact diagonalization techniques and quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT), which are now enabling the *ab initio* simulation of complex molecular ensembles in cavities. By providing a unified perspective on fundamental principles, we chart a course for the rational design of cavity environments to manipulate specific chemical transformations, thereby heralding a new era of quantum-enabled photochemistry.
