Here's an academic abstract inspired by the provided summary and keywords, written in a formal style and suitable for a chemistry publication (2023 context):

**Abstract:**

Recent advances in metallo-supramolecular chemistry have spurred interest in the construction of complex, well-defined coordination cages. This study details a new synthetic strategy for generating heteroleptic palladium(II) lantern-shaped structures, leveraging the principles of self-assembly and directed coordination. By employing carefully selected ancillary ligand pairings, we achieve precise positional and orientational control over ligands exhibiting diverse coordination modes and hydrogen bonding functionalities. The resultant heteroleptic assemblies demonstrate a significant departure from traditional symmetrical cage architectures, offering access to low-symmetry systems with potentially unique properties. This approach, validated through spectroscopic and structural characterization, expands the toolkit for constructing tailored metallo-cages and opens avenues for exploring their application in areas such as catalysis, sensing, and molecular recognition.



I aimed to capture the essence of the summary while elevating the language and adding detail expected in a formal abstract.
