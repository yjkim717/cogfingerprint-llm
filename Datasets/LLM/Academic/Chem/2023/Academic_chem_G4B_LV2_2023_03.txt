**Abstract**

The construction of complex, three-dimensional architectures with controlled ligand arrangements represents a significant challenge within supramolecular chemistry. This study reports the successful synthesis of novel, low-symmetry palladium(II) cage complexes utilizing a strategy predicated on ancillary ligand pairings. Employing a heteroleptic assembly approach, we demonstrate the capacity to dictate precise positional and orientational control over the incorporation of geometrically constrained ligands within the cage framework. Specifically, strategically selected ancillary ligands were utilized to sterically and electronically influence the coordination sphere of the palladium center, leading to the formation of distinct, lantern-shaped structures.  These cages exhibit a notable deviation from symmetry, reflecting the conformational constraints imposed by the ligand pairings.  The resultant complexes offer a valuable model system for investigating the interplay between ligand design, metal coordination, and supramolecular self-assembly.  Further investigation into the dynamic properties and potential applications of these palladium(II) cages is warranted, promising advancements in areas such as catalysis and molecular recognition.
