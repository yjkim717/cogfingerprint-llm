Title: Unveiling a Novel Chemical Pathway: Surface Diffusion of Carbon Atoms on Interstellar Ice and its Implications for Complex Organic Molecule Formation

Abstract:
The astrochemical evolution of interstellar ice is crucial in driving the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs). This study, conducted in 2023, investigates the surface diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice analogues, revealing a previously underappreciated chemical regime that facilitates the synthesis of COMs. Utilizing a combination of experimental and computational approaches, we demonstrate that the mobility of carbon atoms on ice surfaces enables the formation of key precursors to COMs, thereby enhancing their overall production yield. Our findings indicate that this surface-mediated process is a significant contributor to the interstellar chemistry of carbon, underscoring the importance of surface diffusion in the astrochemical context. The results have profound implications for understanding the origins of COMs in the interstellar medium, shedding new light on the intricate chemical networks that underpin the formation of these complex species.
