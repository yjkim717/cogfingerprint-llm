This study introduces a versatile organogel-based platform that facilitates palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions between organolithium nucleophiles and aryl bromides under ambient conditions. The supramolecular gel matrix effectively stabilizes sensitive organometallic intermediates while enabling efficient mass transport, eliminating the need for inert atmosphere protection. Systematic optimization revealed that this methodology proceeds with excellent functional group tolerance across diverse (hetero)aryl substrates at room temperature, achieving complete conversion within 30 minutes. Spectroscopic analysis confirms the gel framework maintains catalyst integrity while suppressing common side reactions. This operationally simple protocol represents a significant advancement in handling air- and moisture-sensitive reagents, providing a robust alternative to conventional Schlenk techniques for constructing biaryl architectures.
