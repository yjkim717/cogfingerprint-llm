**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, operating at the confluence of molecular physics and quantum optics, has emerged as a transformative paradigm for manipulating chemical reactivity. By harnessing vibrational strong coupling (VSC) within optical cavities, molecular ensembles can be hybridized with confined electromagnetic modes to form vibrational polaritonsâ€”collective light-matter quasiparticles. These hybrid states possess novel energy landscapes, offering a potent tool for controlling ground-state chemical processes without external heating or irradiation. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this control mechanism remain intensely debated, primarily due to the critical challenge of gauge ambiguities inherent in molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). In this perspective, we synthesize recent theoretical advances that reconcile these gauge issues, demonstrating the formal equivalence between the Coulomb and dipole gauges when a consistent truncation of the molecular Hilbert space is applied. We further elucidate how this resolution informs the development of accurate and computationally tractable methods, including exact diagonalization and mixed quantum-classical dynamics, for simulating polaritonic systems. By integrating these gauge-invariant frameworks, we explore key applications where VSC has been predicted to significantly alter reaction rates and pathways, such as in proton transfer and bond dissociation reactions. This consolidated theoretical foundation not only clarifies ongoing experimental investigations but also provides a rigorous platform for the rational design of cavity-modified chemistry, paving the way for novel quantum-controlled synthesis and energy conversion technologies.
