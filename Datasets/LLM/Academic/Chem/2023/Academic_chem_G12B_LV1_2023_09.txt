**Abstract: Experimental Determination of Carbon Atom Surface Diffusion Activation Energy in Interstellar Ice Analogs and Implications for Complex Organic Molecule Formation**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a critical step in understanding the origins of life. While gas-phase reactions are well-studied, the significant role of surface chemistry on interstellar dust grains remains a crucial area of ongoing investigation. This work presents experimental measurements of the activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>) for carbon atom (C) diffusion on a model interstellar ice composed of frozen H<sub>2</sub>O and CO, simulating conditions prevalent in dense molecular clouds. Using Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD) coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry, we monitored the release of atomic carbon from the ice surface as a function of temperature.  Data analysis employing Arrhenius-type kinetics yielded an E<sub>a</sub> of 0.68 Â± 0.05 eV for C diffusion within the ice matrix. This value is significantly lower than previously estimated activation energies for C diffusion in other condensed phases.  Our findings suggest that surface diffusion of carbon atoms is a relatively facile process within interstellar ice, making it a highly probable pathway for C-C bond formation and subsequent polymerization reactions. The observed low activation energy supports models where surface reactions are efficient even at the low temperatures characteristic of interstellar environments.  Implications of this work include a revised understanding of the kinetics of COMs like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and fullerenes, and the potential for enhanced production rates compared to purely gas-phase scenarios. Future work will focus on investigating the influence of ice composition and morphology on C diffusion behavior.
