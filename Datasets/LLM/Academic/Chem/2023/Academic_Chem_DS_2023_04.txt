**Abstract**

The modulation of protein phase behavior by macromolecular crowding represents a pivotal factor in the suppression of pathological aggregation pathways. This study investigates the role of synthetic crowders in governing the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and amyloid fibrillation of a model globular protein under confinement-mimicking conditions. We demonstrate that inert polymeric crowders induce a concentration-dependent, reentrant phase diagram for protein condensate formation. At intermediate crowding volumes, the stabilization of dense liquid droplets via depletion interactions effectively sequesters monomeric protein, thereby competitively inhibiting surface-catalyzed nucleation of amyloid fibrils. Spectroscopic and microscopic analyses confirm that this crowding-facilitated LLPS state retains the native protein conformation for extended durations, in stark contrast to rapid fibrillation observed in dilute or excessively crowded environments. Furthermore, we establish that the transition between the protective LLPS regime and aggregation-prone states is governed by the interplay between protein-crowder and protein-surface interactions. These findings elucidate a kinetic trapping mechanism within biomolecular condensates, offering a physicochemical framework for leveraging crowding agents as supramolecular chaperones to prevent aberrant protein aggregation in biotechnological formulations and crowded cellular locales.
