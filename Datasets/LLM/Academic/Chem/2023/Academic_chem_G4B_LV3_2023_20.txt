**Abstract:**

Recent theoretical investigations have increasingly leveraged the principles of polariton chemistry and molecular cavity QED to elucidate and manipulate photochemical processes. This work reviews significant advancements in 2023 concerning *ab initio* quantum electrodynamics (QED) simulations, specifically tailored to model the complex light-matter interactions within molecular environments. We highlight the growing sophistication in describing collective coupling phenomena – crucial for understanding exciton-polariton formation and enhanced radiative decay – within confined spaces such as molecular cavities.  These theoretical methodologies are now enabling researchers to predict and control reaction pathways with unprecedented accuracy, offering potential applications in ground-state chemical modifications and advanced photochemistry.  Challenges remain in accurately capturing long-range correlations and decoherence effects, particularly at elevated excitation energies.  Future research will necessitate further refinement of computational techniques and a deeper theoretical understanding of the interplay between quantum light, matter, and the surrounding molecular landscape, ultimately driving innovation in areas ranging from solar energy conversion to precision chemical synthesis.
