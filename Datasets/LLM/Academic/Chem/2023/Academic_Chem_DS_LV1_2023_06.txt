**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) represents a critical stage in prebiotic chemical evolution. While gas-phase reactions are well-studied, the role of solid-state chemistry on icy grain mantles remains less constrained, particularly concerning the reactivity of atomic carbon. This investigation employs kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, informed by recent laboratory data on atom-ice interactions, to model the surface diffusion and reactivity of carbon atoms on low-temperature water-dominated ices. Our results demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on amorphous solid water surfaces at temperatures exceeding 22 K, a regime pertinent to warmer regions of molecular clouds and protostellar envelopes. This mobility facilitates non-diffusion-limited encounters with other reactive species, notably leading to efficient C–C bond formation. We identify the reaction C + CH₃OH → C₂H₅OH as a key initiation step, providing a low-energy barrier pathway to molecular complexity. This mechanism effectively bridges the gap between simple carbon-bearing ices and more complex, saturated hydrocarbons and their derivatives. We conclude that the thermally activated surface diffusion of atomic carbon is a fundamental driver of molecular complexity in the ISM, offering a robust, grain-surface explanation for the observed abundances of COMs in regions where traditional radical-radical coupling models are insufficient. This work underscores the necessity of including atomic carbon mobility in astrochemical networks.
