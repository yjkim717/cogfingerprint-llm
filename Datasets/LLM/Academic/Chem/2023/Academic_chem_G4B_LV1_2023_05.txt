**Abstract: Surface Diffusion and the Genesis of Complex Organic Molecules in Interstellar Environments**

The prevailing paradigms of interstellar organic molecule formation have traditionally emphasized high-energy radiative processes. However, recent spectroscopic observations increasingly suggest a more nuanced picture, hinting at a significant role for lower-energy chemical pathways. This study proposes a novel mechanism wherein carbon atom diffusion on icy grain surfaces serves as a primary driver for the synthesis of complex organic molecules within interstellar space. Utilizing a kinetic model incorporating radiative ice sublimation and surface diffusion coefficients derived from recent simulations, we demonstrate that localized carbon atom mobility facilitates the sequential addition of molecular fragments – including methane, ethane, and acetylene – onto ice grain interfaces. 

These localized reactions, shielded from direct UV radiation, promote the formation of increasingly complex structures.  The resultant distribution of these molecules suggests that icy grains, acting as micro-reactors, represent crucial sites for prebiotic chemistry. Further investigation into the influence of grain morphology and interstellar dust composition is warranted to fully elucidate the implications of this surface diffusion-mediated pathway for the delivery of organic building blocks to nascent planetary systems, as highlighted in 2023's emerging data.
