**Abstract**

Recent theoretical investigations into polariton chemistry and molecular cavity QED have witnessed significant progress, driven by the need to accurately model complex light-matter interactions. This review synthesizes advancements in simulating hybrid systems, specifically leveraging *ab initio* quantum electrodynamics (QED) approaches to capture the nuanced coupling between molecular excitations and the surrounding electromagnetic environment.  We highlight the growing utility of molecular cavities – nanoscale resonant structures – in controlling photochemistry through tailored light-matter hybridization.  These cavities enable precise manipulation of molecular energy levels, facilitating enhanced reaction rates and selectivity. 

Crucially, the study addresses the inherent challenges in translating theoretical predictions to experimental verification.  Discrepancies frequently arise due to the complexities of decoherence and the difficulty of isolating specific polariton modes.  Therefore, a central focus is placed on developing robust theoretical frameworks capable of accounting for these effects, including advanced many-body QED calculations.  Furthermore, we explore strategies for interpreting experimental observations, emphasizing the importance of considering collective light-matter coupling phenomena and the emergent properties of polariton condensates.  Future research directions will prioritize the development of accessible simulation tools and a deeper understanding of the fundamental limits of cavity-mediated chemical control.
