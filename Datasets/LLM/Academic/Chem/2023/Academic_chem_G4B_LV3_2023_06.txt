**Abstract**

The delivery of prebiotic molecules throughout the interstellar medium is critically dependent on complex chemical processes occurring on icy grain surfaces. This study investigates the role of atomic carbon diffusion within these icy matrices, specifically at temperatures exceeding 22 Kelvin, as a primary driver of organic complexity. Utilizing advanced molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that enhanced carbon mobility facilitates surface reactions, leading to the formation of diverse polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other structurally intricate organic species.  The observed carbon diffusion pathways are intimately linked to the morphology of ice grains, exhibiting a strong correlation with surface area and crystalline structure.  These findings suggest that interstellar cometary ices represent significant ‘chemical nurseries,’ contributing substantially to the carbon inventory available for subsequent star and planet formation.  Further research is warranted to explore the influence of radiation fields and gas phase chemistry on these fundamental interstellar reactions, refining our models of early chemical evolution.
