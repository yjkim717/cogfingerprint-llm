**Abstract: Enhanced Complexity in Interstellar Chemistry via Surface-Mediated Carbon Diffusion**

The prevalence of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar ices represents a fundamental puzzle in the origin of prebiotic chemistry. Recent investigations have increasingly implicated surface diffusion processes as critical drivers of molecular complexity. This study presents compelling evidence demonstrating that carbon diffusion, significantly enhanced at temperatures above 22 K, plays a pivotal role in the formation of C-C bonds within interstellar ices. Utilizing a combination of theoretical modeling and spectroscopic analysis, we posit that the observed surface mobility of carbon atoms facilitates the formation of larger, more intricate molecular structures. 

Specifically, our calculations reveal that photostimulated desorption events, coupled with subsequent surface diffusion, promote the rearrangement and coupling of smaller, precursor molecules. This mechanism circumvents the limitations imposed by purely gas-phase reactions, allowing for the construction of increasingly complex architectures under the prevailing conditions of interstellar ices. Furthermore, the observed correlation between carbon diffusion rates and the abundance of detected COMs suggests a direct causal link.  These findings contribute significantly to our understanding of the chemical pathways operative in the interstellar medium and highlight the importance of surface chemistry in the synthesis of prebiotic building blocks.
