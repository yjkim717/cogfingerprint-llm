**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, which leverages strong light-matter interactions within optical cavities to manipulate chemical processes, represents a paradigm shift in quantum control. This review synthesizes recent theoretical advancements that provide the foundational principles for this nascent discipline, moving from fundamental frameworks to practical computational methodologies. We commence by elucidating the theoretical underpinnings of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), the cornerstone of polaritonics, wherein molecular ensembles are hybridized with confined electromagnetic modes to form dressed light-matter quasiparticles: polaritons. A critical discussion is dedicated to resolving the longstanding challenge of gauge ambiguities in ab initio QED formulations, highlighting how the choice between the Coulomb, dipole, or multipolar gauges impacts the convergence and physical interpretation of calculations, and presenting modern approaches that ensure gauge-invariant predictions. Subsequently, we survey the rapidly evolving landscape of computational methods designed for practical simulations. This includes advancements in ab initio QED methodologies, such as QEDFT (Quantum Electrodynamical Density Functional Theory) and cavity-based coupled-cluster techniques, which enable the first-principles description of complex molecular systems interacting with the quantized field, thereby bridging quantum optics and electronic structure theory. The review culminates in an analysis of proposed and realized applications of these theoretical frameworks, particularly focusing on the mechanistic insights into how polariton formation can selectively modify potential energy surfaces, suppress or enhance reaction rates, and control photochemical pathways. By integrating fundamental theory, computational rigor, and chemical insight, this work aims to establish a coherent conceptual map for navigating the current challenges and future opportunities in theoretically driven polariton chemistry.
