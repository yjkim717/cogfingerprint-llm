Title: Investigating the Role of Surface Diffusion in the Formation of Complex Organic Molecules on Interstellar Ice

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a topic of significant interest in astrochemistry. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of surface diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice in facilitating the synthesis of COMs. In this work, we employ computational simulations to investigate the surface diffusion of carbon atoms on amorphous water ice, a prevalent interstellar ice analogue. Our results indicate that the surface diffusion of carbon atoms is a thermally activated process, with a calculated activation energy of 120 meV. We demonstrate that the mobility of carbon atoms on the ice surface enables the formation of COMs through barrierless reactions, thereby enhancing the chemical complexity of interstellar ices. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the formation of COMs in interstellar environments, shedding light on the role of surface diffusion in interstellar organic chemistry.
