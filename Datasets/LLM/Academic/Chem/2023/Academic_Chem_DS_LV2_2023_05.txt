Of particular significance in the field of astrochemistry is the formation pathway of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the frigid, low-pressure environment of the interstellar medium. While molecular ices are known repositories of chemical diversity, the mechanisms facilitating the requisite carbon-carbon (C-C) bond formation—a foundational step in molecular complexity—have remained inadequately constrained, particularly for non-energetic processing routes. This investigation elucidates a critical physicochemical process underpinning interstellar organic chemistry: the thermally activated surface diffusion of atomic carbon on water-dominated ice mantles. Through a combination of laboratory-based cryogenic experiments and kinetic modelling, we demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on amorphous solid water surfaces at temperatures exceeding approximately 22 K. This mobility is not merely physical; it represents a fundamental shift in chemical reactivity. The diffusive transport enables frequent encounters and subsequent reactions with co-adsorbed species, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde (H₂CO), directly leading to the efficient formation of new C-C bonds. We quantify the diffusion barriers and reaction rates, establishing that this non-diffusive to diffusive transition is a pivotal astrochemical switch. It provides a robust, thermal mechanism for initiating carbon backbone growth in dark molecular clouds and protostellar envelopes, thereby driving chemical evolution toward greater complexity without reliance on external ultraviolet radiation or cosmic-ray bombardment. Our findings necessitate a revision of current astrochemical networks to incorporate this dominant pathway for low-temperature synthesis.
