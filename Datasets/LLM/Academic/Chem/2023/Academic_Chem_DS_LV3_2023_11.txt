In the rapidly evolving field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry, the construction of intricate heteroleptic architectures with defined geometries remains a formidable challenge, particularly when integrating multiple low-symmetry ligands. This study addresses this limitation by introducing a novel ancillary pairings strategy for the rational design of a discrete lantern-shaped Pd(II) coordination cage. By employing four distinct low-symmetry ligands, we demonstrate that selective complementary interactions between specific ligand pairs can direct the self-assembly process with exceptional fidelity. This approach enables unprecedented control over both the positional and orientational arrangement of each ligand within the final supramolecular framework, as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. The resulting heteroleptic assembly not only exemplifies a new paradigm in achieving structural complexity but also exhibits unique hostâ€“guest behavior towards anionic species, underscoring its potential in molecular recognition and sequestration. Our findings, reported in 2023, establish ancillary pairings as a versatile methodology for expanding the toolbox of supramolecular chemists, paving the way for bespoke functional materials with tailored properties and applications in catalysis and smart nanomaterials.
