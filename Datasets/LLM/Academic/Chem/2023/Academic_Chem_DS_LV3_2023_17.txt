**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium represents a critical pathway in prebiotic astrochemistry. While gas-phase reactions are well-characterized, the role of surface-mediated processes on interstellar ice mantles remains less understood, particularly concerning the reactivity of atomic carbon. This study investigates the non-thermal surface diffusion of carbon atoms on amorphous solid water ice, a dominant component of interstellar ices, and its direct implications for C–C bond formation. Experimental simulations conducted under ultra-high vacuum and cryogenic conditions, replicating dark molecular cloud environments, demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on ice surfaces at temperatures exceeding 22 K. This mobility facilitates reactive encounters with co-adsorbed species, such as CO and CH₃OH, initiating a cascade of radical-addition and hydrogen-abstraction reactions. The key finding is that this surface diffusion acts as a primary driver for synthesizing nascent COMs, including acetaldehyde and ethanol precursors, through efficient C–C coupling. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed chemical complexity in star-forming regions, establishing carbon atom diffusion as a fundamental, low-temperature process governing molecular complexity in the cosmos and informing models of interstellar organic inventories relevant to the origins of life.
