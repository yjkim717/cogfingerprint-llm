**Abstract**

The formation pathways of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) represent a fundamental problem in astrochemistry, with direct implications for the prebiotic chemical inventory of nascent planetary systems. While gas-phase reactions are well-characterized, the role of solid-state chemistry on icy dust grain mantles remains less understood, particularly concerning the initial steps of carbon backbone assembly. This investigation provides critical experimental evidence elucidating the non-thermal **surface diffusion** of atomic carbon on amorphous solid water (ASW) ice analogues under ultra-high vacuum conditions simulating the ISM. Our results demonstrate that **carbon atoms** become mobile at temperatures exceeding 22 K, a significantly lower threshold than previously theorized. This mobility facilitates direct encounters with co-adsorbed reactants, such as CO, O, and H, on the **interstellar ice** matrix. Crucially, we observe that this diffusive behavior is the primary driver for efficient **Câ€“C bond formation**, initiating a cascade of radical-addition and hydrogenation reactions. This process effectively bridges the gap between simple, volatile species and refractory **complex organic molecules**, including precursors to ketones and alcohols. The identified low-temperature diffusion mechanism necessitates a paradigm shift in astrochemical models, underscoring that carbon atom reactivity on ice surfaces is a dominant, non-equilibrium process in cold molecular clouds. Consequently, these findings significantly advance our predictive capacity for molecular complexity in star-forming regions and provide a robust physicochemical basis for the organic compounds detected in meteorites and cometary materials.
