**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) within interstellar environments represents a fundamental question in astrochemistry. This study investigates the role of atomic carbon diffusion on interstellar ices, specifically at cryogenic temperatures (above 22 K), as a key mechanistic pathway for COMs synthesis. Utilizing computational modeling and kinetic simulations, we demonstrate that enhanced carbon diffusion significantly promotes C-C bond formation, a critical step in the assembly of larger molecular structures. 

Our research posits that photostimulated desorption, coupled with the increased mobility of carbon atoms, facilitates a higher density of reactive carbon sites on the ice surface. This localized concentration of carbon atoms subsequently increases the probability of intermolecular C-C coupling reactions. Furthermore, we explore the influence of ice grain morphology and surface heterogeneity on diffusion rates, suggesting that specific surface features may act as preferential pathways for carbon transport. 

These findings provide a refined understanding of the chemical processes occurring in interstellar ices, supporting the hypothesis that surface diffusion, driven by energetic input, is a dominant mechanism for the observed prevalence of COMs.  Future research will focus on validating these simulations with observational data and exploring the impact of various ice composition and irradiation conditions.
