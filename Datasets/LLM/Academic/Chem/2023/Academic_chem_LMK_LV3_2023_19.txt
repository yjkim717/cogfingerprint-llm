Title: Harnessing Ancillary Ligand Pairings for Complex Palladium(II) Assemblies

Abstract:

The synthesis of heteroleptic palladium(II) cages with low-symmetry ligands has been a longstanding challenge in metallo-supramolecular chemistry. Recently, a novel strategy leveraging ancillary complementary ligand pairings has emerged, enabling precise control over ligand positioning and orientation. By judiciously selecting ancillary ligand pairs, researchers can now access complex palladium(II) assemblies with tailored properties. This advancement builds upon the understanding of ligand interactions and palladium(II) coordination geometry, facilitating the design of sophisticated supramolecular architectures. The present study demonstrates the efficacy of this approach in synthesizing intricate heteroleptic cages, thereby expanding the toolkit for metallo-supramolecular chemists. The resulting palladium(II) cages exhibit enhanced complexity and functionality, underscoring the potential of ancillary ligand pairings in driving innovation in this field. This development is poised to influence the design of future supramolecular assemblies.
