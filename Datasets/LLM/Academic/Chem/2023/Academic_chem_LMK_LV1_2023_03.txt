Title: Strategic Assembly of Heteroleptic Pd(II) Cages via Ancillary Complementary Pairings

The deliberate synthesis of complex metallo-supramolecular architectures remains a significant challenge in the field of coordination chemistry. Herein, we report a novel approach to access heteroleptic Pd(II) cages with reduced symmetry, leveraging ancillary complementary ligand pairings to dictate the assembly outcome. By carefully selecting ligand combinations that exhibit orthogonal binding preferences, we demonstrate the formation of discrete, multinuclear Pd(II) assemblies with predetermined composition and geometry. The use of low-symmetry ligands, in conjunction with judiciously chosen ancillary pairings, enables the hierarchical assembly of complex architectures that would be inaccessible through traditional self-assembly methods. This strategy provides a versatile platform for the construction of sophisticated metallo-supramolecular systems, with potential applications in catalysis, molecular recognition, and materials science. Our findings underscore the power of ancillary complementary pairings in controlling the assembly of heteroleptic Pd(II) cages, opening new avenues for the design of complex supramolecular architectures.
