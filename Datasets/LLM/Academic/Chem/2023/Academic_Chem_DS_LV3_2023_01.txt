**Abstract**

The formation pathways of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) represent a fundamental problem in astrochemistry, with direct implications for our understanding of molecular complexity in space and its potential role in prebiotic chemistry. While gas-phase reactions have been extensively studied, the role of solid-state reactions on icy dust grain mantles remains less constrained, particularly regarding the initial steps of carbon backbone assembly. This study investigates the non-thermal surface diffusion of atomic carbon (C) on low-temperature amorphous solid water (ASW) ice analogues, a process critical for initiating C–C bond formation. Through a series of ultra-high vacuum (UHV) temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on ASW surfaces at temperatures exceeding 22 K. This mobility facilitates reactive encounters with co-adsorbed species, such as CO, O, and H atoms, leading to the efficient formation of nascent COMs including ketene (H₂CCO) and distinct carbon-chain precursors. Our results establish a robust experimental lower bound for carbon diffusion, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed abundance of interstellar COMs in cold molecular clouds. This work underscores the catalytic role of interstellar ices, where surface diffusion acts as the primary driver for molecular complexity, bridging the gap between simple atomic carbon and the rich organic inventory detected in space. These findings necessitate a revision of current astrochemical models to incorporate the significant contribution of mobile carbon atoms in cold ice-phase chemistry.
