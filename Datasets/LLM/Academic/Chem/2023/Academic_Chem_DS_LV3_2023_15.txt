In 2023, the field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry has achieved a pivotal breakthrough in the construction of intricate heteroleptic assemblies. This work introduces a novel synthetic strategy based on programmed ancillary pairings, which enables the precise assembly of Pd(II) lantern-shaped cages. Departing from conventional high-symmetry ligands, our methodology specifically employs low-symmetry ligands to direct coordination. This approach allows for the deliberate incorporation of four chemically distinct ligands within a single cage architecture. The resulting structures exhibit unprecedented control over both the positional arrangement and the spatial orientation of each ligand component. Such precision over the three-dimensional organization of multiple functionalities was previously unattainable in self-assembled systems. This advancement not only expands the synthetic toolbox for discrete metal-organic cages but also opens new avenues for developing multifunctional materials with applications in selective catalysis, molecular recognition, and sophisticated guest encapsulation, marking a significant leap in the complexity and functionality achievable through supramolecular design.
