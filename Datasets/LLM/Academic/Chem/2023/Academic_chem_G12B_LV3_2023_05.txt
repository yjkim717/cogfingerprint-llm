**Abstract**

Recent advancements in astrochemistry highlight the crucial role of surface processes in the formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments. This study presents experimental evidence demonstrating efficient carbon diffusion across amorphous ice surfaces at ultralow temperatures (22 K). Utilizing temperature-programmed desorption spectroscopy, we observed significant carbon mobility, indicating a previously underestimated kinetic pathway for the incorporation of carbon atoms into existing organic ices. These findings challenge prevailing models of interstellar organic synthesis, suggesting that carbon diffusion provides a more facile route to building larger, more complex molecular structures than previously considered. The observed activation energy for carbon diffusion is remarkably low, further supporting its prevalence. This work has profound implications for understanding the chemical evolution of molecular clouds and the potential delivery of prebiotic organic matter to planetary systems, thereby refining our perspective on the origins of life in the Universe.
