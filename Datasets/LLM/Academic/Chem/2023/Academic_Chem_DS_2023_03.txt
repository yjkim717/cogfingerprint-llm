**Abstract**

The structure and potential distribution of the electrical double layer (EDL) at colloidal interfaces remain central to understanding phenomena in electrocatalysis, energy storage, and nanoparticle dispersion stability. This investigation employs angle-resolved second harmonic scattering (SHS) to probe the evolving EDL structure of anatase TiOâ‚‚ nanoparticles as a function of electrolyte concentration (LiCl, 0.1-100 mM). Our SHS measurements, sensitive to the inherent asymmetry of the interfacial region, reveal a non-linear decay of the interfacial potential with increasing ionic strength. Quantitative analysis of the SHS intensity versus ionic concentration enables the determination of the surface potential and the thickness of the diffuse ion layer. The results indicate a significant compression of the diffuse layer, consistent with classical EDL theory, yet the extracted surface potentials suggest specific ion effects that modulate the Stern layer capacitance. These findings underscore the critical role of ion-specific interactions in dictating the nanoscale electrostatics of metal oxide interfaces, with direct implications for designing optimized colloidal systems in photocatalytic and battery applications.
