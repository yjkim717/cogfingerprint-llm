Title: Unveiling the Role of Surface Diffusion in Interstellar Complex Organic Molecule Formation

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a pivotal process in astrochemistry, with significant implications for understanding the origins of life. Recent investigations have highlighted the crucial role of surface diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice surfaces in driving COM synthesis. Our study provides a quantitative insight into this phenomenon, determining an activation energy of 88 meV for carbon atom diffusion on interstellar ice analogues. This experimentally derived value underscores the feasibility of surface-mediated COM formation under astrophysical conditions. By elucidating the kinetic parameters governing this process, our research advances the understanding of interstellar chemistry and its contribution to the molecular complexity observed in star-forming regions. The findings have profound implications for modeling astrochemical networks and interpreting observations from contemporary telescopes, thereby refining our comprehension of the interstellar medium's chemical evolution in 2023 and beyond.
