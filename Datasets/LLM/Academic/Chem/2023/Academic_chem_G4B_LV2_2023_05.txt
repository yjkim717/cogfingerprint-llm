**Abstract**

The prevailing paradigms of interstellar chemistry necessitate a detailed understanding of molecular genesis within the frigid environments of interstellar ice grains. This research investigates the crucial role of surface diffusion in the formation of complex organic molecules, utilizing photostimulated desorption (PSD) as a sensitive diagnostic technique. We present evidence indicating that carbon atom diffusion, facilitated by thermal motion at temperatures exceeding 22 K, is a primary driver of molecular complexity. PSD measurements reveal a statistically significant increase in the production of larger, structurally intricate organic molecules following periods of sustained surface diffusion. 

Specifically, the observed desorption spectra demonstrate the formation of species indicative of aliphatic chains and potentially, aromatic compounds. These findings challenge prevailing models that primarily emphasize gas-phase chemistry as the dominant pathway for interstellar molecule synthesis.  Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of considering heterogeneous surface processes, particularly carbon diffusion, as a fundamental mechanism contributing to the observed abundance of complex organic molecules within interstellar space.  Future investigations will focus on characterizing the specific diffusion pathways and reaction mechanisms involved in this critical process.
