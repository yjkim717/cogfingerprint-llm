Title: Unveiling the Role of Surface Diffusion in Interstellar Complex Organic Molecule Formation

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a pivotal process in astrochemistry. Recent investigations have elucidated the crucial role of carbon atom mobility on interstellar ice surfaces in driving COM synthesis. Our study demonstrates that at temperatures exceeding 22 K, carbon atoms undergo significant surface diffusion, facilitating the formation of C-C bonds and subsequently, COMs. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques, we observed a marked increase in COM formation rates at elevated temperatures, underscoring the importance of surface diffusion in this process. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of interstellar chemistry, suggesting that the mobility of carbon atoms on ice surfaces is a key factor in the genesis of COMs. As such, this research contributes to a deeper understanding of the astrochemical processes governing the formation of complex organic species in interstellar environments.
