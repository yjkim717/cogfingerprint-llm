**Synthesis and Characterization of Anion-Directed Palladium(II) Cages via Ancillary Ligand Pairing**

The construction of well-defined, three-dimensional supramolecular architectures remains a significant challenge in coordination chemistry. This work reports the development of a novel synthetic strategy employing ancillary ligand pairings to generate complex palladium(II) cage structures exhibiting precise geometric control. Utilizing low-symmetry ligands, we demonstrate the directed self-assembly of lantern-shaped cages, leveraging subtle differences in ligand steric and electronic properties.  Specifically, the incorporation of strategically paired ligands dictates both the positional arrangement and the relative orientation of the palladium centers within the cage framework.  Detailed spectroscopic analysis, including X-ray crystallography, confirms the formation of discrete, hollow cages.  These findings highlight the potential of ancillary ligand manipulation as a powerful tool for templated synthesis and the creation of structurally intricate palladium complexes, offering a pathway toward advanced applications in catalysis and materials science.
