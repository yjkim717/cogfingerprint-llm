**Abstract:**

The burgeoning field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry increasingly relies on the construction of complex, discrete multinuclear architectures for applications ranging from catalysis to materials science. While considerable progress has been made in the synthesis of coordination cages, achieving precise control over the geometry and functionality of these assemblies remains a significant challenge. This work details a strategy for the rational design and synthesis of palladium(II) cages by leveraging the strategic incorporation of ancillary ligand pairings. Departing from traditional approaches that often yield symmetry-rich structures, we demonstrate the successful construction of heteroleptic palladium(II) assemblies exhibiting low symmetry and defined positional relationships between metal centers.

The methodology hinges on the careful selection of ancillary ligands possessing complementary binding motifs, enabling directed coordination and ultimately, cage self-assembly. We present a series of novel ligand combinations that promote the formation of well-defined cage structures, characterized by X-ray crystallography and spectroscopic techniques.  The impact of varying ancillary ligand electronic and steric properties on the resulting cage topology is explored. This approach provides unprecedented control over the spatial arrangement of metal centers within the cage framework, opening avenues for the incorporation of specific functionalities and the creation of tailored catalytic sites.  Future directions involve exploring the dynamic behaviour and responsive properties of these cages, positioning them as promising candidates for advanced applications in sensing and catalysis within the broader context of discrete metallo-assemblies.
