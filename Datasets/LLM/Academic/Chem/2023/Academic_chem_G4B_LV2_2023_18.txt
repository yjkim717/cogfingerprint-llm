**Abstract**

The prevalence of complex organic molecules (COMs) within interstellar space remains a central puzzle in astrochemistry. This study investigates the mechanistic role of surface diffusion in the formation of Câ€“C bonds, a critical step towards the synthesis of these intricate structures. Utilizing a model incorporating photostimulated desorption (PSD) as a sensitive probe, we demonstrate that carbon diffusion on interstellar ices significantly facilitates the formation of extended carbon chains. PSD, triggered by ultraviolet radiation, selectively removes carbon-containing species formed via surface diffusion, allowing for the quantification of diffusion-driven bond formation rates. 

Our findings reveal a positive correlation between carbon diffusion distances and the abundance of larger, more complex organic molecules detected in simulated interstellar ices. Specifically, we observed enhanced production of mid-chain hydrocarbons under conditions promoting extended surface diffusion. This suggests that surface diffusion, operating under the influence of stellar radiation, serves as a primary catalyst for the initial carbon-carbon bond assembly, ultimately contributing to the observed diversity of COMs.  Further investigation employing isotopic labeling and higher fidelity simulations is warranted to fully elucidate the intricacies of this fundamental process in interstellar chemistry.
