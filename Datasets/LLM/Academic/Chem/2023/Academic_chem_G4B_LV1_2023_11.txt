**Abstract**

The synthesis of complex metallosupramolecular architectures continues to drive innovation in coordination chemistry. This study reports the development of a novel strategy employing ancillary ligand pairings to construct highly ordered palladium(II) cage complexes. Utilizing a carefully designed series of bidentate ligands, we demonstrate the directed self-assembly of lantern-shaped cages exhibiting precise positional and orientational control. The incorporation of ancillary ligands, strategically selected for steric and electronic complementarity, facilitates the formation of stable, discrete units. Spectroscopic analysis, including ¹H and ¹³C NMR, confirms the successful construction of these heteroleptic cages.  Furthermore, computational modeling provides insight into the coordination geometry and potential for further functionalization. These results highlight the utility of ancillary ligand pairings as a versatile tool for templated assembly, offering a pathway to sophisticated metallosupramolecular systems with tunable properties and potential applications in catalysis and molecular recognition, as demonstrated in preliminary investigations conducted throughout 2023.
