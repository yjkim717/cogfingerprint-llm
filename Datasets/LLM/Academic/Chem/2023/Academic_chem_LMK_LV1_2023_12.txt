Title: Exploring the Frontiers of Polariton Chemistry: A Review of Theoretical Advances in Molecular Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by the prospect of manipulating chemical reactivity and photochemical processes through strong light-matter interactions. As a subfield of quantum electrodynamics, molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding the complex interplay between molecular systems and electromagnetic radiation. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical advances in polariton chemistry, with a particular emphasis on the vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regime.

Recent theoretical developments have enabled the accurate simulation of molecular systems strongly coupled to cavity modes, revealing novel insights into the modification of chemical reactivity and photochemical pathways. The application of quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT) and other non-perturbative methods has allowed researchers to explore the intricate interplay between molecular vibrations, electronic transitions, and cavity modes. These advances have, in turn, facilitated the investigation of various phenomena, including the suppression of photochemical reactions, the enhancement of energy transfer, and the modification of molecular thermodynamics.

Despite the significant progress made in the field, several challenges remain to be addressed. The accurate description of dissipative processes, the treatment of complex molecular systems, and the development of efficient computational algorithms continue to be pressing concerns. Furthermore, the experimental realization of VSC in a wide range of systems has highlighted the need for more sophisticated theoretical models that can capture the nuances of real-world cavity environments.

This review provides a critical examination of the current state of theoretical research in polariton chemistry, highlighting both the successes and the challenges that lie ahead. By synthesizing the latest advances in molecular cavity QED and VSC, we aim to provide a roadmap for future research in this exciting and rapidly evolving field. As the field continues to mature, it is anticipated that the insights gained from theoretical studies will play an increasingly important role in guiding experimental efforts and unlocking the full potential of polariton chemistry.
