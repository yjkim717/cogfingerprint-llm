Here we report the strategic design of bifunctionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) engineered for enhanced electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction. By implementing a dual-functionalization approach that combines tailored imine-based linkages with judiciously selected aromatic building blocks, we constructed crystalline porous polymers with optimized electronic environments and substrate affinity. The framework architecture facilitates efficient charge transport while the precisely positioned amine functionalities promote CO₂ activation through dipole–doulomb interactions. Systematic electrochemical characterization reveals that these modified COFs achieve exceptional performance in aqueous electrolyte, attaining Faradaic efficiencies exceeding 85% for carbon monoxide production at moderate overpotentials. Post-synthetic modification further enabled fine-tuning of the catalytic microenvironment, significantly improving operational stability over extended electrolysis periods. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations confirm that the synergistic interplay between the engineered linkage chemistry and aromatic core modification lowers the activation barrier for the rate-determining step. This molecular-level engineering strategy provides a versatile platform for developing advanced organic electrocatalysts that bridge the gap between heterogeneous practicality and molecular precision, offering new pathways for sustainable energy conversion technologies.
