Title: Unveiling the Role of Surface Diffusion in the Formation of Complex Organic Molecules on Interstellar Ice

Abstract:

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a longstanding puzzle in astrochemistry. Recent experimental investigations have shed light on the crucial role of surface diffusion in driving the synthesis of COMs on interstellar ice surfaces. Our study demonstrates that carbon atoms diffuse on amorphous water ice surfaces above 22 K, facilitating the formation of COMs via barrierless reactions. Using temperature-programmed desorption and reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy, we monitored the diffusion and reaction of carbon atoms with co-adsorbed species on interstellar ice analogues. Our results indicate that surface diffusion enables the efficient formation of COMs, such as CH3CHO and HCOOCH3, at temperatures relevant to cold dark clouds and protostellar envelopes. These findings underscore the significance of surface diffusion in driving the chemical complexity observed in interstellar environments, providing new insights into the origins of COMs and their role in the astrochemical evolution of star-forming regions.
