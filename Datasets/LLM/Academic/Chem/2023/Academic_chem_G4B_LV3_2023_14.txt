**Abstract**

Interstellar environments represent a unique laboratory for the chemical genesis of prebiotic molecules. This study investigates the mechanistic underpinnings of complex organic molecule formation within interstellar ice grains, focusing specifically on the role of atomic carbon diffusion. Utilizing computational modeling and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that carbon diffusion, significantly enhanced above 22 K, is a primary driver of C–C bond formation.  The observed diffusion pathways are intimately linked to photostimulated desorption events, whereby energetic photons facilitate the release of carbon atoms from ice surfaces.  These liberated carbon atoms subsequently engage in condensation reactions, leading to the progressive accumulation of increasingly complex organic species.  Our findings suggest that this dynamic interplay between thermal activation, desorption, and diffusion constitutes a fundamental process in the delivery of building blocks for life within interstellar space, warranting further investigation into the specific molecular architectures formed under these extreme conditions.
