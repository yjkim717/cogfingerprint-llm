**Abstract:**

The burgeoning field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry increasingly demands sophisticated synthetic strategies to access complex, well-defined coordination architectures. This work reports a novel methodology for the construction of palladium(II) supramolecular cages exhibiting enhanced structural control through the strategic implementation of complementary ligand pairings. Departing from traditional approaches relying on symmetrical ligands, we demonstrate the successful synthesis of heteroleptic palladium(II) assemblies utilizing a design protocol predicated on precise ancillary ligand coordination and directional self-assembly. The key innovation lies in the selection of low-symmetry ligands that, when combined, enforce specific positional and orientational relationships during the cage formation process.

Specifically, we investigate the interplay between two distinct classes of ancillary ligands – a directing group and a bridging unit – to dictate the overall cage geometry. Computational modeling, coupled with spectroscopic (NMR, UV-Vis) and crystallographic characterization, confirms the formation of robust, well-defined cage structures with unprecedented levels of positional isomer control. The deliberate choice of ligand functionalities enables the fine-tuning of cage properties, including cavity size and potential for guest encapsulation.  This approach not only expands the repertoire of accessible palladium(II) cage architectures but also provides a versatile platform for developing functional supramolecular systems with applications in catalysis, sensing, and materials science. Further studies are underway to explore the incorporation of redox-active components and stimuli-responsive functionalities within these heteroleptic assemblies, paving the way for dynamic and adaptable metallo-supramolecular materials.
