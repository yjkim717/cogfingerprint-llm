The development of efficient and durable bifunctional oxygen electrocatalysts is critical for advancing metal-air battery technologies, particularly rechargeable zinc-air batteries (ZABs). While Fe-N-C materials have shown considerable promise for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), their performance in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) often remains insufficient for practical applications. This work demonstrates that the strategic incorporation of phosphorus heteroatoms into the carbon matrix of Fe-N-C catalysts significantly enhances their bifunctional activity. Through a controlled synthesis and subsequent pyrolysis process, we achieve atomic-level modification of the catalyst's electronic structure. Comprehensive electrochemical characterization confirms a substantial reduction in the OER overpotential while maintaining excellent ORR performance, leading to a markedly decreased overall oxygen electrode potential gap. When integrated into a rechargeable ZAB, the P-modified Fe-N-C catalyst enables a high peak power density and exceptional cycling stability, outperforming its unmodified counterpart and benchmark noble-metal catalysts. These findings establish phosphorus incorporation as a powerful strategy for engineering high-performance, non-precious metal electrocatalysts for next-generation energy conversion and storage systems.
