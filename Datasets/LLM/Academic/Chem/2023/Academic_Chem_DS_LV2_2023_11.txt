**Abstract**

The construction of discrete, heteroleptic metallo-supramolecular architectures represents a significant challenge in inorganic chemistry, primarily due to the inherent propensity for statistical ligand scrambling and the formation of homoleptic byproducts. While high-symmetry ligands have enabled the assembly of numerous elegant cages, the integration of multiple, structurally distinct, low-symmetry ligands into a single, well-defined entity remains an underexplored frontier. This limitation restricts access to complexes with sophisticated functionalities derived from spatially segregated chemical environments. Herein, we report a robust synthetic strategy for the assembly of heteroleptic Pd(II) coordination cages comprising four unique low-symmetry ligands. Our approach is predicated on the strategic use of complementary ligand pairings, where carefully designed ancillary ligands direct the orthogonal coordination of two different, low-symmetry primary ligands around a palladium(II) ion vertex. This methodology effectively overcomes the entropic and thermodynamic driving forces for statistical mixture formation, ensuring high-fidelity self-assembly. The resulting heteroleptic cages were characterized by multi-nuclear NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography, unambiguously confirming their structural integrity and composition. This work establishes a generalizable paradigm for the rational design of complex, multi-component supramolecular systems, paving the way for advanced applications in asymmetric catalysis, molecular recognition, and the development of functional materials with bespoke internal cavities.
