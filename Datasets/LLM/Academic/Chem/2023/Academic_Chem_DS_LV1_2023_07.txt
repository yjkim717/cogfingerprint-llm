**Abstract**

The construction of discrete heteroleptic metal-organic architectures with precisely positioned multiple low-symmetry components remains a formidable challenge in supramolecular chemistry. Traditional self-assembly strategies, often reliant on high-symmetry ligands, afford limited control over compositional diversity within a single structure. Herein, we report a rational design strategy for the synthesis of a series of palladium(II)-based coordination cages with four distinct, spatially segregated low-symmetry ligands. Our approach hinges on the strategic implementation of complementary, geometrically mismatched ligand pairings. By employing a combination of ditopic ligands with divergent angular metrics and carefully selected ancillary ligands, we direct the self-assembly process away from statistical mixtures and toward a single, well-defined heteroleptic Pd₄L₂L'₂ cage. Spectroscopic and X-ray diffraction analyses confirm the formation of the target assemblies with high fidelity. This methodology, which provides unprecedented positional control over multiple functionalities within a confined three-dimensional space, establishes a new paradigm for constructing complex, multifunctional molecular containers with potential applications in cooperative catalysis and selective guest encapsulation.
