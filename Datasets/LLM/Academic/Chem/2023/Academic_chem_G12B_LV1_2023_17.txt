**Abstract: Experimental Determination of Carbon Diffusion Activation Energy on Interstellar Ice Analogues and Implications for Complex Organic Molecule Formation**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments remains a central challenge in astrochemistry. While gas-phase synthetic routes are well-studied, the crucial role of icy grain surfaces as reaction platforms is increasingly recognized. This work presents experimental measurements of the activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>) for carbon atom diffusion on amorphous water ice, a prevalent analogue of interstellar ice mantles. Using a novel low-temperature ultra-high vacuum (UHV) surface diffusion experiment, we monitored the temporal evolution of deposited carbon atoms via reflection analysis infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) at temperatures ranging from 10 K to 40 K.  Kinetic analysis of the observed diffusion profiles yielded an E<sub>a</sub> of 18 Â± 2 meV, significantly lower than previously estimated values derived from theoretical calculations.

This experimentally derived activation energy suggests a more facile pathway for carbon atom incorporation into existing organic species adsorbed on interstellar ices, potentially facilitating C-C bond formation and the subsequent growth of COM precursors.  The relatively low energy barrier implies that even at the extremely low temperatures characteristic of interstellar molecular clouds, carbon diffusion can occur at a significant rate, providing a crucial mechanism for enhancing molecular complexity.  Our findings support the hypothesis that surface diffusion, coupled with reactive collisions, constitutes a dominant route for the observed abundance of complex organic molecules detected in star-forming regions. Further investigation of diffusion behavior involving other relevant interstellar elements (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen) is warranted to fully elucidate the surface chemistry driving interstellar organic synthesis.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Terminology:** I've used terms like "amorphous water ice," "ultra-high vacuum (UHV)," "reflection analysis infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS)," "activation energy (E<sub>a</sub>)," and "COMs" to establish a formal, scientific tone.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical structure:
    *   **Context/Problem:** Introduces the challenge of COM formation and the importance of icy grain surfaces.
    *   **Methodology:** Briefly describes the experimental approach (low-temperature UHV, RAIRS, kinetic analysis).
    *   **Results:** Presents the key finding (E<sub>a</sub> value and its uncertainty).
    *   **Interpretation/Implications:** Explains the significance of the result (facilitates C-C bond formation, supports surface diffusion as a key mechanism).
    *   **Future Directions:** Suggests avenues for future research.
*   **2023 Context:** While astrochemistry is a continually evolving field, the focus on surface chemistry and the use of sophisticated experimental techniques like RAIRS are well-aligned with current research trends.
*   **Potential Development:**
    *   **Specific Ice Composition:**  The abstract mentions "amorphous water ice."  Specifying the HDO/H<sub>2</sub>O
