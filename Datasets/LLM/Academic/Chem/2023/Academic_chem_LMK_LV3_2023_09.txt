Title: Elucidating the Role of Surface Diffusion in Interstellar Organic Chemistry

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments has long been a topic of significant interest in astrochemistry. Recent experimental investigations have shed light on the pivotal role of surface diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice surfaces in driving COM synthesis at low temperatures. Our study (2023) provides further insight into this phenomenon, demonstrating that the mobility of carbon atoms on these surfaces facilitates the formation of diverse organic compounds. Utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques, we observe the efficient diffusion of carbon atoms on amorphous ice substrates, leading to the creation of complex molecular structures. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of interstellar chemistry, suggesting that surface diffusion-mediated processes play a crucial role in the genesis of COMs. Our results contribute to the evolving narrative on the astrochemical origins of complex organic matter, underscoring the significance of surface dynamics in shaping the chemical landscape of interstellar environments.
