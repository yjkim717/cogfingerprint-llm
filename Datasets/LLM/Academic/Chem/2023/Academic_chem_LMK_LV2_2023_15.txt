Title: Strategic Assembly of Heteroleptic Palladium(II) Cages via Complementary Ancillary Ligand Pairings

Abstract:
The synthesis of complex metallo-supramolecular architectures with precise control over their composition and structure remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report a novel approach to access heteroleptic palladium(II) cages by exploiting complementary ancillary ligand pairings. By designing low-symmetry ligands with tailored ancillary interactions, we demonstrate the formation of discrete heteroleptic assemblies with predetermined stoichiometry. The strategic combination of ligands featuring orthogonal binding motifs enables the hierarchical assembly of complex architectures, thereby expanding the scope of metallo-supramolecular chemistry. Our results showcase the potential of ancillary pairings in directing the self-assembly of palladium(II) cages, offering a versatile platform for the construction of sophisticated supramolecular structures with bespoke properties. This methodology is anticipated to facilitate the development of novel functional materials and provide insights into the intricate interplay between molecular structure and supramolecular organization.
