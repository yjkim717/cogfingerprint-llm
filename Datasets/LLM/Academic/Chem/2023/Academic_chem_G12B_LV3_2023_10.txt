**Abstract**

Recent experimental investigations into interstellar chemistry reveal a crucial pathway for organic molecule complexity formation within low-temperature astrophysical environments. Molpeceres (2023) provides direct evidence of carbon atom surface diffusion on interstellar ice grains at cryogenic temperatures as low as 22 K. This observation challenges prior assumptions regarding the kinetic limitations of carbon-carbon bond formation in such conditions. The demonstrated mobility of individual carbon atoms on ice surfaces promotes efficient incorporation into existing organic frameworks, bypassing traditional gas-phase reaction bottlenecks. These findings have significant implications for understanding the chemical evolution of translucent clouds and protoplanetary disks, suggesting that surface chemistry plays a more prominent role than previously considered in the synthesis of complex organic molecules. The research underscores the importance of surface diffusion processes in the broader context of astrochemistry and the emergence of prebiotic building blocks.
