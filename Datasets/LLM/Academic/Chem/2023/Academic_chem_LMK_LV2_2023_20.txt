Title: Advances in Polariton Chemistry and Molecular Cavity QED: Theoretical Perspectives

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by the prospect of manipulating photochemical reactions through quantum light-matter interactions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical advancements in polariton chemistry and molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) in 2023. We examine the latest developments in methodologies and applications, with a particular focus on vibrational strong coupling.

Theoretical frameworks have been instrumental in elucidating the complex interplay between molecular systems and quantized electromagnetic fields within cavities. Recent studies have made significant strides in understanding the role of cavity-mediated interactions in modulating chemical reactivity and photochemical processes. We discuss the application of advanced theoretical methods, such as quantum master equations and cavity-QED, in describing the dynamics of polariton systems.

A critical aspect of this review is the examination of vibrational strong coupling, a regime where the coherent exchange of energy between vibrational modes and cavity photons becomes significant. Theoretical models have been developed to capture the essential features of this phenomenon, including the emergence of novel vibrational polariton states and their impact on chemical reaction kinetics.

This review provides a timely summary of the current state of theoretical research in polariton chemistry and molecular cavity QED. We highlight the potential implications of these advances for the field of photochemistry and outline future directions for theoretical investigations. By synthesizing the latest theoretical developments, this review aims to provide a foundation for further research into the manipulation of chemical reactions through quantum light-matter interactions.
