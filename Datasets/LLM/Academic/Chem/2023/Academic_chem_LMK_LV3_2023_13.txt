Title: Investigating the Role of Surface Diffusion in the Formation of Complex Organic Molecules on Interstellar Ice

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a crucial aspect of astrochemistry. Recent experimental investigations (2023) have elucidated the pivotal role of surface diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice in driving COM formation. At temperatures exceeding 22 K, the mobility of carbon atoms on ice surfaces facilitates the synthesis of COMs, underscoring the significance of surface diffusion in interstellar chemistry. This study provides empirical evidence for the hitherto theoretically predicted surface-mediated formation pathway of COMs. The results demonstrate that the increased mobility of carbon atoms at elevated temperatures enables the formation of complex molecular structures, thereby shedding light on the molecular processes governing the emergence of COMs in interstellar space. These findings have far-reaching implications for our understanding of the astrochemical origins of complex organic molecules.
