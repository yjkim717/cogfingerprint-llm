**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry continues to demand innovative synthetic strategies for constructing complex coordination architectures. This work introduces a refined methodology for the de novo synthesis of palladium(II) cages exhibiting unprecedented control over ligand placement and orientation. Our approach leverages strategically designed ancillary ligand pairings to direct the self-assembly process, resulting in heteroleptic assemblies characterized by low-symmetry coordination environments. By carefully selecting complementary ligands with disparate binding affinities and spatial requirements, we achieve a level of positional and orientational control previously challenging to attain in palladium(II) cage construction. This methodology circumvents limitations inherent in traditional approaches that often yield mixtures of isomeric products. The resultant cages, synthesized in 2023, demonstrate potential utility as building blocks for functional materials and catalytic scaffolds, offering avenues for future investigation into host-guest chemistry and controlled release applications. Further investigations will focus on exploring the impact of ancillary ligand modifications on cage stability and reactivity.
