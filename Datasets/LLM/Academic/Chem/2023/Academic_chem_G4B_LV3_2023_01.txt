**Abstract**

Interstellar chemistry remains a critical area of investigation into the origins of complex organic molecules. This study presents compelling evidence that atomic carbon diffusion on icy grain surfaces, specifically at temperatures exceeding 22 K, represents a primary driver of molecular complexity. Utilizing computational modeling and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that thermally activated carbon atoms readily diffuse across ice grain interfaces, facilitating C–C bond formation.  Crucially, this process is coupled with photostimulated desorption, whereby energetic photons induce the release of these nascent carbon fragments, promoting further reaction pathways.  The resultant cascade of reactions yields a significant enrichment of complex organic molecules – precursors to prebiotic chemistry – within interstellar ices.  These findings suggest that icy grain surfaces provide a dynamic and energetically favorable environment for the spontaneous assembly of intricate molecular architectures, fundamentally impacting the chemical inventory of interstellar clouds.
