**Abstract**

Recent theoretical investigations into polariton chemistry and molecular cavity QED have witnessed significant progress, demanding refined methodologies for accurate simulation and manipulation of quantum light-matter interactions. This review synthesizes advancements in *ab initio* QED calculations and their application to understanding collective phenomena within molecular cavities. Specifically, we examine sophisticated techniques for characterizing polariton states – exciton-polariton hybrids – driven by resonant cavity fields.  The interplay between molecular excitation and cavity photon modes is increasingly leveraged to engineer photochemical reactions, demonstrating enhanced efficiency and selectivity through controlled resonance conditions.  Furthermore, we address the inherent complexities in translating theoretical predictions to experimental observations, highlighting the need for improved spectroscopic probes and advanced data analysis.  Challenges remain in fully accounting for environmental decoherence and non-Markovian dynamics, necessitating further development of coupled quantum electrodynamics and many-body theories.  Future research will likely focus on exploiting these collective coupling regimes for novel quantum control strategies in chemical systems.
