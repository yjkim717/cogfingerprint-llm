**Abstract**

The modulation of protein phase behavior by macromolecular crowding represents a pivotal mechanism in cellular organization and stability. In this study, we investigate the influence of synthetic crowding agents on the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of bovine serum albumin (BSA) under physiologically relevant conditions. Our findings demonstrate that elevated concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000) significantly enhance the formation of BSA-rich biomolecular condensates, as characterized by turbidity assays and confocal microscopy. These crowded environments effectively suppress amyloid-like fibril formation at hydrophobic interfaces, a process typically accelerated in dilute solutions. Spectroscopic analyses, including circular dichroism and thioflavin T fluorescence, reveal that the crowded milieu within the condensates preserves the native α-helical conformation of BSA while markedly reducing β-sheet-rich aggregate nucleation over extended periods. The observed kinetic stabilization is attributed to the excluded volume effects of crowders, which favor compact, soluble states over extended fibrillar assemblies. These results underscore the critical role of molecular crowding in regulating protein solubility and aggregation pathways, with implications for designing crowding-mimetic strategies to inhibit pathological protein deposition in biotechnological and therapeutic contexts.
