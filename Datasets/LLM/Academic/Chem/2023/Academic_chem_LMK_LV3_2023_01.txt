Title: Elucidating the Role of Surface Diffusion in Interstellar Organic Chemistry: A Mechanistic Insight into Complex Molecule Formation

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a pivotal process in understanding the origins of organic chemistry in the Universe. Recent studies have underscored the significance of surface diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice mantles at low temperatures. Through a combination of theoretical modeling and experimental validation, this research elucidates the mechanistic pathways by which surface diffusion drives COM formation. Our findings indicate that the mobility of carbon atoms on ice surfaces facilitates the synthesis of complex molecules, thereby influencing the astrochemical evolution of star-forming regions. The results provide a nuanced understanding of the interplay between surface processes and interstellar chemistry, shedding light on the molecular precursors to life. This study advances our comprehension of the complex chemistry underlying the emergence of life in the Universe, with implications for the search for extraterrestrial life.
