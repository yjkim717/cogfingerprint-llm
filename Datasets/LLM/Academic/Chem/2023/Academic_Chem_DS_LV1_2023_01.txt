**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium (ISM) represents a critical stage in prebiotic chemical evolution. While gas-phase reactions are well-studied, the role of solid-state chemistry on icy grain mantles remains less constrained, particularly regarding the initial steps of carbon backbone assembly. This investigation employs kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, informed by recent laboratory data, to model the surface diffusion and reactivity of atomic carbon on water-dominated ices under conditions representative of translucent molecular clouds. Our results demonstrate that carbon atoms become significantly mobile at temperatures exceeding 22 K, a regime where heavier species like CO remain immobilized. This mobility facilitates non-thermal, barrier-mediated reactions with other carbon-bearing species, directly leading to Câ€“C bond formation. We identify this process as a dominant, low-temperature pathway for initiating molecular complexity, effectively bypassing the kinetic limitations of traditional radical-radical association mechanisms. The ensuing carbon-chain growth provides a foundational reservoir for more complex functionalized species upon subsequent processing by UV photons and cosmic rays. These findings necessitate a revision of current astrochemical networks to include the active role of atomic carbon diffusion, positioning it as a primary driver of chemical complexity in cold interstellar environments.
