Of particular significance in the field of astrochemistry is the formation pathway of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the cold, dense environments of interstellar ices. While many COMs are observed, the mechanisms enabling their synthesis at cryogenic temperatures remain inadequately constrained. This investigation employs kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to quantitatively model the surface diffusion of carbon atoms on amorphous water ice, a predominant component of interstellar grain mantles. Our results demonstrate that carbon atom mobility becomes non-negligible at temperatures exceeding approximately 22 K, with a calculated activation energy for diffusion of 142 ± 15 K. This mobility facilitates reactive encounters with other adsorbed precursors, most critically enabling the formation of new C–C bonds, which serve as the foundational step for molecular complexity. We propose that this previously underestimated diffusion-driven chemistry represents a dominant non-energetic pathway for initiating carbon-chain growth in dark molecular clouds. These findings necessitate a revision of current astrochemical models, underscoring the critical role of light atomic species diffusion in driving molecular complexity in the interstellar medium prior to the onset of star formation.
