Herein, we report a novel synthetic strategy for the construction of a heteroleptic Pd(II) lantern-shaped cage, a significant advancement in metallo-supramolecular chemistry. Traditional assemblies often rely on high-symmetry ligands, limiting structural complexity and functional group placement. Our 2023 study overcomes this by employing an "ancillary pairings" methodology, utilizing four distinct low-symmetry ligands. This design enables precise spatial control over the final architecture. The assembly's integrity is governed by complementary denticity, ensuring correct metal-ligand coordination, while strategically positioned hydrogen bonding motifs provide an additional thermodynamic driving force for the heteroleptic structure. This synergistic approach yields unprecedented positional and orientational control over each ligand within the cage framework, a feat not achievable with conventional homoleptic systems. Spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analyses confirm the formation of the discrete, well-defined lantern complex. This work establishes a general paradigm for engineering complex, low-symmetry supramolecular systems with tailored internal environments, opening new avenues for applications in molecular recognition, catalysis, and the development of sophisticated functional materials.
