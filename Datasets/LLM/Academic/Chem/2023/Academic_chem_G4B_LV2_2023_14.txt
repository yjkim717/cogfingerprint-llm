**Abstract: Surface Diffusion of Carbon Atoms as a Catalyst for Complex Organic Molecule Synthesis in Interstellar Environments**

The prevalence of complex organic molecules (COMs) within interstellar space remains a fundamental puzzle in astrochemistry. Current models often struggle to adequately explain the observed abundance and structural diversity of these molecules. This study posits that surface diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice grains, significantly enhanced at temperatures above 22 K, represents a critical, previously underappreciated mechanism driving COM formation. Utilizing kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that thermally activated carbon atoms readily migrate across the icy surfaces, facilitating the sequential addition of hydrogen and other volatile species. 

Specifically, our simulations reveal a pathway wherein these mobile carbon centers act as nucleation sites, promoting the condensation and subsequent polymerization of precursor molecules. The observed temperature dependence of diffusion rates directly correlates with the increased accessibility of reactive sites on the ice. These findings suggest that the heterogeneous surface environment of interstellar ice grains, characterized by dynamic carbon diffusion, fundamentally shapes the chemical landscape of molecular formation.  This perspective offers a compelling alternative to purely gas-phase synthesis models and warrants further investigation regarding the specific ice compositions and observational signatures indicative of this surface-driven chemical evolution.  Further research in 2024 will focus on incorporating spectroscopic data to validate these simulation results.
