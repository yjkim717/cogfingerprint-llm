**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, situated at the confluence of quantum optics, condensed matter physics, and theoretical chemistry, has emerged as a transformative paradigm for manipulating chemical reactivity and material properties. By confining molecular ensembles within optical cavities, strong light-matter coupling gives rise to hybrid quasi-particles known as polaritons, which possess altered potential energy landscapes and novel photophysical properties distinct from their bare molecular constituents. This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of the foundational theoretical frameworks and computational methodologies underpinning modern polariton chemistry, with a specific focus on the molecular cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) perspective. We critically examine the ab initio QED approach, which provides a first-principles, non-empirical route to describe these complex quantum phenomena, thereby enabling the predictive design of cavity-modified chemical systems. A central theme of our discussion addresses the resolution of long-standing gauge ambiguitiesâ€”the apparent dependence of physical observables on the choice of electromagnetic gauge (e.g., Coulomb vs. dipole gauges) in truncated Hilbert spaces. We elucidate recent theoretical advances that reconcile these ambiguities, establishing a consistent and gauge-invariant framework essential for reliable numerical simulations and a rigorous physical interpretation. Furthermore, we survey the application of these theoretical tools to demonstrate the potential for profound control over chemical dynamics, including the suppression or enhancement of reaction rates, selective vibrational energy redistribution, and the modification of conical intersections. By bridging fundamental quantum light-matter interactions with practical chemical applications, this review aims to chart a course for future theoretical developments and experimental validations in the quest to harness quantum optical environments for tailored chemical synthesis and control.
