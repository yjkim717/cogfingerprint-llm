This study reports the development of a heterogeneous catalytic system employing ligand-free iridium nanoparticles for the regioselective hydrogenation of phosphine oxides. The catalyst demonstrates exceptional activity and selectivity toward the synthesis of octahydro-binaphthyl (H8-BINAP) derivatives, a class of privileged chiral ligands. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the exposed iridium facets govern the observed regioselectivity, enabling preferential reduction at sterically hindered positions. The catalyst exhibits remarkable stability under hydrogenation conditions and maintains consistent performance over multiple reaction cycles without significant metal leaching or aggregation. This recyclable, ligand-free approach provides a sustainable pathway for accessing valuable chiral phosphine ligands, circumventing the need for homogeneous catalysts and complex ligand designs. The methodology represents a significant advancement in nanoparticle-catalyzed asymmetric synthesis, offering both economic and environmental benefits for pharmaceutical and fine chemical manufacturing.
