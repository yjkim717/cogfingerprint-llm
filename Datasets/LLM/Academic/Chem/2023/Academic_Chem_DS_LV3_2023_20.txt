**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, situated at the confluence of molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) and photochemistry, represents a paradigm shift for controlling quantum light-matter interactions. By confining molecules within optical cavities, hybrid light-matter states—polaritons—are formed, which can fundamentally alter molecular properties and reaction pathways. This 2023 review synthesizes critical theoretical advancements in this domain, with a particular focus on resolving long-standing gauge ambiguities inherent in the quantization of the electromagnetic field when coupled to molecular systems. The arbitrary choice between the Coulomb, dipole, and multipolar gauges has historically led to divergent predictions for physical observables, creating a significant barrier to the development of a robust, first-principles understanding of polaritonic phenomena. We systematically dissect these gauge issues, demonstrating how modern formulations of *ab initio* QED provide a unified framework that ensures gauge invariance across different regimes of interaction strength. This theoretical consolidation is pivotal for the accurate computational modeling of polaritonic systems. We subsequently survey the evolving landscape of computational methods, highlighting how *ab initio* QED approaches are being integrated with electronic structure theory to simulate the nuanced dynamics of molecules under strong and ultrastrong coupling. The practical implications of these theoretical frameworks are explored through key applications, including the manipulation of photochemical reactions—such as energy transfer and isomerization yields—and the emerging field of vibrational strong coupling, which offers a powerful tool for modifying ground-state chemical landscapes and reaction rates without external heating. Despite rapid progress, significant challenges remain, including the scalable simulation of collective effects in large molecular ensembles, the precise treatment of dissipative environments, and the experimental verification of theoretically predicted catalytic effects. This review thus not only charts the current theoretical frontiers of molecular cavity QED but also outlines a roadmap for future research aimed at harnessing polaritons for tailored chemical synthesis and energy conversion technologies.
