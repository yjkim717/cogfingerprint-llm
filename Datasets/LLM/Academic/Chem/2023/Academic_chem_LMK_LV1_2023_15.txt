Title: Strategic Assembly of Heteroleptic Pd(II) Cages via Complementary Ancillary Ligand Pairings: A Modular Approach to Supramolecular Complexity

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry has witnessed significant advances in the design and synthesis of complex architectures, with Pd(II)-based assemblies being particularly prominent. However, the construction of heteroleptic Pd(II) cages, comprising multiple distinct ligand types, remains a challenging task due to the inherent difficulties in controlling the self-assembly process. Herein, we report a novel strategy for the synthesis of intricate heteroleptic Pd(II) cages leveraging the concept of ancillary complementary ligand pairings. By judiciously selecting ligand combinations with tailored steric and electronic properties, we demonstrate the formation of discrete, low-symmetry Pd(II) cages through a modular assembly process. The ancillary ligand pairs, designed to interact favorably with one another, facilitate the organization of multiple ligands around the Pd(II) centers, thereby enabling the creation of complex supramolecular architectures. This approach not only expands the repertoire of accessible heteroleptic Pd(II) cages but also provides a versatile platform for exploring the intricate interplay between ligand design, metal coordination, and supramolecular assembly. Crystallographic and spectroscopic analyses confirm the structural integrity and uniqueness of the resulting assemblies, underscoring the efficacy of our strategy in navigating the complexities of metallo-supramolecular chemistry. This work represents a significant step forward in the rational design of sophisticated supramolecular structures, with potential implications for applications in catalysis, molecular recognition, and beyond.
