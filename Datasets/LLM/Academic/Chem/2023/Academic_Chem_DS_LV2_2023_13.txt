Of particular significance in the field of astrochemistry is the formation pathway of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the extreme conditions of the interstellar medium. While gas-phase reactions are well-characterized, the role of solid-state chemistry on icy grain mantles remains less understood, particularly concerning the initial steps of carbon backbone assembly. This investigation demonstrates that the surface diffusion of atomic carbon on amorphous solid water ice becomes significant at temperatures exceeding 22 K. Through kinetic Monte Carlo simulations informed by density functional theory calculations of diffusion barriers, we quantify the non-negligible mobility of carbon atoms under such conditions. This mobility facilitates reactive encounters with other adsorbed precursors, such as CO, CH3, and other carbon species. Crucially, our results establish that this diffusion-driven process is a dominant mechanism for the formation of nascent Câ€“C bonds, a fundamental step in molecular complexity. This finding provides a critical, previously underestimated, non-energetic pathway for building molecular complexity in cold molecular clouds, directly linking the physical behavior of a fundamental atom to the chemical evolution of prebiotic species in space.
