Title: Advances in Polariton Chemistry: Harnessing Quantum Electrodynamics for Photochemical Control

Abstract:
Recent breakthroughs in polariton chemistry and molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) have revolutionized our understanding of light-matter interactions and their implications for photochemical reactions. This review highlights the latest theoretical advancements in simulating and manipulating chemical reactivity within optical cavities. By integrating principles from quantum electrodynamics and photochemistry, novel methodologies have emerged to control photochemical pathways and reaction rates. The strong coupling between molecular excitations and cavity photons gives rise to polaritons, hybrid light-matter states that enable the tailoring of potential energy landscapes. As a result, cavity QED has become a powerful tool for modulating photochemical reactions, offering unprecedented opportunities for optimizing reaction outcomes. This review provides an overview of the current state of the field, discussing key theoretical developments and their applications in polariton chemistry, with a focus on the latest research as of 2023.
