Title: Strategically Controlled Assembly of Heteroleptic Palladium(II) Cages via Low-Symmetry Ligands

Abstract:
The precise synthesis of complex metallo-supramolecular architectures remains a significant challenge in the field of metallo-supramolecular chemistry. Here, we report a novel approach to accessing heteroleptic palladium(II) cages with high positional and orientational control, utilizing low-symmetry ligands in conjunction with carefully selected ancillary ligand pairings. By judiciously designing the ligand framework and exploiting the inherent coordination preferences of palladium(II) centers, we demonstrate the assembly of complex heteroleptic cages with predefined structural attributes. This strategic approach enables the formation of discrete, low-symmetry architectures that are otherwise difficult to access through traditional self-assembly methods. The presented methodology offers a new paradigm for the rational design and synthesis of intricate metallo-supramolecular assemblies, expanding the scope of supramolecular chemistry and its potential applications. Our findings underscore the potential of low-symmetry ligands in constructing complex, functional supramolecular architectures.
