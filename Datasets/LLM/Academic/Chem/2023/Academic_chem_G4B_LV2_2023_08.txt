**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry is rapidly establishing itself as a powerful tool for manipulating and controlling photophysical and photochemical processes, driven by advancements in molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (MC-QED). This review synthesizes recent theoretical developments within this domain, highlighting innovative methodologies and exploring their expanding applications while acknowledging persistent challenges. Polaritons, hybrid quasiparticles arising from the strong coupling between photons and excitons in a cavity environment, offer a unique platform for circumventing traditional energy transfer limitations and accessing novel reaction pathways. 

Specifically, we examine theoretical frameworks employed to model polariton dynamics, including multi-mode approaches and sophisticated numerical simulations, crucial for understanding strong coupling regimes. Furthermore, we detail the growing number of applications, ranging from enhanced fluorescence and upconversion processes to the initiation of unconventional photochemical transformations. The ability to tailor molecular environments within cavities enables precise control over polariton formation and subsequent reactivity. 

However, the field faces significant hurdles, notably the accurate prediction of complex multi-polariton interactions and the development of robust, scalable experimental techniques to realize the full potential of these systems.  Future research must prioritize the refinement of theoretical models to accurately capture these intricacies, alongside the engineering of tailored molecular cavities conducive to controlled polariton chemistry and ultimately, the precise manipulation of chemical reactions at the single-molecule level.
