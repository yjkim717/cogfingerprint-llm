Title: Elucidating the Role of Carbon Atom Diffusion on Interstellar Ice Surfaces in the Formation of Complex Organic Molecules via C–C Bond Formation

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a crucial process in astrochemistry. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of surface diffusion on interstellar ice surfaces in facilitating the formation of COMs. In this work, we investigate the diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice surfaces and its role in driving C–C bond formation, a key step in the synthesis of COMs. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the diffusion of carbon atoms on amorphous water ice surfaces is a facile process, enabling the formation of C–C bonds via barrierless reactions. Our findings suggest that the diffusion of carbon atoms is a crucial step in the formation of COMs, providing new insights into the astrochemical processes that govern the evolution of interstellar environments. The results of this study have significant implications for our understanding of the origins of COMs in the interstellar medium.
