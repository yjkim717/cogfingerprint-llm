**Abstract: Surface Diffusion and Carbon-Carbon Bond Formation in Astrophysical Ice Analogs: Implications for Interstellar Organic Complexity**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments remains a fundamental challenge in astrochemistry. While gas-phase reactions are well-studied, the role of icy grain surfaces as reaction platforms, particularly at cryogenic temperatures, continues to be a subject of intense investigation. This study presents experimental evidence demonstrating the significant role of surface diffusion in promoting carbon-carbon (C-C) bond formation within simulated interstellar ice analogs. Using ultra-high vacuum (UHV) conditions and temperature-controlled substrates, we observed the diffusion of individual carbon atoms (¹²C) across amorphous water ice surfaces at temperatures as low as 10 K.  Time-resolved secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) analysis revealed the progressive incorporation of these diffusing carbon atoms into larger molecular species, indicative of C-C bond formation.  Specifically, we detected the formation of small hydrocarbon fragments, suggesting a pathway for the growth of more complex organic structures.  The observed diffusion rates, estimated via analysis of ion intensity profiles, are surprisingly high, suggesting that surface mobility is not a limiting factor in the synthesis of organic material. These findings underscore the importance of considering surface kinetic processes alongside gas-phase chemistry in models of interstellar organic molecule synthesis.  Furthermore, the demonstrated efficiency of C-C bond formation on ice surfaces at extremely low temperatures has profound implications for understanding the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks and the potential for prebiotic chemistry in extraterrestrial environments. Future work will focus on investigating the influence of ice composition (e.g., inclusion of methanol or ammonia) on carbon diffusion and subsequent reaction pathways.
