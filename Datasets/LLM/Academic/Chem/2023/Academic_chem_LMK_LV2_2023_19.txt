Title: Strategic Construction of Heteroleptic Palladium(II) Cages via Ancillary Complementary Ligand Pairings

Abstract:
The development of metallo-supramolecular chemistry has led to significant advancements in the design of complex architectures. Herein, we report a novel strategy for the construction of heteroleptic palladium(II) cages utilizing ancillary complementary ligand pairings. By employing low-symmetry ligands in conjunction with carefully selected ancillary ligands, we demonstrate the controlled assembly of complex palladium(II) architectures. The judicious selection of ligand pairings enables the formation of heteroleptic assemblies with high fidelity, thereby overcoming the inherent challenges associated with the self-assembly of multiple components. The resulting palladium(II) cages exhibit well-defined structures, as confirmed by comprehensive characterization techniques. This approach provides a versatile platform for the rational design of complex metallo-supramolecular assemblies, expanding the scope of palladium(II)-based cage chemistry. The findings presented herein contribute to the advancement of metallo-supramolecular chemistry, offering new avenues for the development of sophisticated functional materials. (2023)
