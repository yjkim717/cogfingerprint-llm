Advances in Polariton Chemistry and Molecular Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics: Enhancing Control over Photochemical Reactivities.

Recent breakthroughs in polariton chemistry and molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics have revolutionized our understanding of quantum light-matter interactions, offering unprecedented opportunities to manipulate photochemical reactivities. By harnessing the unique properties of polaritons, hybrid quasiparticles formed by the strong coupling of molecular excitations and cavity photons, researchers can now modulate chemical reaction pathways with enhanced precision. Theoretical frameworks developed in 2023 have elucidated the intricate interplay between molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics and polariton chemistry, revealing the underlying mechanisms governing the altered photochemical landscapes. This synergy enables the rational design of novel photochemical reactions, leveraging the tunable properties of polaritons to control reaction rates and outcomes. Consequently, these advances are poised to transform the field of photochemistry, enabling the development of innovative, cavity-mediated photochemical processes with far-reaching implications for various chemical applications.
