**Abstract: Surface Diffusion of Atomic Carbon as a Driver of Organic Complexity in Simulated Interstellar Ices**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments remains a central question in astrochemistry. While gas-phase reactions are well-studied, low-temperature surface chemistry on interstellar dust grains presents a crucial, yet less understood, pathway. This study investigates the role of atomic carbon (C) diffusion as a fundamental mechanism for initiating and propagating chemical reactions within interstellar ice analogs. Using ultra-high vacuum (UHV) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), we experimentally observed and quantified the surface diffusion of C atoms on a water ice matrix at cryogenic temperatures (8-30 K). Our results demonstrate that C atom mobility significantly enhances the probability of carbon-carbon (C-C) bond formation, leading to the observed creation of small hydrocarbon fragments and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon precursors.  Kinetic modeling, incorporating measured diffusion coefficients, suggests that this process can account for a non-negligible fraction of observed organic species in protostellar outflows.  These findings highlight the critical importance of considering surface diffusion mechanisms, particularly that of atomic carbon, in accurately modeling the chemical evolution of interstellar ices and the subsequent delivery of prebiotic molecules to nascent planetary systems.  Future work will focus on exploring the influence of ice composition and irradiation on C atom diffusion and reactivity.
