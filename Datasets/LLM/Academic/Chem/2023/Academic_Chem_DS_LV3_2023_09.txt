**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium represents a critical stage in prebiotic chemical evolution. While gas-phase reactions are well-characterized, the role of solid-state chemistry on icy grain mantles remains less understood, particularly concerning the initial steps of carbon backbone assembly. This study investigates the non-thermal surface diffusion of atomic carbon on low-temperature amorphous solid water (ASW) ice analogues, a process hypothesized to be a fundamental driver for C–C bond formation. Through a series of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) experiments conducted under ultra-high vacuum conditions simulating cold molecular clouds, we demonstrate that carbon atoms become mobile on water-ice surfaces at temperatures exceeding 22 K. This mobility facilitates reactive encounters with co-adsorbed species such as CO, O₂, and simple hydrocarbons. Our results provide direct experimental evidence for a previously postulated but unconfirmed diffusion-mediated reaction pathway. The observed formation of C₂-bearing species, including ketene (H₂CCO) and acetylene (C₂H₂), at these low temperatures confirms that carbon atom diffusion is a potent non-energetic mechanism for initiating molecular complexity. This process circumvents the significant activation barriers typically associated with C–C bond formation, suggesting that carbon atom mobility is a ubiquitous and essential ingredient in the bottom-up synthesis of interstellar COMs, with profound implications for our understanding of molecular genesis in star-forming regions.
