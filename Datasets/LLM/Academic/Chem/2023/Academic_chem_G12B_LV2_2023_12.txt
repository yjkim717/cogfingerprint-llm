**Emergent Frontiers in Polariton Chemistry: A Theoretical Perspective on Light-Matter Strong Coupling and Non-Adiabatic Dynamics**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry represents a paradigm shift in chemical reactivity, leveraging the strong coupling regime between molecular excitations and optical photons within confined photonic environments. This review synthesizes recent theoretical advancements underpinning this rapidly evolving area, focusing on methodologies and challenges inherent in accurately modeling light-matter interactions at the molecular level. Traditional approaches to chemical dynamics often neglect the quantum nature of light, a limitation that becomes increasingly critical when approaching strong coupling conditions â€“ typically defined by coupling strengths exceeding system dissipation rates. We delineate the progression of theoretical techniques, beginning with *ab initio* Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) methods, which provide a foundational framework for calculating molecular polaritonic states and their associated energies and transition dipole moments. However, the computational expense of full QED treatments often necessitates the development of effective and approximated approaches.

This review critically examines these approximations, including density matrix embedding theory coupled with QED, and explores their accuracy in predicting polariton-mediated chemical reactions. A central focus is the integration of non-adiabatic dynamics (NAD) into these frameworks, acknowledging that polariton chemistry frequently involves transitions between electronic states induced by the photonic field. We discuss the challenges in accurately capturing both the coherent light-matter coupling *and* the underlying electronic structure evolution within a consistent dynamical picture. Specifically, we address the implementation of surface hopping and other NAD algorithms within a polaritonic context, considering the impact of the photonic reservoir on system dynamics and the potential for novel reaction pathways inaccessible under traditional, light-independent conditions.

Finally, we highlight current limitations and future directions. These include the need for improved computational efficiency to enable the study of larger molecular systems and more complex reaction environments, the development of robust methods for treating dissipative effects within the strong coupling regime, and a deeper understanding of how cavity geometry and photon statistics influence chemical outcomes. The integration of machine learning techniques for parameterization and accelerated simulations also presents a promising avenue for future research. Ultimately, this review underscores the critical role of theoretical chemistry in guiding experimental endeavors and unlocking the full potential of polariton chemistry for applications ranging from photocatalysis to novel materials design.
