Title: Advances in Polariton Chemistry and Molecular Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics: Theoretical Perspectives and Emerging Applications

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by the prospect of manipulating chemical reactions and photochemical processes through strong light-matter interactions. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical advances in polariton chemistry and molecular cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), highlighting the latest methodological developments and their implications for various applications. By delving into the intricacies of molecular cavity QED, we examine the theoretical frameworks that underlie the emerging field of polariton chemistry, with a focus on the interplay between quantum fluctuations, cavity modes, and molecular excitations.

Recent theoretical breakthroughs have enabled the description of complex molecular systems strongly coupled to cavity modes, facilitating the exploration of novel photochemical pathways and reactivity patterns. The development of new methods, such as quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT) and cavity-modified molecular dynamics, has provided a robust framework for understanding the intricate interplay between light and matter at the molecular scale. These advances have far-reaching implications for the control of photochemical reactions, the manipulation of energy transfer processes, and the design of novel materials with tailored optical properties.

This review provides a detailed examination of the theoretical foundations of polariton chemistry, including the role of cavity-induced modifications to molecular potential energy surfaces, the impact of quantum fluctuations on chemical reactivity, and the description of collective excitations in ensembles of molecules. We also discuss the latest applications of polariton chemistry, including the control of photochemical reactions, the enhancement of energy transfer processes, and the design of novel optoelectronic materials.

By providing a comprehensive overview of the theoretical advances in polariton chemistry and molecular cavity QED, this review aims to stimulate further research in this rapidly evolving field, highlighting the potential for innovative applications in photochemistry, materials science, and quantum technology. As the field continues to mature, we anticipate that the theoretical frameworks and methodologies described herein will play a crucial role in shaping the future of polariton chemistry and its applications.
