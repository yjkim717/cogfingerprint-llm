Title: Investigating the Role of Surface Diffusion of Carbon Atoms in the Formation of Complex Organic Molecules on Interstellar Ice Surfaces

Abstract:
The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments is a topic of significant interest in astrochemistry. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of surface diffusion processes on interstellar ice surfaces in facilitating the complexity of organic chemistry. This study investigates the diffusion of carbon atoms on interstellar ice surfaces and its implications for COM formation. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that C atoms exhibit significant mobility on ice surfaces at temperatures above 22 K, enabling the formation of complex organic species through surface-mediated reactions. Our results show that the surface diffusion of C atoms plays a crucial role in driving the complexity of organic molecules, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying COM formation in interstellar environments. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the origins of complex organic chemistry in the interstellar medium.
