**Abstract: Surface Diffusion of Carbon Atoms as a Catalyst for Complex Organic Molecule Genesis in Interstellar Environments**

The prevalence of complex organic molecules (COMs) within interstellar space remains a fundamental puzzle in astrochemistry. This research investigates the role of carbon atom diffusion on icy grain surfaces as a key mechanistic pathway for COM formation. Utilizing kinetic modeling and incorporating recent spectroscopic observations, we posit that localized, thermally-activated surface diffusion of carbon atoms – facilitated by the heterogeneous environment of interstellar ice grains – dramatically enhances the probability of sequential chemical reactions. 

Specifically, our simulations demonstrate that this diffusion process overcomes kinetic barriers associated with traditional gas-phase chemistry, leading to the condensation and polymerization of simple carbonaceous precursors.  The resulting network of carbonaceous fragments provides a scaffold for the subsequent incorporation of other interstellar elements.  Crucially, this model predicts a significant enrichment of specific COM fragments, consistent with observed spectral signatures. These findings suggest that icy grain surfaces represent dynamic, reactive sites, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of the origins and distribution of the building blocks of life throughout the cosmos.  Further investigation is warranted to quantify the impact of grain size and ice composition.
