**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, wherein molecular ensembles are coherently coupled to confined electromagnetic modes of optical cavities, has unveiled profound opportunities for manipulating chemical reactivity. A prominent, yet mechanistically debated, phenomenon is the significant suppression of reaction rates under vibrational strong coupling (VSC). Herein, we present a theoretical investigation that elucidates the critical role of non-Markovian dynamics in mediating this suppression. By constructing a microscopic model that explicitly treats the collective vibrational polariton modes and their interaction with a dissipative bath of dark states and solvent degrees of freedom, we demonstrate that the cavity frequency dictates the onset of a dynamical caging effect. This effect arises from the retarded feedback inherent in the non-Markovian polaritonic energy exchange, which transiently localizes the reactive nuclear wavepacket. Our analysis reveals that the reaction rate suppression is not a static barrier modification but a consequence of this frequency-dependent dynamical trapping, which impedes the system's progression along the reaction coordinate. These findings, established in 2021, provide a foundational framework for understanding VSC-modified chemistry and underscore the necessity of treating the cavity-molecule system as a non-Markovian quantum entity for accurate prediction and control of polaritonic reaction dynamics.
