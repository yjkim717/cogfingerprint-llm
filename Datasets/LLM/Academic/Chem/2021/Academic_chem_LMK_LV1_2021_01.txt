Title: Investigating the Cryogenic Morphology of Mixed Ices on Refractory Grains via Transmission Electron Microscopy

Abstract:

The morphology of ices formed from H2O, CO2, and CO on refractory grains is crucial in understanding their role in protoplanetary disks. In this study, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the crystallization behavior and resulting morphology of these mixed ices. Amorphous ices were grown on refractory substrates at cryogenic temperatures, and their structural evolution was monitored upon annealing. Our TEM observations reveal that the morphology of the ices is strongly influenced by the composition and thermal history. Notably, the presence of CO2 and CO affects the crystallization kinetics of H2O ice, leading to the formation of distinct ice morphologies. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of ice formation and evolution in protoplanetary disks, where they play a critical role in shaping planetary composition and habitability. Our results provide new insights into the complex interplay between ice composition, morphology, and thermal processing in astrophysical environments. (2021)
