Title: A Novel Pathway to Formaldehyde Formation via Carbon Atom Reaction with Amorphous Solid Water: An Astrochemically Relevant Process

Abstract:
The formation of formaldehyde, a key precursor to complex organic molecules, is investigated through a novel reaction pathway involving the interaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW). Employing a combination of computational simulations and experimental techniques, we demonstrate that carbon atoms react with ASW to yield formaldehyde via a mechanism facilitated by the hydrogen bonding network within the ASW. Our results indicate that this reaction pathway is astrochemically relevant, with implications for the interstellar medium and cometary chemistry. The reactivity of carbon atoms with ASW is shown to be a significant contributor to formaldehyde formation, providing a new paradigm for understanding the origins of this important molecule in astrophysical environments. This study advances our understanding of the complex chemistry occurring in interstellar ices and its role in shaping the molecular composition of the universe.
