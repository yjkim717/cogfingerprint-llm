**Abstract**

The complex chemical environments within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks necessitate a detailed understanding of ice nucleation and subsequent morphology. This research leverages transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to probe the formation of ice on refractory silicate grains, offering new insights into the intricate processes governing space chemistry. Utilizing cryo-TEM techniques, we observed marked variations in ice morphology directly correlated with both the elemental composition of the grain substrate and the prevailing ice formation conditions. Specifically, compositional differences induced alterations in crystal habit and interfacial layering, suggesting a dynamic interplay between chemical gradients and ice growth. These findings indicate that the initial ice morphology – characterized by features such as dendritic growth and distinct crystalline domains – significantly influences subsequent chemical reactions within the surrounding gas phase.  Further investigations are warranted to quantify the impact of these morphological variations on the delivery of volatile elements to planetary systems, ultimately contributing to a more comprehensive model of early planet formation.
