The structural characterization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) presents significant challenges in automated analysis due to morphological heterogeneity and complex boundary delineation. This work introduces a hybrid deep learning architecture that synergistically integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with conditional random field (CRF) optimization to address the critical task of instance segmentation in MOF micrographs. Our framework leverages hierarchical feature extraction capabilities of CNNs to generate preliminary pixel-wise predictions, while the subsequent CRF layer refines these outputs by incorporating spatial contextual relationships and enforcing topological consistency. Experimental validation on diverse MOF specimens demonstrates substantial improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to conventional approaches, achieving precise boundary localization and robust differentiation between adjacent crystallites. This computational advancement enables high-throughput quantitative analysis of MOF morphological properties, facilitating more reliable correlations between synthesis conditions and resulting structural characteristics. The proposed methodology establishes a new paradigm for automated nanomaterial characterization, with potential applications extending to other porous coordination polymers and complex crystalline systems.
