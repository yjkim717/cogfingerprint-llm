**Abstract**

The structural characterization of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is pivotal for correlating morphological features with material performance. However, the quantitative analysis of complex, aggregated MOF crystals remains a significant challenge. This work introduces a computational framework for the precise instance-level segmentation of MOF particles from SEM micrographs. Our approach leverages a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to generate high-quality pixel-wise semantic predictions, which are subsequently refined using a probabilistic graphical model to enforce spatial consistency and delineate individual crystal boundaries. This integrated pipeline effectively disambiguates densely packed and overlapping morphologies that are common in synthetic MOF products. Trained and validated on an extensive dataset of synthesized ZIF-8 and UiO-66 samples, the model achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 94.2% in instance segmentation, substantially outperforming conventional watershed-based algorithms. This robust analytical tool facilitates the high-throughput, automated quantification of MOF particle size, distribution, and shape, thereby accelerating the rational design and optimization of porous materials.
