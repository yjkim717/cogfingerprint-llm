**Abstract**

The non-energetic formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) on interstellar ice grains remains a pivotal question in astrochemistry. This study investigates the reaction dynamics of ground-state atomic carbon (C(³P)) with amorphous solid water (ASW) at cryogenic temperatures, employing a combination of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). We demonstrate that the formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) proceeds with high efficiency and exhibits a negligible activation barrier. The reaction mechanism is identified as a water-catalyzed proton transfer, wherein the ASW matrix itself acts as a Brønsted acid-base pair, facilitating H-atom migration and C–O bond formation. This catalytic cycle, inherent to the hydrogen-bonded water network, provides a robust non-diffusive pathway for COM synthesis. Our results underscore the critical role of water ice not merely as a passive substrate but as an active catalytic participant in the genesis of prebiotic molecules in dark molecular clouds, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of carbon reactivity in astrochemical environments.
