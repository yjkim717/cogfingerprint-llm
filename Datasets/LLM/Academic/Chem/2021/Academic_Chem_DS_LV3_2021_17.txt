**Abstract**

The microstructural characterization of ice accretion on refractory substrates represents a critical frontier in understanding the physicochemical evolution of protoplanetary environments. Traditional astrochemical models often assume the formation of homogeneous, amorphous solid water (ASW) mantles on cosmic dust grains within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. However, this study employs high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) to systematically investigate the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of water ice on a suite of synthetic refractory grain analogs, including forsterite (Mg₂SiO₄) and amorphous silicates. Our 2021 findings demonstrate unequivocally that the resultant ice morphology—spanning amorphous, crystalline cubic (I˅c), and hybrid structures—is not a universal constant but is intrinsically governed by a complex interplay of local conditions and substrate properties. Key determinants identified include the chemical composition and surface topography of the grain, the local water vapor deposition rate, and the thermal history of the accreting ice. We observe that specific mineralogical interfaces can catalyze the unexpected crystallization of ice at temperatures as low as 130 K, a phenomenon previously considered improbable under typical interstellar conditions. This substrate-dependent **amorphous crystallization** challenges the canonical view of ice mantle uniformity and necessitates a revision of current astrochemical models. The implications are profound, as the **ice morphology** directly influences the porosity, surface area, and chemical reactivity of the icy mantles, thereby altering the catalytic efficiency for molecular hydrogen formation and the trapping of volatile species. Consequently, our results demand the integration of grain-specific **amorphous crystallization** parameters into simulations of grain-surface chemistry to accurately predict molecular abundances and the initial conditions for planetary formation in **protoplanetary disks**.
