**Abstract**

The investigation of ices within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks represents a critical avenue for understanding the initial stages of planet formation. This work details a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study employing cryogenic techniques to characterize the three-dimensional morphology and crystallinity of ices comprising water (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and carbon monoxide (CO). Samples were derived from refractory grains, providing a controlled environment to observe ice evolution. Utilizing focused ion beam milling and subsequent TEM imaging, we documented composition-dependent variations in ice crystal structures. Specifically, differing abundances of H₂O, CO₂, and CO resulted in distinct crystalline arrangements, ranging from densely packed, columnar morphologies to more disordered, amorphous phases. These observations challenge prevailing models of ice nucleation and aggregation, suggesting a more nuanced interplay between chemical composition and microstructural development.  The obtained data provides valuable constraints for theoretical simulations seeking to accurately represent ice formation processes within these formative environments. Further research will focus on correlating these microstructural features with observed spectral signatures.
