**Abstract**

The reactivity of carbon atoms on interstellar ice analogues remains a pivotal question in astrochemistry, with implications for the formation of complex organic molecules in space. This study investigates the reaction dynamics of ground-state carbon atoms (C(³P)) with amorphous solid water (ASW) at cryogenic temperatures, employing ab initio molecular dynamics and kinetic modelling. We demonstrate that the formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) proceeds with notably low activation barriers, contrasting with the high energies anticipated for gas-phase analogues. The reaction is critically facilitated by the unique properties of the ASW matrix, which acts as a proton transfer catalyst. The pre-organized hydrogen bonding network enables efficient proton shuffling, stabilizing key polar intermediates and transition states. This water-catalyzed mechanism provides a robust, low-energy pathway, underscoring the catalytic role of water ice in solid-state astrochemical synthesis and offering a plausible route for the genesis of interstellar prebiotic molecules.
