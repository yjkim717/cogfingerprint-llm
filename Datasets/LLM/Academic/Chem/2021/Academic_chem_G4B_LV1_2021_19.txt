**Abstract**

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials for gas adsorption and sensing applications. This study reports the synthesis and characterization of a novel fluorescent MOF, designated DUT-140(M), incorporating a specifically designed fluorescent ligand.  The resultant material exhibits enhanced structural flexibility, a critical factor influencing its gas interaction properties.  Employing a combination of X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate a pronounced negative gas adsorption behavior towards select volatile organic compounds (VOCs).  Computational modeling, utilizing density functional theory (DFT), provides insights into the underlying mechanism of this counterintuitive adsorption, suggesting a cooperative interaction between the ligand’s fluorescence and the MOF’s pore structure.  Furthermore, we observed a correlation between pressure applied to the MOF and amplified fluorescence emission, indicative of a pressure amplification effect. These findings highlight the potential of rationally designed fluorescent MOFs for advanced sensing technologies and controlled gas manipulation.
