**Abstract**

Recent advancements in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have enabled unprecedented investigation of ice morphologies within astrophysical environments. This study, conducted in 2021, critically re-evaluates the conventional assumption of uniform ice coatings on refractory grain surfaces prevalent in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. Our TEM observations reveal a complex interplay between ice composition and the underlying substrate, leading to the formation of heterogeneous ice structures. These structures exhibit a dynamic mixture of amorphous and crystalline phases, demonstrating a clear dependence on factors such as volatile species and grain material. This finding necessitates a revised understanding of ice accretion and subsequent chemical processing in these regions, with implications for the formation and evolution of complex organic molecules and, ultimately, planetary systems.
