**Abstract**

The pursuit of materials exhibiting unusual thermodynamic behavior at elevated pressures continues to drive innovation in porous materials chemistry. This work reports the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel class of fluorescent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) based on the DUT-140 topology, incorporating a strategically selected fluorescent core. These materials demonstrate a unique combination of properties, including significant pressure amplification effects and, critically, evidence of negative gas adsorption behavior for specific probe gases under high-pressure conditions. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals the structural integrity of the framework under pressure, while in situ fluorescence spectroscopy confirms the preservation of the luminescent properties despite substantial structural compression.  Gas adsorption isotherms, measured using a volumetric technique up to 100 MPa, provide compelling evidence for negative adsorption of CO₂ and N₂ within the pore space, a phenomenon attributed to a combination of strong framework-guest interactions and a reduction in accessible void volume under pressure. The observed pressure amplification and negative adsorption are rationalized through a consideration of the framework's flexibility and the interplay between host-guest interactions and the applied hydrostatic pressure. These findings highlight the potential of DUT-140-based fluorescent MOFs for advanced gas separation, sensing, and high-pressure energy storage applications, representing a significant advance in the field of functional porous materials.
