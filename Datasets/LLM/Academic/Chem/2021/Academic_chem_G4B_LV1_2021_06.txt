**Abstract**

The mechanistic pathways governing the interaction of carbon-based substrates with amorphous solid water (ASW) remain incompletely understood. This research investigates the catalytic activity of ASW in promoting the formation of formaldehyde (H2CO) from elemental carbon, utilizing a novel spectroscopic and kinetic analysis. Our findings reveal a concerted proton transfer mechanism wherein carbon atoms are sequentially activated within the ASW matrix. Specifically, initial interaction facilitates the abstraction of a proton, generating a reactive intermediate species. This intermediate subsequently undergoes a concerted reaction with adsorbed water molecules, ultimately yielding H2CO and regenerating the ASW catalyst.  Crucially, the observed rate constants strongly suggest a significant role for hydrogen bonding within the ASW structure in stabilizing and directing these proton transfer events.  These results offer compelling evidence for ASW as a surprisingly effective, and mechanistically nuanced, catalyst for carbon fixation reactions, with potential implications for prebiotic chemistry and materials science.
