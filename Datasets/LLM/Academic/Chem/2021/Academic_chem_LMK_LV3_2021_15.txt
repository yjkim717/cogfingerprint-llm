Title: Integrating Fluorescent Functionality into Pressure-Amplifying Metal-Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Optical Responsiveness

Abstract:
In 2021, advancements in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have led to the development of novel porous crystals exhibiting unique adsorption properties. This study reports the successful integration of fluorescent functionality into pressure-amplifying MOFs, yielding materials that combine negative gas adsorption (NGA) behavior with responsive optical properties. The synthesized MOFs demonstrate amplified pressure-induced phase transitions, resulting in enhanced fluorescence emission. The incorporation of fluorescent moieties into the framework enables the visualization of structural transformations under varying mechanical stimuli. The observed optical responsiveness is attributed to the tailored design of the MOF's structural and chemical properties. This innovative approach expands the scope of MOF applications, offering potential uses in sensing and optomechanical devices. The findings highlight the potential of hybrid MOFs for advanced technological applications, where the synergy between structural dynamics and optical properties is exploited.
