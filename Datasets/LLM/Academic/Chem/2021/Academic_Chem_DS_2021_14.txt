The interfacial behavior of aqueous electrolytes at metal oxide surfaces exhibits marked deviations from classical electrostatic predictions, with specific ion effects playing a decisive role in dictating interfacial structure and reactivity. This investigation employs polarization-resolved second harmonic scattering (SHS) to probe the molecular-level organization of water and ions at the interface of α-Fe₂O₃ (hematite) nanoparticles. By systematically varying alkali chloride salts (Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, Cs⁺) across a concentration gradient (10–100 µM), we quantify cation-specific perturbations to the interfacial water hydrogen-bonding network. Our SHS data reveal a non-monotonic trend in the effective χ⁽²⁾ susceptibility, which we attribute to distinct ion-pairing phenomena and the subsequent reorientation of solvation water molecules within the Stern layer. These findings demonstrate that ion adsorption transcends purely Coulombic interactions, implicating hydration entropy and dispersion forces as critical contributors to the observed interfacial potential. The results provide a revised molecular framework for predicting colloidal stability and catalytic performance in complex electrolyte environments, with significant implications for environmental chemistry and materials synthesis.
