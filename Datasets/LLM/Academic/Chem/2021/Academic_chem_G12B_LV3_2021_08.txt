**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry has revealed unexpected alterations in ground-state chemical reactivity under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) conditions. This work, building upon recent advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics, provides a theoretical framework elucidating this phenomenon. Our analysis demonstrates that the observed suppression of reaction rate constants within VSC regimes is fundamentally linked to the non-Markovian dynamics of the coupled cavity radiation mode. Specifically, we propose a dynamical caging effect, wherein the systemâ€™s evolution deviates from the standard Markovian approximation typically employed in chemical kinetics. This deviation manifests as a frequency-dependent modulation of the reaction pathway, leading to a transient trapping of reactants. These findings, relevant to studies conducted throughout 2021 and beyond, highlight the critical importance of considering non-Markovian effects when interpreting experimental observations in polariton chemistry and offer new avenues for controlling chemical reactivity through light-matter interaction.
