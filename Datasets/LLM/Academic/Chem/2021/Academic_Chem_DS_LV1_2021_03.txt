**Abstract**

The integration of multiple, synergistic functionalities within a single porous framework represents a frontier in advanced material design. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel series of isoreticular metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived from the DUT-49 archetype, engineered to concurrently exhibit negative gas adsorption (NGA) and intrinsic fluorescent emission. These soft porous crystals undergo a reversible, pressure-induced structural transition, which we demonstrate acts as a potent mechanism for pressure amplification—a hallmark of NGA. Crucially, we establish that this metastable transition is directly coupled to a pronounced, quantifiable modulation of the material's fluorescent signal. This correlation was elucidated through a combination of *in situ* high-pressure fluorimetry and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, which provide a molecular-level rationale for the observed piezochromic luminescence. The confluence of these phenomena—NGA-driven pressure amplification and fluorescent functionality—opens new avenues for creating highly sensitive optical gas sensors and novel micro-actuator systems, where a gas-phase stimulus is transduced into an unambiguous optical readout.
