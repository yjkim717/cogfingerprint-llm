**Abstract**

The formation and evolution of ices in astrophysical environments, particularly within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks, are critical for understanding the chemical origins of complex organic molecules and the potential for habitability beyond our solar system. While laboratory simulations of interstellar ices are commonplace, the influence of grain surface properties, specifically the nature of the refractory substrate and ice composition, on ice morphology remains incompletely understood. This study employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to directly observe and characterize the morphology of ices deposited onto various refractory grain analogs. Our findings demonstrate a strong dependence of ice structure on both the chemical composition of the ice (e.g., H₂O, CO, CH₃OH) and the underlying substrate material (e.g., amorphous silicate, carbonaceous material). Specifically, we observed variations in ice crystal size, orientation, and the presence of amorphous phases correlated with the substrate’s surface energy and chemical reactivity. These observations suggest that the heterogeneous nucleation and growth of ices are significantly affected by grain surface properties, leading to a diverse range of ice morphologies. This, in turn, has implications for the subsequent chemical processing of ices via non-thermal pathways, such as UV photolysis and cosmic ray irradiation, potentially influencing the efficiency of molecule formation and the overall chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks. Further investigation of these substrate-ice interactions is crucial for refining astrophysical models of ice chemistry and its impact on planet formation.
