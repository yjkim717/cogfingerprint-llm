**Abstract: Compositional Control of Ice Morphology in Protoplanetary Environments – A Transmission Electron Microscopy Study**

The formation of icy planetesimals within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks hinges critically on the initial morphology and crystalline structure of water, carbon dioxide, and carbon ices. Utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at cryogenic temperatures, this study investigated the three-dimensional morphology and crystallinity of these ices adsorbed onto refractory silicate grains, providing unprecedented detail regarding composition-dependent ice structure. Specimens were prepared via focused ion beam milling and maintained at liquid nitrogen temperatures to preserve the native ice phase. 

TEM imaging revealed significant variations in ice morphology, directly correlated with the relative abundances of H₂O, CO₂, and CO. Specifically, higher CO₂ concentrations consistently promoted the formation of columnar crystalline structures, contrasting with the more disordered, amorphous morphologies observed under predominantly H₂O or CO conditions. Furthermore, analysis of diffraction patterns within the TEM revealed distinct crystallographic orientations indicative of varying degrees of crystallinity. 

These findings suggest that the initial ice composition, acting as a primary control parameter, dictates the subsequent ice morphology and crystalline development. This work provides valuable insights into the complex ice chemistry prevalent in nascent planetary systems, offering a framework for future modeling efforts aimed at understanding the evolution of icy bodies and their contribution to planetary formation.
