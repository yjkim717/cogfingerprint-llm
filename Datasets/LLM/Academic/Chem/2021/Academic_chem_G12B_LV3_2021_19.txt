Here's an academic-style abstract inspired by the provided summary and keywords, suitable for a chemistry publication in 2021:

"This study reports the synthesis and characterization of three novel fluorescent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), designated DUT-140(M), structurally related to the isoreticular framework DUT-49. These materials exhibit intriguing pressure amplification and negative gas adsorption behavior, properties increasingly sought for gas separation and storage applications. Detailed investigation, particularly focusing on DUT-140(Cu), reveals a strong correlation between the framework's microporous architecture and its fluorescence properties. Spectroscopic analysis indicates unique light absorption characteristics influenced by the copper coordination environment. These findings contribute to the expanding understanding of how MOF design can be leveraged to simultaneously achieve enhanced gas sorption capabilities and tunable optical responses, representing a significant advancement in the field of porous materials."
