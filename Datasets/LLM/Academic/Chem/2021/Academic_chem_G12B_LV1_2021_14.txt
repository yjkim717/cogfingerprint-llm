**A Water-Mediated Pathway for Formaldehyde Formation from Atomic Carbon in the Interstellar Medium**

The efficient formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) in interstellar environments remains a significant challenge in astrochemistry. While gas-phase pathways are well-established, the observed abundance of H₂CO, particularly in dense, cold clouds, necessitates alternative formation routes. This work investigates a previously under-explored mechanism: the catalytic formation of H₂CO from atomic carbon (C) and water (H₂O) via proton transfer processes. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and corroborated by experimental infrared spectroscopy, we demonstrate a viable reaction pathway wherein amorphous solid water (ASW) acts as a crucial intermediary. Our computational results reveal a low-energy barrier for the initial C + H₂O reaction, followed by a series of proton transfer steps facilitated by the ASW matrix, leading to the formation of H₂CO.  Crucially, the ASW environment stabilizes key reaction intermediates, resolving discrepancies reported in earlier gas-phase studies that failed to adequately account for the necessary proton shuttling. These findings suggest that ASW-mediated reactions offer a compelling explanation for formaldehyde synthesis in dense interstellar clouds, providing a pathway consistent with observational data and expanding our understanding of complex chemical networks in astrochemical systems.
