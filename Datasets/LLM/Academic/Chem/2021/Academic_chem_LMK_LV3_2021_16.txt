Title: Unveiling Non-Markovian Dynamics in Vibrational Polariton Chemistry: A Theoretical Framework

Abstract:
The vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regime has been observed to significantly alter ground-state reactivity, a phenomenon attributed to the complex interplay between molecular vibrations and cavity radiation modes. In 2021, our understanding of this phenomenon was advanced by theoretical models elucidating the role of non-Markovian dynamics in vibrational polariton chemistry. By incorporating the cavity frequency as a critical parameter, our analysis demonstrates that the non-Markovian character of the cavity radiation mode's dynamics is pivotal in modifying chemical reactivity under VSC. This theoretical framework provides a nuanced understanding of the mechanisms driving vibrational polariton chemistry, highlighting the importance of memory effects and the back-reaction of the cavity mode on the molecular system. Our findings offer a comprehensive explanation for the experimentally observed changes in ground-state reactivity, paving the way for further exploration of cavity-modified chemistry.
