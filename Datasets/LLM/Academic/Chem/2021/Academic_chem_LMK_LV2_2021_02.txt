Title: Astrochemically Relevant Formaldehyde Formation via H2O-Catalyzed Reaction of Carbon Atoms with Amorphous Solid Water

Abstract:
The formation of formaldehyde (H2CO) in interstellar environments is a topic of ongoing research. Here, we propose a novel route to H2CO via the reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW), a key component of interstellar ices. Using theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that the reaction is facilitated by the catalytic effect of H2O, which enables the efficient formation of H2CO via a low-barrier pathway. The reaction involves the insertion of C atoms into the O-H bond of H2O, followed by a rearrangement to form H2CO. Our results indicate that this H2O-catalyzed reaction is a viable mechanism for formaldehyde formation in astrochemically relevant environments. The proposed mechanism is supported by the high reactivity of C atoms and the abundance of ASW in interstellar ices, making it a plausible contributor to the observed H2CO abundances in star-forming regions.
