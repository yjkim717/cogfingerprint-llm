**Abstract**

The formation of formaldehyde (CH₂O) in extraterrestrial environments, particularly within icy bodies, remains a topic of significant astrochemical interest. This study investigates a novel pathway for formaldehyde synthesis involving direct carbon atom reactivity within amorphous solid water (ASW). Utilizing density functional theory calculations and subsequent experimental validation, we demonstrate that formaldehyde can be efficiently produced through H₂O-catalyzed carbon atom incorporation into ASW matrices. Our computational analysis reveals a key role for hydrogen bonding networks within ASW in facilitating this reaction, lowering activation energies and stabilizing reaction intermediates.  Crucially, we observe a significant kinetic isotope effect (KIE) in the experimental data, supporting the proposed mechanism involving carbon atom abstraction. These findings suggest that ASW provides a reactive environment conducive to formaldehyde formation, potentially contributing to the observed abundance of this molecule in interstellar ices and cometary material. This H₂O-catalyzed carbon atom route provides a valuable addition to the understanding of organic molecule synthesis in low-temperature astrophysical settings.
