This study investigates the catalytic role of amorphous solid water (ASW) in the formation of formaldehyde from carbon atom reactions under astrochemical conditions. We demonstrate that ASW facilitates a water-catalyzed proton transfer mechanism, which significantly enhances reaction efficiency. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that this process proceeds through markedly low energy barriers, enabling formaldehyde production at cryogenic temperatures relevant to interstellar ice mantles. Our results provide a compelling non-radiative pathway for the formation of this prebiotic molecule, challenging previous assumptions that required higher energy inputs or radical-mediated routes. This work underscores the critical function of ASW not merely as a passive substrate but as an active proton-transfer catalyst, fundamentally reshaping our understanding of molecular complexity generation in dark molecular clouds and protoplanetary disk environments.
