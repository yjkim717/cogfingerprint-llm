**Abstract**

The efficient formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) under astrochemical conditions remains a critical area of investigation. This study presents a combined computational and experimental investigation into a novel pathway for H₂CO synthesis involving the reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW). Utilizing density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the incorporation of carbon atoms into ASW is significantly facilitated by the extensive hydrogen bonding network inherent to this ice phase, effectively acting as a catalyst.  Experimental validation, conducted at cryogenic temperatures, confirms the formation of H₂CO following carbon atom irradiation within ASW samples. Notably, a kinetic isotope effect was observed, supporting the proposed reaction mechanism. These findings suggest a previously underappreciated role for water’s hydrogen-bonding capabilities in catalyzing carbon-hydrogen bond formation within icy environments, offering a plausible route for H₂CO production in interstellar ices. This work contributes to a growing body of research highlighting the importance of ASW as a reactive medium and provides insights into the complex chemical processes occurring in star-forming regions.
