Computational investigations into the molecular interactions of organomercurial species with biologically relevant thiol and selenol groups provide critical insight into their toxicological mechanisms. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) to characterize the coordination chemistry and electronic structure perturbations arising from methylmercury (CH₃Hg⁺) adduct formation with cysteine and selenocysteine residues, with a specific focus on their implications for the catalytic function of peroxide-reducing enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidases. Our calculations reveal that while CH₃Hg⁺ binding significantly alters the redox potential of the selenium center in selenocysteine, facilitating its oxidation, the resultant coordination complex sterically and electronically impedes the enzyme's ability to reduce peroxides. The comparative analysis indicates that the selenol adduct exhibits a more pronounced inhibitory effect on the catalytic cycle than its thiol counterpart. These findings, contextualized within 2021, elucidate a molecular-level rationale for the disruption of essential antioxidant defense systems by organomercury compounds, contributing to a refined understanding of their neurotoxic potential.
