**Abstract**

The formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) in extraterrestrial environments, particularly within icy bodies, remains a significant astrochemical puzzle. This study investigates a novel pathway for H₂CO synthesis involving the reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW), a prevalent component of icy grain mantles. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and corroborated by experimental observations, we demonstrate that ASW’s unique hydrogen-bonding network acts as an effective catalyst, facilitating carbon atom insertion and subsequent proton transfer events leading to H₂CO formation. Our computational analysis reveals a preferential reaction mechanism involving initial carbon atom adsorption followed by a series of proton shuttling steps mediated by ASW’s hydroxyl groups. The calculated activation energies and reaction barriers suggest this process can occur at astrophysically relevant temperatures. These findings provide a plausible, efficient route for formaldehyde production in cold, dense molecular clouds and icy planetary surfaces, contributing to our understanding of prebiotic molecule origins and the chemical complexity of icy worlds.



I aimed for the following in crafting this abstract:

*   **Formal Tone:**  Uses precise language and avoids colloquialisms.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** Presents the problem, the approach (computational & experimental), the key findings, and the implications.
*   **Precise Terminology:** Includes terms like "density functional theory," "activation energies," "reaction barriers," "astrophysically relevant temperatures," and "prebiotic molecule origins."
*   **2021 Context:**  The phrasing reflects current research trends in astrochemistry and the emphasis on icy bodies.
