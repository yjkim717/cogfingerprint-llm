In this 2021 astrochemical study, we elucidate a novel low-barrier reaction pathway for formaldehyde (Hâ‚‚CO) formation through carbon atom interactions with amorphous solid water (ASW) matrices. Previous computational and experimental investigations reported significant discrepancies regarding reaction barriers under interstellar medium conditions. Our cryogenic surface science experiments demonstrate that ASW actively catalyzes proton transfer mechanisms, enabling efficient hydrogenation of carbon atoms at 10 K. Quantum chemical calculations reveal water molecules mediate proton relocation through a concerted tunneling mechanism, reducing the activation barrier by 2.3 kcal/mol compared to gas-phase analogues. This water-catalyzed pathway resolves longstanding contradictions in astrochemical literature by providing a kinetically viable route for complex organic molecule formation in molecular clouds. Our findings fundamentally revise understanding of prebiotic chemistry in icy grain mantles, with broad implications for molecular complexity in star-forming regions.
