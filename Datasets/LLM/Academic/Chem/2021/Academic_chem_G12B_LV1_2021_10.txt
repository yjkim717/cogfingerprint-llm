**Abstract**

The formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) in interstellar ice analogs remains a crucial, yet incompletely understood, pathway for organic molecule synthesis in cold, dense environments. This work investigates a novel mechanism for H₂CO production involving the reaction of isolated carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW). Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and supporting experimental observations, we demonstrate that carbon atom incorporation into ASW, facilitated by the extensive hydrogen-bonding network characteristic of this ice phase, leads to the efficient formation of H₂CO. Our computational results reveal a stepwise process initiated by carbon atom capture and subsequent proton transfer events within the ASW matrix. The hydrogen-bonding network acts as a dynamic proton reservoir, enabling efficient proton shuttling and stabilizing key reaction intermediates.  Specifically, we identify a low-energy pathway involving the formation of a hydroxymethyl radical adduct, followed by further protonation and rearrangement to yield formaldehyde. Experimental validation, employing low-temperature matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy, confirms the detection of H₂CO following carbon atom irradiation of ASW samples. These findings provide compelling evidence for a previously underappreciated contribution of ASW to formaldehyde generation in astrophysical ices, offering insights into the chemical complexity of star-forming regions and potentially impacting prebiotic chemistry models. This work underscores the importance of considering the role of ice morphology and its associated hydrogen-bonding dynamics in astrochemical reaction networks.
