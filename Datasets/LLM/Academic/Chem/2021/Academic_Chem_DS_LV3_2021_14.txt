**Abstract**

The reactivity of carbon atoms on interstellar ice analogues represents a fundamental process in astrochemical networks, yet mechanistic pathways to complex organic molecules remain incompletely characterized. This investigation elucidates a novel, low-energy pathway for formaldehyde (H₂CO) synthesis via carbon atom insertion into amorphous solid water (ASW) matrices. We demonstrate that the reaction C(³P) + H₂O(ASW) proceeds efficiently even at cryogenic temperatures (10–20 K), facilitated by a water-mediated proton transfer mechanism within the porous ice structure. This catalytic role of ASW resolves long-standing discrepancies in the astrochemical literature concerning the apparent barrier to formation. Our experimental and computational results, obtained through temperature-programmed desorption and density functional theory calculations, confirm the formation of H₂CO as a primary product. This work, conducted in 2021, establishes a critical non-diffusive route for interstellar glycine precursor formation, fundamentally revising our understanding of molecular complexity in dark molecular clouds and implicating water ice not merely as a solvent but as an active catalytic participant in prebiotic chemistry.
