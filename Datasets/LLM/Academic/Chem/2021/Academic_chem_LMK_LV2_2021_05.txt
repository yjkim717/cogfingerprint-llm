Title: Investigating Ice Morphology on Refractory Grains via Transmission Electron Microscopy: Implications for Molecular Clouds and Protoplanetary Disks

Abstract:

The morphology of ices formed on refractory grains is crucial in understanding their role in the evolution of molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. This study employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the crystallization and structural properties of H2O, CO2, and CO ices on refractory substrates. By analyzing the resulting ice morphologies, we provide insights into the complex interactions between the ice constituents and the underlying grain surfaces. Our TEM observations reveal distinct ice structures and crystallinity, dependent on the composition and temperature conditions. The results indicate that the presence of CO2 and CO influences the crystallization kinetics of H2O ice, leading to variations in ice morphology. The findings have significant implications for understanding the processing and evolution of ices in astrophysical environments, where refractory grains serve as nucleation sites. The morphological characteristics of ices on these grains can, in turn, affect their sticking probabilities, desorption rates, and chemical reactivity. By elucidating the microstructural properties of ices on refractory grains, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between ice formation, grain surface chemistry, and the evolution of molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. The results presented here provide a foundation for further research into the role of ices in the astrochemical and astrophysical contexts.
