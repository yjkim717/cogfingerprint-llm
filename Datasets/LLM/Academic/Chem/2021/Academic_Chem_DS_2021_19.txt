This work reports a bifunctional electrocatalyst derived from a covalent organic framework composite, featuring atomically dispersed Co-Nx sites and metallic cobalt nanoparticles. The material demonstrates high activity and stability for both the oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions under alkaline conditions.
