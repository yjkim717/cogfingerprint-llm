Here we report the design and characterization of isoreticular metal-organic frameworks derived from the prototypical DUT-49 architecture that simultaneously exhibit pressure amplification phenomena and intrinsic luminescent properties. Through strategic ligand functionalization with Ï€-conjugated fluorophores, we engineered crystalline materials that maintain structural flexibility while gaining spectroscopic reporting capabilities. These multifunctional frameworks demonstrate counterintuitive gas adsorption behavior, where specific pressure regimes trigger collective pore contraction accompanied by pronounced emission shifts. In situ spectroscopic monitoring reveals direct correlation between lattice deformation dynamics and photophysical response, enabling real-time observation of metastable states during adsorption-induced phase transitions. Density functional theory calculations suggest that ligand rotational freedom and guest-host interactions modulate both mechanical instability and exciton migration pathways. This synergistic combination of negative compressibility and stimulus-responsive luminescence establishes a new paradigm for smart porous materials, offering unprecedented insight into cooperative transformation mechanisms while providing optical signatures for pressure transduction applications.
