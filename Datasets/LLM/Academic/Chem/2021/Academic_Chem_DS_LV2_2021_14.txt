This study investigates the formation of formaldehyde via carbon atom reactions on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces, a process of significant astrochemical relevance. We demonstrate that the interaction of ground-state carbon atoms with ASW proceeds through a water-catalyzed proton transfer mechanism, which effectively reduces or eliminates reaction barriers. Experimental and computational analyses reveal that the ASW matrix acts as a proton transfer catalyst, facilitating hydrogen abstraction and subsequent formation of Hâ‚‚CO. This low-barrier pathway provides a plausible route for formaldehyde generation in cold interstellar environments where thermal processing is limited. Our findings fundamentally revise previous models of carbon reactivity in icy grain mantles and suggest that non-diffusive reactions catalyzed by water ice may contribute substantially to molecular complexity in dark molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.
