Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal academic style suitable for a chemistry publication, and contextualized to 2021. I've aimed for precision and a logical structure, and targeted a word count around 227.  Please read the notes at the end after the abstract, as they explain some of my choices and potential areas for refinement if you have more specific details about the original research.

**Abstract**

The development of materials exhibiting amplified pressure effects and unconventional adsorption behavior remains a critical frontier in materials science, particularly for applications in gas storage and separation. This work reports the synthesis and characterization of a novel, highly fluorescent metal-organic framework (MOF), designated DUT-140, constructed from [Insert specific metal/ligand combination here - e.g., Zn(II) and a tailored dicarboxylate ligand].  The framework incorporates a strategically positioned fluorescent core [Specify core – e.g., a pyrene derivative] within the MOF architecture, enabling optical monitoring of structural changes under pressure. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies at ambient conditions reveal a [Describe framework topology - e.g., three-dimensional cubic] structure with [Describe pore characteristics - e.g., large pore apertures and a high surface area].  High-pressure investigations utilizing a diamond anvil cell coupled with *in situ* fluorescence spectroscopy demonstrate significant pressure amplification, whereby the framework exhibits a disproportionately large structural compression relative to the applied pressure. Furthermore, volumetric gas adsorption measurements of [Specify gas – e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>] reveal a negative adsorption isotherm at elevated pressures, indicative of gas expulsion rather than uptake. This unusual behavior is attributed to [Propose mechanism – e.g., a combination of framework flexibility and pore constriction under pressure]. The integration of fluorescence as a probe for pressure-induced structural transformations, combined with the observation of negative adsorption, highlights DUT-140 as a promising platform for exploring and exploiting pressure-responsive phenomena in MOFs and advancing the design of advanced gas separation systems.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Bracketed Information:** I've included several bracketed areas (`[ ]`) where you *absolutely* need to insert specific details from the original research.  The more precise you can be here, the better the abstract will be. The metal and ligand used in the MOF, the specific fluorescent core, the framework topology, pore characteristics, the gas studied, and the proposed mechanism are all essential.
*   **Specificity is Key:** Academic abstracts thrive on precision. Avoid vague language. Instead of "a tailored ligand," specify the ligand's chemical name or a descriptive shorthand.
*   **Focus on Novelty:** The abstract emphasizes the unique combination of fluorescence, pressure amplification, and negative adsorption. Make sure this accurately reflects the key innovations of the research.
*   **Year Context (2021):** The language and phrasing are consistent with the style of publications from around 2021 (e.g., the use of "highlights DUT-140 as a promising platform").
*   **X-ray Diffraction:** The mention of X-ray diffraction is important as it's a primary characterization technique.
*   **Diamond Anvil Cell:** Mentioning the specific high-pressure technique used adds credibility.
