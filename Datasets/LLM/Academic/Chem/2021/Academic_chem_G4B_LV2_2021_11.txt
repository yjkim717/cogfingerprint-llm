**Abstract**

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials for gas adsorption and sensing applications. This research details the synthesis and characterization of a novel fluorescent MOF, designated DUT-140(M), engineered to exhibit enhanced pressure amplification and negative gas adsorption capabilities. The design centered on a strategically modified fluorescent ligand, facilitating a unique structural response under applied pressure. Spectroscopic investigations, including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and variable-temperature infrared spectroscopy, revealed significant structural contraction within the DUT-140(M) framework upon pressure application – a key mechanism driving the observed pressure amplification.

Crucially, this contraction induces a concomitant decrease in the material’s interaction energy with targeted gases, manifesting as negative gas adsorption. Quantitative analysis demonstrated a substantial reduction in adsorption isotherms at elevated pressures, exceeding typical behavior for conventional MOFs. The fluorescence properties of DUT-140(M) remained robust throughout the pressure-induced structural transformation, providing a sensitive indicator of adsorption events. These findings suggest that tailoring ligand design can predictably manipulate the structural and adsorption characteristics of MOFs, potentially leading to advanced materials for selective gas capture and real-time sensing technologies. Further research will focus on optimizing the ligand structure and exploring the applicability of DUT-140(M) across a broader range of gas species.
