**Abstract**

The intricate interplay between light and matter dictates molecular reactivity, a phenomenon increasingly recognized as susceptible to non-equilibrium modifications. This study introduces a theoretical framework elucidating how optical cavities, specifically engineered to exhibit strong vibrational coupling, can dramatically alter reaction rates within adsorbed molecules. Our investigation centers on the concept of ‘polariton chemistry,’ wherein cavity radiation modes interact with molecular vibrational transitions, generating hybrid light-matter excitations. These polaritons, characterized by their photon frequency-dependent properties, induce a pronounced ‘dynamical caging effect,’ effectively restricting molecular conformational freedom and hindering reactant access. 

Through rigorous modeling incorporating non-Markovian dynamics, we demonstrate that the spectral overlap between the polariton resonance and the relevant molecular vibrational band dictates the extent of reaction suppression. Critically, we observe a significant reduction in reaction rates at specific photon frequencies, correlating directly with the cavity’s resonant characteristics.  This effect transcends simple energy transfer, proposing a mechanism wherein the cavity actively shapes the molecular environment.  The theoretical predictions, validated through numerical simulations, suggest potential applications in controlling chemical reactions with unprecedented precision, utilizing tailored optical cavities to achieve selective reactivity modulation.  Further experimental validation is warranted to fully explore this emergent phenomenon in 2021 and beyond.
