This study reports the development of a catalytic system utilizing palladium(0) nanoparticles stabilized within amphiphilic block copolymer nanomicelles for mediating cross-coupling reactions in aqueous environments. A significant challenge in aqueous-phase catalysis involves the inherent instability of highly reactive electrophilic partners, particularly acid chlorides, which are prone to rapid hydrolysis. Our methodology addresses this limitation by leveraging the unique microenvironment provided by the nanomicelles, which act as nanoreactors to compartmentalize and protect the sensitive substrates from the bulk aqueous phase. The surfactant PS-750-M was identified as a critical component for forming stable micellar assemblies and ensuring high dispersion of the active Pd(0) species. This system facilitates efficient Suzuki-Miyaura and related carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions between acid chlorides and various nucleophilic partners, achieving excellent yields while circumventing substrate decomposition. The catalytic protocol demonstrates broad functional group tolerance and operational simplicity, highlighting the potential of micellar encapsulation as a general strategy for conducting water-sensitive transformations under environmentally benign aqueous conditions. This approach offers a sustainable alternative to traditional organic solvents without compromising catalytic efficiency.
