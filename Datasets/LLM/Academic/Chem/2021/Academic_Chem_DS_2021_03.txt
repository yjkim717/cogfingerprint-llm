This study employs second harmonic scattering (SHS) spectroscopy to quantitatively investigate the specific adsorption of alkali metal cations at the silica (SiO₂)-aqueous electrolyte interface. By systematically varying the ionic composition at micromolar concentrations, we elucidate distinct cation-dependent mechanisms that modulate the interfacial electrostatic potential. Our SHS measurements reveal that kosmotropic cations (e.g., Li⁺) induce a more pronounced decrease in the interfacial potential compared to their chaotropic counterparts (e.g., Cs⁺), an effect not fully accounted for by classical mean-field theories. This ion-specific behavior is directly correlated with changes in the orientational distribution of interfacial water molecules, as inferred from the SHS response. The findings demonstrate that specific ion adsorption governs the local hydrogen-bonding network and the resultant interfacial electric field, with significant implications for predicting colloidal stability and reactivity in aqueous environments. This work, conducted in 2021, establishes SHS as a critical tool for probing non-linear optical phenomena arising from ion-water-surface interactions at buried solid-liquid interfaces.
