**Abstract**

The long-standing assumption of homogeneous ice mantle formation on interstellar refractory grains has been challenged by recent experimental evidence. This investigation employs cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) to systematically analyze the crystallization behavior and resultant morphologies of amorphous solid water (ASW) and complex amorphous ices deposited onto a range of astrophysically relevant substrates, including forsterite (Mg₂SiO₄) and amorphous carbon. Contrary to canonical models, our results demonstrate a profound substrate-dependence, where interfacial chemistry and topography dictate nucleation kinetics and the ensuing crystalline architecture. We observe a spectrum of structures, from highly textured, epitaxial cubic ice (Iˢc) on silicate surfaces to randomly oriented, polycrystalline films on carbonaceous grains. Furthermore, the inclusion of non-volatile organic residues within the ice matrix significantly alters the amorphous-to-crystalline transition temperature and suppresses grain growth, leading to metastable, glassy states. These findings, obtained in 2021, necessitate a revision of astrochemical models, as the microphysical structure of icy grain mantles—governed by underlying grain properties—is a critical, yet overlooked, parameter influencing surface chemistry, light scattering, and the thermal evolution of protoplanetary disks.
