**Abstract**

The integration of multiple, synergistic functionalities within a single porous framework represents a frontier in advanced material design. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel series of isoreticular metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived from the DUT-49 archetype, engineered to concurrently exhibit the rare phenomenon of negative gas adsorption (NGA) and intrinsic fluorescent functionality. These soft porous crystals were constructed using custom-designed, fluorescent organic linkers, maintaining the underlying topology required for collective host-guest-induced structural transitions. Upon adsorption of methane at defined pressures, these materials undergo a sudden, discontinuous pore contraction, releasing stored gas and demonstrating pronounced NGA, accompanied by a significant intrinsic pressure amplification effect. Crucially, we establish a direct correlation between the structural dynamics and the optical properties; the framework's fluorescence exhibits a quantifiable, reversible shift in response to the NGA-triggered phase transition. This coupling was elucidated through *in situ* spectroscopic techniques and corroborated by Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, which model the free energy landscape underlying the metastable states. The successful fusion of NGA with fluorescence reporting in a single platform opens pathways for creating intelligent, self-reporting adsorbents and novel chemical sensors for pressure and gas detection.
