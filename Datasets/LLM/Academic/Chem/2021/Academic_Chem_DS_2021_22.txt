This investigation explores collisional cooling mechanisms in primordial hydrogenic molecular systems within alternative dark matter frameworks. We compute state-resolved quantum reaction rates for rovibrational transitions in (p̄⁺e⁻)-type exotic species interacting with baryonic matter. Cross-sections are derived using non-adiabatic coupled-channel methods across astrophysically relevant temperature regimes (10-10⁴ K). Our results demonstrate enhanced energy dissipation channels through resonant charge-exchange processes, yielding cooling rates up to three orders of magnitude greater than conventional WIMP scenarios. These findings establish critical microphysical inputs for hydrodynamic simulations of early structure formation, suggesting dissipative dark matter components could significantly accelerate halo condensation timelines through efficient molecular cooling pathways.
