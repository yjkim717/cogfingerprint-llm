This investigation systematically explores the influence of oxidative agent selection in metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE) on the resulting architecture of porous silicon. We demonstrate that the chemical nature of the oxidizer fundamentally directs pore propagation mechanisms, leading to distinct morphological regimes. Employing hydrogen peroxide as the oxidant yields highly anisotropic, parallel macropores with minimal branching, characteristic of a diffusion-limited etching front. Conversely, potassium permanganate induces a transition to a three-dimensionally interconnected mesoporous network, attributed to its higher oxidation potential promoting isotropic silicon dissolution. These structural differences are quantitatively correlated with Raman spectroscopic signatures, revealing characteristic phonon confinement effects corresponding to specific pore wall dimensions. Our findings establish a rational framework for tailoring silicon porosity—from directional to sponge-like architectures—through strategic oxidizer choice, with significant implications for applications in photonics, energy storage, and sensing platforms.
