 Here's an academic abstract inspired by the provided summary and keywords, written in a formal style and suitable for a chemistry publication (as of a 2021 context):

"This study reports the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of three novel fluorescent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), designated DUT-140(M), structurally analogous to the established DUT-49 series. These isoreticular MOFs demonstrate intriguing properties including pressure amplification and, notably, negative gas adsorption behavior, indicative of framework flexibility and potential for selective gas capture. Particular attention is given to DUT-140(Cu), examining its detailed adsorption isotherms and photophysical characteristics. Results reveal a unique interplay between the copper coordination environment and the MOF's porous architecture, impacting both gas uptake and fluorescence quantum yields. These findings contribute to the ongoing development of advanced porous materials for gas separation and sensing applications."
