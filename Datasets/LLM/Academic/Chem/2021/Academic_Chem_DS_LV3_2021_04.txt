**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of vibrational polariton chemistry has demonstrated that strong light-matter coupling within infrared optical cavities can fundamentally alter chemical reaction landscapes. While experimental observations of modified reaction rates are well-documented, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the underlying microscopic mechanisms remains a significant challenge. This work establishes a unified theoretical framework that elucidates the critical role of **non-Markovian dynamics** in mediating cavity-induced chemical reactivity. We demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons does not merely create new hybrid light-matter states but also imposes a structured photonic environment that engenders strong memory effects in the molecular system's evolution. Our analysis reveals that the observed **reaction rate suppression** is not a static phenomenon but a direct consequence of a **dynamical caging effect**. This caging arises from the cavity's ability to transiently localize energy within the reactive bonds, effectively hindering the system from sampling the transition state geometry. Crucially, our model provides a mechanistic explanation for the **cavity frequency-dependent** nature of this suppression, linking the optimal inhibitory effect to a resonant condition between the cavity mode and specific anharmonic vibrational overtones of the reactant. These findings, positioned within the 2021 research landscape, bridge a critical gap between quantum optical descriptions and chemical kinetics, offering predictive power for tailoring photonic environments to control molecular transformations with unprecedented specificity.
