Title: Non-Markovian Rate Theory for Vibrational Strong Coupling-Induced Modification of Ground State Reactivity

Abstract:
The emerging field of polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention due to its potential to manipulate chemical reactivity through vibrational strong coupling (VSC). In this work, we present a theoretical framework to elucidate the cavity modification of ground state reactivity in the VSC regime. Employing non-Markovian rate theory, we demonstrate that the cavity frequency plays a crucial role in modulating the reaction rate constant. Our analysis reveals that the non-Markovian dynamics of the system-bath interaction, influenced by the cavity frequency, significantly impact the reaction kinetics. By incorporating the effects of cavity frequency on the non-Markovian dynamics, our theoretical model provides a comprehensive understanding of the VSC-induced modification of ground state reactivity. The results presented herein offer valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms governing VSC-mediated chemistry, shedding light on the potential applications of polariton chemistry in controlling chemical reactions.
