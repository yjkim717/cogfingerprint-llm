Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, targeting a chemistry/astrophysics audience, based on your provided summary and adhering to the requested style and word count (~257 words). I've aimed for a level of detail consistent with a publication in a journal like *Astrochemistry and Molecular Physics* or *The Astrophysical Journal Letters*.

**Abstract**

The formation of ices within interstellar environments is a critical process governing the chemical evolution of molecular clouds and the subsequent composition of protoplanetary disks. While theoretical models extensively explore ice condensation pathways, direct observational constraints on ice morphology at the nanoscale remain limited. This study presents a novel application of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the morphology of ice layers formed on refractory grain analogues, simulating conditions prevalent in cold molecular cloud cores. Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of ice habit on the underlying substrate material and the ice composition. Specifically, we observed a diverse range of morphologies, including layered structures, amorphous aggregates, and crystalline domains, influenced by the surface energy and chemical reactivity of materials such as silicates and carbonaceous grains.  Variations in ice composition, particularly the ratio of H₂O to other volatile species (e.g., CO, CH₃OH), further modulated the observed ice structures, frequently resulting in phase separation and heterogeneous nucleation. These findings provide crucial, high-resolution data for validating theoretical models of ice accretion and crystallization kinetics in astrophysical ices. The ability to directly visualize these nanoscale features will significantly refine our understanding of the role of grain surface properties in ice growth, impacting predictions of grain mantle composition and, ultimately, the chemical feedstock available for planet formation within protoplanetary disks. This work contributes to a growing body of research bridging laboratory simulations and astronomical observations in the field of astrochemistry.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Expansion:**

*   **Emphasis on Significance:** I've explicitly stated *why* this research matters (planet formation, refining models).
*   **Specific Examples:** Mentioning CO and CH₃OH gives more concrete detail.
*   **Linking to Broader Context:**  I included a sentence about bridging lab and astronomical observations.
*   **Future Work (Optional):**  If the study involved different grain types or ice compositions, you could briefly mention that future work will explore that wider parameter space.
