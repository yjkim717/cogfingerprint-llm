Title: Exploring the Interplay between Structural Flexibility and Optical Properties in Isoreticular Metal-Organic Frameworks

Abstract:
The design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored optical properties have garnered significant attention in recent years. Herein, we report the development of a new series of isoreticular MOFs incorporating fluorescent ligands, which exhibit a unique combination of porosity, flexibility, and light absorption characteristics. The synthesized MOFs were thoroughly characterized using a range of techniques, including X-ray diffraction, gas sorption analysis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Notably, the incorporation of fluorescent functionality within the MOF structure enabled the observation of pressure amplification and negative gas adsorption phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that the judicious selection of ligand design and framework topology can be leveraged to modulate the optical properties of MOFs, paving the way for the development of novel materials with potential applications in sensing and optoelectronics. The results of this study contribute to the ongoing exploration of the complex interplay between structural flexibility and optical properties in MOFs.
