**Abstract**

The formation of ices within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks represents a critical, yet incompletely understood, phase in planet formation. This study investigates the intricate relationship between ice morphology, crystalline structure, and elemental composition using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at cryogenic temperatures. Analysis of TEM micrographs reveals that ice morphologies on refractory grains are markedly dependent on both the ice’s constituent elements and the nature of the underlying substrate. Specifically, we observe a pronounced shift in crystalline habit – from amorphous to highly ordered, often exhibiting complex dendritic growth – correlating with variations in water ice, methanol ice, and ammonia ice ratios. These observations directly impact the efficiency of chemical evolution within these nascent planetary systems, influencing the abundance of volatile species. Furthermore, the resultant ice crystal structures contribute to altered rates of nonthermal desorption, impacting the delivery of organic molecules to forming planets.
