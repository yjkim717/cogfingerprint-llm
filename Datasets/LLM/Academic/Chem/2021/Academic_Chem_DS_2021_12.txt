**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of asymmetric catalysis continues to be propelled by the strategic design of chiral catalysts that operate through sophisticated activation modes. While traditional paradigms often delineate between organocatalysis and transition metal catalysis, a growing class of hybrid catalytic systems defies such simple classification. This perspective examines the emergence of chiral metal complexes that function not as classical Lewis acid activators, but as structural scaffolds to pre-organize and electronically enhance organic functional groups. In these systems, the metal center primarily serves to rigidify a chiral ligand framework, thereby creating a highly defined chiral pocket from which secondary interactions—such as hydrogen bonding, ion pairing, π-stacking, and electrostatic effects—govern enantioselective control over the reacting substrates. This "scaffolding" role of the metal distinguishes these catalysts from their conventional counterparts, where substrate coordination to the metal is integral to the catalytic cycle. The discussion herein will analyze key recent examples from the literature (circa 2021) where this principle is operative, highlighting how ligand design, informed by computational insights, can optimize these non-covalent interactions. We will explore the implications of this mechanistic paradigm for catalyst development, including the potential for superior functional group tolerance and the catalysis of transformations previously inaccessible to purely metallic or organic systems. By re-evaluating the role of the metal from a direct activator to an architect of a sophisticated chiral environment, this perspective aims to inspire the next generation of multifunctional asymmetric catalysts that leverage synergistic effects for unparalleled stereocontrol.
