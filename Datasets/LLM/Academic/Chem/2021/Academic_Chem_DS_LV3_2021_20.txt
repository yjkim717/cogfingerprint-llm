In this theoretical investigation, we elucidate the fundamental mechanisms by which vibrational strong coupling (VSC) governs chemical reactivity through a cavity frequency-dependent framework. Our model demonstrates that the formation of vibrational polaritons induces profound non-Markovian dynamics, fundamentally altering the reaction pathway. A pivotal finding is the significant suppression of the reaction rate observed when the cavity frequency is tuned in proximity to the intrinsic molecular vibrational frequency, specifically near the activation barrier. This phenomenon is quantitatively attributed to the dynamical caging effect, wherein the hybrid light-matter state effectively restrains nuclear motion along the reaction coordinate, thereby increasing the effective activation barrier. The non-Markovian character of the polaritonic environment introduces a memory effect, causing the system's evolution to depend on its history, which further modulates the kinetic outcomes. This work provides a unified theoretical explanation for recent experimental observations of modified reaction rates under VSC, moving beyond a simple transition-state theory description. By rigorously connecting cavity frequency, non-Markovian dynamics, and the dynamical caging effect, our findings establish a new paradigm for controlling chemical transformations through quantum optical environments, with broad implications for polariton chemistry and the design of novel catalytic platforms.
