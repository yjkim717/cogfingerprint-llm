Title: Cavity-Modulated Ground State Reactivity in the Vibrational Strong Coupling Regime: A Non-Markovian Perspective

Abstract:
The emerging field of polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of vibrational strong coupling (VSC). In this regime, the reaction rate constant of ground state chemical reactions is found to be modified by the cavity radiation mode. To elucidate this phenomenon, we present a theoretical framework that incorporates non-Markovian dynamics to describe the cavity-modulated reactivity. By accounting for the non-perturbative coupling between the molecular vibrations and the cavity mode, our model reveals the intricate interplay between the cavity radiation field and the reaction coordinate. We demonstrate that the cavity-modified reaction rate constant can be attributed to the non-Markovian memory effects arising from the strongly coupled cavity-molecule system. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the VSC-induced modifications to ground state reactivity, shedding new light on the underlying mechanisms governing polariton chemistry. (2021)
