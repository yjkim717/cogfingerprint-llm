This study reports the synthesis and characterization of a novel series of isoreticular metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived from the DUT-49 archetype, engineered to integrate fluorescent properties with anomalous adsorption phenomena. We demonstrate that these soft porous crystals exhibit a pronounced negative gas adsorption (NGA) transition upon exposure to methane at cryogenic temperatures, accompanied by a distinct and quantifiable fluorescence shift. This synergistic effect provides a direct optical signature of the structural transition, enabling real-time monitoring of the NGA event. Spectroscopic analysis and in-situ high-pressure experiments confirm that the pressure amplification inherent to the NGA mechanism directly modulates the electronic environment of the fluorophore. Complementary grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the framework flexibility and specific ligand functionalization are critical for stabilizing the metastable states responsible for this coupled behavior. The concurrent optical and adsorptive response observed in these multifunctional materials establishes a new paradigm for designing sensor systems that translate mechanical energy from gas adsorption directly into a detectable optical signal, with potential applications in advanced chemical sensing and solid-state actuator technologies.
