**Abstract**

The reactivity of carbon atoms on interstellar ice analogues remains a critical process in understanding the formation of complex organic molecules in space. This study investigates the reaction dynamics of ground-state carbon atoms (C(³P)) with amorphous solid water (ASW) at low temperatures (10–20 K), with a focus on the mechanism of formaldehyde (H₂CO) formation. Utilizing temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) coupled with theoretical density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate that the reaction proceeds via a water-catalyzed proton transfer. The extensive hydrogen-bonding network of ASW facilitates this catalysis by significantly lowering the energy barrier for the insertion of the carbon atom into a water molecule, leading to the hydroxymethylene (HCOH) intermediate and its subsequent isomerization to H₂CO. These findings underscore the pivotal role of the ASW matrix not merely as a passive substrate but as an active catalytic participant, providing a low-energy pathway for molecular complexity in cold astrophysical environments.
