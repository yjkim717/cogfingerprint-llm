**Abstract**

The design and synthesis of porous crystalline materials exhibiting dual functionality remains a significant challenge in chemical research. Here, we report the construction and characterization of a novel metal-organic framework (MOF), designated DUT-140, incorporating fluorescent properties alongside intriguing gas adsorption characteristics. DUT-140, synthesized via a solvothermal method, demonstrates a robust three-dimensional structure and was thoroughly characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, gas sorption analysis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Notably, experimental results reveal pressure amplification behavior within the framework, suggesting the potential for enhanced gas uptake under specific conditions. Furthermore, we observed negative gas adsorption for CO<sub>2</sub> at low pressures, a phenomenon attributed to the framework's unique pore geometry and interaction energetics. The integrated fluorescent functionality, originating from [Specify the fluorophore if known, e.g., a pyrene-based linker], allows for potential sensing applications and provides a valuable probe for investigating guest-host interactions within the MOF pores. These findings highlight DUT-140 as a promising candidate for applications requiring both gas separation/storage and optical sensing capabilities, contributing to the ongoing development of multifunctional porous materials. Further investigations into the optimization of pore functionality and exploration of different guest molecules are warranted to fully exploit the potential of this novel MOF system.
