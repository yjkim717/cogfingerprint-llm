**Abstract**

Recent investigations into formaldehyde formation pathways have highlighted inconsistencies within the existing literature. This study introduces a novel mechanistic proposal, supported by both computational modeling and experimental data, suggesting a direct reaction between carbon atoms and amorphous solid water (ASW) as a significant contributor to formaldehyde generation.  Hydrogen bonding networks within the ASW structure appear to act as a critical catalytic element, facilitating this previously unconsidered reaction.  Kinetic isotope effect analysis further corroborates the involvement of specific carbon-hydrogen bond cleavages.  These findings challenge prevailing assumptions regarding formaldehyde genesis and provide a framework for resolving longstanding discrepancies.  The observed pathway represents a potentially significant process in environments containing both carbonaceous materials and hydrated amorphous solids, demanding further investigation into its prevalence and implications for diverse chemical systems.
