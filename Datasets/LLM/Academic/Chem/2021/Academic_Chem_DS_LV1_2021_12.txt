**Abstract**

The emerging field of vibrational polariton chemistry has demonstrated that strong light-matter coupling within infrared optical cavities can fundamentally alter chemical reactivity, notably by suppressing reaction rates. While initial experimental observations are compelling, a comprehensive theoretical framework explaining the underlying microscopic mechanisms remains an active area of research. This work presents a theoretical investigation into the non-Markovian dynamics governing reaction rate suppression under vibrational strong coupling (VSC). We demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—introduces a potent, frequency-dependent caging effect on the reactive coordinate. Our model reveals that this caging is not a static barrier but arises from the dynamical back-action between the cavity field and the molecular ensemble, which imposes a collective energy constraint on the system. This constraint effectively decelerates the trajectory along the reaction pathway by redistributing the vibrational energy. Crucially, the efficacy of this suppression is non-trivially dependent on the cavity frequency, exhibiting a resonant profile when the cavity is tuned near the frequency of the specific vibrational mode directly coupled to the reaction coordinate. These findings provide a unified explanation for key experimental observations and establish non-Markovianity as a central principle in polariton chemistry, paving the way for the targeted optical control of ground-state chemical processes.
