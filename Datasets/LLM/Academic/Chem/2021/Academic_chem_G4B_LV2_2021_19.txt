**Abstract**

Metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials for gas adsorption and sensing applications, yet their inherent structural rigidity often limits their performance. This study reports the synthesis and characterization of a novel fluorescent MOF, designated DUT-140(M), designed to overcome these limitations. Utilizing a specifically engineered fluorescent ligand, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in structural flexibility, leading to the observation of negative gas adsorption isotherms for carbon dioxide. Spectroscopic analysis, including X-ray diffraction and UV-Vis spectroscopy, reveals a pronounced structural contraction upon gas exposure, a key factor contributing to the observed negative adsorption. 

Computational modeling, employing density functional theory (DFT), corroborated these experimental findings, suggesting a mechanism involving ligand-guest interactions that induce a conformational change within the MOF framework. This contraction effectively reduces the accessible void volume, resulting in a decrease in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake at elevated pressures.  The fluorescent nature of DUT-140(M) further provides a sensitive indicator of structural modifications, enabling real-time monitoring of the adsorption process.  These results highlight the potential of rationally designed fluorescent MOFs to exhibit tailored gas adsorption behavior, specifically negative adsorption, and provide a pathway for developing advanced pressure amplification strategies within porous materials.
