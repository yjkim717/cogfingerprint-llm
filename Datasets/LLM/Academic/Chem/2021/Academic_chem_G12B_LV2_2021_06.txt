**Abstract**

The formation of formaldehyde (CH₂O) under astrophysical conditions remains a critical, yet incompletely understood, process. This work investigates a novel pathway for formaldehyde synthesis involving the reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW), a prevalent component of interstellar ices. Utilizing computational chemistry methods, specifically density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that carbon atom incorporation into ASW is significantly facilitated by water’s extensive hydrogen bonding network. These simulations reveal a plausible reaction mechanism whereby water molecules act as catalysts, stabilizing key intermediates and lowering the activation energy barrier for formaldehyde formation. Complementary experimental investigations, employing controlled deposition and annealing of carbon and ASW mixtures, provide initial support for this H₂O-catalyzed pathway. Observed kinetic isotope effects, assessed through deuterium substitution, further corroborate the involvement of hydrogen bonding in the reaction kinetics. These findings suggest that ASW, acting as a reactive matrix and catalyst, represents a potentially significant environment for formaldehyde production in cold, dense molecular clouds.
