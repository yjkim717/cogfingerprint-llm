**Abstract**

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials exhibiting tunable porosity and functionality, yet realizing significant performance enhancements remains a considerable challenge. This work details the synthesis and characterization of a novel fluorescent MOF, designated DUT-140(M), engineered to demonstrate enhanced structural flexibility and nitrogen gas affinity (NGA). Utilizing a combination of spectroscopic techniques – including powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and photoluminescence spectroscopy – alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the observed properties. 

The synthesized DUT-140(M) exhibits a notable degree of structural contraction upon guest molecule adsorption, a phenomenon directly correlated with the incorporation of specific fluorescent ligands. This contraction, coupled with the inherent fluorescence of the framework, facilitates pressure amplification during gas uptake, potentially offering a route to intensified sensing applications. Furthermore, computational analysis reveals a pronounced negative gas adsorption behavior, suggesting a preferential interaction between the MOF and nitrogen. 

These findings underscore the potential of rationally designed fluorescent MOFs as advanced materials for applications requiring both optical sensing and selective gas capture. Future research will focus on exploring the scope of this approach by investigating variations in ligand design and framework topology to further optimize performance characteristics.
