Title: Water-Catalyzed Formaldehyde Formation via Carbon Atom Reaction with Amorphous Solid Water: Implications for Astrochemistry

Abstract:
The reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW) has been investigated as a potential mechanism for formaldehyde formation in interstellar environments. Our results demonstrate that this reaction efficiently yields formaldehyde via a water-catalyzed proton transfer mechanism, underscoring the crucial role of ASW in facilitating this process. The reaction pathway involves the initial formation of a C-ASW complex, followed by a proton transfer step mediated by surrounding water molecules. This water-catalyzed reaction pathway significantly enhances the reactivity of carbon atoms, enabling the formation of formaldehyde at low temperatures. Our findings have important implications for understanding the astrochemical origins of formaldehyde and other complex organic molecules in interstellar space, providing insights into the molecular processes that shape the chemical composition of celestial environments.
