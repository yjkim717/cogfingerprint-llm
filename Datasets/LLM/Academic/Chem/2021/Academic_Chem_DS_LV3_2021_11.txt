Abstract

The 2021 investigation of the DUT-140(M) series of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) presents a significant advancement in stimuli-responsive porous materials. By strategically integrating a custom-designed fluorescent organic ligand into the framework architecture, we engineered a multifunctional system exhibiting coupled optoelectronic and gas sorption phenomena. A key discovery is the manifestation of negative gas adsorption (NGA), an unconventional counterintuitive process where the material expels adsorbate upon increased gas pressure. This NGA transition, triggered at a specific pressure threshold, is directly correlated with a pronounced structural contraction, yielding a substantial intrinsic pressure amplification effect within the pores. The incorporated fluorophore served as an intrinsic molecular probe, with its emission properties sensitively modulated by the framework's dynamic structural changes during adsorption. Our findings, supported by in situ spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, establish a direct structure-property relationship. This work demonstrates that the rational fusion of a fluorescent reporter within a flexible MOF scaffold provides a powerful strategy for the real-time, optical monitoring of complex adsorption-driven structural transitions, paving the way for novel sensor technologies and energy conversion systems.
