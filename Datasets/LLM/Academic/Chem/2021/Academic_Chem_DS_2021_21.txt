**Abstract**

The detection of complex organic molecules in cold, dark molecular clouds provides critical insights into prebiotic chemical evolution. In this study, we report the identification of methylcyanotriacetylene (CH₃C₇N) within the Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 (TMC-1), achieved through high-sensitivity spectral line observations conducted as part of the GOTHAM survey at the Green Bank Telescope. This finding extends the known inventory of long-chain cyanopolymers in interstellar space. To elucidate the formation chemistry of such species, we performed detailed gas-grain chemical kinetics modeling. Our simulations reveal a significant divergence in the dominant formation pathways between saturated methylpolyynes (e.g., CH₃C₂ₙ₊₁H) and their cyanated counterparts, the methylcyanopolyynes (CH₃C₂ₙ₊₁N). The results indicate that while methylpolyynes are efficiently formed via successive acetylene additions to methyl radicals, methylcyanopolyynes likely arise from alternative routes involving the reaction of cyanopolyyne anions with abundant small organics like methanol. This mechanistic distinction, established in 2021, underscores the complex and non-linear nature of molecular growth in cold interstellar environments and has profound implications for our understanding of molecular complexity preceding star and planet formation.
