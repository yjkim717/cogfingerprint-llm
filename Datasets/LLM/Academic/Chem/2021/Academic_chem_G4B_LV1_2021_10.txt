**Abstract**

The formation of hydrogenocarbon (H₂CO) represents a significant, yet mechanistically elusive, pathway in carbon dioxide genesis. This study presents compelling evidence for a novel catalytic route involving the interaction of elemental carbon with amorphous solid water (ASW), ultimately yielding H₂CO. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate a concerted mechanism wherein hydrogen bonding within the ASW matrix facilitates initial carbon activation. Subsequent proton transfer events, driven by the inherent acidity of the ASW, promote the formation of the H₂CO molecule. Experimental validation, achieved through spectroscopic analysis of reaction products under controlled conditions, corroborates the computational predictions.  These findings suggest that ASW possesses a latent catalytic potential, potentially influencing carbon cycling in diverse environmental systems. The observed pathway provides a framework for understanding unconventional CO₂ formation and warrants further investigation into the role of hydrogen bonding in surface catalysis.
