**Abstract**

The reactivity of atomic carbon on interstellar ice analogues remains a subject of debate, with significant discrepancies in reported activation barriers for the formation of simple organic molecules. Herein, we employ ab initio molecular dynamics and microkinetic modeling to elucidate the reaction mechanism of a single carbon atom interacting with amorphous solid water (ASW) at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that the ASW matrix is not a passive substrate but acts as an efficient proton transfer catalyst. This water-mediated catalysis dramatically reduces the effective activation barrier for the formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) compared to gas-phase or non-catalytic surface reactions. The proposed mechanism involves a water molecule facilitating a proton relay, enabling a low-energy pathway for hydrogenation and C–O bond formation. This work reconciles conflicting literature values by highlighting the critical role of the water ice environment, providing a robust, experimentally testable model for the efficient formation of prebiotic molecules in dark molecular clouds.
