**Abstract: Compositional Control of Ice Morphology in Protoplanetary Environments – A Transmission Electron Microscopy Study**

The formation of ices within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks represents a critical phase in planetary system evolution.  Understanding the intricate relationship between ice composition and resultant morphology is paramount to elucidating accretion processes and the delivery of volatiles to nascent planetary cores. This study reports on a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation into the 3D morphology of water (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and carbon monoxide (CO) ices, specifically those formed on refractory silicate grains, conducted in 2021. Utilizing cryo-TEM techniques, we observed substantial compositional dependence in ice crystal structure. 

Analysis revealed that CO₂ ice exhibited a markedly columnar morphology, contrasting with the more disordered and plate-like structures observed for H₂O and CO ices.  These variations are attributed to differences in intermolecular forces and hydrogen bonding networks within each ice phase.  Furthermore, the presence of trace impurities, inferred from localized textural variations within the TEM images, appears to modulate crystal growth kinetics and ultimately, the observed morphology.  These findings provide critical insights into the potential for compositional gradients within icy mantles and offer a framework for interpreting observational data from protoplanetary disk surveys.  Future work will focus on quantifying these morphological differences and their implications for ice dynamics within circumstellar environments.
