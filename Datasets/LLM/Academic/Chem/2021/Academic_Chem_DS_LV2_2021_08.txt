Herein, we present a theoretical framework elucidating the mechanism of reaction rate suppression under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in optical cavities. Conventional chemical kinetics fails to describe this phenomenon, as it emerges from the formation of vibrational polaritons and their non-Markovian dynamics. Our analysis demonstrates that the cavity environment induces a frequency-dependent dynamical caging effect on the reactive molecular coordinate. This caging originates from the hybrid light-matter character of the polaritonic states, which effectively restructures the potential energy landscape and introduces memory effects into the reaction pathway. The suppression is most pronounced when the cavity frequency is resonant with a key molecular vibration, leading to a significant redistribution of vibrational energy flow and a consequent retardation of the reaction trajectory. This work provides a fundamental, dynamical explanation for VSC-modified chemistry, moving beyond a purely energetic description and highlighting the critical role of cavity-induced non-Markovianity in controlling ground-state chemical reactivities.
