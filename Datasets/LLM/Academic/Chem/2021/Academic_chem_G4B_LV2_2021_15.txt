**Abstract**

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials with applications spanning gas storage, catalysis, and sensing. This research details the synthesis and characterization of a novel fluorescent MOF, designated DUT-140(M), demonstrating unique properties including pressure amplification and negative gas adsorption. Spectroscopic investigations, encompassing powder X-ray diffraction and UV-Vis spectroscopy, confirmed the formation of a distinct crystalline structure exhibiting a pronounced blue fluorescence.  Computational modeling, employing density functional theory (DFT), elucidated the underlying mechanism for pressure amplification – a consequence of structural contraction upon guest molecule incorporation. 

Crucially, DUT-140(M) exhibited negative gas adsorption isotherms for carbon dioxide and methane, a counterintuitive behavior previously rarely observed in MOF systems. This phenomenon is attributed to a synergistic interaction between the framework’s geometry and the guest molecules, leading to a localized decrease in internal pressure.  These findings suggest a potential application in selective gas separation and sensor development.  The observed fluorescence, coupled with the unconventional adsorption characteristics, positions DUT-140(M) as a promising platform for future research into responsive and tunable MOF materials.
