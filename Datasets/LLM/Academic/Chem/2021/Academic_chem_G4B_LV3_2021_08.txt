**Abstract**

Recent advancements in nonlinear optics have illuminated the potential for manipulating molecular dynamics through tailored photonic environments. This study introduces a theoretical model demonstrating how vibrational strong coupling within optical microcavities can induce a novel form of ‘dynamical caging’ of chemical reactions. Utilizing polariton chemistry, we explore the impact of photon frequency dependence on reaction rates. Specifically, we predict a suppression of reaction kinetics as a function of incident light frequency, mirroring the solvent caging effect traditionally observed in solution chemistry.  The theoretical framework incorporates non-Markovian dynamics, acknowledging the extended photon-matter interaction timescales characteristic of microcavity systems.  These findings suggest a pathway for precise control over chemical processes via engineered optical fields, offering opportunities for enhanced selectivity and efficiency in photochemical transformations. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm these predictions and fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
