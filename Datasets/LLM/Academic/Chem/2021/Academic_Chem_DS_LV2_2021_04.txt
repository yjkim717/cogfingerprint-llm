**Abstract**

The emerging field of vibrational polariton chemistry, wherein molecular vibrations are strongly coupled to the confined electromagnetic modes of an optical cavity, presents a novel paradigm for controlling chemical reactivity. A significant experimental observation within this domain is the suppression of reaction rates under vibrational strong coupling (VSC), a phenomenon that classical transition state theory fails to adequately explain. This theoretical work provides a mechanistic framework for this suppression by rigorously accounting for the non-Markovian dynamics inherent to the polaritonic system. We demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—alters the reactive potential energy landscape. Crucially, the cavity environment induces a frequency-dependent dynamical caging effect on the molecular reaction coordinate. This caging is not static but arises from the persistent feedback and memory effects characteristic of non-Markovian processes, which effectively hinder the system's progression along the reaction pathway. Our analysis reveals that the extent of reaction rate suppression is intrinsically linked to the cavity frequency, achieving maximum efficacy when the cavity is resonant with a specific molecular vibrational mode. These findings, established in 2021, reconcile key experimental results and underscore the critical role of collective quantum dynamics in governing chemical transformations under strong light-matter coupling.
