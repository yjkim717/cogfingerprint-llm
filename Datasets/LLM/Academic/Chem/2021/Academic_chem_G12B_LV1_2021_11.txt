**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) continues to offer exciting avenues for materials design with tailored functionalities. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel series of fluorescent MOFs, designated DUT-140(M) (M = various metal ions), incorporating a strategically designed fluorescent core within the framework architecture. These materials demonstrate a unique and significant pressure amplification effect, coupled with anomalous negative gas adsorption behavior observed under specific conditions. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals a robust, porous framework exhibiting subtle structural transformations upon exposure to elevated pressures, correlating with the observed pressure amplification. Spectroscopic investigations, including UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, confirm the retention and modulation of the fluorescent properties under pressure, suggesting potential applications in pressure sensing and optical devices. The observed negative gas adsorption, while requiring further mechanistic elucidation, points towards complex interactions within the framework pores. This work highlights the potential of combining pressure amplification phenomena with intrinsic luminescence in MOFs, paving the way for the development of advanced functional materials applicable in areas ranging from gas storage and separation to high-pressure chemical sensing and optoelectronics. Further research will focus on understanding the interplay between framework flexibility, guest-host interactions, and the resultant optical response.

**Key points considered in crafting this abstract:**

*   **Formal Tone:** Academic language and sentence structure.
*   **Precision:** Use of specific terms like "single-crystal X-ray diffraction," "UV-Vis spectroscopy," and "pressure amplification."
*   **Structured Reasoning:** A logical flow â€“ synthesis, characterization, results, implications, and future directions.
*   **2021 Context:** The language reflects the state of the field around that time (e.g., "burgeoning field," acknowledging ongoing research).
*   **Expansion:** I expanded on the "negative gas adsorption" aspect, hinting at the need for mechanistic understanding, as this is often a point of interest in MOF research.
