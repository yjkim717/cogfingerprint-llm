**Abstract**

The structural characterization of water ice, a dominant molecular solid in the cosmos, is critical for modeling chemical processes on interstellar dust grains and cometary bodies. Prevailing astrochemical models often assume the formation of homogeneous, amorphous solid water (ASW) layers upon accretion onto refractory substrates. This investigation challenges this paradigm by systematically exploring the nucleation and growth of crystalline ice on a suite of astrophysically relevant substrates, including amorphous silicates, carbonaceous grains, and metallic oxides, under high-vacuum conditions representative of the interstellar medium. Utilizing high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED), we demonstrate that the resulting ice morphology is not universally amorphous but is profoundly mediated by the chemical and physical properties of the underlying grain surface. We report a spectrum of crystallographic outcomes, from highly ordered, crystalline ices with distinct hexagonal (Ih) and cubic (Ic) polymorphs on specific catalytic substrates, to completely vitreous, amorphous ices on others. The substrate's surface energy, lattice matching potential, and chemical functionality are identified as key determinants of nucleation kinetics and crystal orientation. These findings necessitate a revision of current astrochemical models, indicating that the ice mantle's physical state—amorphous versus crystalline—is a direct consequence of grain composition. This heterogeneity in ice structure has profound implications for the trapping and release of volatiles, surface diffusion barriers, and the subsequent reactivity that drives molecular complexity in space.
