**Abstract**

The incorporation of a fluorescent organic ligand into the metal-organic framework DUT-140 has enabled unprecedented real-time monitoring of its negative gas adsorption (NGA) phenomenon. NGA, a counterintuitive pressure-amplifying response triggered by external gas pressure, involves a metastable-to-stable structural transition in flexible frameworks. By designing a ligand with intrinsic fluorescence, we established a direct spectroscopic probe for the pore contraction event. In situ fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a quantifiable shift in emission maxima correlated with the onset of NGA, providing a direct optical signature of the lattice rearrangement. This experimental data was corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which modelled the electronic structure changes of the ligand during the transition. The synergy between spectroscopic evidence and computational modelling elucidates the atomistic mechanism of the pressure-amplification process. This work, conducted in 2021, demonstrates that fluorophore integration transforms NGA materials into self-reporting systems, opening new pathways for designing intelligent, sensor-equipped porous materials with advanced diagnostic capabilities for monitoring gas-solid interactions under non-equilibrium conditions.
