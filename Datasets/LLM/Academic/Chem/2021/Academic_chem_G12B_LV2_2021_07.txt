Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, aiming for precision, structured reasoning, and appropriate terminology, reflecting a 2021 context. I've aimed for around 245 words.  I've included some potential citations (indicated by brackets) as would be typical in a published abstract.

**Abstract**

The development of porous materials exhibiting enhanced gas adsorption capabilities and responsive optical properties remains a critical area of research for applications in gas storage, separation, and sensing. This study reports the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel fluorescent metal-organic framework (MOF), designated DUT-140, incorporating a fluorescent core within its framework architecture. The material was synthesized via a solvothermal method and subsequently characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption analysis, and spectroscopic techniques including fluorescence emission spectroscopy. Computational methods, specifically density functional theory (DFT), were employed to investigate the framework’s structural properties and to model the phenomenon of pressure amplification within the pores.

Experimental physisorption isotherms revealed a moderate surface area and pore volume, demonstrating promising adsorption behavior for various gases [e.g., CO₂, CH₄]. Critically, we observed a significant enhancement of fluorescence intensity upon gas adsorption, indicative of a strong interaction between the guest molecules and the fluorescent moieties within the MOF structure.  DFT calculations confirmed the presence of pressure amplification effects, wherein the applied external pressure results in a disproportionately larger pressure increase within the confined pores, potentially leading to increased adsorption capacity [similar to findings in DUT-49, Ref. 1]. This combined pressure amplification and fluorescence response provides a unique platform for the development of gas sensors and selective adsorption systems. The observed synergistic relationship between structural properties, gas adsorption, and optical response highlights the potential of rationally designed fluorescent MOFs for advanced applications [Ref. 2]. Further research will focus on tailoring the fluorescent core and pore functionality to optimize performance for specific gas separations and sensing protocols [Ref. 3].

**Key Considerations & Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Specificity:** I've used general terms where more specific details weren't available in the provided summary. If you have information about the specific metal, linker, or fluorescent core, incorporating that would strengthen the abstract.
*   **Citations:** The bracketed citations are placeholders. Replace them with actual relevant literature.
*   **Quantifiable Data:** Adding specific data points (e.g., surface area value, pore size range, fluorescence enhancement factor) would make the abstract more impactful.
*   **Target Audience:** Consider the specific journal or conference you're targeting. Tailor the language and emphasis accordingly.
