Title: Elucidating the Role of Non-Markovian Dynamics in Vibrational Strong Coupling-Mediated Ground State Reactivity

Abstract:
The modification of ground state reactivity under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) conditions has garnered significant attention in the realm of polariton chemistry. Theoretical frameworks have been proposed to rationalize the observed changes in reaction rate constants. In this work, we investigate the influence of non-Markovian dynamics on VSC-mediated ground state reactivity. By incorporating the effects of cavity radiation modes, we demonstrate that the non-Markovian character of the system-bath interaction plays a crucial role in determining the reaction rate constant. Our results show that the cavity-modified reaction rate constant is sensitive to the spectral density of the bath and the coupling strength between the molecular vibration and the cavity mode. The findings of this study provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing VSC-mediated ground state reactivity, shedding light on the intricate interplay between cavity quantum electrodynamics and chemical reactivity in the VSC regime (2021).
