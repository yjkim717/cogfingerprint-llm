**Abstract: Compositional Heterogeneity in Ice Morphology During Grain-Scale Ice Formation within Protoplanetary Disks**

The prevailing theoretical framework for ice nucleation and subsequent morphology within protoplanetary disks often posits a homogeneous ice layer forming uniformly on refractory dust grains. However, recent observations utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) challenge this simplification, revealing intricate, composition-dependent ice morphologies. This study, conducted in 2021, leveraged TEM to directly investigate ice formation processes on simulated refractory grains, mirroring conditions prevalent within molecular clouds and nascent protoplanetary disks. 

Our analysis demonstrates that the ice morphology – characterized by distinct crystalline structures and complex textural variations – is strongly influenced by the elemental composition of the underlying grain. Specifically, variations in silicate and carbonaceous material content resulted in markedly different ice crystal arrangements, moving beyond the predicted uniform layering. These findings suggest a dynamic ice formation mechanism wherein compositional gradients drive localized freezing and crystal growth. 

Furthermore, the observed morphological complexity indicates a significant deviation from the assumed homogeneity, impacting ice opacity and potentially influencing radiative transfer within the disk.  These results necessitate a re-evaluation of current ice models and highlight the critical role of grain-scale compositional heterogeneity in determining the physical properties of ice prevalent in the early stages of planetary system formation.
