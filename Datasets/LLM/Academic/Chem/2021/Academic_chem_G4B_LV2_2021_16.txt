**Abstract**

The precise control of molecular reactivity remains a central challenge in chemical synthesis and photochemistry. Recent investigations have highlighted the potential of optical cavities to influence reaction pathways, particularly within regimes of vibrational strong coupling. This work introduces a theoretical framework elucidating the mechanism by which cavity radiation modes dynamically ‘cage’ molecular vibrations, thereby modulating reaction rates. Our model posits that resonant coupling between the molecular vibrational modes and the cavity’s quantized electromagnetic field generates a time-dependent potential energy surface. 

Specifically, the cavity radiation mode, exhibiting a photon frequency-dependent response, induces a non-linear shift in the molecular energy levels. This shift, termed the dynamical caging effect, effectively restricts the vibrational freedom of the molecule, prolonging its interaction with reactive intermediates.  The resulting alteration in reaction kinetics demonstrates a significant sensitivity to the cavity’s resonant frequency and geometry.  Computational simulations, employing a time-dependent Schrödinger equation, confirm the predicted enhancement of reaction rates under conditions of vibrational strong coupling. These findings suggest a novel strategy for leveraging optical cavities to achieve unprecedented levels of chemical control, representing a significant advancement in polariton chemistry and associated fields.
