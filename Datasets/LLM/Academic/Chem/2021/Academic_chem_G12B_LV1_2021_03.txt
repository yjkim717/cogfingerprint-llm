**Abstract: Pressure Amplification and Negative Adsorption Behavior in Fluorescent DUT-140 Metal-Organic Frameworks**

The rational design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored properties remains a central challenge in materials chemistry. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel fluorescent MOF, designated DUT-140, exhibiting both pressure amplification and, crucially, negative gas adsorption behavior under specific conditions. The framework is constructed utilizing [Specify Metal and Organic Linker – e.g., Zn(II) and a substituted dicarboxylate linker] and features a [Briefly describe pore structure and relevant features – e.g., highly porous, cage-like structure with accessible Lewis acid sites].  Detailed X-ray diffraction analysis confirms the crystalline structure and reveals a unique structural response to applied pressure, demonstrating a significant pressure amplification effect.

Furthermore, we investigated the gas adsorption properties of DUT-140 with a focus on CO₂ and N₂.  Surprisingly, at low pressures (p < [Specify Pressure Range]), DUT-140 exhibits negative adsorption isotherms, a phenomenon attributed to [Propose a plausible mechanism – e.g., framework breathing and kinetic trapping effects].  This behavior is correlated with changes in the fluorescence emission spectrum of the MOF, suggesting a link between structural rearrangement and guest-host interactions.  The observed fluorescence, characterized by [Specify excitation/emission wavelengths and quantum yield], is intrinsic to the organic linker and provides a sensitive probe of the framework’s response to external stimuli.  These findings highlight DUT-140 as a promising candidate for applications in gas separation, sensing, and pressure-responsive materials, opening avenues for exploring the interplay between structural dynamics, luminescence, and adsorption phenomena in MOF systems.
