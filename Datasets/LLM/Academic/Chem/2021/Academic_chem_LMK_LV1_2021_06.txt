Title: Unveiling the Role of Amorphous Solid Water in Formaldehyde Formation: A Mechanistic Investigation of Carbon Atom Reactivity in Interstellar Clouds

Abstract:
The reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW) is investigated as a potential pathway for formaldehyde (H2CO) formation in interstellar clouds. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical methods, we demonstrate that carbon atoms react with ASW to produce H2CO via a water-catalyzed mechanism. The reaction proceeds through the formation of a C-H2O complex, which is stabilized by the surrounding water molecules. Our results indicate that the H2O-catalyzed reaction pathway significantly enhances the reactivity of carbon atoms, leading to the efficient formation of H2CO. The findings of this study provide new insights into the chemistry of interstellar clouds and have implications for our understanding of the origins of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium. The proposed mechanism is consistent with recent observations of H2CO in star-forming regions, highlighting the importance of ASW in facilitating this key reaction.
