"Manipulating Ground-State Reactivity through Vibrational Strong Coupling: A Non-Markovian Perspective"

The vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regime has been shown to significantly alter ground-state reactivity, yet a comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon remains elusive. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that attributes the modification of reaction rates in VSC to non-Markovian dynamics and the dynamical caging effect. By incorporating cavity frequency-dependent effects, our model reveals that the reaction rate is influenced by the interplay between the cavity mode and the vibrational modes of the reactant. The non-Markovian dynamics induced by the cavity-reactant interaction lead to a caging effect, effectively hindering the reaction pathway. Our results, validated against recent experimental findings (2021), demonstrate that the VSC regime can be exploited to control ground-state reactivity, paving the way for novel applications in polariton chemistry. This study provides a fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms, shedding light on the potential of VSC to reshape chemical reactivity.
