**Abstract: Substrate-Dependent Ice Morphology in Simulated Protoplanetary Disk Environments: A Transmission Electron Microscopy Investigation**

The formation of ices within molecular clouds and subsequent incorporation into protoplanetary disks is a crucial process for the delivery of volatile elements and the potential emergence of water-rich planetary bodies. While laboratory simulations of these environments are increasingly sophisticated, the detailed microstructural characteristics of ice formation remain incompletely understood. This study employs transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the morphology of ices deposited on various substrate materials mimicking grain surfaces prevalent in interstellar media, specifically focusing on H₂O, CO, and CO₂ ices. Experiments were conducted at cryogenic temperatures (8-20 K) under ultra-high vacuum conditions to replicate the low-temperature, low-density conditions of molecular cloud cores. Our observations demonstrate a strong dependence of ice crystal morphology on both the ice composition and the underlying substrate.  H₂O ice exhibited a range of morphologies, from amorphous to crystalline, with the degree of crystallinity significantly influenced by substrate surface energy and roughness.  CO ice predominantly formed as disordered amorphous films, while CO₂ ice displayed a propensity for layered crystalline structures. Furthermore, the presence of mixed ices revealed complex interfacial phenomena and heterogeneous nucleation events. These findings highlight the critical role of surface interactions in controlling ice structure at the microscale, impacting ice properties such as density, porosity, and reactivity.  Understanding these nuances is essential for accurately modeling the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks and the subsequent formation of planets.
