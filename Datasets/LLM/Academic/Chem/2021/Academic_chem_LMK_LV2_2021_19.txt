Title: Exploring Isoreticular Metal-Organic Frameworks with Enhanced Pressure Amplification and Fluorescent Functionality

Abstract:
A series of novel isoreticular metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating fluorescent ligands were synthesized and characterized in 2021, exhibiting intriguing adsorption behavior and optical properties. The judicious selection of ligands enabled the formation of MOFs displaying negative gas adsorption (NGA) behavior, a phenomenon where the material releases gas upon increasing pressure. The incorporation of fluorescent functionality allowed for the investigation of the relationship between structural dynamics and optical properties. The results demonstrate that the isoreticular expansion of the MOFs leads to enhanced pressure amplification, a critical factor influencing NGA behavior. Furthermore, the fluorescent properties of the MOFs were found to be sensitive to the adsorption of guest molecules, indicating potential applications in sensing and optoelectronics. This study provides insight into the design and synthesis of MOFs with tailored properties, shedding light on the intricate relationships between structure, adsorption behavior, and optical functionality.
