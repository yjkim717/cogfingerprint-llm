The burgeoning demand for sustainable energy technologies has intensified research into efficient electrocatalytic processes, with computational methods playing a pivotal role in catalyst design. This perspective examines recent advances in first-principles simulations, primarily employing density functional theory, to elucidate and predict the performance of heterogeneous electrocatalysts. We focus on three critical reactions central to renewable energy cycles: the hydrogen evolution reaction for clean hydrogen production, the oxygen reduction reaction for fuel cell applications, and the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction toward value-added chemicals. The discussion highlights how computational approaches have transitioned from post-rationalization of experimental observations to predictive tools for identifying active sites, determining reaction pathways, and calculating thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of accurate solvation models and the treatment of electrochemical potentials, which remain significant challenges in the field. By bridging electronic structure calculations with macroscopic catalytic properties, these methodologies provide fundamental insights that accelerate the discovery of next-generation electrocatalytic materials with enhanced activity, selectivity, and stability.
