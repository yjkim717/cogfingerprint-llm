**Abstract**

Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrational modes and cavity photons has emerged as a powerful paradigm for modulating chemical reactivity. While previous investigations often focused on simplified Markovian descriptions, the inherently non-Markovian nature of molecular dynamics within VSC regimes introduces complexities that significantly impact reaction outcomes. This work elucidates a previously underappreciated role of the cavity frequency in mediating molecular reactivity within VSC systems. Through theoretical modeling and analysis, we demonstrate that the precise tuning of the cavity frequency relative to the vibrational mode induces a ‘caging’ effect, wherein the molecular system exhibits reduced propensity for dissociation or reaction due to prolonged vibrational coherence. This phenomenon is directly linked to the non-Markovian dynamics arising from the strong coupling, which hinders the efficient relaxation pathways typically observed in uncoupled systems. Our findings highlight that the cavity frequency is not merely a parameter for achieving strong coupling, but rather a crucial lever for controlling reaction rates and product distributions. This perspective underscores the importance of incorporating non-Markovian dynamics and cavity frequency dependence in future studies of polariton chemistry, opening avenues for the rational design of light-matter interfaces to achieve unprecedented control over chemical transformations.
