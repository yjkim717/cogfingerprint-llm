Title: Cavity-Modulated Reaction Kinetics in the Vibrational Strong Coupling Regime: A Non-Markovian Perspective

Abstract:
The vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regime has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to alter ground-state chemical reactivity. In this work, we present a theoretical framework to elucidate the cavity-modulated reaction kinetics in the VSC regime. By incorporating non-Markovian dynamics, we demonstrate that the cavity frequency plays a crucial role in determining the reaction rate constant. Our analysis reveals that the cavity-induced modification of the reaction rate constant is a result of the interplay between the cavity frequency and the vibrational modes of the reactants. We derive an expression for the cavity-modified reaction rate constant, which is shown to be in qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the polariton chemistry in the VSC regime and offer insights into the design of novel cavity-mediated chemical reactions. (2021)
