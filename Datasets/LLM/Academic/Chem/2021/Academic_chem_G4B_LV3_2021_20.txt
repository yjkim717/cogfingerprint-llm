**Abstract**

Recent investigations into vibrational strong coupling within optical microcavities have revealed a novel mechanism for modulating molecular reaction kinetics. This study presents a theoretical model, grounded in non-Markovian rate theory, to elucidate the observed phenomenon, termed ‘dynamical caging’. Specifically, we demonstrate that the dynamic evolution of cavity radiation modes, exhibiting strong coupling with the target molecule’s vibrational transitions, effectively confines the reactant, thereby suppressing its intrinsic reaction rate.  Crucially, the observed effect is quantitatively dependent on the photon frequency, highlighting a resonant interaction between the cavity field and molecular dynamics.  These findings suggest a pathway for manipulating chemical processes through tailored optical microcavity design, with potential implications for enhanced selectivity and control in photochemical reactions. Further experimental validation is warranted to fully characterize this emergent chemical control strategy.
