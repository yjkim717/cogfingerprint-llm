**Abstract**

Recent theoretical investigations into coupled light-matter systems have illuminated the potential for manipulating chemical reactivity through non-equilibrium optical phenomena. This work proposes a novel mechanism whereby vibrational strong coupling within a dielectric microcavity significantly alters reaction rates, a phenomenon termed “dynamical caging.” We hypothesize that cavity radiation modes, exhibiting frequency-dependent modifications of the electromagnetic environment, induce a suppression of reaction rates proximate to their resonant frequencies. Utilizing rate theory and incorporating non-Markovian dynamics, we demonstrate that this effect arises from the transient formation of polariton-like states, effectively ‘caging’ reactant molecules within the cavity’s field.  Specifically, the enhanced interaction with the cavity field elevates the energy barrier for chemical transition states, thereby reducing the probability of reaction.  Further simulations suggest this mechanism is particularly pronounced for reactions involving vibrational modes closely aligned with the cavity’s operating frequencies.  These findings offer a framework for rationally designing optical environments to control chemical processes with unprecedented precision.
