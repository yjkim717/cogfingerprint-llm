In 2021, the emerging field of vibrational polariton chemistry has demonstrated that strong light-matter interactions within optical microcavities can fundamentally alter ground-state chemical reaction landscapes. This theoretical investigation establishes that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) induces significant modifications to reaction kinetics through non-Markovian dynamics, where the system's memory effects and feedback mechanisms play crucial roles. Our analysis reveals that cavity frequency-dependent phenomena emerge as pivotal factors, with specific resonant conditions between molecular vibrations and cavity photons leading to substantial reaction rate suppression. The underlying mechanism involves dynamical caging effects, wherein the hybrid light-matter states—polaritons—create transient potential energy barriers that impede reactive trajectories. Through quantum dynamical simulations of model systems, we quantify how the photonic environment restructures the reaction coordinate, demonstrating suppression factors exceeding 50% under optimal VSC conditions. These findings challenge conventional transition state theory and provide a new framework for controlling chemical reactivity without external reactants or catalysts. The work establishes optical microcavities as versatile platforms for manipulating molecular transformations through quantum electrodynamical principles, opening pathways for novel synthetic strategies and energy conversion technologies.
