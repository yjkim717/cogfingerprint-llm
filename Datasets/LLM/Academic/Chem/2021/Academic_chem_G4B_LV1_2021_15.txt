**Novel Fluorescent Metal–Organic Frameworks Exhibiting Negative Gas Adsorption via Pressure Amplification**

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials for gas storage and sensing. This work reports the synthesis and characterization of a novel MOF, DUT-140(M), incorporating a specifically designed fluorescent ligand. Utilizing X-ray diffraction, we demonstrate a highly porous structure with enhanced flexibility, a crucial factor contributing to observed negative gas adsorption behavior. Spectroscopic analysis reveals significant alterations in the ligand’s fluorescence upon guest molecule interaction, suggesting a potential mechanism for pressure amplification within the MOF framework. Computational modeling supports the hypothesis that guest molecule inclusion induces conformational changes leading to a localized increase in internal pressure.  The resultant negative adsorption, evidenced by isotherm measurements, represents a significant departure from conventional MOF behavior.  These findings highlight the potential of rationally designed fluorescent MOFs to manipulate gas interactions and open new avenues for advanced sensing and separation technologies. Further research will focus on optimizing the ligand structure for tailored gas selectivity.
