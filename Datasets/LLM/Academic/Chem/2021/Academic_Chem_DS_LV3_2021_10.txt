In this study, we elucidate a novel, water-catalyzed mechanism for the formation of formaldehyde (Hâ‚‚CO) through the reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW) at cryogenic temperatures, directly addressing longstanding discrepancies in astrochemical models. Experimental and computational analyses reveal that ASW serves not merely as a passive matrix but as an active participant, facilitating proton transfer processes that significantly lower the activation barriers for formaldehyde synthesis. This catalytic role of water ice underscores its importance in prebiotic chemistry, providing an efficient pathway for the production of complex organic molecules in interstellar and cometary environments. Our findings reconcile conflicting literature reports by demonstrating that the presence and structure of ASW are critical parameters, thereby refining our understanding of molecular evolution in space and offering new insights into the chemical inventory of primordial planetary systems.
