Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel series of fluorescent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) isoreticular to the prototypical flexible framework DUT-49. By incorporating a custom-designed, luminescent organic ligand, we engineered materials that exhibit a pronounced fluorescence signal, enabling direct optical monitoring of framework transformations. Our investigation focused on the interplay between structural flexibility, guest-induced phase transitions, and photophysical properties. High-pressure methane and n-butane adsorption studies revealed that these isoreticular frameworks maintain the phenomenon of negative gas adsorption (NGA), a counterintuitive pressure amplification event driven by a metastable-to-stable phase transition. Crucially, we established a direct correlation between the NGA transition and a quantifiable shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum, providing an unprecedented, non-invasive optical probe for this unique phenomenon. This work, conducted in 2021, demonstrates that the integration of fluorescent linkers into flexible MOFs offers a powerful strategy for the real-time, in-situ detection of adsorbate-induced structural rearrangements, opening new pathways for the development of advanced chemical sensors and intelligent adsorbent materials.
