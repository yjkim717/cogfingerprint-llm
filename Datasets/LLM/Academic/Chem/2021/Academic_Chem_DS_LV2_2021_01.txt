Of particular relevance to astrochemical processes is the morphology of water ice, a dominant component of interstellar and circumstellar grains. Prevailing models often assume the formation of homogeneous, amorphous ice layers under low-temperature, high-vacuum conditions analogous to space. This study employs high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to systematically investigate the nucleation and growth of water ice on a variety of astrophysically relevant silicate and carbonaceous substrates. Contrary to established assumptions, our results demonstrate a profound dependence of ice morphology on both the chemical composition of the underlying grain and the local deposition conditions. We observe a direct transition to crystalline ice phases on specific catalytic substrates, even at temperatures as low as 30 K, while other surfaces promote the formation of distinct amorphous structures with varying porosity and density. These substrate-induced morphological variations directly influence the iceâ€™s surface area, porosity, and potential reactivity. Our findings challenge the simplistic view of interstellar ices as uniform amorphous layers, suggesting instead that the chemical and physical history of the grain surface is a critical determinant of ice structure. This necessitates a revision of current astrochemical models to incorporate substrate-specific ice morphologies for accurate predictions of molecular synthesis and desorption behaviors in dense molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.
