**Abstract**

Amorphous solid water (ASW) presents a unique environment exhibiting both high hydrogen bonding density and dynamic structural characteristics, prompting investigation into its catalytic potential. This study reports the observation of formaldehyde formation from carbon atoms catalyzed by ASW, utilizing a concerted proton transfer mechanism. Kinetic isotope effect measurements reveal a significant enhancement in reaction rate when employing ¹⁸O-labeled carbon sources, strongly suggesting a direct involvement of the ASW lattice in the catalytic process.  The observed formaldehyde production is hypothesized to arise from a series of localized proton transfer events within the ASW structure, stabilized by extensive hydrogen bonding networks.  Further mechanistic exploration is warranted to fully elucidate the role of specific ASW structural motifs and the energetic landscape governing this novel carbon atom reactivity.  These findings contribute to a growing understanding of unconventional catalytic systems and the potential of hydrogen-bonded materials in chemical transformations.
