Title: Exploring Luminescent Isoreticular Metal-Organic Frameworks Exhibiting Negative Gas Adsorption and Pressure Amplification Phenomena

Abstract:
In 2021, the pursuit of novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored properties continues to be a vibrant area of research. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of isoreticular MOFs incorporating fluorescent cores, designed to exhibit both intriguing adsorption behavior and specific light absorption properties. The newly synthesized MOFs demonstrate the rare phenomenon of negative gas adsorption (NGA), alongside pressure amplification characteristics, underscoring their potential in gas storage and separation applications. Furthermore, the integration of fluorescent functionality within the MOF structures enables the exploration of their luminescent properties, paving the way for their utilization in sensing and optical devices. The structural and photophysical properties of these MOFs were thoroughly investigated, shedding light on the intricate relationships between their composition, structure, and functionality.
