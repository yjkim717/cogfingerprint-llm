**Abstract**

The mechanistic pathways governing formaldehyde (H₂CO) formation remain incompletely understood, particularly under conditions mimicking environmental or geological processes. This research investigates a previously uncharacterized route involving the interaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW). Utilizing a novel experimental approach, we observed that ASW, characterized by a robust hydrogen bonding network, catalyzes the conversion of elemental carbon into H₂CO. Spectroscopic analysis, including infrared and Raman spectroscopy, revealed distinct vibrational modes indicative of carbon bond scission and subsequent hydrogen transfer.  Crucially, the reaction proceeds via a concerted proton transfer mechanism facilitated by the ASW’s inherent structural arrangement. These findings suggest that ASW represents a viable, and potentially ubiquitous, catalytic matrix for low-temperature formaldehyde genesis, warranting further investigation into its broader implications for carbon cycling and prebiotic chemistry.
