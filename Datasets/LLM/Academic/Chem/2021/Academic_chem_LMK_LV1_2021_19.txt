Title: Exploring the Interplay between Fluorescent Functionality and Adsorption Behavior in Isoreticular Metal-Organic Frameworks

Abstract:
The design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored properties have garnered significant attention in recent years. In this study, we report the development of a novel series of isoreticular MOFs incorporating fluorescent functionality, which exhibit intriguing porosity, flexibility, and adsorption behavior. The synthesized MOFs demonstrate a unique pressure amplification phenomenon, wherein the incorporation of fluorophores within the framework enhances their responsiveness to external stimuli. Notably, certain members of this MOF family display negative gas adsorption (NGA) behavior, a rare phenomenon characterized by the spontaneous release of adsorbed gas upon increasing pressure. Our findings highlight the potential of these fluorescent MOFs for applications in sensing and gas storage. The structural and adsorption properties of these materials are thoroughly characterized, providing insights into the interplay between their composition, structure, and functionality.
