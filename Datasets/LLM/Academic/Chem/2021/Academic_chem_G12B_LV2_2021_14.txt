**Abstract**

The abiotic synthesis of formaldehyde (H₂CO) is a crucial step in prebiotic chemistry, potentially providing a key building block for the emergence of life. This work investigates a novel pathway for H₂CO formation involving the reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW). Combining computational modeling with experimental validation, we demonstrate that ASW, characterized by its extensive hydrogen-bonding network, efficiently catalyzes the reaction between carbon and water, leading to detectable H₂CO production. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal a plausible reaction mechanism wherein the hydrogen-bond network facilitates proton transfer events essential for stabilizing reaction intermediates and lowering activation barriers. Experimental results, utilizing controlled deposition of carbon atoms onto ASW matrices at cryogenic temperatures, corroborate the computational findings, providing spectroscopic evidence for the formation of H₂CO. These results suggest that ASW environments, readily available on icy bodies in the early solar system, may have significantly contributed to the abiotic production of formaldehyde and, consequently, to the chemical complexity of protoplanetary environments.
