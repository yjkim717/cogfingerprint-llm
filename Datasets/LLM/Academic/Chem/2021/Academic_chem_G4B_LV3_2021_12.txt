**Abstract**

Recent investigations into vibrational strong coupling between molecular and photonic modes within optical microcavities have revealed a compelling phenomenon: the modulation of molecular reaction dynamics. This study presents a theoretical model employing non-Markovian rate equations to elucidate this effect, specifically attributing it to a novel ‘dynamical caging’ mechanism. Our framework demonstrates that the cavity’s radiative field, exhibiting a pronounced dependence on its frequency, actively influences the timescale of molecular vibrational relaxation.  We posit that the strong coupling generates a temporally fluctuating, effective potential, trapping the molecule within a resonant cavity mode. This leads to a non-markovian response, characterized by memory effects in the reaction rate.  Simulations, validated against established theoretical predictions, illustrate the sensitivity of this dynamical caging to cavity frequency and demonstrate its potential for precise manipulation of chemical kinetics. Further research will focus on experimentally verifying these findings and exploring the broader implications for photochemistry and molecular sensing.
