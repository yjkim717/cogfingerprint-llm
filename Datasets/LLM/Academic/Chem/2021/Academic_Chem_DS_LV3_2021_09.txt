In this 2021 study, we employ cryogenic transmission electron microscopy to systematically investigate the microstructural evolution of amorphous ices deposited on refractory grain analogs under astrophysically relevant conditions. Our experimental approach reveals that ice morphology is fundamentally governed by a complex interplay between compositional heterogeneity, substrate chemistry, and thermal history, rather than forming homogeneous layers as previously assumed. Through controlled crystallization experiments spanning 10-150 K, we demonstrate that water-ice domains undergo distinct phase transitions while co-deposited volatile organics maintain amorphous structures, creating complex microporous networks. These morphological characteristics directly influence surface diffusion barriers and pore connectivity, thereby modulating the efficiency of solid-state reactions and molecular segregation processes. The presence of fractal ice structures on carbonaceous substrates versus layered morphologies on silicates further indicates substrate-dependent nucleation mechanisms. These findings necessitate revision of current astrochemical models describing molecular cloud evolution and protoplanetary disk chemistry. Specifically, the observed microstructural diversity alters predicted reaction yields in ice mantles, modifies ultraviolet photon penetration depths, and affects grain coagulation dynamics. Consequently, our results establish amorphous ice microstructure as a critical parameter in understanding chemical complexity in interstellar environments and early planetary system formation.
