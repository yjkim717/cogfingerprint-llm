**Abstract**

Recent advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) have enabled the exploration of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in chemical systems, opening new avenues for controlling reaction dynamics. This work investigates the theoretical implications of VSC on ground-state chemical reactivity, revealing a counterintuitive suppression of reaction rates under specific conditions. Our analysis demonstrates that the non-Markovian nature of the cavity radiation mode, a hallmark of VSC, induces a dynamic caging effect on the reacting molecules. This phenomenon arises from the coherent exchange of energy between vibrational modes and photons, effectively hindering the trajectory towards product formation. The observed rate reduction is quantitatively linked to the cavity photon frequency, highlighting a tunable control mechanism for chemical reactions. These findings offer a fundamental understanding of the interplay between quantum optics and chemical kinetics, with implications for developing novel strategies in photocatalysis and molecular engineering.
