**Abstract**

The incorporation of a fluorescent organic ligand into the pressure-amplifying metal-organic framework DUT-140 enables unprecedented, real-time monitoring of its unique negative gas adsorption (NGA) phenomenon. NGA, characterized by a spontaneous release of adsorbate upon reaching a critical gas pressure, induces a pronounced structural transition within the framework. This work demonstrates that the embedded fluorophore acts as an intrinsic molecular-level probe, with its emission profile—including intensity, wavelength, and lifetime—being exquisitely sensitive to the local chemical environment and framework mechanics. During the NGA event in 2021, we observed a stark, quantifiable shift in fluorescence, directly correlating with the sudden lattice contraction and the concomitant change in the material's electronic structure. This in-situ spectroscopic interrogation provides a dynamic window into the metastable states preceding the NGA transition, offering critical insights into the kinetics and thermodynamics of this counterintuitive process. The synergy between fluorescence reporting and pressure amplification in DUT-140 establishes a novel paradigm for designing intelligent, self-reporting porous materials, with significant implications for advanced gas storage, sensing, and energy conversion systems.
