In vibrational polariton chemistry, the manipulation of chemical reactivity through strong light-matter interactions within optical microcavities represents a frontier in controlling molecular transformations. This study, conducted in 2021, develops a comprehensive theoretical framework demonstrating that cavity frequency serves as a critical parameter governing reaction rate suppression in vibropolaritonic systems. We establish that vibrational strong coupling induces non-Markovian dynamics, where the system's evolution depends on its entire history rather than instantaneous conditions alone. Through quantum dynamical simulations and analytical modeling, we reveal how resonant cavity modes generate a dynamical caging effectâ€”effectively trapping reactants in metastable configurations through periodic energy exchange between molecular vibrations and cavity photons. Our findings indicate maximum suppression occurs when the cavity frequency aligns with specific molecular vibrational transitions, creating destructive interference in the reaction coordinate. This frequency-selective control mechanism operates through the formation of hybrid light-matter states (polaritons) that alter the potential energy landscape and decoherence pathways. The theoretical predictions resolve longstanding experimental observations of modified reaction kinetics under vibrational strong coupling while providing design principles for cavity-assisted chemical manipulation. This work establishes non-Markovian dynamics as fundamental to polariton chemistry and opens avenues for precise spectroscopic control of molecular processes through tailored photonic environments.
