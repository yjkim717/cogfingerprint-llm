**Abstract**

The formation mechanism of formaldehyde (H₂CO) in interstellar environments remains a critical challenge in astrochemistry. Previous models have struggled to reconcile theoretical predictions with observed kinetic isotope effects and reaction rates. This work, conducted in 2021, presents a novel, experimentally validated pathway for H₂CO synthesis involving the catalytic action of amorphous solid water (ASW) on carbon atoms. Utilizing computational chemistry techniques, we demonstrate an efficient reaction sequence wherein ASW facilitates the incorporation of carbon into H₂CO. Experimental validation using low-temperature matrix isolation spectroscopy confirms the predicted reaction products and supports the proposed mechanism. Our findings resolve inconsistencies within existing literature regarding H₂CO formation kinetics and provide a robust explanation for observed deuterium fractionation. This water-catalyzed route offers a compelling mechanism for formaldehyde production in cold, dense interstellar clouds, impacting our understanding of complex organic molecule origins.
