**Abstract**

Recent advances in polariton chemistry have revealed that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) can significantly modify chemical reactivity. This theoretical investigation elucidates the mechanistic origin of the suppression of reaction rates observed under VSC conditions. We demonstrate that the cavity frequency must be resonant with a specific molecular vibrational mode to initiate this phenomenon. The suppression is not adequately described by a simple transition state barrier modification. Instead, our analysis establishes that the effect arises from a synergistic interplay of two key factors. First, the cavity induces non-Markovian dynamics, where the system's evolution depends on its history, impeding the reactive flow through the formation of long-lived polariton states. Second, we identify a frequency-dependent caging effect, wherein the confined electromagnetic field of the optical cavity effectively restrains the nuclear motion along the reaction coordinate. This caging is most pronounced when the cavity is tuned to the vibrational frequency, leading to a dynamical trapping of the reactant population. Our findings provide a coherent theoretical framework that reconciles the resonant nature of VSC with the observed kinetic isotope effects, moving beyond a Markovian, Rabi-splitting-centric interpretation. This work underscores the critical role of cavity-mediated memory effects in dictating chemical pathways under strong light-matter coupling.
