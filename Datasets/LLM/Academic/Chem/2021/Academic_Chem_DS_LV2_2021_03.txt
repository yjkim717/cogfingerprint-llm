Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of novel fluorescent metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) isoreticular to the prototypical soft porous crystal DUT-49. By incorporating tailored luminescent organic ligands, we engineered frameworks that exhibit pronounced negative gas adsorption (NGA) phenomena alongside tunable photophysical properties. Our investigation reveals that the introduction of fluorescent moieties does not compromise the structural flexibility required for NGA, a counterintuitive pressure amplification effect driven by metastable states. High-pressure gas adsorption studies, coupled with *in situ* spectroscopic analysis, demonstrate a synergistic relationship between the adsorption-induced structural transitions and the resultant modulation of fluorescence emission. This correlation provides a direct, optical probe for monitoring the otherwise elusive NGA transition dynamics in real-time. The dual functionality of these materials—combining extreme mechanical responses with intrinsic luminescence—establishes a new paradigm for smart adsorbents. These findings, from 2021, open avenues for developing advanced sensor technologies and responsive systems where gas uptake is optically reportable, bridging a critical gap between macroscopic adsorption properties and molecular-scale framework mechanics.
