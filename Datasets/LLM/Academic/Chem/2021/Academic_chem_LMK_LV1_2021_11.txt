Title: Exploring Structural Flexibility and Gas Adsorption in Isoreticular Metal-Organic Frameworks with Fluorescent Functionality

Abstract:
In 2021, research in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) continues to uncover novel materials with tailored properties. We report the synthesis and characterization of a new series of isoreticular MOFs incorporating fluorescent ligands, designed to probe the interplay between structural flexibility and gas adsorption behavior. The resulting materials exhibit pronounced pressure amplification and negative gas adsorption (NGA) phenomena, indicative of their flexible frameworks. Through a combination of in situ X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic analysis, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying these phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that the judicious selection of fluorescent ligands enables the monitoring of structural transformations in real-time, providing unprecedented insights into the dynamics of guest-host interactions. This study highlights the potential of isoreticular MOFs with fluorescent functionality for advancing our understanding of gas storage and separation processes, and paves the way for the development of novel, responsive materials.
