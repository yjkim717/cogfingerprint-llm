**Abstract**

Recent advancements in nonlinear optics have illuminated the potential for manipulating chemical processes via resonant optical fields. This work introduces a theoretical framework for understanding how integrated optical cavities, exhibiting strong vibrational coupling, can induce a ‘dynamical caging’ effect on molecular reactivity. Utilizing a non-Markovian dynamics model, we demonstrate that the cavity’s radiation mode, specifically tuned to a photon frequency-dependent manner, significantly alters the timescale of chemical reactions.  The theory predicts a suppression of reaction rates at frequencies corresponding to the cavity’s resonant characteristics, effectively ‘trapping’ reactants in a state of prolonged interaction.  This phenomenon, termed ‘polariton chemistry,’ arises from the coupling between photons and vibrational modes within the cavity.  Our simulations reveal that the magnitude of this effect is directly proportional to the strength of the vibrational coupling and the cavity’s quality factor.  These findings, presented in 2021, suggest a novel pathway for controlling chemical selectivity through optical engineering and open avenues for advanced spectroscopic techniques.
