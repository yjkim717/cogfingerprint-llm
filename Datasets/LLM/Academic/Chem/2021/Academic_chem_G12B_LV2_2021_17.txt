**Abstract**

The chemical complexity of interstellar ices plays a crucial role in the formation of planetary systems, influencing both the composition of protoplanetary disks and the subsequent chemical evolution of nascent planets. While laboratory simulations have begun to elucidate the behavior of ices under astrophysical conditions, the detailed morphological characteristics of ice mantles on refractory grains remain poorly understood. This study utilizes transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the morphology of ices deposited onto various refractory substrates, simulating conditions prevalent in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disk environments. Our findings demonstrate a strong dependence of ice morphology on both the ice composition – specifically, mixtures of water, carbon monoxide, and methane – and the nature of the underlying grain material. Observed morphologies range from amorphous layers and crystalline domains to complex layered structures, with distinct textures arising from differing deposition rates and thermal histories. Furthermore, we observed a marked influence of substrate material (e.g., silicates versus carbonaceous grains) on ice nucleation and crystal growth. These results highlight the critical importance of ice morphology in determining grain collisional dynamics, surface reactivity, and volatile transport within these environments. Understanding these ice-grain interactions is essential for accurately modeling the chemical evolution of interstellar media and predicting the chemical building blocks available for planet formation. Future work will focus on correlating observed morphologies with simulated ice compositions and thermal profiles to refine our understanding of astrophysical ice behavior.
