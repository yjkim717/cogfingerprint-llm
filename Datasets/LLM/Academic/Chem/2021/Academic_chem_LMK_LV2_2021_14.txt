Title: Astrochemically Relevant Formation of Formaldehyde through Water-Catalyzed Proton Transfer in the Reaction of Carbon Atoms with Amorphous Solid Water

Abstract:
The reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW) is investigated as a potential pathway for the formation of formaldehyde, a key interstellar molecule. Using advanced surface science techniques, we demonstrate that the reaction proceeds via a water-catalyzed proton transfer mechanism, facilitating the formation of formaldehyde. Our results show that the reactivity of carbon atoms with ASW is significantly enhanced by the presence of water molecules, which act as a catalyst for the proton transfer step. The astrochemical implications of this finding are significant, as it provides a novel route for the formation of formaldehyde in interstellar environments. The proposed mechanism is consistent with existing observations and provides a new perspective on the chemistry of carbon atoms in ices. (2021)
