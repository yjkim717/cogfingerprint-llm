**Abstract**

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials with applications spanning gas storage, catalysis, and sensing. This research details the synthesis and characterization of a novel fluorescent MOF, designated DUT-140(M), exhibiting a unique combination of structural flexibility and negative gas adsorption capabilities. Utilizing a specifically designed fluorescent ligand, the resultant framework demonstrates enhanced responsiveness to external stimuli, offering a promising avenue for advanced materials design. Spectroscopic investigations, including X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy, revealed a significant structural contraction upon guest molecule interaction, a key feature underpinning the observed negative gas adsorption. 

Computational modeling employing density functional theory (DFT) corroborated these experimental findings, providing insights into the underlying mechanisms driving the framework’s conformational changes. Notably, the framework’s fluorescence intensity was found to be sensitive to the presence of adsorbed gases, suggesting potential applications in pressure amplification techniques. The observed negative gas adsorption, coupled with the integrated fluorescence sensing, represents a significant advancement in MOF chemistry. Future research will focus on tailoring the ligand architecture to optimize these properties and explore potential applications in selective gas separation and optical sensing devices.
