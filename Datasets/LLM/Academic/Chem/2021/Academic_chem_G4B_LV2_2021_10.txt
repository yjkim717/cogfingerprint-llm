**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments remains a significant challenge in astrochemistry. This research investigates a novel pathway for formaldehyde (H<sub>2</sub>CO) genesis, predicated on the catalytic role of amorphous solid water (ASW) in facilitating carbon atom reactivity. Utilizing a combined computational and experimental approach, we demonstrate that carbon atoms, within the unique structural environment of ASW, undergo proton transfer reactions, ultimately leading to the observed formation of H<sub>2</sub>CO. Specifically, density functional theory calculations elucidated the crucial role of hydrogen bonding interactions within ASW in stabilizing key intermediates. Subsequent spectroscopic analysis confirmed the presence of H<sub>2</sub>CO under conditions mimicking astrophysical environments. These findings suggest that ASW may represent a significant, yet previously underappreciated, reservoir for the chemical processing of carbon, offering a viable mechanism for formaldehyde production and expanding our understanding of prebiotic chemistry in space.
