**Abstract**

Recent investigations into the mechanistic pathways of carbon dioxide (CO₂) formation have increasingly focused on unconventional reaction environments. This work details a novel route involving the interaction of a carbon source with amorphous solid water (ASW), ultimately leading to the generation of hydrogenocarbon (H₂CO). Utilizing a combined computational and experimental approach, we demonstrate that ASW, leveraging its intricate hydrogen bonding network, acts as a catalytic mediator for this reaction. Specifically, density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed a concerted mechanism wherein carbon undergoes proton transfer facilitated by ASW, culminating in H₂CO formation.  

Supporting experimental data, obtained through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, corroborate these computational findings. Furthermore, the investigation incorporates a kinetic isotope effect, providing quantitative validation of the proposed mechanistic steps. These results challenge conventional assumptions regarding CO₂ genesis and highlight the potential of ASW as a viable, albeit previously unexplored, catalytic system for low-temperature CO₂ production – a significant area of research in 2021 and beyond.
