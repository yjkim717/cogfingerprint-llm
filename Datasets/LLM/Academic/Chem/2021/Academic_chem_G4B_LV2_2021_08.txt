**Abstract**

The interplay between light and matter at strong coupling regimes presents a compelling avenue for manipulating molecular dynamics with unprecedented control. This work introduces a theoretical framework elucidating the influence of optical cavities on vibrational reactivity, specifically within systems exhibiting vibrational strong coupling. Our investigation posits that observed alterations in molecular behavior are fundamentally rooted in the dynamics of cavity radiation modes. We demonstrate that the resonant interaction between an excited molecule and the cavity’s electromagnetic field generates a ‘dynamical caging’ effect – effectively confining the molecule within a spatially and temporally fluctuating potential dictated by the cavity field. 

Crucially, this dynamic confinement significantly alters the molecule’s vibrational spectrum, leading to a photon frequency-dependent modulation of reactivity.  The theory incorporates the concept of polariton chemistry, recognizing the formation of hybrid light-matter states that mediate the interaction.  Numerical simulations, employing a coupled oscillator model, reveal a distinct shift in vibrational energy levels as a function of the cavity’s resonant frequency. These findings suggest that strategically engineered optical cavities offer a novel approach to controlling photochemical processes, potentially enabling tailored reactivity profiles across a broad range of chemical transformations. Further research will explore the practical implementation of this theoretical framework in specific molecular systems.
