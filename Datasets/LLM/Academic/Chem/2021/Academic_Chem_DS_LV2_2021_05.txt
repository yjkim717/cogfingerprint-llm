Of particular relevance to astrochemical processes is the understanding of ice morphology on cosmic grain analogs, where prevailing models often assume homogeneous, crystalline layers. This study employs high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to systematically investigate the nucleation and growth of water ice, alongside amorphous solid water (ASW), on a variety of substrates under ultra-high vacuum conditions representative of the interstellar medium. We demonstrate unequivocally that the resulting ice morphology—specifically, the degree of crystallinity, porosity, and grain texture—is not an intrinsic property of the condensate but is critically governed by the chemical composition of the underlying substrate and the local deposition environment. Our data reveal that carbonaceous substrates predominantly foster the formation of persistent amorphous ices, while certain silicate analogs catalyze rapid crystallization even at low temperatures. These findings directly challenge the conventional assumption of uniform ice mantles in astrochemical models. The implications are profound, as ice morphology directly influences surface chemistry, including the efficiency of molecular hydrogen formation and the trapping of volatile species. Consequently, this work necessitates a revision of current astrochemical kinetics to incorporate substrate-dependent morphological descriptors for a more accurate prediction of molecular evolution in protoplanetary disks and dense clouds.
