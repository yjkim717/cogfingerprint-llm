Title: Unveiling the Astrochemical Significance of H2O-Catalyzed Formaldehyde Formation on Amorphous Solid Water

Abstract:
The reactivity of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW) has been investigated, revealing a novel pathway for formaldehyde (H2CO) formation via an H2O-catalyzed reaction. Our study demonstrates that the interaction between C atoms and ASW at cryogenic temperatures (âˆ¼10 K) facilitates the efficient production of H2CO. Utilizing a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, we elucidate the mechanistic details of this process, highlighting the crucial role of H2O in modulating the reaction kinetics. The results indicate that the H2O-catalyzed reaction pathway significantly enhances the reactivity of C atoms, thereby promoting the formation of H2CO. This finding has important implications for understanding the astrochemical origin of formaldehyde in interstellar environments, where ASW is ubiquitous. The proposed mechanism provides a plausible explanation for the observed abundance of H2CO in molecular clouds, shedding new light on the complex chemistry governing these regions. (2021)
