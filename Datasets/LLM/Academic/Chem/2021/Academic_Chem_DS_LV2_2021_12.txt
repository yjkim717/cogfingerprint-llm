**Abstract**

The emerging field of vibrational polariton chemistry has demonstrated that coupling molecular vibrations to confined electromagnetic modes of an optical cavity can profoundly alter chemical reactivity, notably leading to significant reaction rate suppression. While this phenomenon is experimentally established, a comprehensive theoretical framework explaining the underlying mechanism remains a subject of intense investigation. This work presents a theoretical model that attributes the suppression of chemical reaction rates under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) to the emergence of non-Markovian dynamics and a frequency-dependent caging effect. We posit that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—introduces a long-lived memory kernel into the reaction coordinate's evolution, deviating from traditional Markovian approximations. This non-Markovian character, combined with the structured density of optical states within the cavity, creates a transient energetic barrier that effectively cages reactant species. Crucially, our analysis demonstrates that this caging mechanism is resonantly enhanced, exhibiting a pronounced dependence on the cavity frequency relative to the targeted molecular vibration. This model not only provides a unified explanation for key experimental observations but also establishes non-Markovianity as a central principle for controlling chemical landscapes and reaction pathways through quantum optical environments.
