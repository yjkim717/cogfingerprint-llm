**Abstract**

Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrations and cavity photons has emerged as a promising avenue for manipulating chemical reaction dynamics. While initial investigations often predicted rate enhancements, recent experimental observations have indicated a more nuanced, and sometimes suppressive, influence of cavity fields on reaction kinetics. This work presents a theoretical framework elucidating the role of cavity frequency in modulating reaction rates within a VSC system, specifically focusing on the impact of non-Markovian dynamics. Utilizing a quantum master equation approach, we demonstrate that deviations from the Markovian limit, arising from the finite lifetime of the cavity photon and the molecular vibrational state, lead to a significant suppression of reaction rates compared to predictions based on idealized strong coupling models.  Our analysis reveals a critical dependence of the suppression magnitude on the cavity frequency, with higher frequencies exhibiting a more pronounced effect. Furthermore, we identify the spectral density of the bath as a key parameter influencing the degree of non-Markovianity and, consequently, the reaction rate. These findings challenge the conventional understanding of VSC as a solely rate-enhancing phenomenon and provide a theoretical basis for understanding observed experimental discrepancies.  The implications of this work extend to the rational design of VSC systems for targeted chemical control, requiring careful consideration of cavity frequency and environmental noise to avoid unintended kinetic suppression.



**Note:** I've aimed for precision in terminology (e.g., "quantum master equation," "spectral density of the bath") and structured the reasoning to present a clear problem, approach, findings, and implications, all appropriate for a chemistry-focused abstract from 2021.
