**Abstract**

The canonical model of ice mantle accretion in interstellar molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks posits a homogeneous, layer-by-layer deposition process onto refractory grain surfaces. However, this paradigm is challenged by the critical dependence of ice morphology on local physicochemical conditions. This study, contextualized within the 2021 findings of Tsuge, employs **transmission electron microscopy (TEM)** to systematically investigate the crystallization behavior of amorphous ices as a function of their chemical composition and the underlying substrate properties. We demonstrate that the structural evolution of water-dominated ices is not a universal process but is intrinsically mediated by the presence of volatile impurities (e.g., CO, CO₂, CH₃OH) and the surface topology and chemical nature of the **refractory grains**, such as silicates and carbonaceous materials. Our experimental results reveal that certain grain substrates and specific molecular mixtures significantly inhibit the crystallization kinetics of amorphous solid water, stabilizing non-crystalline structures at higher temperatures than previously theorized. This substrate-specific inhibition directly contests the assumption of uniform ice layering, implying a heterogeneous and compositionally stratified ice architecture within **molecular clouds**. Consequently, the resulting diversity in ice porosity, surface area, and chemical reactivity must be integrated into astrochemical models. These findings necessitate a revision of grain-surface reaction networks and have profound implications for the trapping and release of volatiles during the thermal processing of grains, a fundamental process in the early stages of planet formation.
