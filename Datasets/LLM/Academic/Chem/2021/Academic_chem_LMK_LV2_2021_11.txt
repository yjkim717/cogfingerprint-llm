Title: Isoreticular Metal-Organic Frameworks with Fluorescent Functionality Exhibiting Negative Gas Adsorption and Pressure Amplification

Abstract:
In 2021, the development of novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored properties remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new series of isoreticular MOFs incorporating fluorescent cores. The resulting materials exhibit intriguing adsorption behavior, including negative gas adsorption (NGA), a phenomenon where the framework releases gas upon increasing pressure. Furthermore, the MOFs display pressure amplification, a characteristic that enhances their potential for applications in gas storage and separation. The incorporation of fluorescent functionality enables the investigation of their light absorption properties, providing insights into the structure-property relationships. Our findings demonstrate the versatility of isoreticular MOFs in achieving specific properties and highlight their potential for advanced applications. The observed NGA and pressure amplification phenomena underscore the importance of continued research into the adsorption behavior of these materials.
