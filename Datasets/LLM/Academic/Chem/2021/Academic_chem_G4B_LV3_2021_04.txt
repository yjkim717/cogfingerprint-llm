**Abstract:**

Recent investigations into vibrational strong coupling within optical microcavities have revealed a novel mechanism for manipulating molecular reaction dynamics. This study introduces a theoretical framework predicated on non-Markovian rate theory to describe the phenomenon of ‘dynamical caging,’ whereby photon-mediated interactions alter the effective timescale of chemical processes. Specifically, we demonstrate that the cavity frequency exhibits a critical influence on the strength of this caging effect, leading to a frequency-dependent modulation of molecular reaction rates. Utilizing a detailed rate equation model, we analyze the interplay between cavity field enhancement and molecular vibrational modes, highlighting the emergence of non-markovian dynamics – a deviation from classical rate processes – under strong coupling conditions.  These findings suggest potential applications in controlling chemical selectivity and achieving unprecedented temporal precision in photochemical reactions, representing a significant advance in polariton chemistry and microcavity-enhanced spectroscopy.
