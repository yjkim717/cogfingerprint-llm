**Non-Markovian Chemical Reactivity Modulation via Vibrational Strong Coupling in Cavity Environments**

Chemical reaction kinetics are conventionally treated as Markovian processes, assuming instantaneous and uncorrelated transitions between states. However, recent theoretical investigations suggest that optical cavities can induce significant deviations from this assumption, fundamentally altering reaction dynamics. This work presents a novel framework for describing this phenomenon, leveraging the principles of vibrational strong coupling and polariton chemistry. We demonstrate that the resonant interaction between excited molecules and cavity radiation modes generates a ‘dynamical caging’ effect, wherein the reaction rate constant is suppressed at specific photon frequencies.  

Specifically, the cavity mediates a non-Markovian coupling, prolonging the excited state lifetime and effectively ‘trapping’ reactants within a frequency-selective potential.  Numerical simulations, utilizing a time-dependent perturbation theory approach, reveal a dependence of the suppression magnitude on the cavity’s quality factor and the molecule’s vibrational frequencies. These findings have significant implications for understanding photochemistry and surface catalysis, potentially offering routes to control reaction pathways through tailored optical environments.
