In this 2021 astrochemistry study, we investigate formaldehyde (H₂CO) formation through carbon atom reactions with amorphous solid water (ASW) interstellar ice analogues. Previous experimental and theoretical work presented conflicting energy barriers for this fundamental astrochemical process. Our combined experimental and computational approach reveals that ASW's disordered hydrogen-bonding network actively catalyzes proton transfer reactions at cryogenic temperatures. This water-mediated mechanism provides low-energy pathways (ΔG‡ < 5 kJ/mol) through concerted proton relays along hydrogen-bonded chains, effectively bypassing the higher barriers associated with gas-phase reactions. The catalytic effect persists even at 10 K, demonstrating ASW's role not merely as a passive substrate but as an active participant in molecular synthesis. These findings reconcile longstanding literature discrepancies by establishing that ASW's proton-transfer catalysis enables efficient H₂CO formation under astrophysically relevant conditions, with significant implications for complex organic molecule formation in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.
