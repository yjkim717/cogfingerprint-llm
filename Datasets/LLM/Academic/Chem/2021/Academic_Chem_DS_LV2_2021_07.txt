**Abstract**

The phenomenon of negative gas adsorption (NGA) in soft porous crystals represents a counterintuitive departure from classical adsorption behavior, offering potential for pressure amplification applications. While the prototypical material DUT-49 has demonstrated this metastability-driven effect, the integration of additional functionalities, such as luminescence, remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a series of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) isoreticular to DUT-49, engineered to incorporate fluorescent moieties within their architecture. These novel frameworks retain the critical structural flexibility necessary for undergoing reversible pore network transitions. Crucially, we demonstrate that these fluorescent analogues not only maintain the characteristic NGA behavior upon gas uptake but also exhibit a concomitant and pronounced change in their emission profile correlated with the adsorption-induced structural transformation. This direct coupling between a macroscopic mechanical response—pressure amplification—and an optical signal provides a powerful, non-invasive tool for monitoring internal framework dynamics in real-time. Our findings establish a new class of multifunctional porous materials where NGA and reporter functionality are synergistically combined, paving the way for advanced sensors and responsive material systems.
