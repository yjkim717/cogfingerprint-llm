**Abstract**

The formation of formaldehyde (CH₂O) in interstellar ices remains a critical, yet incompletely understood, pathway for the synthesis of complex organic molecules. This study investigates a novel mechanism for formaldehyde production via direct carbon atom (C) reactivity with amorphous solid water (ASW), a prevalent component of astrophysical ices. Employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and subsequent experimental validation, we demonstrate that water’s extensive hydrogen-bonding network effectively catalyzes this reaction, facilitating efficient formaldehyde formation at astrophysically relevant temperatures. Our computational analysis reveals a significant kinetic isotope effect (KIE) associated with the reaction, providing insight into the rate-limiting step involving hydrogen abstraction. The proposed h₂o-catalyzed pathway offers a plausible explanation for observed formaldehyde abundances in cold, dense molecular clouds, circumventing the need for high-energy photons or reactive radicals. These findings contribute to a refined understanding of the chemical processes occurring within interstellar ices and bolster models of prebiotic molecule formation in space.
