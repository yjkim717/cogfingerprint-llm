Title: Investigating the Crystallization Dynamics of H2O, CO2, and CO Ices on Refractory Grains via Transmission Electron Microscopy

Abstract:

The morphology of ices formed on refractory grains is crucial in understanding their role in protoplanetary disks. In this study, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the crystallization dynamics of amorphous H2O, CO2, and CO ices. Our results show that the presence of refractory grain surfaces influences the ice morphology, with distinct crystallization pathways observed for each ice composition. The amorphous-to-crystalline transition was found to occur at temperatures consistent with laboratory measurements, indicating a thermally driven process. Notably, the CO2 ice exhibited a unique crystallization behavior, characterized by the formation of compact, crystalline aggregates. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of ice evolution in protoplanetary disks and the potential for the formation of complex organic molecules. Our TEM observations provide a detailed, nanoscale insight into the crystallization dynamics of astrophysically relevant ices, shedding light on the intricate processes governing their morphology.
