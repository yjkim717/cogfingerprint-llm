**Abstract**

Recent advancements in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have increasingly focused on tailoring their properties for specialized applications. This study details the synthesis and characterization of a novel MOF series, designated DUT-140(M), incorporating a fluorescent ligand to probe structural dynamics and facilitate emergent functionalities. Specifically, DUT-140(M) exhibits compelling behavior regarding negative gas adsorption, a phenomenon previously observed with limited stability. Utilizing a combination of spectroscopic techniques – including fluorescence spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction – alongside density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate a correlation between ligand environment and enhanced pressure amplification upon gas adsorption. These findings suggest a pathway toward designing MOFs with tunable responsiveness and potential applications in sensing and controlled release systems. The observed negative adsorption warrants further investigation into its underlying mechanisms and broader applicability within the MOF field.
