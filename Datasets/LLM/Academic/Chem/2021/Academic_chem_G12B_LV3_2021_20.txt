**Abstract**

The emergence of polariton chemistry as a distinct field has highlighted the potential for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) to influence chemical reaction dynamics. This work investigates the theoretical underpinnings of experimentally observed reactivity modifications within vibrational strong coupling systems. Departing from traditional Markovian rate theory assumptions, we demonstrate that the finite lifetime of the cavity radiation mode introduces inherently non-Markovian dynamics, significantly impacting ground-state chemical processes. Specifically, we propose a dynamical caging effect, whereby resonant interactions between molecular vibrations and the cavity field lead to a frequency-dependent suppression of reaction rates. These findings suggest that the cavity modeâ€™s spectral density plays a crucial role in dictating chemical reactivity, offering a pathway to control reaction pathways through tailored photonic environments. This perspective provides a framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of molecular systems under strong coupling conditions and opens new avenues for rational design of chemically responsive photonic devices.
