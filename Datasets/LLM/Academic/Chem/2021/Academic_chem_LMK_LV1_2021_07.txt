Title: Exploring Luminescent Isoreticular Metal-Organic Frameworks for Unconventional Gas Adsorption Properties

Abstract:

In 2021, the development of novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored properties continues to advance the field of gas storage and separation. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a new series of isoreticular MOFs (IR-MOFs) incorporating fluorescent ligands, which exhibit intriguing negative gas adsorption (NGA) behavior. The judicious selection of luminescent linkers enables the resulting IR-MOFs to display amplified pressure responses upon gas adsorption, thereby demonstrating a unique pressure amplification effect. Comprehensive structural analysis and in situ luminescence spectroscopy reveal a correlation between the MOFs' fluorescent functionality and their NGA properties. The integration of light absorption and gas sorption characteristics in these IR-MOFs offers a promising avenue for the design of stimuli-responsive materials. Our findings underscore the potential of luminescent MOFs for applications in sensing and gas-related technologies, highlighting the importance of precise structural control in MOF design.
