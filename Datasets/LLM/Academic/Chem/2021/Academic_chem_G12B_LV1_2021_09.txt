**Abstract**

The prevalence of icy grain mantles in interstellar molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks profoundly influences the chemical evolution of star-forming regions and the potential for planet formation. While laboratory simulations have begun to address the behavior of ices under astrophysical conditions, a detailed understanding of ice morphology and crystallization pathways remains elusive. This work presents a novel investigation into the crystallization kinetics of astrophysically relevant ices, specifically water, methane, and carbon monoxide, deposited as thin films onto various substrate materials mimicking interstellar grain surfaces. Utilizing high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we directly observed the nucleation and growth of ice crystals across a range of deposition temperatures (10-100 K) and substrate compositions (amorphous carbon, olivine, and silicate). Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of ice morphology on both the ice composition and the underlying substrate. Water ice exhibits a range of crystalline phases, including amorphous, cubic, and hexagonal forms, with the transition pathways significantly influenced by the substrate’s surface energy and lattice structure. Methane and carbon monoxide, conversely, tend to form layered structures, with the layer thickness and orientation sensitive to substrate interactions. These observations provide critical insights into the heterogeneous nucleation processes governing ice crystallization in space and offer a pathway for more accurate modeling of ice spectral properties. Furthermore, the observed substrate-dependent morphology suggests that the physical properties of dust grains—beyond simple composition—play a crucial role in determining the chemical evolution and ultimately, the habitability potential of protoplanetary systems.
