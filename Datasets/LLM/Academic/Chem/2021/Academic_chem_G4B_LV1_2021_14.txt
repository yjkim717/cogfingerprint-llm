**Abstract**

The formation of hydrogenocarbon (H₂CO) represents a significant, yet incompletely understood, pathway in aqueous environments. This research presents novel mechanistic insights into H₂CO genesis, demonstrating a catalytic role for amorphous solid water (ASW) in facilitating carbon atom reactivity. Utilizing spectroscopic and computational analyses conducted in 2021, we observed that ASW’s intricate hydrogen bonding network promotes the initial interaction between carbon atoms and water molecules. Specifically, proton transfer events within the ASW matrix appear to destabilize carbon-oxygen bonds, subsequently leading to the formation of H₂CO.  The observed kinetics suggest that this process circumvents traditional thermal decomposition pathways, potentially operating under ambient conditions.  Further investigation into the structural dynamics of ASW and the precise nature of these catalytic interactions is warranted to fully elucidate this newly identified carbon fixation mechanism and its implications for geochemical cycles and astrobiological contexts.
