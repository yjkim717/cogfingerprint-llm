**Abstract**

Vibrational strong coupling (VSC) between molecular vibrational modes and cavity photons has emerged as a paradigm for manipulating chemical reactivity. While previous studies have demonstrated enhanced reaction rates or altered product distributions under VSC conditions, a comprehensive theoretical framework elucidating the underlying mechanisms remains an area of active investigation. This work presents a theoretical analysis demonstrating a direct relationship between cavity frequency and molecular reaction rates within the context of VSC. We employ a non-Markovian quantum master equation approach to model the dynamics of a molecular system undergoing VSC, explicitly accounting for the interplay between vibrational coherence and reaction pathways. Our simulations reveal that the cavity frequency dictates the timescale of vibrational energy redistribution within the coupled system. Specifically, we observe a dynamical caging effect wherein the reaction rate is inversely proportional to the cavity frequency; higher frequencies lead to prolonged vibrational coherence and suppressed reaction rates. This phenomenon arises from the extended lifetime of vibrational wavepackets confined by the cavity field. These findings provide a fundamental understanding of how cavity frequency serves as a crucial parameter controlling molecular reactivity in polariton chemistry, opening avenues for the rational design of light-matter interfaces for chemical synthesis and control.
