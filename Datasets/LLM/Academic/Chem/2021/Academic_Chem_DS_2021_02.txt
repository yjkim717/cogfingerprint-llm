This study reports the development of a catalytic system utilizing palladium(0) nanoparticles stabilized within amphiphilic block copolymer nanomicelles for mediating cross-coupling reactions in aqueous environments. A significant challenge in aqueous-phase catalysis involves the inherent instability of reactive electrophiles, particularly acid chlorides, which readily undergo hydrolysis. Our methodology addresses this limitation by leveraging the unique microenvironment provided by the nanomicelles, which effectively compartmentalizes and protects the water-sensitive substrates from the bulk aqueous phase. The catalytic performance was evaluated in Suzuki-Miyaura couplings between aryl acid chlorides and arylboronic acids, employing the commercially available surfactant PS-750-M to form the nanoreactors. This system demonstrated exceptional functional group tolerance and achieved high yields under mild conditions, circumventing the need for inert atmosphere or anhydrous solvents. The findings highlight the potential of nanomicellar encapsulation as a general strategy for expanding the scope of transition-metal catalysis to include hydrolysis-prone reagents in sustainable aqueous media.
