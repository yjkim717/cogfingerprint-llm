Title: Non-Markovian Dynamics and Cavity Modification of Ground State Reactivity in the Vibrational Strong Coupling Regime

Abstract:
The vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regime has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to modify ground state chemical reactivity. In this work, we present a theoretical explanation for the cavity-induced modification of reaction rate constants within the VSC regime. Employing non-Markovian rate theory, we investigate the influence of cavity radiation modes on the dynamics of chemical reactions. Our analysis reveals that the non-Markovian dynamics of the cavity-radiation mode coupling play a crucial role in determining the reaction rate constant. We demonstrate that the cavity modification of ground state reactivity can be attributed to the non-Markovian effects induced by the strong coupling between the cavity radiation mode and the vibrational modes of the reactants. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing polariton chemistry in the VSC regime, shedding light on the intricate interplay between cavity quantum electrodynamics and chemical reactivity.
