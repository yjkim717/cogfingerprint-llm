**Abstract**

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) continue to attract significant interest due to their tunable porosity and diverse functionalities. This work reports the synthesis and characterization of novel MOFs incorporating a strategically designed fluorescent ligand, demonstrating a unique combination of properties. Specifically, the ligand’s inherent flexibility induces significant structural contraction upon guest molecule interaction, leading to pronounced pressure amplification effects observable via spectroscopic analysis. Furthermore, these MOFs exhibit a compelling negative gas adsorption behavior, a phenomenon previously rarely observed in crystalline materials.  Detailed X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence spectroscopy were employed to elucidate the structural transformations and correlate them with the observed gas uptake. The resultant MOFs demonstrate a sensitivity to external pressure, potentially enabling applications in sensing and controlled release systems.  Future research will focus on tailoring the ligand architecture to optimize these effects and explore their broader applicability across various gas species.
