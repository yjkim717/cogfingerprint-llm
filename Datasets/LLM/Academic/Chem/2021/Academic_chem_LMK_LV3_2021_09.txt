Title: Investigating the Crystallinity of Interstellar Ice Analogs via Transmission Electron Microscopy

Abstract:
The morphology of ices formed on refractory grains is crucial in understanding their role in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. In this study (2021), we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the crystallinity and morphology of H2O, CO2, and CO ices on silicate and carbonaceous substrates. Our results show that the crystal morphology of these ices is strongly dependent on their composition and the underlying substrate. Specifically, H2O-rich ices exhibited a crystalline structure on silicate substrates, whereas CO2-dominated ices displayed amorphous characteristics. Conversely, CO-rich ices formed crystalline structures on carbonaceous substrates. These findings have significant implications for understanding the evolution of ices in astrophysical environments and their potential impact on the formation of planetary systems. Our TEM analysis provides valuable insights into the microstructural properties of interstellar ice analogs, shedding light on their crystallinity and morphology.
