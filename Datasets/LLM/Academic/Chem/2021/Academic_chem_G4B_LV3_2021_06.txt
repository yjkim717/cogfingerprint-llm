**Abstract**

Recent investigations into carbon atom reactivity have revealed an unexpected catalytic pathway for formaldehyde formation, predicated on the interaction between carbon and amorphous solid water (ASW). Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and supporting experimental data, this study elucidates a mechanism wherein hydrogen bonding within ASW significantly lowers the activation energy for this reaction. Specifically, the observed kinetic isotope effect suggests a concerted process involving water molecule cleavage and carbon insertion.  These findings directly challenge previous models that attributed formaldehyde formation primarily to conventional aqueous catalysis.  The resultant low reaction barriers observed herein resolve existing inconsistencies within the literature concerning carbon-water reactivity.  Further research will explore the implications of this ASW-mediated catalysis for diverse chemical transformations and its potential applications in sustainable chemistry, particularly in formaldehyde mitigation strategies.
