**Abstract**

The emerging field of vibrational polariton chemistry has demonstrated the ability to significantly alter chemical reaction rates by coupling molecular vibrations to the confined electromagnetic modes of an optical cavity. While experimental observations of reaction rate suppression under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) are established, a comprehensive theoretical framework explaining the underlying mechanism remains a subject of intense investigation. This work presents a theoretical model that attributes the suppression of a model reaction rate to the interplay of non-Markovian dynamics and a dynamical caging effect. We demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons creates a potential energy landscape where the reaction coordinate becomes correlated with the cavity photon mode. This correlation induces non-Markovian feedback from the cavity, effectively hindering the system's evolution along the reaction pathway. Crucially, the model reveals that the cavity frequency must be resonant with a specific molecular vibration to maximize this effect, leading to a resonant suppression profile. The proposed "dynamical caging" mechanism, distinct from traditional transition-state theory, provides a unified explanation for the observed kinetic modifications under VSC, offering a significant step toward the rational design of cavity-modified chemistry.
