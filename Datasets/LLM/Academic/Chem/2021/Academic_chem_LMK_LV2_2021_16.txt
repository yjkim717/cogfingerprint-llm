Title: Non-Markovian Dynamics Underlying Vibrational Strong Coupling Modulation of Ground-State Reactivity

Abstract:
The emerging field of polariton chemistry has garnered significant attention due to its potential to manipulate chemical reactivity through vibrational strong coupling (VSC) with cavity radiation modes. In this work, we present a theoretical framework elucidating the cavity modification of ground-state reactivity in the VSC regime. By employing a non-Markovian rate theory, we demonstrate that the cavity-induced modulation of reaction rate constants arises from the non-Markovian dynamics of the coupled system. Our analysis reveals that the VSC regime enables the cavity radiation mode to significantly influence the reaction coordinate, thereby altering the rate-determining step. The presented theoretical model provides a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing VSC-mediated reactivity changes, offering insights into the design of novel polaritonic systems for controlling chemical reactions. Our findings contribute to the advancement of polariton chemistry, enabling the exploration of new avenues for manipulating ground-state reactivity.
