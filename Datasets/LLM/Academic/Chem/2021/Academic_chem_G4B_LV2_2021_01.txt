**Abstract**

The formation and evolution of ices within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks represent critical processes in the delivery of volatile elements to planetary systems. Utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at cryogenic temperatures, this research investigated the three-dimensional morphology of water (H₂O), carbon dioxide (CO₂), and carbon monoxide (CO) ices, providing novel insights into their crystalline behavior. Cryo-TEM analysis revealed significant composition-dependent variations in ice morphology, specifically demonstrating a pronounced influence of molecular structure on crystal habit and overall textural complexity. Notably, the observed crystallization pathways suggest a hierarchical growth process, potentially driven by preferential solvation and subsequent nucleation. These findings are particularly relevant to understanding the chemical gradients and radiative transfer occurring within these complex astrophysical environments.  The observed ice morphologies were correlated with predicted thermodynamic properties, strengthening the hypothesis that ice composition dictates crystalline structure.  Further investigation into these processes is warranted to refine models of gas-ice interactions and their impact on the formation of planetesimals and the subsequent chemical evolution of circumstellar disks.
