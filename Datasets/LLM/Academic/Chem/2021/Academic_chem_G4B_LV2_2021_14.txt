**Abstract**

Recent investigations into the catalytic activity of amorphous solid water (ASW) have yielded a revised mechanistic understanding of formaldehyde formation from carbon atoms. This study presents compelling evidence that ASW facilitates this reaction through a concerted proton transfer process, effectively resolving prior inconsistencies in proposed pathways. Spectroscopic analysis, coupled with kinetic isotope effect measurements, reveals a distinct mechanistic route wherein carbon atoms undergo activation within the ASW matrix. Notably, the observed reaction kinetics exhibit a significant kinetic isotope effect, indicative of a primary proton transfer event. Furthermore, the formation of formaldehyde was quantitatively assessed, confirming its generation as a major product. These findings challenge conventional models and suggest that ASW’s unique structural properties – specifically, its extensive hydrogen bonding network – play a critical role in stabilizing reactive intermediates and directing reaction selectivity.  The observed mechanism underscores ASW’s potential as a novel catalytic system in carbon chemistry, warranting further investigation into its broader applications in 2021 and beyond.
