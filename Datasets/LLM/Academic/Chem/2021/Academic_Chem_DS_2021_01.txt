**Abstract**

The strategic integration of transition metal centers with sophisticated organic ligand architectures has unlocked powerful paradigms in asymmetric synthesis. While traditional mechanistic interpretations often attribute enantiocontrol to the chiral environment directly surrounding the metal, a growing body of evidence highlights systems where the metal primarily serves as a structural scaffold. This perspective examines a distinct class of chiral metal-organic complexes that functionally emulate organocatalysts. In these assemblies, the metal ion acts as a template to pre-organize and rigidify multidentate organic ligands into specific, three-dimensional chiral cavities. The ensuing enantioselective transformations are not mediated by classical metal-centered Lewis acidity or redox activity. Instead, catalysis is driven by the organic ligand framework, which engages substrates through a sophisticated network of non-covalent interactions—including directed hydrogen bonding, ion pairing, π-stacking, and van der Waals forces—from within the defined chiral pocket. This "scaffolding" role of the metal distinguishes these systems from conventional coordination catalysis and positions them as hybrid platforms that merge the structural robustness of inorganic complexes with the nuanced, biomimetic recognition modes of organic molecules. This review, contextualized within 2021, will delineate the design principles for such metal-templated organocatalytic assemblies, analyze key mechanistic studies that decouple the metal's structural role from its potential chemical involvement, and survey their application in benchmark asymmetric reactions. Understanding this duality promises to inspire the next generation of catalysts that transcend traditional classification.
