In this 2021 study, we employ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to systematically investigate the nucleation and growth mechanisms of amorphous solid water on refractory grain analogs under astrophysically relevant conditions. Our experimental results demonstrate that ice morphology exhibits profound substrate-dependent characteristics, with carbonaceous grains promoting heterogeneous crystallization while silicate substrates predominantly maintain amorphous structures. Through controlled deposition experiments across temperatures ranging from 10-150 K, we establish that surface chemistry and lattice mismatch parameters govern the transition kinetics between amorphous and crystalline phases. These findings fundamentally challenge prevailing models of homogeneous ice mantle formation in molecular cloud environments and protoplanetary disks. The observed morphological diversity necessitates revision of current astrochemical models that assume uniform ice layering, with significant implications for our understanding of grain surface chemistry, molecular hydrogen formation, and the initial conditions of planetary system formation. This substrate-specific crystallization behavior represents a critical parameter in reconstructing the thermal history and chemical evolution of cosmic ices.
