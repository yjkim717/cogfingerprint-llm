**Abstract**

The role of ice morphology in the chemical evolution of interstellar grains remains a critical, yet incompletely understood, aspect of astrochemistry. Ices, ubiquitous on dust grains within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks, serve as reservoirs for volatile species and sites for complex chemical reactions. This study, employing transmission electron microscopy (TEM), investigates the influence of ice composition and substrate material on ice morphology, revealing a complex interplay that significantly impacts grain surface properties and subsequent collisional dynamics. Our analyses focused on the formation of ices composed of H₂O, CO, and CH₃OH on various substrate materials mimicking interstellar dust analogs. The results demonstrate a strong dependence of ice structure—including crystal size, morphology (amorphous, crystalline, mixed-phase), and layering—on the specific elemental composition and the nature of the underlying substrate. Specifically, we observed that CO-rich ices tend to form smaller crystallites compared to H₂O-dominated ices, and the presence of CH₃OH can induce phase segregation within the ice matrix. Furthermore, the substrate material (e.g., amorphous silicate vs. carbonaceous material) demonstrably affects ice nucleation and growth kinetics. These findings suggest that the observed variance in ice morphologies within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks is not solely dictated by temperature and pressure but is also critically influenced by compositional heterogeneity and grain surface properties. This research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of ice-mediated chemistry and collisional processes, ultimately impacting models of planet formation and the origin of complex organic molecules in space.
