Of particular interest in the field of flexible metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are systems exhibiting anomalous adsorption phenomena, such as negative gas adsorption (NGA), which involves a sudden release of gas upon reaching a specific pressure threshold. While the prototypical framework DUT-49 has demonstrated this behavior, the underlying structural transitions driving pressure amplification and NGA remain challenging to probe in situ. Herein, we report the rational design and synthesis of a series of novel MOFs isoreticular to DUT-49, into which we have successfully integrated fluorescent molecular functionalities. These designed frameworks not only retain the characteristic pressure-amplified NGA behavior but also provide a direct spectroscopic handle to correlate host-guest interactions with the framework's structural dynamics. The emission properties of these MOFs are exquisitely sensitive to the guest-induced pore contraction and expansion, offering unprecedented, real-time insight into the metastable states preceding the NGA event. This work, therefore, establishes a versatile platform for elucidating the mechanisms of stimuli-responsive porosity in MOFs by bridging macroscopic adsorption measurements with molecular-level spectroscopic analysis, opening new avenues for the development of smart adsorbents and sensors.
