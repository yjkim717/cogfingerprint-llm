**Investigating Ice Morphology and its Influence on Space Chemistry via Transmission Electron Microscopy**

The formation of ice in extraterrestrial environments presents a crucial challenge for planetary science, significantly impacting the long-term stability of volatiles and the potential for prebiotic chemistry. This work details an investigation into ice morphology generated upon grain surfaces, utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the resultant structures. Specifically, we observed a strong correlation between ice morphology and both the elemental composition of the substrate grain and the inherent characteristics of the ice itself. Notably, significant variations in ice structure, ranging from highly ordered crystalline forms to amorphous ice morphologies, were documented.  Furthermore, the presence of refractory grains appeared to influence crystallization pathways, promoting the formation of localized, densely packed ice regions.  These findings suggest that the heterogeneous nature of planetary surfaces profoundly affects ice nucleation and growth, ultimately modulating the chemical evolution of these environments.  Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms driving these observed morphologies and their downstream effects on space chemistry.
