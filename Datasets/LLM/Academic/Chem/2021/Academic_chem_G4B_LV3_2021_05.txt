**Abstract:**

Recent investigations into the formation of ice mantles on solid precursors within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks have traditionally posited a model of uniform, layered ice growth. However, this study, employing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at cryogenic temperatures, reveals a markedly more complex relationship. Analysis of ice morphologies on refractory grains demonstrates substantial variation dependent upon both ice chemical composition and the nature of the underlying substrate. Observed ice structures deviate significantly from idealized layered architectures, exhibiting dendritic and granular features indicative of heterogeneous nucleation and growth. These findings suggest that ice formation in these astrophysical environments is not governed by simple thermodynamic principles, but rather by intricate interactions between ice chemistry, substrate properties, and potentially, external radiative influences. Further research utilizing advanced spectroscopic techniques is warranted to fully elucidate the mechanisms driving this complex ice morphology.
