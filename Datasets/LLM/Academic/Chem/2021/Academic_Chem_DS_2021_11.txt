This investigation explores the collisional cooling dynamics of hydrogenic molecular species within primordial dark-matter halos, with implications for dissipative dark matter frameworks. We compute state-to-state reaction cross-sections and thermalization rates for key processes including radiative association and spin-exchange collisions. Our quantum-chemical calculations reveal enhanced cooling efficiencies at redshifts z > 30 compared to standard cosmological models. These results establish critical microphysical inputs for hydrodynamic simulations of early structure formation, suggesting that molecular cooling mechanisms could significantly alter halo density profiles and fragmentation scales in non-minimal dark sector scenarios. The derived rate coefficients enable more accurate modeling of baryonic feedback in alternative dark matter cosmologies.
