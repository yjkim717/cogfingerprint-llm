Title: Isoreticular Metal-Organic Frameworks with Fluorescent Functionality: Unveiling Pressure Amplification and Negative Gas Adsorption Phenomena

Abstract:
We report the synthesis and characterization of novel isoreticular metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating fluorescent ligands, which exhibit intriguing adsorption behavior and optical properties. The judicious selection of ligands enabled the creation of MOFs with tailored pore sizes and environments, facilitating the investigation of pressure amplification and negative gas adsorption (NGA) phenomena. The as-synthesized MOFs were thoroughly characterized using a range of techniques, including X-ray diffraction, gas sorption analysis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of fluorescent functionality does not compromise the structural integrity or adsorption properties of the MOFs. Notably, the observed NGA behavior is accompanied by a pronounced pressure amplification effect, underscoring the potential of these materials for advanced gas storage and sensing applications. The findings presented herein contribute to the expanding knowledge on the design and properties of MOFs with bespoke functionality.
