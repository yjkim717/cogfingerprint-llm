This work presents a novel class of bifunctional electrocatalysts derived from covalent organic framework (COF)-templated heterostructures. Through controlled pyrolysis of a ZIF-67-integrated COF precursor, we fabricate hierarchical core-shell carbon matrices embedding atomically dispersed Co-Nx moieties alongside metallic cobalt nanoparticles. Systematic electrochemical evaluation confirms exceptional activity for both oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media, outperforming commercial Pt/C benchmarks. The synergistic coupling between single-atom sites and nanoscale metal domains within the porous architecture is identified as crucial for enhancing reaction kinetics and stability.
