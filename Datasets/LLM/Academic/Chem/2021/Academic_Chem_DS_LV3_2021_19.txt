In this 2021 study, we report the synthesis and characterization of DUT-140(M) metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating a novel fluorescent ligand, which exhibit unprecedented negative gas adsorption (NGA) behavior coupled with pressure amplification effects. Through advanced spectroscopic techniques—including in situ fluorescence spectroscopy and synchrotron X-ray diffraction—we elucidate the dynamic structural flexibility of these frameworks during adsorption-desorption cycles. Our experimental results demonstrate that the integration of fluorescent moieties not only enables real-time monitoring of host-guest interactions but also enhances the framework's responsive behavior to external stimuli. Computational modeling reveals that the observed NGA stems from metastable states and sudden pore contractions, which generate intrinsic pressure amplification exceeding 15 kPa. This work establishes a critical link between luminescent properties and adsorption phenomena in flexible MOFs, offering new pathways for designing smart materials with applications in sensing, energy storage, and micro-mechanical systems. The dual functionality of DUT-140 underscores its potential as a multifunctional platform for investigating stimulus-responsive porous materials.
