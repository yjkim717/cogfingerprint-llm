**Abstract**

The integration of multiple functionalities into metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a frontier in porous materials science. In 2021, we report the design and synthesis of a novel series of isoreticular frameworks derived from the DUT-49 archetype, engineered to concurrently exhibit the rare phenomenon of negative gas adsorption (NGA) and intrinsic fluorescent functionality. These soft porous crystals undergo a structurally monitored, discontinuous pore collapse upon reaching a critical gas pressure, resulting in a spontaneous pressure amplification and the release of adsorbed guest molecules. We demonstrate that the incorporation of specific, luminescent organic linkers does not compromise the framework's metastability essential for NGA. The materials were rigorously characterized using high-pressure gas sorptionetry, in situ fluorescence spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our findings reveal a direct correlation between the pressure-induced phase transition and a quantifiable fluorescence quenching, providing a novel optical signature for the NGA event. This synergistic combination of extreme mechanical responsiveness and photophysical reporting in a single material platform opens avenues for advanced sensors and energy-efficient gas handling technologies.
