Of particular interest in the field of stimuli-responsive materials are soft porous crystals (SPCs), which exhibit dynamic structural transitions upon external stimuli. While the phenomenon of negative gas adsorption (NGA)—a counterintuitive pressure release during gas uptake—has been demonstrated in select metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), integrating this property with optical functionality remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a series of isoreticular fluorescent MOFs, structurally analogous to the prototypical DUT-49 framework. These materials uniquely combine the NGA phenomenon, driven by a metastable-to-stable phase transition under gas pressure, with intrinsic fluorescent properties. Comprehensive spectroscopic characterization, including steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements, confirms the retention of strong luminescence while simultaneously allowing for the in-situ monitoring of the structural transition associated with NGA. This work not only presents a new class of multifunctional SPCs but also establishes a pioneering strategy for coupling mechanical instability with optical readouts, paving the way for advanced sensor technologies and novel pressure amplification devices.
