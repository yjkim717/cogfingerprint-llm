Title: Efficient Formaldehyde Formation via Carbon Atom Reaction with Amorphous Solid Water: An Astrochemically Relevant Process

Abstract:
The formation of formaldehyde (H2CO) in interstellar environments is a topic of ongoing research in astrochemistry. Recent experimental investigations have provided new insights into the reaction of carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW), a key component of interstellar ices. Our study demonstrates that this reaction proceeds efficiently, yielding formaldehyde as a primary product. The reaction is found to be catalyzed by H2O, with the ASW surface facilitating the formation of H2CO through a barrierless pathway. Quantum chemical calculations corroborate the experimental findings, highlighting the crucial role of H2O in modulating the reactivity of carbon atoms. The results presented here support an astrochemically relevant mechanism for formaldehyde formation, with implications for understanding the chemistry of interstellar ices and the origins of complex organic molecules in the universe.
