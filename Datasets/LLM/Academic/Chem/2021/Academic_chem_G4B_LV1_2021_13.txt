**Abstract**

The heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent morphology of ice phases within astrophysical environments present a compelling area for investigation. This work reports on the utilization of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the crystalline structures formed upon ice deposition onto refractory silicate analogs, mimicking the conditions prevalent in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.  Analysis revealed a pronounced dependence of ice morphology on both ice composition – specifically, the relative abundance of water and volatile organics – and the nature of the underlying substrate. Observed crystal architectures transitioned from disordered, amorphous ice to complex, three-dimensional morphologies exhibiting notable crystallinity.  These structures demonstrate anisotropic growth patterns, suggesting preferential orientation driven by substrate interactions.  Spectroscopic analysis, coupled with TEM imaging, allowed for the identification of distinct ice polymorphs.  The observed ice morphologies offer valuable insights into the initial stages of ice formation within these cold, dusty environments, potentially influencing the subsequent evolution of planet-forming systems and the delivery of volatile materials to nascent planetary cores.
