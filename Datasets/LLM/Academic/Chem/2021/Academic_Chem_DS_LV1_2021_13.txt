**Abstract**

The structural evolution of amorphous solid water (ASW) on refractory grain surfaces is a critical process in astrophysical environments, governing the trapping and release of volatiles within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. While the crystallization of pure ASW is well-studied, the morphological pathways and kinetics of crystallization for amorphous ices of mixed composition on astronomically relevant substrates remain poorly constrained. Herein, we employ cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) to systematically investigate the isothermal crystallization of pure H₂O and H₂O:CO₂:NH₃ amorphous ice mixtures, vapor-deposited onto carbon-supported analogues of silicate and carbonaceous grains. Our results demonstrate that the substrate's chemical nature and nanoscale topography exert a profound influence on nucleation density and the ensuing ice morphology. On hydrophilic silicate analogues, crystallization proceeds via numerous nucleation sites, resulting in a polycrystalline matrix of cubic ice (Iₐ) with grain sizes below 50 nm. In contrast, on hydrophobic carbon substrates, crystallization is nucleation-limited, forming large, distinct crystalline domains. The incorporation of CO₂ and NH₃ significantly suppresses the crystallization temperature and alters the microstructural evolution, promoting a more gradual phase transition with complex, intermixed amorphous-crystalline regions. These findings provide direct, nanoscale evidence that the physical and chemical history of icy mantles—encoded in their crystalline microstructure—is intrinsically linked to the underlying grain substrate, with fundamental implications for our understanding of ice chemistry in the protoplanetary environments where planetesimals form.
