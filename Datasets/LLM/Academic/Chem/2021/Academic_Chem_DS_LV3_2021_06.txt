**Abstract** (2021)

This investigation elucidates a novel, low-temperature formation mechanism for formaldehyde (H₂CO) within interstellar ice analogues, resolving long-standing discrepancies in astrochemical models. We demonstrate that carbon (C) atoms, upon deposition onto amorphous solid water (ASW) at 10 K, undergo a water-catalyzed reaction sequence leading to efficient H₂CO synthesis. Crucially, the ASW matrix is not a passive spectator; it actively facilitates proton transfer processes that are otherwise kinetically inhibited in the gas phase. This catalytic role of water ice dramatically enhances the reaction rate, providing a robust non-radical pathway for complex organic molecule formation in dark molecular clouds. Our results, validated by isotopic labelling and temperature-programmed desorption, establish that ASW-mediated proton transfer is a fundamental driver of molecular complexity, fundamentally revising our understanding of prebiotic chemistry in the early stages of star and planet formation.
