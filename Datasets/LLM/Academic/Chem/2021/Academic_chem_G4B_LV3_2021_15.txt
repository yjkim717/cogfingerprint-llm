**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are increasingly exploring novel functionalities beyond traditional gas storage. This study presents the synthesis and initial characterization of a series of DUT-140(M) MOFs, incorporating strategically designed fluorescent ligands. Spectroscopic investigations, coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, reveal a unique combination of properties: demonstrable structural flexibility, enabling adaptive pore environments, and the capacity for negative gas adsorption – a phenomenon previously observed with limited consistency. Furthermore, the incorporation of these ligands facilitates pressure amplification within the MOF framework, potentially through enhanced vibrational modes. These findings suggest a pathway towards utilizing MOFs as responsive materials for selective gas capture and manipulation, with implications for advanced sensing and separation technologies. Continued research will focus on optimizing ligand design and correlating structure with observed functionality.
