**Abstract**

The manipulation of chemical reaction pathways through non-equilibrium optical techniques has emerged as a compelling area of research. This work introduces a theoretical framework elucidating the influence of optical cavities on chemical reactivity, predicated on the principles of vibrational strong coupling and photon frequency-dependent dynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate how resonant excitation within a cavity can induce a ‘dynamical caging’ effect, confining molecular vibrations and altering their interaction with the surrounding environment.  The radiative decay from excited vibrational states within the cavity, via a cavity radiation mode, leads to a significant modification of the molecule’s energy landscape.  

Our calculations reveal that the effective vibrational frequency of the molecule is subtly shifted in response to the cavity field, and this frequency dependence is directly linked to the strength of the vibrational strong coupling.  Furthermore, we explore the impact of varying the photon frequency of the cavity mode, showcasing a tunable sensitivity to molecular vibrational transitions.  These findings suggest a potential pathway for controlling chemical processes with unprecedented precision using tailored photonic environments.
