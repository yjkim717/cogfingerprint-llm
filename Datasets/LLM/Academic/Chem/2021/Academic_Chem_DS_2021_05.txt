The deleterious effects of methylmercury (MeHg) on cellular redox homeostasis are well-documented, yet the specific molecular mechanisms underlying its potentiation of oxidative stress remain incompletely characterized. This computational study employs density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the interaction of MeHg with the catalytic residues of key peroxide-reducing enzymes, namely glutathione peroxidases and peroxiredoxins. We demonstrate that MeHg exhibits a high thermodynamic affinity for both the cysteine (Cys) and selenocysteine (Sec) residues within the enzymes' active sites, forming stable MeHg-S/Se adducts. These interactions fundamentally alter the electronic structure of the catalytic center, lowering the activation barrier for the oxidation of the Cys/Sec thiol/selenol. Paradoxically, while this facilitates the initial oxidation step, the resultant MeHg-bound species significantly impedes the subsequent catalytic cycle necessary for peroxide reduction. Our findings suggest that MeHg toxicity arises not merely from enzyme inhibition but from a more complex dysregulation, where the metal promotes a non-productive oxidation pathway, effectively stalling the enzymatic defense against reactive oxygen species and exacerbating oxidative damage.
