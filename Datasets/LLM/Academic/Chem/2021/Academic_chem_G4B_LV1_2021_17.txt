**Abstract**

The complex interplay between ice formation and grain composition represents a critical, yet incompletely understood, process within molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. This study leverages transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the morphology of ice crystallites formed on refractory silicate grains, employing cryogenic techniques to maintain representative ice conditions. Analysis reveals a strong correlation between ice morphology – specifically, the prevalence of dendritic and layered structures – and both the elemental composition of the substrate and the ice itself.  We posit that subtle variations in surface chemistry, dictated by the grain’s refractory component, directly influence the nucleation and growth pathways of ice, leading to diverse crystalline arrangements.  These observations suggest that ice formation isn’t a passive process, but rather a chemically-directed phenomenon.  Further investigation into the specific chemical interactions at the grain-ice interface is warranted to refine models of space chemistry and the early stages of planet formation, particularly concerning the delivery of volatile compounds to nascent planetary systems.
