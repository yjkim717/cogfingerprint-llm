Title: Investigating the Morphological Evolution of Ices on Refractory Grains via Transmission Electron Microscopy

Abstract:

The crystallization of ices on refractory grains plays a crucial role in the astrochemical evolution of molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. To elucidate the morphological transformations of these ices, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the structural properties of H2O, CO2, and CO ices deposited on refractory substrates. Our results demonstrate that the morphology of these ices is highly dependent on the composition and temperature of the system. At cryogenic temperatures, the ices exhibit amorphous structures, whereas upon annealing, they undergo a phase transition to form crystalline domains. The TEM images reveal that the crystalline structures are characterized by distinct morphologies, including faceted crystallites and dendritic growth patterns. The observed morphological evolution is attributed to the interplay between the thermodynamic properties of the ices and the substrate-ice interactions. Notably, the presence of CO2 and CO in the H2O ice matrix significantly influences the crystallization kinetics, leading to the formation of complex ice morphologies. Our findings have implications for understanding the role of ice morphology in astrochemical processes, such as grain surface chemistry and ice sublimation, which occur in the dense interstellar medium. The insights gained from this study will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions between ices and refractory grains in astrophysical environments, shedding light on the intricate processes that shape the chemical and physical evolution of molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.
