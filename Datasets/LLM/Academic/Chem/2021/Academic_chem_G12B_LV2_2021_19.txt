**Abstract**

The pursuit of materials capable of exhibiting both enhanced gas adsorption behavior and optical functionalities remains a significant challenge in chemical research. This study reports the synthesis and characterization of a novel series of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), designated DUT-140(M) (where M = various metal ions), incorporating a fluorescent core within the framework structure. The strategic design of these MOFs aims to leverage the principles of pressure amplification, a phenomenon wherein the effective pressure experienced by gas molecules within the pores is significantly higher than the external pressure, thereby enhancing adsorption capacity.

Detailed structural analysis, employing X-ray diffraction and gas sorption measurements, reveals that DUT-140(M) exhibits a unique porous architecture conducive to pressure amplification. Notably, we observed negative gas adsorption behavior for COâ‚‚ at elevated pressures, indicating a deviation from ideal Langmuir behavior attributable to pore condensation and inter-adsorbate interactions. Spectroscopic techniques, including fluorescence spectroscopy, confirm the presence and tunability of the fluorescent core, with emission properties dependent on the incorporated metal ion. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing the observed pressure amplification and gas adsorption isotherms. These findings demonstrate the potential of DUT-140(M) MOFs as advanced materials for gas separation, storage, and sensing applications, while simultaneously providing a platform for the development of multifunctional materials integrating optical and adsorption properties.
