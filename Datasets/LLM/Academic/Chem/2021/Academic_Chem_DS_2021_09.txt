Abstract

The rational design of advanced electrocatalysts is paramount for the development of efficient energy conversion technologies. This review systematically examines the pivotal role of first-principles simulations, primarily grounded in density functional theory (DFT), in elucidating the atomistic mechanisms underpinning key electrochemical transformations. We focus on three critical reactions central to a sustainable energy landscape: the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for clean hydrogen production, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for fuel cell efficiency, and the electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) for closing the carbon cycle. The discussion highlights how DFT-derived parameters, such as adsorption free energies, reaction pathways, and electronic structure descriptors, provide fundamental insights into catalytic activity and selectivity. Furthermore, we explore the application of these computational insights in screening and designing novel catalytic materials, including single-atom catalysts and tailored nanostructures, by establishing activity volcanoes and stability criteria. By bridging quantum-level calculations with macroscopic electrochemical performance, this work underscores computational electrochemistry as an indispensable tool for accelerating the discovery of next-generation electrocatalysts, thereby addressing pressing challenges in renewable energy storage and conversion.
