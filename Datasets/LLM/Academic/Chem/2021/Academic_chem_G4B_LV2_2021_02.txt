**Abstract**

Recent investigations into unconventional reaction pathways have revealed a surprising catalytic role for amorphous solid water (ASW) in the generation of hydrogenocarbon (H₂CO). This study reports on a combined computational and experimental approach elucidating the mechanistic details of this process, observed in 2021. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified a key role for hydrogen bonding within the ASW matrix in facilitating the abstraction of a proton from a carbon atom, initiating a cascade leading to H₂CO formation.  Furthermore, kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements confirmed the proton transfer step as rate-limiting.  The observed KIE values, alongside computational analysis of transition states, strongly suggest a concerted mechanism. These findings challenge conventional understanding of carbon atom reactivity and introduce ASW as a potentially significant, yet previously unappreciated, catalytic agent in low-temperature chemical transformations.  Future work will explore the influence of ASW structure and composition on reaction efficiency.
