**Abstract**

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials for gas adsorption and sensing applications. This work details the synthesis and characterization of a novel fluorescent MOF, designated DUT-140(M), engineered to exhibit enhanced flexibility and demonstrate negative gas adsorption capabilities. Utilizing a carefully selected organic linker and metal node, we observed a significant increase in structural mobility compared to conventional MOF architectures. Spectroscopic analysis, including X-ray diffraction, confirmed the dynamic nature of the framework.  Furthermore, computational modeling provided insights into the mechanism of negative gas adsorption, suggesting a cooperative interaction between the fluorescent core and the porous environment. The observed fluorescence response was demonstrably sensitive to the presence of target gases, indicating potential for real-time sensing. These findings represent a significant advancement in the design of responsive MOF materials, offering new avenues for selective gas capture and advanced sensing technologies.
