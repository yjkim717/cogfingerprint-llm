Title: Cavity-Modulated Ground State Reactivity: A Non-Markovian Perspective on Vibrational Strong Coupling

Abstract:
The vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regime has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to alter ground state chemical reactivity. In this work, we present a theoretical framework to elucidate the cavity modification of reaction rate constants under VSC conditions. By incorporating the cavity radiation mode into the system-bath Hamiltonian, we demonstrate that the non-Markovian dynamics of the vibrational polaritons play a crucial role in modulating the reactivity. Our analysis reveals that the cavity-mediated non-Markovian effects lead to a suppression of the reaction rate constant, in qualitative agreement with recent experimental observations. Furthermore, we show that the cavity-resonant enhancement of the reaction rate is attributed to the selective modification of the vibrational polariton modes. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the VSC-modified ground state reactivity, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms governing polariton chemistry.
