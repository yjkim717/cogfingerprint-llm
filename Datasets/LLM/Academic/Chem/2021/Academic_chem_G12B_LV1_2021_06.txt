Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, suitable for a chemistry-related publication in 2021. I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and a tone consistent with academic writing.  Following the abstract, I’ll include a few notes explaining my choices and potential expansions.

**Abstract**

The formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) in extraterrestrial ice environments remains a critical question in astrochemistry, particularly concerning the potential origins of prebiotic molecules. This work investigates a novel pathway for formaldehyde synthesis involving the reaction of isolated carbon atoms with amorphous solid water (ASW) under low-temperature conditions. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations and corroborated by experimental infrared spectroscopy, we demonstrate that hydrogen bonding networks within ASW efficiently catalyze this reaction. Our computational results reveal a concerted mechanism involving initial adsorption of both carbon and H₂O onto the ASW matrix, followed by a series of proton transfer events facilitated by the hydrogen bond network. These transfers stabilize reaction intermediates and lower the activation energy for formaldehyde formation. Experimental observations confirm the presence of H₂CO following irradiation of ASW containing carbon precursors, supporting the computational predictions. This pathway suggests a potentially significant contribution to formaldehyde abundances in interstellar ices, providing a plausible route for the generation of this key building block for more complex organic molecules in cold, dense regions of space.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Year Context (2021):** The phrasing implies the research is current and relevant to the field as of that time.
*   **Astrochemistry Focus:** The abstract explicitly frames the research within the context of astrochemistry, highlighting the relevance to the formation of prebiotic molecules in space. This aligns with the implied setting of the original summary.
*   **Methodology:** I included both "computational" (DFT) and "experimental" (IR spectroscopy) aspects to reflect the dual nature of the original summary.
*   **Mechanism Detail:** I added a brief description of the proposed mechanism (adsorption, proton transfer) to provide more substance.
*   **Hydrogen Bonding Emphasis:** The role of hydrogen bonding is highlighted as the catalytic factor.
*   **Precise Terminology:** Terms like "density functional theory," "amorphous solid water," "concerted mechanism," and "activation energy" are used appropriately.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: introduction of the problem, description of the approach, presentation of key findings, and statement of implications.
*   **Potential Expansions:**
    *   The specific DFT functional used could be mentioned (e.g., B3LYP).
    *   Details about the experimental setup (e.g., irradiation wavelength, carbon precursor) could be included if space allows.
    *   A quantitative estimate of the formaldehyde yield or reaction rate could be added if available.
