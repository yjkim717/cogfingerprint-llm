**Abstract**

The efficient formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO), a crucial molecule in interstellar environments, has remained a subject of ongoing investigation. This study, conducted in 2021, addresses persistent ambiguities surrounding the reaction mechanism of H₂CO synthesis from carbon atoms and amorphous solid water (ASW). Through a combination of computational modeling and experimental validation, we demonstrate a novel, water-catalyzed pathway exhibiting significantly enhanced reaction efficiency. Our findings reveal that ASW effectively facilitates H₂CO production, providing a reactive platform for carbon atom insertion and subsequent H₂O catalysis. These results reconcile conflicting observations reported in prior literature and offer a refined understanding of formaldehyde formation within the cold, dense phases of interstellar ices.
