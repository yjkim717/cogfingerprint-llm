**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, wherein molecular ensembles are coherently coupled to confined electromagnetic modes of optical cavities, presents a paradigm shift for controlling chemical reactivity. A central and mechanistically debated phenomenon is the significant suppression of reaction rates under vibrational strong coupling (VSC). While initial experimental observations are compelling, a comprehensive theoretical framework delineating the operative mechanisms remains an active pursuit. Herein, we present a theoretical analysis demonstrating that VSC-induced reaction rate suppression arises from a synergistic interplay of non-Markovian dynamics and a dynamical caging effect, both critically dependent on the cavity frequency. Our model, which treats the reactive system as an open quantum system, reveals that the hybrid light-matter polaritonic states are not merely spectators but actively reshape the potential energy landscape. The cavity environment imposes memory effects—non-Markovianity—that inhibit intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR), a prerequisite for barrier crossing. Concurrently, we identify a resonant dynamical caging mechanism, where the collective polaritonic state effectively traps the molecular system in the reactant well, impeding progress along the reaction coordinate. Crucially, this dual suppression mechanism is maximized only when the cavity frequency is specifically tuned to resonate with a key molecular vibrational mode involved in the reaction pathway. These findings provide a unified theoretical basis for the observed cavity frequency-specific control in polariton chemistry, offering new design principles for manipulating chemical transformations.
