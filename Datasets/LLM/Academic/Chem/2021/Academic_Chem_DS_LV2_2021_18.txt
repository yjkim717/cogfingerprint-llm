This study investigates the catalytic role of amorphous solid water (ASW) in the formation of formaldehyde (Hâ‚‚CO) from carbon atom reactions under astrochemically relevant conditions. We demonstrate that ASW is not merely an inert substrate but actively facilitates proton transfer processes, significantly enhancing reaction efficiency. Through computational modeling, we identify a water-mediated proton transfer mechanism that dramatically lowers the activation barriers compared to analogous gas-phase reactions. The resulting pathway enables the formation of formaldehyde, a key prebiotic molecule, with high efficacy at low temperatures. These findings underscore the critical function of water ice as a proton transfer catalyst in interstellar and cometary environments, providing a plausible route for the synthesis of complex organic molecules in dark molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. This work advances our understanding of non-equilibrium chemistry on cosmic ice grains.
