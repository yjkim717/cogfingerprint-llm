**Abstract**

Metalâ€“organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials for gas adsorption and sensing, yet achieving both high performance and tunable functionality remains a significant challenge.  This study reports the synthesis and characterization of a novel fluorescent MOF, designated DUT-140(M), incorporating a specifically designed fluorescent ligand.  Computational modelling, combined with spectroscopic investigation, reveals a pronounced structural contraction upon guest molecule interaction, leading to a compelling demonstration of negative gas adsorption capabilities.  Crucially, the flexible ligand architecture imparts enhanced conformational adaptability within the MOF lattice, facilitating this pressure-amplified negative adsorption effect.  The resultant fluorescence properties are sensitive to the adsorbed gas, providing a potential route toward real-time monitoring.  These findings suggest that rationally designed MOFs, leveraging ligand flexibility and pressure-responsive mechanisms, represent a promising avenue for developing advanced gas separation and sensing technologies. Further research will focus on exploring the scope of applicable guest molecules and optimizing the material for industrial applications.
