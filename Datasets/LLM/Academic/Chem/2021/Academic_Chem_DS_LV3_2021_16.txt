In this theoretical investigation, we elucidate the mechanistic origins of reaction rate suppression observed under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) conditions. Our model posits that the cavity frequency, when resonant with the molecular vibrational transition, induces the formation of hybrid light-matter states known as vibrational polaritons. This study demonstrates that the ensuing chemical kinetics are governed by non-Markovian dynamics, where the system's history profoundly influences its temporal evolution. A key finding is the emergence of a dynamical caging effect within the cavity, which effectively impedes the reaction coordinate's progression over the activation barrier. The suppression is most pronounced when the cavity frequency is tuned near the intrinsic barrier frequency, leading to a significant alteration of the potential energy landscape experienced by the reactants. This work provides a unified, frequency-dependent framework for polariton chemistry, moving beyond static descriptions to capture the essential role of dynamical correlations in modifying chemical reactivity. Our findings, situated in the context of 2021 experimental advances, offer a foundational theory for controlling ground-state chemical processes with optical cavities.
