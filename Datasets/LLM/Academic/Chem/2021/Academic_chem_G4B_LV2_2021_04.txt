**Abstract**

The interplay between light and matter at strong coupling regimes presents a compelling opportunity to engineer novel chemical phenomena. This work introduces a theoretical framework elucidating the modification of molecular reactivity within optical cavities, specifically focusing on the influence of vibrational strong coupling and non-Markovian dynamics. Utilizing a time-dependent Schrödinger equation approach, we demonstrate that cavity radiation modes, characterized by a photon frequency dependence, induce a pronounced dynamical caging effect on vibrational transitions in the interacting molecule. 

Our model predicts that the coupling strength between the molecule and the cavity dictates the extent of this caging, effectively altering the timescale and probability of vibrational relaxation. The non-Markovian nature of the system, reflecting the persistent interaction between the molecule and the cavity field, is crucial in establishing this observable modification of reactivity.  Specifically, we illustrate how the cavity’s resonant frequency can selectively ‘trap’ molecular vibrations, suppressing certain pathways while enhancing others. 

These findings contribute to the burgeoning field of polariton chemistry, suggesting a pathway for utilizing engineered optical cavities to control chemical reactions with unprecedented precision. Further investigation into the specific vibrational modes affected and the associated energy transfer mechanisms will be critical for realizing practical applications in areas such as selective catalysis and photochemistry.  This research, presented in 2021, establishes a foundational understanding for future experimental validation and system design.
