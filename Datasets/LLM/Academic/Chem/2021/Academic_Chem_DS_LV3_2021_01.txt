**Abstract**

The structural evolution of icy mantles on refractory grain substrates represents a critical, yet poorly constrained, physicochemical process in the thermal history of protoplanetary disks. Traditional astrochemical models often presuppose the deposition of homogeneous, layered ices, an assumption that fails to account for the complex interplay between grain surface properties and condensate phase behavior. In this 2021 study, we employ high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to systematically investigate the nucleation and growth of water and volatile ices on a suite of synthetic refractory grain analogs, including forsterite (Mg₂SiO₄) and amorphous carbon. Our results demonstrate unequivocally that ice morphology is not a universal property but is intrinsically governed by the coupled effects of condensate composition and the nanoscale topography and chemical nature of the underlying substrate. We observe a spectrum of outcomes, from the formation of discrete, crystalline domains to the pervasive development of non-crystalline, amorphous solid water (ASW) matrices, a process we term substrate-mediated amorphous crystallization. These microstructural heterogeneities directly influence the porosity, surface area, and potential reactivity of the icy grains. Consequently, our findings challenge the paradigm of uniform ice mantles in interstellar and circumstellar environments, providing a refined microphysical framework. This new understanding necessitates a revision of grain-surface reaction kinetics and dust coagulation models, with profound implications for tracing the initial stages of planetesimal formation in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.
