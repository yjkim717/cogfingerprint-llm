The interstellar detection of complex organic molecules continues to reveal the intricate chemical processes active within cold molecular clouds. This study presents the identification of methyl-terminated carbon chains, including several novel methylpolyynes, within the starless core TMC-1, achieved through a deep, high-spectral-resolution molecular line survey. Complementary gas-grain chemical kinetics simulations were employed to elucidate the underlying reaction network. Our models indicate that the observed abundances of methylated polyynes are best reproduced by a formation pathway dominated by gas-phase ion-molecule reactions, specifically involving the sequential methylation of smaller carbon-chain precursors. In contrast, the synthesis of related methylcyanopolyynes appears to be heavily influenced by radical-radical recombination reactions on dust grain surfaces, followed by non-thermal desorption into the gas phase. This mechanistic divergence highlights the distinct chemical drivers for nitrogen-bearing versus pure hydrocarbon methyl chains in dark clouds, providing critical constraints on the molecular complexity achievable prior to the onset of star formation.
