Title: Integrating Fluorescent Functionality into Pressure-Amplifying Metal-Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Gas Adsorption

Abstract (2021): 
This study reports the successful integration of fluorescent functionality into pressure-amplifying metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), yielding highly porous and flexible crystalline structures. The resulting MOFs exhibit negative gas adsorption behavior, facilitated by their unique pressure-amplifying properties. The incorporation of fluorescent moieties enables real-time monitoring of gas adsorption processes, providing valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of these porous crystals. The findings demonstrate the potential of these advanced MOFs for applications in gas storage and separation, highlighting their significance in the field of materials science.
