Title: Exploring Luminescent Isoreticular Metal-Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Gas Adsorption Properties

Abstract:
In 2021, the synthesis and characterization of novel isoreticular metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) incorporating fluorescent functionality have garnered significant attention. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a new series of luminescent MOFs, leveraging the integration of fluorescent cores within their structures. The resulting materials exhibit intriguing adsorption behavior, including pressure amplification and negative gas adsorption phenomena. A comprehensive investigation into the light absorption properties of these MOFs reveals a strong correlation between their luminescent characteristics and gas adsorption properties. Our findings demonstrate the potential of isoreticular MOFs with tailored fluorescent functionality to enhance gas adsorption capacities. The insights gained from this study contribute to the advancement of MOF-based materials for applications in gas storage and separation, highlighting the significance of luminescent MOFs in this field. The results underscore the importance of precise structural control in optimizing MOF properties.
