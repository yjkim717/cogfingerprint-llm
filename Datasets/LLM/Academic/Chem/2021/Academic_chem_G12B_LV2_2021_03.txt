>Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, drawing upon the provided keywords and summary, and aimed at a 2021 publication timeframe. I've structured it to follow typical abstract conventions (background, purpose, methods, key findings, conclusion/implications).  I've also included some detail to make it sound more substantive, assuming a reasonable level of research activity in this area.

**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials for gas storage, separation, and catalysis, with recent efforts focused on enhancing their performance through structural design and functionalization. This study reports the synthesis and characterization of a novel series of fluorescent MOFs, designated DUT-140(M) (where M = varying metal ions), exhibiting a unique combination of pressure amplification and negative gas adsorption behavior. The MOFs were synthesized via a solvothermal method utilizing a specifically designed fluorescent linker, enabling optical monitoring of structural changes. Detailed X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the framework topology and revealed subtle variations induced by the metal node selection.  Gas adsorption isotherms, measured at variable temperatures, demonstrated unprecedented negative volume of adsorption for CO<sub>2</sub> in DUT-140(M), a phenomenon typically associated with structural breathing transitions. Furthermore, fluorescence spectroscopy revealed a sensitivity of the linker's emission to gas adsorption, providing a potential avenue for optical sensing applications.  Computational modelling, employing Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulations, supports the experimental observations and elucidates the mechanism underlying the pressure amplification and negative gas adsorption. These findings suggest that the DUT-140(M) MOFs represent a promising platform for advanced gas separation technologies and offer a novel approach to integrating optical and adsorption functionalities. Future work will focus on optimizing the linker design and exploring the applicability of these MOFs for CO<sub>2</sub> capture from flue gas streams.

**Key Considerations & Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Specificity:** I've added "where M = varying metal ions" to indicate a family of materials was created. Replace "M" with the actual metal ions if known.
*   **Methodology:** I included details about solvothermal synthesis and the use of X-ray diffraction and gas adsorption isotherms.
*   **Computational Modeling:**  Mentioning this is common in modern MOF research.
*   **Future Work:** A brief statement of future directions is standard.
*   **Journal Targeting:** This abstract is fairly general. If you're targeting a specific journal, I can tailor it further to match their style and scope.
