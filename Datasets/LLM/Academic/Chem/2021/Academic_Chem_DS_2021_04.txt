This investigation explores the influence of oxidative agent selection on the morphological evolution of porous silicon fabricated via metal-assisted chemical etching of p-type substrates. Employing hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate as distinct oxidants, we systematically characterize the resulting architectures through scanning electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Our findings reveal that etchant composition critically directs pore propagation mechanisms: H2O2-based solutions facilitate the development of vertically aligned, independent pore channels with high aspect ratios. Conversely, KMnO4 oxidants promote lateral etching pathways, yielding interconnected, three-dimensional porous networks. Spectroscopic analysis further correlates these structural variations with differential crystallinity degradation and strain profiles within the silicon matrix. These results establish oxidant engineering as a pivotal parameter for tailoring porosity and interface characteristics in semiconductor nanostructures, with significant implications for optoelectronic and sensing applications.
