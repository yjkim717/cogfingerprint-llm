Title: Catalytic Role of Amorphous Solid Water in Formaldehyde Formation via Carbon Atom Reactivity

Abstract:
The astrochemical formation of formaldehyde (H2CO) is a complex process involving the reaction of carbon atoms with water molecules. Recent studies have elucidated the pivotal role of amorphous solid water (ASW) in facilitating this reaction. In 2021, research underscored the mechanistic significance of ASW in catalyzing the reaction between carbon atoms and water, yielding formaldehyde via a proton transfer mechanism. The water-catalyzed process enhances the reactivity of carbon atoms, thereby efficiently forming H2CO. This study highlights the importance of ASW in mediating the reaction, providing insights into the molecular-level interactions governing formaldehyde formation. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the astrochemical processes driving the synthesis of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments, with implications for the origins of prebiotic chemistry. The results demonstrate the catalytic potential of ASW in facilitating key reactions relevant to astrochemical evolution.
