Title: Cavity-Modulated Reaction Kinetics in the Vibrational Strong Coupling Regime: A Non-Markovian Perspective

Abstract:
The vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regime has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to modify ground-state chemical reactivity. In this work, we present a theoretical framework to elucidate the cavity-induced modulation of reaction rate constants within the VSC regime. By incorporating non-Markovian dynamics and cavity radiation modes, our model reveals the intricate interplay between vibrational polaritons and the reaction coordinate. We demonstrate that the cavity-mediated modification of the reaction rate constant arises from the non-Markovian memory effects, which are influenced by the cavity photon lifetime and the vibrational dephasing time. Our results provide a comprehensive understanding of the polariton chemistry in the VSC regime, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that govern cavity-controlled chemistry. The proposed framework offers a versatile tool for predicting and optimizing cavity-modified reaction kinetics, paving the way for the development of novel polaritonic chemistry applications. (2021)
