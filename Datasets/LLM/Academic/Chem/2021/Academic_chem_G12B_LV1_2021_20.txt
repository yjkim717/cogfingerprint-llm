**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polariton chemistry explores the profound impact of strong light-matter interactions on chemical reaction dynamics. Here, we present a theoretical investigation into the influence of cavity frequency on reaction rates within vibrational strong coupling (VSVC) systems. Our analysis builds upon recent advances demonstrating that VSVC can alter reaction pathways and energetics, but specifically addresses the previously less-explored role of the cavityâ€™s electromagnetic environment. We employ a non-Markovian master equation approach to model the coupled molecular-cavity system, accounting for the finite lifetime of polaritons and the inherent non-equilibrium nature of reactive processes.  Results reveal a systematic suppression of reaction rates as the cavity frequency deviates from the molecular vibrational frequency, even when maintaining strong coupling conditions. This suppression arises from a complex interplay between the polariton dispersion, the decoherence induced by the finite cavity linewidth, and the altered vibrational energy landscape experienced by the reacting molecules.  Furthermore, we observe that the degree of rate suppression is sensitive to the initial population distribution of vibrational states. These findings highlight the critical importance of cavity frequency tuning as a means of controlling chemical reactivity in VSVC regimes and offer a pathway toward rationally designed photochemical processes. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms governing polariton-enhanced or -inhibited chemistry, aligning with the growing interest in utilizing cavity quantum electrodynamics for advanced chemical synthesis and control observed since 2020.
