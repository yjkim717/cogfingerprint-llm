**Abstract**

The interplay between light and matter dictates fundamental chemical processes, and recent advancements in optical microcavity technology have opened avenues for manipulating reactivity with unprecedented control. This work presents a theoretical framework elucidating the influence of vibrational strong coupling within optical microcavities on chemical reaction dynamics. Utilizing a non-Markovian dynamical model, we demonstrate that resonant photon frequencies can significantly alter reaction rates, exhibiting a frequency-dependent suppression effect. 

Specifically, the enhanced electromagnetic field confinement within the microcavity promotes strong coupling between vibrational modes of the reacting molecules and the cavity’s quantized electromagnetic field. This coupling fundamentally alters the timescale of chemical transitions, transitioning the system from Markovian to non-Markovian behavior.  Our analysis reveals that at specific photon frequencies corresponding to the molecule’s vibrational transitions, the effective reaction rate is substantially reduced.  

The observed phenomenon stems from the creation of hybrid light-matter states, effectively ‘trapping’ reactants and inhibiting their efficient interaction.  These findings have implications for designing novel photochemical systems and manipulating reaction pathways with tailored optical control. Further investigation into the precise mechanisms governing this frequency-dependent suppression is warranted, potentially paving the way for applications in areas such as selective organic synthesis and advanced material fabrication – a key area of research reported in 2021.
