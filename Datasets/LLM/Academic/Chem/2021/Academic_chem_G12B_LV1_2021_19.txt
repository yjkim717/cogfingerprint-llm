**Abstract**

The pursuit of materials exhibiting dynamic structural responses to external stimuli remains a central challenge in porous materials chemistry. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel metal-organic framework (MOF), designated DUT-140, incorporating a fluorescent linker and demonstrating a unique combination of pressure amplification, structural flexibility, and negative gas adsorption behavior. DUT-140, constructed from [Specific Metal Ion – e.g., Zn(II)] and a carefully selected fluorescent organic ligand [Specific Ligand – e.g., a modified 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid derivative], exhibits a three-dimensional framework architecture readily amenable to guest molecule interaction.  Low-pressure gas adsorption isotherms reveal a distinct negative slope in the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption profile at reduced pressures, indicative of pressure amplification – a phenomenon wherein the local pressure experienced by the adsorbate within the pores is higher than the bulk pressure. Furthermore, *in situ* X-ray diffraction studies demonstrate significant skeletal breathing and framework flexibility upon CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, confirming a dynamic response to guest molecules. The integrated fluorescent properties of DUT-140 allow for real-time monitoring of guest uptake and framework transformations, providing a valuable tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms governing these phenomena. Computational modeling supports the observed pressure amplification, suggesting a correlation between linker flexibility and enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> affinity. These findings highlight DUT-140 as a promising platform for advanced gas separation technologies and offer insights into the design principles for stimuli-responsive porous materials capable of exploiting pressure amplification effects.

**Notes on Choices & Rationale:**

*   **Formal Tone & Vocabulary:** I've used terms like "pursuit," "central challenge," "amenable," "skeletal breathing," "stimuli-responsive," "governing mechanisms" to establish a formal academic voice.
*   **Specificity (with placeholders):** The original summary was quite general. To make it more impactful, I've included placeholders like "[Specific Metal Ion]" and "[Specific Ligand]".  In a real publication, these would be replaced with the actual chemical identities.  This demonstrates a level of detail expected in a research abstract.
*   **Structure:** The abstract follows a logical flow: (1) introduction of the problem/motivation, (2) description of the material and its synthesis, (3) key findings (pressure amplification, flexibility, fluorescence), (4) supporting evidence (XRD, computational modeling), and (5) conclusion highlighting significance and potential applications.
*   **Year Context (2021):** This is reflected in the focus on dynamic materials and advanced separation technologies – areas that were of significant interest in the field around that time.  The mention of "in situ XRD" is also consistent with trends in materials characterization.
*   **Pressure Amplification Explanation:** I've included a brief explanation of what pressure amplification *is* to make the abstract accessible to a broader audience.
*   **Fluorescence Integration:** I’ve emphasized the utility of the fluorescent linker for
