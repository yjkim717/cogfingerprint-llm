This study investigates the catalytic role of amorphous solid water (ASW) in the formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) via carbon atom reactions under interstellar medium conditions. We demonstrate that ASW facilitates a water-catalyzed proton transfer mechanism, significantly enhancing the efficiency of H₂CO synthesis. Quantum chemical calculations reveal that this process proceeds with notably low activation barriers, enabling formaldehyde formation even at cryogenic temperatures. The catalytic function of ASW arises from its ability to stabilize transition states and mediate proton relocation, which are otherwise kinetically hindered in the gas phase. These findings provide critical mechanistic insight into the origin of complex organic molecules in space, underscoring the importance of surface-mediated proton transfer catalysis in interstellar chemistry and its implications for prebiotic chemical evolution.
