Title: Integrating Fluorescent Functionality into Pressure-Amplifying Metal-Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Gas Adsorption Properties

Abstract:
In 2021, the development of novel metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored properties continues to advance the field of porous crystals. This study presents the successful integration of fluorescent functionality into pressure-amplifying MOFs, achieved through the design of a bespoke ligand and the synthesis of isoreticular frameworks. The resulting MOFs exhibit remarkable flexibility and unique adsorption behavior, including the rare phenomenon of negative gas adsorption (NGA). By harnessing the amplified pressure within these frameworks, we demonstrate enhanced gas adsorption properties. The incorporation of fluorescent functionality allows for real-time monitoring of the adsorption process, providing valuable insights into the structural dynamics of these materials. This innovative approach paves the way for the development of advanced MOFs with multifaceted properties, bridging the gap between functional materials and responsive systems.
