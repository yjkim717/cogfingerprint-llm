Title: Investigating the Crystallization and Morphology of H2O, CO2, and CO Ices on Refractory Grains using Transmission Electron Microscopy

Abstract:
The crystallization and morphology of ices formed from H2O, CO2, and CO on refractory grains are crucial in understanding their role in protoplanetary disks. In this study, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to examine the microstructure and morphology of these ices. Our results show that the ices exhibit varying morphologies, ranging from amorphous to crystalline structures, depending on the composition and temperature conditions. The H2O-rich ices displayed a characteristic crystalline structure, while CO2-rich ices formed amorphous aggregates. In contrast, CO-rich ices exhibited a mixed morphology, suggesting a complex crystallization process. Our findings provide insights into the formation and evolution of ices in protoplanetary disks, with implications for understanding the delivery of volatile compounds to planetary bodies. The TEM observations offer a detailed understanding of the ice morphology, shedding light on the complex interactions between ices and refractory grains in astrophysical environments. (2021)
