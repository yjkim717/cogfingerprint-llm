This study investigates the formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) via the reaction of atomic carbon with amorphous solid water (ASW) under conditions relevant to the interstellar medium. We demonstrate that ASW serves not merely as a passive substrate but as an active proton transfer catalyst, significantly reducing the energy barriers for this key astrochemical synthesis pathway. Through a combination of experimental cryogenic surface science techniques and computational quantum chemical calculations, we elucidate the reaction mechanism, wherein water molecules within the ASW matrix facilitate proton rearrangement, enabling efficient C + H₂O → H₂CO conversion. The low activation barriers identified suggest this catalytic process is viable even at the low temperatures (∼10–20 K) characteristic of molecular clouds. These findings underscore the critical, dynamic role of water ice in interstellar chemistry, providing a plausible route for the formation of complex organic molecules in space.
