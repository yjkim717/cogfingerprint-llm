**Abstract**

The heterogeneous nucleation and subsequent morphology of ice remain a critical, yet incompletely understood, process governing the evolution of molecular clouds and the formation of planetary systems. This work presents novel insights into ice crystallization dynamics on refractory silicate grains, utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to characterize the resulting ice morphologies.  Analysis of TEM micrographs reveals a strong correlation between ice crystal habit and the chemical composition of the substrate, suggesting a nuanced interplay between surface chemistry and ice nucleation pathways. Specifically, we observed variations in ice morphology – ranging from columnar to dendritic – dependent on the presence of trace elements incorporated during initial crystallization. These findings indicate that the substrate’s elemental makeup dictates the preferred ice growth mode, potentially influencing the subsequent accretion of ice onto larger bodies within protoplanetary disks.  Further investigation employing advanced spectroscopic techniques will be necessary to elucidate the precise mechanisms driving this compositional dependence and its implications for the broader context of icy planet formation.
