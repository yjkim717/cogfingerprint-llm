>Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract based on the provided summary, aimed at a chemistry audience and reflecting a 2021 timeframe. I've aimed for precision, structure, and a level of detail appropriate for a research publication.  I've also included a few potential expansions based on what would be typical in such a context.  Please review it and let me know if you'd like any adjustments.

**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) continues to offer avenues for addressing critical challenges in gas storage, separation, and catalysis. This research presents the design, synthesis, and characterization of a novel series of fluorescent MOFs, designated DUT-140(M), incorporating a fluorescent core moiety. The core structure was strategically integrated to enable optical monitoring of adsorption behavior and to facilitate investigations into pressure amplification phenomena. Synthesized materials were thoroughly characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, nitrogen sorption analysis, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Our findings demonstrate that DUT-140(M) exhibits unusual negative gas adsorption behavior for select species under specific pressure conditions, a phenomenon potentially linked to framework flexibility and guest-framework interactions. Furthermore, the inherent fluorescence of the MOF allows for *in situ* observation of changes in the local environment upon gas adsorption, providing valuable insights into adsorption mechanisms. This study leverages the combined properties of pressure amplification and fluorescence to provide a unique platform for understanding and manipulating gas adsorption processes. Initial investigations focus on CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, revealing [mention specific findings about CO2, e.g., binding sites or capacity - *this would be added if more detail from the original text existed*]. The observed behavior warrants further exploration towards applications in gas separation technologies and the development of stimuli-responsive materials. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge surrounding multifunctional MOFs and their potential for advanced chemical applications.

**Key improvements and considerations reflected in this abstract:**

*   **Contextualization:** Placed the work within the broader MOF research landscape.
*   **Specificity:** Replaced vague terms ("investigating their adsorption behavior and light absorption") with more precise language (e.g., "optical monitoring of adsorption behavior," "pressure amplification phenomena").
*   **Methodology:** Briefly mentioned key characterization techniques.
*   **Findings:** Highlighted the core finding of negative gas adsorption and linked it to potential structural reasons.
*   **Future Directions:** Indicated potential applications and further research avenues.
*   **Formal Tone:** Used academic phrasing and sentence structure.
*   **Year Context:** The language and references to the "burgeoning field" align with trends in 2021 MOF research.
*   **Placeholder:** I've included a bracketed section where specific findings could be inserted if the original text provided them.
