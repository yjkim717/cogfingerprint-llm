**Abstract**

The advancement of materials chemistry increasingly relies on reproducible and accessible scientific data. This study investigates the critical need for Fair Data (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) practices within the field, specifically concerning the utilization of data repositories.  We argue that robust data repositories are paramount to fostering effective collaboration and accelerating materials discovery.  Challenges remain in ensuring data interoperability across diverse platforms and formats, necessitating standardized metadata schemas and persistent identifiers.  This work highlights the role of proactive data management strategies, including detailed provenance tracking and open access policies, in promoting data reuse and mitigating bias.  Future research should prioritize the development of automated tools to facilitate FAIR data implementation and impact assessment within materials chemistry communities.
