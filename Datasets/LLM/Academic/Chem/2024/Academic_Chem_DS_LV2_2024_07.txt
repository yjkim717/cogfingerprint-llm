This study evaluates the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles within materials chemistry, focusing on specialized data repositories. We analyze how structured data deposition enhances collaborative research and accelerates knowledge discovery by enabling robust data interoperability and reuse. Our 2024 assessment demonstrates that adherence to FAIR guidelines significantly improves experimental reproducibility and facilitates high-throughput screening of material properties. These practices are shown to bridge critical data siloes, fostering an integrated research ecosystem that propels innovation in materials design and optimization.
