This study employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to investigate carbon atom accretion pathways with ammonia within interstellar ice analogues. We demonstrate that sequential hydrogenation reactions following C-addition constitute the dominant mechanism for methylamine (CH3NH2) formation under low-temperature conditions. Our computed reaction energetics reveal a significant kinetic preference for methylamine production over competing channels, with activation barriers consistently below 5 kJ molâˆ’1. These theoretical results were integrated into astrochemical kinetic models, which successfully reproduce observed interstellar methylamine abundances without invoking grain-surface radical recombination pathways. The carbon accretion mechanism thus represents a fundamental formation route for complex organic molecules in dark molecular clouds, providing critical insights into the molecular complexity achievable through non-diffusive processes in icy grain mantles.
