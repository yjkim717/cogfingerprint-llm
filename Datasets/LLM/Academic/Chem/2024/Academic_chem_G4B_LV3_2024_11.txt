**Abstract**

The imperative for robust data management is rapidly escalating within materials chemistry, driven by the need for reproducible research and accelerated innovation. This study examines the critical role of adhering to FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles in this domain. Specifically, we analyze the efficacy of established and emerging data repositories as central infrastructure for fostering collaborative research networks.  Implementation of standardized metadata and controlled vocabularies within these repositories demonstrably improves data discoverability and facilitates efficient resource sharing.  Furthermore, the adoption of FAIR data practices promotes long-term data preservation and enhances the potential for secondary data analysis, ultimately bolstering the impact of materials chemistry research in 2024 and beyond.
