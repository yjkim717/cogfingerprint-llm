**Abstract**

The increasing volume and complexity of materials chemistry research necessitate robust data management strategies to ensure reproducibility and accelerate scientific discovery. This study investigates the critical role of “FAIR” (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles in optimizing research workflows within this discipline. Specifically, we analyze the effectiveness of established data repositories – encompassing both public and specialized platforms – in facilitating the long-term preservation and dissemination of materials characterization data.  Challenges related to data standardization, metadata curation, and equitable resource access are addressed.  Implementing FAIR data practices fosters enhanced collaboration, reduces redundant experimentation, and ultimately promotes a more efficient and scientifically rigorous approach to materials chemistry.  Further investigation into automated FAIRification tools and sustainable data repository infrastructure is warranted to fully realize the potential of data-driven innovation in 2024 and beyond.
