**Abstract**

Recent advancements in quantum dynamics have illuminated the intricate interplay between vibrational modes and chemical kinetics, particularly within complex environments. This study employs time-resolved quantum dynamical calculations to examine the influence of optical cavity fields and solvent interactions on reaction pathways. Specifically, we investigate systems exhibiting vibrational strong coupling, where the dynamics of the vibrating molecule are inextricably linked to the surrounding electromagnetic field. Our findings demonstrate that optical cavities can induce significant modifications to reaction rates and product distributions, effectively altering the equilibrium and non-equilibrium reactivity. Furthermore, solvent effects, modeled through polarizable force fields, are shown to modulate these cavity-mediated changes, impacting the observed reaction kinetics. These results provide a crucial framework for understanding and controlling chemical processes in technologically relevant systems, with implications for areas such as photocatalysis and molecular sensing.
