In this 2024 study, we demonstrate through high-level quantum chemical calculations that carbon atom condensation on ammonia-water interstellar ices provides a viable formation pathway for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) in molecular clouds. Our computational investigations reveal that carbon deposition initiates a hydrogenation network where the CNH₃ radical intermediate exhibits remarkable stability at cryogenic temperatures (10-20 K). This radical persists sufficiently long for successive hydrogenation reactions to proceed, overcoming previous mechanistic challenges in explaining interstellar methylamine abundances. The identified pathway operates efficiently on mixed molecular ices, suggesting carbon condensation represents a previously overlooked astrochemical process. These findings necessitate revision of current astrochemical models to incorporate surface-mediated carbon addition mechanisms alongside traditional gas-phase routes. The proposed formation network provides critical insights into prebiotic nitrogen chemistry in star-forming regions, with implications for understanding molecular complexity in prestellar environments.
