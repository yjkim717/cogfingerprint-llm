Title: Advancing Materials Chemistry through FAIR Data Practices: A Review of Key Repositories and Interoperability Challenges

Abstract:
The accelerating pace of materials chemistry research necessitates the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data practices to enhance collaboration and knowledge sharing. As of 2024, the landscape of scientific data sharing is characterized by a proliferation of data repositories, each with its own strengths and limitations. This review examines the role of prominent data repositories in materials chemistry, such as the Materials Project and the Cambridge Structural Database, in promoting FAIR data principles. We assess the current state of interoperability among these repositories, highlighting challenges and opportunities for improvement. By analyzing the metadata standards, data formats, and APIs employed by these repositories, we identify key areas for development to facilitate seamless data exchange and integration. Our analysis underscores the need for continued investment in FAIR data infrastructure to propel materials chemistry research forward.
