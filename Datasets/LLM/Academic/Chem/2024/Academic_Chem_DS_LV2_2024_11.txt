The implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles is revolutionizing materials chemistry by establishing robust data repositories. This paradigm enhances scientific data sharing, enabling unprecedented cross-correlation of structural, synthetic, and property data. Consequently, researchers can accelerate knowledge discovery through advanced data mining and machine learning approaches applied to these curated datasets. By 2024, the systematic adoption of these practices is demonstrably reducing experimental redundancy and fostering collaborative innovation, thereby establishing a new foundation for predictive materials design and development.
