**Abstract**

The accelerating pace of materials chemistry research necessitates a paradigm shift towards enhanced data management and dissemination. This study investigates the application of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles within the field, recognizing that widespread adoption is crucial for accelerating knowledge discovery and fostering innovation. Current limitations in data sharing practices impede reproducibility, limit the potential for meta-analyses, and hinder the development of predictive models. We explore the existing landscape of materials chemistry data repositories, evaluating their adherence to FAIR guidelines and identifying key barriers to broader implementation. Furthermore, this work proposes strategies for improving data provenance tracking, standardizing metadata schemas, and promoting community-driven curation efforts. Through a combination of literature review and analysis of existing repositories, we highlight the transformative potential of FAIR data to unlock new avenues for materials design, optimization, and ultimately, the advancement of the field. Future research directions focusing on incentivizing FAIR data practices and developing automated data validation tools are also discussed.
