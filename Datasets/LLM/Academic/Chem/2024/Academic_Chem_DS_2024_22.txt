**Title:** Catalytic Nucleation and Self-Limiting Growth of Macromolecular Frameworks in Prebiotic Environments

**Abstract:**

The transition from simple prebiotic monomers to complex, structured macromolecules represents a critical, yet poorly constrained, phase in the origin of life. Current models often fail to account for the dynamic interplay between catalytic formation and competitive fragmentation processes in early Earth environments. This work introduces a novel kinetic-analytical model that conceptualizes the synthesis of protocellular frameworks not as a simple polymerization, but as a self-regulating, autocatalytic nucleation event. We posit that specific mineral surfaces act as catalytic templates, lowering the activation energy for the assembly of lipid-peptide conglomerates. The model demonstrates that the inherent instability of these nascent aggregates under fluctuating physicochemical conditions (e.g., pH, ionic strength) induces a feedback loop; fragmentation does not merely dissipate structure but instead generates secondary nucleation sites, propagating further assembly. This feedback-fragmentation interplay leads to the rapid, coordinated formation of a population of discrete, supramolecular compartments rather than a dilute solution of oligomers. Crucially, the model predicts that under the high monomer concentrations and specific catalytic regimes plausible for hydrothermal vent systems or subaerial pools, this process can yield a dominant population of structurally uniform, robust frameworks. These initial, metastable "seeds" are primed for subsequent chemical evolution, potentially serving as the foundational compartments for the emergence of Darwinian evolution, thereby offering a new theoretical pathway from geochemistry to biochemistry.
