**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments hinges critically upon efficient carbon condensation pathways. This research presents a quantum chemical investigation into the reaction network governing carbon accretion onto ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices, a prevalent constituent of interstellar ices. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we systematically explored the energetics and mechanisms of key condensation steps, focusing on the potential formation of stable, low-temperature products. Our findings reveal methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as a robust intermediate and final product, demonstrating significant stability under simulated interstellar conditions.  Akin to astrochemical kinetics models, this study suggests methylamine’s formation represents a viable route for carbon incorporation, potentially contributing to the chemical complexity observed in molecular clouds.  Further investigation incorporating rotational and vibrational effects is warranted to refine these predictions and assess the influence of additional ice constituents on this fundamental process.
