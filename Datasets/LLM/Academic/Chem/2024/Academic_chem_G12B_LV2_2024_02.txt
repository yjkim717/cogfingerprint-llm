**Abstract**

The chemical complexity observed in interstellar ices necessitates a deeper understanding of the formation pathways for organic molecules within cold, dense astrophysical environments. This study investigates the efficiency of carbon atom (C) accretion onto ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices as a route to nitrile and amine synthesis. Utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations, specifically density functional theory (DFT) with explicitly correlated methods, we examined the reaction network initiated by C addition to various ice constituents. Our findings demonstrate that, contrary to expectations prioritizing simpler nitrile formation (HCN, HNC), the incorporation of a single carbon atom predominantly leads to the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂).

A detailed analysis of reaction energetics reveals that the formation of methylamine is kinetically favored due to a combination of favorable C-N bond formation and subsequent proton/hydrogen transfer steps. These results challenge existing astrochemical models that primarily emphasize nitrile production via C accretion. The implications of this pathway for the abundance of amines in interstellar ices and subsequent gas-phase chemistry are discussed, suggesting a potentially significant role for methylamine as a precursor to more complex nitrogen-bearing molecules in star-forming regions. This work contributes to refining our understanding of the chemical evolution of interstellar ices and the origin of prebiotic molecules.
