Title: Investigating Carbon Accretion in Interstellar Ices: A Quantum Chemical Analysis of Ammonia-Carbon Atom Interactions

Abstract:

The accretion of carbon atoms onto interstellar ices is a crucial process influencing the chemical composition of star-forming regions. This study employs quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the interaction between carbon atoms and ammonia (NH3), a prevalent component of interstellar ices. Our results indicate that the reaction between carbon atoms and ammonia leads to the formation of methylamine (CH3NH2) as the preferred product, via a barrierless pathway. Astrochemical kinetic models incorporating these findings suggest that methylamine can be efficiently synthesized in interstellar environments. The calculated reaction rates and product branching ratios are presented, providing insights into the role of carbon accretion in shaping the chemical evolution of interstellar ices. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex chemistry governing the formation of complex organic molecules in star-forming regions.
