**Abstract**

The imperative for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices is rapidly gaining prominence within materials chemistry research. This study investigates the evolving landscape of data repositories and accessibility strategies crucial for accelerating scientific discovery in the field. Specifically, we analyze the current utilization of key repositories – including [mention 2-3 specific relevant repositories, e.g., Materials Project, PubChem] – and assess their adherence to FAIR principles.  Challenges related to data standardization, metadata curation, and long-term preservation are highlighted.  Effective implementation of FAIR data management not only maximizes resource utilization and minimizes redundancy but also fosters collaborative research and robust validation of materials properties.  Recommendations are offered for enhancing data repository infrastructure and promoting wider adoption of FAIR methodologies within the materials chemistry community, contributing to more reproducible and impactful research outcomes by 2025.
