The burgeoning class of ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) presents a versatile platform for addressing critical challenges in separations science and sustainable energy technologies. This perspective delineates recent advances in the strategic design of iCOFs, emphasizing the pivotal role of their intrinsic charged motifs and ordered nanoporosity. We explore how these structural attributes govern selective ion-exchange and adsorption processes for resource recovery, while also enabling their function as robust scaffolds for electro- and photocatalysis. The discussion critically assesses structure-property relationships underpinning charge-directed mass and energy transport. Finally, we outline emergent research directions, including the integration of stimuli-responsive components and the development of multifunctional iCOF composites, to propel their application in next-generation environmental and energy systems.
