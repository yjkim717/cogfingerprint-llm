**Abstract**

The accelerating pace of materials discovery necessitates a paradigm shift towards enhanced data management and sharing within the field of materials chemistry. This work investigates the critical role of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles in accelerating knowledge discovery and fostering collaborative innovation. We examine the current landscape of materials chemistry data repositories, evaluating their adherence to FAIR standards and identifying key barriers to widespread adoption. Our analysis highlights the potential of standardized metadata schemas, persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs), and robust data governance policies to improve data accessibility and interoperability. Furthermore, we explore emerging trends such as the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence with FAIR-compliant datasets to facilitate predictive modeling and accelerate materials design. This study advocates for a concerted effort involving researchers, funding agencies, and repository providers to prioritize FAIR data practices, ultimately aiming to establish a sustainable and globally connected ecosystem for materials chemistry data, maximizing its scientific and technological impact in the coming years.
