**Abstract**

The imperative for reproducible and impactful research is driving a paradigm shift towards FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles within materials chemistry. This study examines the evolving landscape of data repositories as critical infrastructure for facilitating robust scientific investigation.  We argue that proactive adoption of FAIR standards – encompassing standardized metadata, persistent identifiers, and open access dissemination – is paramount to accelerating materials discovery. Specifically, the interoperability of data across diverse repositories remains a key challenge, necessitating the development of unified data schemas and robust data exchange protocols.  Future research should prioritize the implementation of automated FAIRification workflows and the establishment of comprehensive, community-driven data repositories to maximize the utility of materials science data in 2024 and beyond.
