The implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles is revolutionizing materials chemistry by enabling systematic data curation in specialized repositories. This paradigm shift enhances the reproducibility of complex syntheses and property characterizations, fostering unprecedented cross-institutional collaboration. By structuring heterogeneous datasets with standardized ontologies, these repositories facilitate advanced data mining and machine learning applications, accelerating the discovery of novel functional materials. This contribution argues that the maturation of FAIR-compliant infrastructures is critical for addressing grand challenges in sustainable energy and advanced manufacturing, thereby establishing a new foundation for data-driven scientific inquiry in the field.
