**Abstract**

The influence of vibrational strong coupling on chemical reactivity within optically resonant environments, particularly in the presence of dissipative solvents, represents a burgeoning area of investigation. This work presents a quantum dynamical study leveraging advanced computational techniques to elucidate these complex interactions. Utilizing vibrational strong coupling, we model the dynamics of chemical reactions occurring within an optical cavity, incorporating the effects of a solvent environment exhibiting significant dissipation. Our methodology employs [Specify Quantum Dynamical Method – e.g., Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction – TDCI] to accurately capture the coupled vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom. Preliminary results demonstrate a measurable alteration in reaction rate constants compared to isolated systems, attributed to the cavity-mediated enhancement of vibrational modes. Furthermore, the solvent’s dissipative nature significantly impacts the observed dynamics, necessitating a nuanced understanding of the interplay between radiative and collisional dissipation. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive theoretical framework for manipulating chemical reactivity in photonic systems.
