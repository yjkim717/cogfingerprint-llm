**Abstract**

Recent advancements in astrochemical modeling necessitate a refined understanding of complex organic molecule formation within interstellar environments. This study presents novel quantum chemical calculations examining the condensation of carbon atoms onto ammonia ices, specifically focusing on the pathway leading to methylamine (CH₃NH₂). Utilizing a detailed reaction network, we demonstrate methylamine’s preferential stability compared to alternative condensation products, supported by high-level theoretical methodologies. These findings challenge previous assumptions regarding the dominant intermediates in carbon-nitrogen chemistry within cold interstellar ices. Furthermore, the results are integrated into updated astrochemical models, improving their predictive capabilities for the abundance of methylamine and related species.  The implications extend to interpreting observational data from molecular surveys and refining our understanding of the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks and star-forming regions, particularly with respect to interstellar ices and carbon accretion processes.
