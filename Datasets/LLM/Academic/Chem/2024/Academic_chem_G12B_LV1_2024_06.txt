## Abstract: Carbon Accretion Pathways on Ammonia Ice and the Enhanced Formation of Methylamine in Interstellar Ices

The chemical complexity observed in interstellar ices necessitates a deeper understanding of the pathways leading to the formation of molecular species under cryogenic conditions. This study investigates the impact of carbon accretion onto ammonia (NH₃) ice, a prevalent component of dense molecular clouds, using high-level quantum chemical calculations. Specifically, we explore the energetics and reaction mechanisms governing the incorporation of atomic carbon onto NH₃, focusing on the competition between various product formation routes. Our results demonstrate that carbon addition to NH₃ preferentially leads to the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) over alternative pathways yielding isocyanides (HCN and HNC). This preference arises from the lower activation energy barrier associated with hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group following carbon addition, ultimately stabilizing the methylamine adduct. The calculated reaction energetics strongly suggest that, in the presence of sufficient atomic carbon, methylamine can become a dominant product of carbon accretion on ammonia ice. These findings have significant implications for models of interstellar ice chemistry, providing a mechanistic explanation for the observed abundance of methylamine and highlighting the role of hydrogen abstraction in directing the evolution of complex organic molecules in cold molecular environments.
