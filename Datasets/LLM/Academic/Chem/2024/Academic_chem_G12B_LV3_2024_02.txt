**Abstract**

The formation mechanisms of complex nitrogen-bearing molecules within interstellar ices remain a critical area of astrochemical investigation. This study, utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations, explores the reaction pathways initiated by carbon atom condensation onto ammonia-water ices. Our findings reveal a previously underappreciated route to methylamine (CH3NH2) synthesis, proceeding through a kinetically and thermodynamically favored CNH3 radical intermediate. This newly identified pathway offers an alternative to existing models and suggests that methylamine formation may be more efficient than currently estimated in cold, dense molecular clouds. The implications of these results are significant for refining astrochemical kinetic models and improving our understanding of interstellar molecule abundances.
