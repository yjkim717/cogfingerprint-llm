**Abstract: Accelerating Materials Discovery through FAIR Data Implementation in Chemical Repositories**

The accelerating pace of materials discovery necessitates a paradigm shift towards enhanced data management and sharing within the chemical sciences. This work investigates the critical role of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles in revolutionizing materials chemistry research, specifically focusing on the utility of dedicated data repositories. While experimental and computational materials data generation has increased exponentially, effective knowledge discovery remains hampered by fragmentation, limited accessibility, and a lack of standardized metadata. We propose that robust implementation of FAIR data practices—including persistent identifiers (DOIs), structured metadata schemas adhering to community standards (e.g., Materials Project, Crystallography Open Database), and open access policies—is essential to unlock the full potential of existing materials datasets. This study examines current challenges in repository adoption, including concerns regarding intellectual property and long-term preservation. Furthermore, we outline strategies for incentivizing researchers to contribute high-quality, FAIR-compliant data, and discuss the potential of machine learning algorithms to leverage these resources for predictive materials design and accelerated discovery cycles. Achieving widespread FAIR data adoption represents a key enabler for realizing the promise of data-driven materials science in 2024 and beyond.
