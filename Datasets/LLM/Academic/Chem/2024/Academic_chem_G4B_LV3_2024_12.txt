**Abstract**

Recent advancements in quantum dynamics are increasingly informing our understanding of complex chemical processes, particularly within optically confined environments. This study investigates the influence of vibrational strong coupling on chemical kinetics within specifically engineered optical cavities, employing time-dependent density matrix formalism in 2024. We demonstrate that resonant interactions between vibrational modes and the electromagnetic field significantly alter reaction pathways, leading to observable modifications in rate constants. The incorporation of solvent effects was crucial in modeling realistic conditions, revealing a nuanced interplay between solvation dynamics and cavity-mediated reactivity. These findings suggest a novel approach to manipulating chemical reactivity through tailored optical cavities. Specifically, the observed shifts in reaction timescales offer potential for designing responsive materials and systems. Future research will focus on exploring the applicability of these principles to diverse chemical transformations and characterizing the underlying quantum mechanical mechanisms driving this resonant modification of chemical kinetics.
