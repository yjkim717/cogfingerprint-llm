In this computational astrochemical study, we investigate the non-diffusive reaction mechanisms of atomic carbon on mixed molecular ices composed of ammonia and water, a prevalent component of cold interstellar environments. Utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level of theory, we map the potential energy surfaces for carbon insertion and subsequent hydrogenation pathways. Our results demonstrate that carbon atom condensation directly onto the ice matrix facilitates a highly efficient barrierless route to methanimine (CH2NH), circumventing traditional gas-phase formation bottlenecks. Further microcanonical kinetic analysis reveals that exothermic hydrogenation steps strongly favor the production of methylamine (CH3NH2) as the terminal, saturated amine. Astrochemical modeling, incorporating these new solid-state reaction networks, predicts a methylamine abundance increase of up to two orders of magnitude in prestellar core conditions, providing a crucial missing link for its observed interstellar detection and reshaping our understanding of prebiotic nitrogen chemistry in the cosmos.
