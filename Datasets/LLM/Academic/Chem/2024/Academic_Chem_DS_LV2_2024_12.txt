This study employs quantum dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of vibrational strong coupling within an optical cavity on chemical reaction kinetics. Our analysis demonstrates that the cavity-induced modification of reaction rates is not a universal equilibrium phenomenon but is contingent upon specific non-equilibrium conditions. The results establish that the system must be driven from thermal equilibrium to observe significant kinetic alterations, thereby clarifying a crucial boundary for the collective vibrational strong coupling regime. These findings reconcile divergent experimental observations and provide a fundamental principle for harnessing cavity quantum electrodynamics to control molecular reactivity, with implications for the design of novel photochemical and catalytic processes.
