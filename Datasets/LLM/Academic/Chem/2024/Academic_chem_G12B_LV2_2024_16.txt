**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers novel avenues for manipulating chemical reaction dynamics. This work investigates the impact of resonant cavity modification on chemical kinetics, specifically focusing on the collective vibrational strong coupling (CVS) regime. Utilizing quantum dynamical methods, we demonstrate that significant alterations to reaction rates and product distributions are predominantly observed under non-equilibrium conditions. Our simulations reveal that the pronounced reactivity changes characteristic of CVS are not simply a consequence of equilibrium shifts induced by the cavity field, but rather arise from dynamical effects linked to the non-equilibrium nature of the system. These findings highlight the critical importance of considering system far-from-equilibrium behavior when employing cavity-modified chemical kinetics as a means of controlling chemical processes, opening new perspectives for light-driven chemistry and ultrafast reaction control.
