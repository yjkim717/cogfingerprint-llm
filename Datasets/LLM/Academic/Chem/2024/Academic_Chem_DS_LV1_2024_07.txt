The implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles is revolutionizing data-driven discovery in materials chemistry. This article critically examines the evolving ecosystem of domain-specific data repositories, assessing their capacity to curate and disseminate complex, multi-faceted datasets. We argue that systematic adherence to FAIR guidelines mitigates data fragmentation and enhances the reproducibility of computational and experimental workflows. By facilitating advanced data mining and integration, these practices accelerate the identification of structure-property relationships and enable predictive materials design. Our analysis concludes that robust data stewardship is a critical enabler for next-generation innovation, transforming raw data into a foundational asset for the global research community.
