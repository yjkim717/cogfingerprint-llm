This study employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the carbon accretion mechanism with ammonia within interstellar ice analogues. We demonstrate that the sequential addition of a carbon atom to solid-phase NH₃, followed by hydrogenation, constitutes a highly efficient barrierless pathway for the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂). Our computational results, obtained at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level of theory, identify this route as kinetically and thermodynamically favored over competing isomerization channels. Subsequent integration of these findings into a comprehensive astrochemical kinetic model confirms that this grain-surface reaction is a dominant source of methylamine in cold molecular clouds. This work provides critical mechanistic insight into interstellar prebiotic chemistry, resolving a key synthetic route for a fundamental amine detected in the interstellar medium and establishing carbon atom addition as a pivotal process in molecular complexity growth.
