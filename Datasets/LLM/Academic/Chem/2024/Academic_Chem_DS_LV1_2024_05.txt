In the cold, dense molecular clouds of the interstellar medium, the sequential hydrogenation of simple species on icy grain surfaces is a fundamental process for chemical complexity. This study employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the reaction mechanism and kinetics for the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) via the carbon atom addition pathway to ammonia (NH₃) under astrochemical conditions. Our results confirm that the barrierless addition of a ground-state carbon atom ([³P]) to NH₃, forming the H₂N–CH radical intermediate, is highly exothermic. Subsequent exothermic hydrogenation steps proceed with minimal activation barriers, rendering this pathway highly efficient at cryogenic temperatures. The derived reaction rate constants were incorporated into a comprehensive astrochemical kinetic model, which successfully reproduces the observed solid-state methylamine abundances in regions such as Sgr B2(N). This work establishes carbon accretion on nitrogen-bearing ices as a dominant, non-diffusive formation route for interstellar methylamine, significantly impacting our understanding of prebiotic nitrogen chemistry in the cosmos.
