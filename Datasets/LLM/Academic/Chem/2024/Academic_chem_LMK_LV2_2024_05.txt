Title: Investigating Carbon Accretion on Interstellar Ices: A Quantum Chemical Study of Carbon-Ammonia Interactions

Abstract:
The accretion of carbon atoms onto interstellar ices is a crucial process influencing the chemical evolution of star-forming regions. This study employs quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the interaction between carbon atoms and ammonia (NH3) on interstellar ice surfaces. Using high-level ab initio methods, we explored the potential energy surfaces governing the C-NH3 reaction, identifying key reaction pathways and products. Our findings indicate that the C + NH3 reaction is barrierless, yielding H2CN + H as the primary products. The results are subsequently integrated into astrochemical kinetic models to assess the impact on interstellar ice chemistry. Our simulations demonstrate that the C-NH3 interaction significantly influences the abundance of nitrogen-bearing species in interstellar ices. This work provides new insights into the complex chemistry occurring on interstellar ices, shedding light on the role of carbon accretion in shaping the chemical composition of star-forming regions.
