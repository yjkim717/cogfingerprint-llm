**Abstract**

The expanding frontier of organoselenium chemistry continues to reveal its profound significance in both biological catalysis and synthetic methodology. This perspective delineates recent advances in the design of small-molecule organoselenium catalysts that emulate the sophisticated redox functions of selenoenzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase. Particular focus is given to novel catalytic systems capable of mediating the selective reduction of reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide and lipid hydroperoxides, highlighting their potential in mitigating oxidative stress. Concurrently, the synthetic utility of selenium-directed transformations is explored, with an emphasis on contemporary adaptations of the selenoxide elimination as a powerful tool for alkene synthesis and late-stage functionalization in complex molecule assembly. Despite these promising developments, the translational application of organoselenium compounds in therapeutics remains constrained by challenges pertaining to bioavailability and selective subcellular targeting. This discussion critically assesses these limitations and posits future research directions aimed at engineering next-generation selenium-based catalysts and probes with enhanced efficacy and specificity for biomedical and materials science applications.
