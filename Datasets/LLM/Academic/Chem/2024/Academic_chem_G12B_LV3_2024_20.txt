**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers unprecedented opportunities to manipulate chemical reactivity. This work presents a quantum dynamical investigation of chemically reacting systems exhibiting vibrational strong coupling within optical cavities. Our simulations reveal that, while thermodynamic equilibrium rate constants remain invariant under strong coupling, non-equilibrium reactivity profiles are demonstrably altered through resonant interactions. Specifically, we observe a tunable modification of reaction timescales dependent on cavity parameters. These findings suggest the potential for designing novel experimental protocols to control chemical kinetics and highlight crucial avenues for future research, including the exploration of dissipative effects and the development of robust theoretical frameworks for accurately predicting resonant reactivity enhancements in coupled molecular systems.
