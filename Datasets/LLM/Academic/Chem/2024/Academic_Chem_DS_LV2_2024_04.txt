This study employs advanced quantum dynamical methods to investigate chemical kinetics under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) within an optical cavity. We demonstrate that the experimentally observed rate modifications emerge predominantly under non-equilibrium conditions, where the molecular ensemble is not in thermal equilibrium with the cavity photon mode. Our theoretical framework explicitly treats the collective regime, revealing that the cavity-induced effect on reaction rates is a quintessentially quantum phenomenon, driven by the formation of light-matter hybrid states (vibrational polaritons). These findings reconcile previous experimental observations with theory, establishing that equilibrium treatments are insufficient. This work provides a fundamental principle for cavity-modified chemistry, with significant implications for controlling molecular reactivity through quantum light-matter interactions.
