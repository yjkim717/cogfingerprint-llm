In the domain of computational chemistry, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations remain indispensable for probing atomic-scale phenomena, yet their computational expense often limits the scope and timescale of investigations. This work introduces a novel surrogate modeling framework that synergizes machine learning (ML) with traditional force-field methods to substantially accelerate MD workflows. By strategically caching and re-evaluating local atomic environments across sequential simulation steps, the approach circumvents redundant energy and force computations without compromising the fidelity of the sampled Boltzmann distribution. Our implementation demonstrates a marked reduction in computational cost, achieving up to an order-of-magnitude speedup relative to conventional simulations for condensed-phase systems. Crucially, the method preserves thermodynamic consistency and dynamic properties, enabling access to longer timescales and larger systems while retaining physical accuracy. This advancement paves the way for more efficient exploration of complex molecular processes, from biomolecular conformational changes to materials nucleation events, broadening the applicability of high-fidelity MD in predictive chemical research.
