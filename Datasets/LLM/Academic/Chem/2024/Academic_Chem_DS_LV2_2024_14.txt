Employing high-level quantum chemical calculations, this study elucidates the low-temperature reaction dynamics of carbon atom addition to ammonia (NH₃) within interstellar ice analogues. Our results demonstrate that the initial formation of aminomethyl radical (•CH₂NH₂) is barrierless, providing a highly efficient pathway for complex organic molecule synthesis under dark cloud conditions. Subsequent hydrogenation steps, involving quantum tunneling-enhanced mechanisms, are shown to selectively produce methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as the dominant molecular product. This mechanistic pathway is incorporated into a refined astrochemical kinetic model, which successfully reconciles the observed methylamine abundances in star-forming regions with theoretical predictions. The findings underscore the critical role of carbon accretion reactions in interstellar ices as a fundamental source of prebiotic nitrogen-bearing organics, challenging previous assumptions that attributed their formation primarily to photon- or radiation-driven processes.
