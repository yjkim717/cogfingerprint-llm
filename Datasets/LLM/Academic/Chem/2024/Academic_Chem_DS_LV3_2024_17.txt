In this study, we employ high-level quantum chemical calculations to investigate the mechanistic pathways of carbon condensation on ammonia-doped interstellar ice analogues, revealing a novel route for the formation of methanimine (CH2NH) and its subsequent hydrogenation to methylamine (CH3NH2). Our computational results, obtained at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level of theory, demonstrate that barrierless carbon atom addition to ammonia initiates a radical-mediated network, efficiently bypassing traditional gas-phase reaction bottlenecks. The identified pathways exhibit significantly lower activation energies compared to previously proposed mechanisms involving HCN or H2CO hydrogenation. Subsequent integration of these kinetic parameters into a state-of-the-art astrochemical model of a cold molecular cloud (TMC-1) demonstrates a marked increase in predicted methylamine abundances, aligning more closely with recent observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope. These findings fundamentally revise our understanding of interstellar nitrogen chemistry, establishing carbon condensation on icy grain mantles as a critical, non-equilibrium process for the synthesis of complex prebiotic molecules in the interstellar medium.
