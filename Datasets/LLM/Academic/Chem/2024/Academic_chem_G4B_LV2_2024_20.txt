**Abstract**

The interplay between vibrational dynamics and chemical kinetics within optical cavities remains a significant challenge in contemporary photochemistry. This research leverages advanced quantum mechanical simulations to explore the impact of vibrational strong coupling on reaction rates in systems incorporating a dissipative solvent environment. Specifically, we investigate how coupling between vibrational modes of reactant molecules and the optical cavityâ€™s resonant frequencies modifies the photochemical transition pathways. The inclusion of a solvent, characterized by its inherent dissipation mechanisms, introduces further complexity, influencing both the excited-state lifetime and the overall reaction efficiency. Our findings, presented in 2024, demonstrate a clear correlation between the strength of vibrational coupling and observable changes in chemical kinetics. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of light-matter interactions and provides a framework for designing more efficient photochemical processes utilizing tailored optical cavities and solvent environments.
