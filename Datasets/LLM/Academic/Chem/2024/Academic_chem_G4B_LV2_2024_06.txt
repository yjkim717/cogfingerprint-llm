**Abstract: Enhanced Methylamine Production via Carbon-Ammonia Ice Interactions – Implications for Early Planetary Chemistry**

This research presents a novel investigation into the fundamental chemical pathways governing carbon incorporation within ammonia ice, a prevalent constituent of interstellar ices. Utilizing quantum chemical calculations, we examined the reaction kinetics between elemental carbon and ammonia (NH₃) under simulated interstellar conditions. Our computational analysis reveals that methylamine (CH₃NH₂) emerges as the thermodynamically favored product, exhibiting significantly greater stability compared to alternative carbon-nitrogen adducts. 

This discovery challenges prevailing astrochemical models, which often predict lower methylamine yields in such environments.  The observed preference for methylamine formation suggests a potentially more efficient mechanism for carbon accretion onto icy planetesimals during the early stages of solar system formation. Furthermore, the identified pathway highlights the importance of considering methylamine as a key precursor molecule in the synthesis of more complex organic compounds, contributing to the chemical diversity observed in protoplanetary disks. Future work will focus on validating these findings through detailed astrochemical modeling incorporating these revised reaction rates.
