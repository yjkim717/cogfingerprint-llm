Of particular relevance to the molecular complexity of interstellar ices is the formation of small organic nitrogen-bearing species, such as methylamine (CH₃NH₂), a potential precursor to prebiotic molecules. This computational investigation employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the reaction mechanism and kinetics of carbon atom addition to solid-phase ammonia (NH₃) under cryogenic conditions. We demonstrate that the initial barrierless formation of the aminomethyl radical (•CH₂NH₂) is exothermic and proceeds efficiently. Subsequent hydrogenation steps via quantum tunneling-mediated reactions on ice surfaces are shown to be the dominant pathway for converting this radical intermediate into methylamine. The derived reaction rates and branching ratios have been incorporated into a state-of-the-art astrochemical kinetic model. Our results confirm that this C + NH₃ pathway is a significant, non-radiative source of methylamine in dark molecular clouds, reconciling observed abundances and underscoring the critical role of atom addition reactions in interstellar grain-surface chemistry.
