This study employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the mechanistic pathways of carbon atom addition to ammonia within interstellar ice analogues. Our results demonstrate that sequential hydrogenation represents the dominant low-temperature reaction channel, with methylamine (CH₃NH₂) identified as the thermodynamically and kinetically favored product. The calculated energy barriers for the key hydrogenation steps are significantly lower than those for alternative radical-radical recombination pathways, indicating preferential formation under typical molecular cloud conditions (T = 10–20 K). Subsequent integration of these kinetic parameters into a comprehensive astrochemical model confirms that this mechanism can account for observed methylamine abundances in star-forming regions. These findings resolve longstanding questions regarding interstellar methylamine formation and underscore the critical role of carbon accretion reactions in the molecular complexity of interstellar ices, providing fundamental data for models of prebiotic chemistry.
