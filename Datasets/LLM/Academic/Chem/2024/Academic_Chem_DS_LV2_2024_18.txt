This study investigates the fundamental reaction pathways governing carbon atom condensation with ammonia in interstellar ice analogues through high-level quantum chemical calculations. We demonstrate that barrierless carbon addition to ammonia initiates a sequential hydrogenation mechanism, ultimately yielding methylamine as the dominant stable product. Our computational results reveal that methylamine formation proceeds efficiently even at cryogenic temperatures, with no significant kinetic barriers along the minimum energy pathway. These findings provide crucial mechanistic insights into the astrochemical synthesis of complex organic molecules in dark molecular clouds. When incorporated into astrochemical kinetic models, our calculated rate constants and branching ratios significantly improve predictions of methylamine abundances observed in star-forming regions. This work establishes carbon atom reactions as a viable non-radical pathway for amine functionalization in interstellar ices, advancing our understanding of molecular complexity in prebiotic environments.
