Of particular relevance to prebiotic chemistry is the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) within interstellar ices. This study investigates the fundamental reaction pathway of carbon atom addition to solid-state ammonia (NH₃) under cryogenic conditions, a process central to carbon accretion. Utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations, we mapped the potential energy surface to identify the most kinetically and thermodynamically favorable routes. Our results demonstrate that the initial formation of aminomethyl radical (•CH₂NH₂) is barrierless, followed by exothermic hydrogenation steps. Contrary to alternative isomerization channels, sequential hydrogen addition leads directly to methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as the dominant, low-energy product. These mechanistic insights were subsequently integrated into a refined astrochemical kinetic model. The model confirms methylamine's efficient formation in dark molecular clouds, significantly enhancing its predicted interstellar abundance and reinforcing its role as a potential precursor to more complex nitrogen-bearing species in star-forming regions.
