This study employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the mechanism of carbon accretion onto ammonia within interstellar ice analogues. We demonstrate that sequential carbon atom addition and hydrogenation pathways represent the dominant low-temperature route to methylamine formation. Our computational results reveal a negligible activation barrier for the initial C + NH₃ reaction, proceeding via an insertion mechanism to form H₂C–NH₂, which subsequently undergoes rapid hydrogenation. Kinetic modelling incorporating these theoretical findings confirms methylamine as the principal product, with abundances consistent with astronomical observations toward quiescent clouds. These results provide critical mechanistic insight into interstellar amine formation, resolving longstanding questions regarding nitrogen-bearing complex organic molecule genesis in cold dark clouds. The identified pathway underscores the fundamental role of radical-mediated solid-state chemistry in driving molecular complexity in star-forming regions.
