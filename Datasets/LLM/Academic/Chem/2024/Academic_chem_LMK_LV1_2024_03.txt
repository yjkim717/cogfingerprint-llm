Title: Advancing Materials Chemistry through FAIR Data Practices: A Critical Examination of Data Repositories

Abstract:
The accelerating pace of materials discovery in chemistry necessitates the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data practices to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration. In 2024, the materials chemistry community continues to grapple with the challenges of data-intensive research, underscoring the need for robust data repositories. This study examines the current landscape of scientific data sharing in materials chemistry, with a focus on key data repositories and their adherence to FAIR principles. We assess the role of these repositories in promoting data-driven discovery, highlighting best practices and identifying areas for improvement. By elucidating the interplay between FAIR data practices and materials chemistry research, this work aims to inform the development of more effective data-sharing strategies, ultimately driving innovation and accelerating the discovery of novel materials with tailored properties.
