**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon atoms accreted onto ammonia-rich interstellar ice mantles represents a critical non-diffusive pathway for the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in dense molecular clouds. In this study, we employ high-level quantum chemical calculations, including coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)] with augmented correlation-consistent basis sets, to map the reaction network initiated by C-addition to NH₃. Our results elucidate a barrierless pathway for the sequential hydrogenation of the C–NH₃ adduct, leading directly to the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂). The identified mechanism proceeds through a carbene-like intermediate, with the initial C–N bond formation identified as the rate-determining step under cryogenic conditions. These findings provide a robust, quantum-mechanically validated route for methylamine formation, resolving longstanding uncertainties in astrochemical models regarding its gas-phase abundance and solid-state origin. This work underscores the necessity of incorporating precise surface reaction energetics into astrochemical networks to accurately predict the molecular inventory of star-forming regions.
