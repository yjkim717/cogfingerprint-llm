**Abstract**

The accelerating pace of materials chemistry research necessitates robust data management strategies to foster reproducibility and accelerate knowledge discovery. This study examines the current landscape of data sharing practices within the field, specifically evaluating the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles across prominent materials data repositories. We analyze repository architectures, metadata standards, and data access policies to assess their efficacy in promoting data sharing and reuse. Our findings reveal both significant advancements and persistent challenges regarding FAIR adoption, including inconsistencies in metadata description and limitations in data provenance tracking. This work argues that continued investment in standardized data infrastructure, coupled with incentivizing researcher adherence to FAIR guidelines, is crucial for maximizing the scientific return on materials data and driving innovation in 2024 and beyond.
