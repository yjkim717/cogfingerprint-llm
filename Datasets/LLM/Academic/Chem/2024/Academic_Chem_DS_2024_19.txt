The burgeoning class of ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) represents a paradigm shift in the design of functional crystalline porous materials. By integrating ionic functionalities directly within their robust, ordered scaffolds, iCOFs offer unparalleled opportunities for targeted ion exchange and separation processes. This review systematically explores the latest synthetic methodologies for tailoring ionic site density and distribution, which critically govern performance in electro- and photocatalytic energy conversion systems. We elucidate the fundamental adsorption and transport mechanisms, including electrostatic interactions and host-guest chemistry, that underpin the selective capture of specific ions from complex matrices. The discussion extends to emerging applications in next-generation energy storage and environmental remediation, highlighting the unique synergy between structural precision and ionic activity that positions iCOFs as transformative platforms for advanced chemical separations and sustainable energy technologies.
