**Abstract**

The circumstellar envelopes of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (C-rich AGB) stars represent dynamic chemical reactors, where molecular complexity evolves under non-equilibrium conditions. This investigation probes the molecular inventory within the circumstellar environment of the C-rich AGB system CIT 6, a source known for its complex morphology. Utilizing high-resolution submillimeter spectroscopy from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we have spatially resolved the distributions of key carbon-bearing molecules. Our analysis reveals a pronounced chemical differentiation; the inner wind is dominated by the parent species CS and SiS, while the outer, cooler layers of the circumstellar envelope exhibit a significant enhancement of long carbon-chain radicals, notably C₄H and C₆H. Local thermodynamic equilibrium modeling of the observed line intensities provides robust fractional abundance estimates, indicating that these carbon chains are several orders of magnitude more abundant than predicted by standard thermal equilibrium chemistry. These findings strongly implicate the role of photochemistry driven by interstellar ultraviolet radiation in the outer envelope, alongside potential shock-induced chemistry in a hypothesized binary-induced spiral structure. The work underscores the critical influence of both radiative and dynamical processes in shaping the complex molecular output of evolved stellar systems.
