**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments remains a central challenge in astrochemistry. This work investigates a proposed mechanism for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) synthesis, predicated on the condensation of carbon atoms onto ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices. Utilizing high-resolution quantum chemical calculations, we assessed the energetics and stability of various carbon-containing species formed via sequential addition to the ice surface. Specifically, we modeled the abstraction of hydrogen from NH₃ and H₂O, generating reactive carbon radicals. Subsequent reactions demonstrated a pronounced propensity for these radicals to condense onto the ice, ultimately yielding methylamine as a thermodynamically favored product.  These findings are incorporated into astrochemical models, suggesting that this pathway represents a significant, and previously underappreciated, contributor to interstellar methylamine abundance.  Further research will focus on extending this investigation to explore the formation of more complex building blocks.
