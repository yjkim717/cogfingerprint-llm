**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments remains a central challenge in prebiotic chemistry. This research presents novel quantum chemical calculations investigating a previously unexplored reaction pathway for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) synthesis, specifically focusing on the addition of carbon to ammonia (NH₃). Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) methodologies, we demonstrate the thermodynamic stability of methylamine as a product of this carbon accretion process, contrasting it with established mechanistic proposals. Our calculations reveal a significant barrier to methylamine formation via conventional routes, while the proposed pathway exhibits a substantially lower activation energy. Furthermore, the resulting reaction network is amenable to incorporation within existing astrochemical models, suggesting a potentially more prevalent role for this mechanism in the formation of interstellar ices. These findings, informed by interstellar ice composition and supported by quantum chemical validation, offer a refined perspective on the chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks and the delivery of prebiotic precursors to nascent planetary systems.
