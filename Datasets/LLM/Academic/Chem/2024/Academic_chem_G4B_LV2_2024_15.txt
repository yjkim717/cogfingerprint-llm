**Abstract**

The imperative for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices is rapidly gaining prominence within materials chemistry research. This study investigates the evolving landscape of data repositories and accessibility strategies critical to advancing scientific progress in the field.  Traditional research models, reliant on opaque data management, impede reproducibility and collaborative innovation. We argue that proactive adoption of FAIR principles—specifically concerning data provenance, standardized metadata, and open access—is now essential.  This work highlights the utility of curated repositories, such as [mention a specific example if possible, e.g., Materials Project], alongside the necessity for clear data documentation.  Ultimately, prioritizing FAIR data infrastructure will optimize resource utilization and foster a more robust and transparent scientific ecosystem within materials chemistry by 2024.
