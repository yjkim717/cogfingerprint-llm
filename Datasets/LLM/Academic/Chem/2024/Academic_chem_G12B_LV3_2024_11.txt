**Abstract:**

The accelerating pace of materials chemistry research necessitates robust data management strategies to maximize knowledge discovery and accelerate innovation. This study examines the practical application of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles within the field, specifically evaluating the efficacy of prominent materials data repositories. Our analysis highlights the critical role these repositories play in fostering scientific data sharing, addressing challenges related to metadata standardization and data provenance.  We argue that widespread adoption of FAIR practices is paramount for unlocking the full potential of existing datasets and enabling data-driven materials design.  Future directions include developing automated FAIR compliance tools and incentivizing researchers to contribute to and utilize these increasingly valuable resources.
