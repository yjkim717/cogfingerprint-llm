**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments hinges critically on the condensation of simple precursors onto icy substrates. This work presents a quantum chemical investigation into the carbon condensation pathways occurring on NH₃-H₂O ices, focusing on the influence of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as a key product. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we explored reaction mechanisms involving carbon atoms and ammonia, identifying a stable radical intermediate – a methylamino radical – as a pivotal step.  Our results demonstrate that methylamine formation is statistically favored compared to alternative carbon condensation products under the specified conditions.  Furthermore, astrochemical kinetics modeling, informed by these quantum chemical insights, suggests that methylamine’s prevalence on interstellar ices, particularly those rich in carbonaceous interstellar ices, warrants further investigation.  This study contributes to a growing understanding of the chemical complexity achievable in the cold interstellar medium, potentially impacting models of prebiotic chemistry.
