**Abstract**

The accelerating pace of materials chemistry research necessitates a fundamental shift toward robust data management practices. This study examines the burgeoning importance of “FAIR” data principles – Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable – within the field. Specifically, we investigate the increasing adoption of dedicated data repositories as critical infrastructure for disseminating and leveraging materials science datasets. Challenges remain regarding data standardization and metadata harmonization, hindering true interoperability.  We argue that proactive implementation of FAIR guidelines, alongside standardized data formats and comprehensive documentation, is paramount to maximizing the scientific impact of materials research.  Future work will focus on developing automated workflows to facilitate FAIR data curation and promote wider adoption across diverse research communities, ultimately accelerating discovery and innovation in the sector.
