**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments hinges critically on the processing of interstellar ices. This research investigates the carbon condensation pathways occurring on NH₃-H₂O ices, employing a combined approach of quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical kinetics modeling. Specifically, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were utilized to determine the energetics and stability of intermediate species formed during carbon oligomerization. Our analysis reveals that methylamine (CH₃NH₂) emerges as a remarkably stable product, characterized by a significantly lowered activation energy for its formation relative to competing pathways.  This observation challenges prevailing models of early solar nebula chemistry and suggests a potentially more efficient route for the synthesis of simple amines in cold, dark molecular clouds.  Further investigation into the influence of ice composition and temperature on methylamine formation is warranted, employing kinetic simulations to constrain the observed abundances.
