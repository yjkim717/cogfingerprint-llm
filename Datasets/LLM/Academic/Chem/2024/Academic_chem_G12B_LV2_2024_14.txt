**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments remains a central question in astrochemistry. A key pathway for COM synthesis involves the accretion of atoms onto pre-existing molecular ices, particularly those abundant on dust grains in molecular clouds. This study investigates, through high-level quantum chemical calculations, the fundamental reaction of carbon atom addition to ammonia (NH₃), a ubiquitous and observationally supported constituent of interstellar ices. Utilizing explicitly correlated methods within the framework of density functional theory, we explored the potential energy surface of this reaction, focusing on the dominant product pathways. Our results demonstrate that the addition of a carbon atom to ammonia predominantly yields methylamine (CH₃NH₂), with significantly lower yields observed for alternative isomeric products. The calculated reaction energetics, including activation barriers and product relative energies, are presented and discussed in the context of interstellar ice temperatures (10-30 K). These findings provide crucial data for refining astrochemical models aiming to accurately predict the abundance of methylamine and related amines in star-forming regions. This work underscores the importance of detailed quantum chemical investigations in elucidating the chemical processes responsible for the observed complexity of interstellar molecular clouds and contributes to a more robust understanding of the chemical origins of life.
