Title: Enhancing Materials Chemistry Research through FAIR Data Practices and Repositories

Abstract:
The accelerating pace of materials chemistry research necessitates the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data practices to facilitate knowledge discovery and scientific collaboration. This study examines the current state of FAIR-compliant data repositories in materials chemistry, assessing their efficacy in promoting data sharing, reuse, and integration. By analyzing existing repositories and identifying best practices, we provide a framework for optimizing data management in materials chemistry, ultimately advancing research outcomes and fostering innovation in the field (2024).
