**Abstract**

The chemical complexity of interstellar ices is a crucial factor in understanding the origin of organic molecules in star-forming regions. This study investigates the low-temperature reaction pathways leading to nitrogen-containing organic compounds within these ices, specifically focusing on the carbon accretion process onto ammonia (NH₃). Utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations, including density functional theory (DFT) and explicitly correlated methods, we explored the energetics and reaction kinetics of carbon atom addition to NH₃ and subsequent isomerization pathways. Our results demonstrate a significant preference for the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) over alternative products such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and cyanate (HNC) under astrophysically relevant conditions.  Analysis of potential energy surfaces reveals that the formation of CH₃NH₂ proceeds through a kinetically favorable route, benefiting from a relatively low activation energy barrier. These findings are integrated into a preliminary astrochemical kinetic model to assess the impact of this reaction on the abundance of methylamine in interstellar ice mantles. The implications of these results for the broader chemical network within interstellar ices and the potential for forming more complex nitrogenous molecules are discussed.
