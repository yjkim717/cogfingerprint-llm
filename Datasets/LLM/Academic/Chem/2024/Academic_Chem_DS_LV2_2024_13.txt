This study employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the mechanism of carbon accretion reactions within interstellar ice analogues. We demonstrate that sequential carbon atom addition to ammonia (NH₃), followed by hydrogenation, constitutes a viable low-temperature pathway for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) formation. Our computational results, obtained at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level of theory, reveal negligible activation barriers for the initial C + NH₃ step and subsequent H-atom addition reactions under dark cloud conditions (T ≈ 10 K). The newly determined reaction rates and branching ratios were incorporated into a state-of-the-art astrochemical kinetic model. The simulation outputs show a significant enhancement in the predicted gas-phase methylamine abundance, achieving closer alignment with recent observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope. This work establishes carbon addition as a critical non-energetic processing route, fundamentally revising our understanding of interstellar complex organic molecule synthesis in icy grain mantles.
