**Abstract**

The formation of complex nitrogen-bearing molecules in interstellar ices remains a critical area of astrochemical investigation. This study presents quantum chemical calculations exploring the reaction pathways of carbon atom condensation within ammonia-rich ices, a prevalent environment in cold molecular clouds. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of carbon atoms into ammonia ice preferentially yields methylamine (CH₃NH₂) over simpler nitrile isomers, such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and cyanogen (HNC). These findings challenge existing astrochemical kinetic models that often overemphasize nitrile formation. The calculated reaction rates and product distributions provide crucial data for refining these models, leading to a more accurate representation of methylamine abundance observed in star-forming regions. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the chemical complexity arising from simple precursors in the interstellar medium, with implications for prebiotic chemistry.
