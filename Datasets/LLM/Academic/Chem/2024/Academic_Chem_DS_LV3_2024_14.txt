In the evolving field of astrochemistry, the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) on interstellar ice mantles remains a central research focus. This study employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to investigate carbon condensation on mixed NH₃–H₂O ices as a novel mechanism for methanimine (CH₂NH) and methylamine (CH₃NH₂) synthesis. Our computational results reveal that sequential hydrogenation of condensed carbon atoms initiates efficient reaction networks, bypassing traditional gas-phase routes. Crucially, kinetic and thermodynamic analyses identify methylamine as the predominant and thermodynamically favored stable product under low-temperature, dense interstellar cloud conditions. These findings necessitate a revision of existing astrochemical models, which have historically underrepresented grain-surface pathways. By demonstrating the efficacy of this alternative formation route, our work provides critical insights into the molecular inventory of star-forming regions and the prebiotic chemical inventory available for planetary system formation.
