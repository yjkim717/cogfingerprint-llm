Here's an academic abstract inspired by the provided summary and keywords, written in a formal style suitable for a chemistry publication (circa 2024):

**Abstract**

Recent advancements in cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offer unprecedented opportunities to probe and manipulate chemical reaction dynamics. This work presents a novel application of quantum dynamical simulations to model chemical kinetics within systems exhibiting vibrational strong coupling to an optical cavity. Our findings demonstrate that, in the thermodynamic limit, equilibrium reactivity remains largely unaffected by the presence of the cavity field. However, we observe a significant modification of non-equilibrium dynamics, specifically demonstrating resonant cavity-induced alterations to reaction pathways and rates when the system is driven far from equilibrium. These results highlight the potential for cQED to act as a tunable control parameter influencing chemical reactivity, opening avenues for exploring non-equilibrium chemical processes and potentially enabling novel catalytic strategies.



I aimed for a tone and structure consistent with typical chemistry abstracts, including a clear statement of the problem, methodology, key findings, and potential implications.
