**Abstract**

The imperative for reproducible research is driving a paradigm shift within materials chemistry, necessitating the widespread adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. This study investigates the evolving landscape of data repositories critical to fostering collaboration and accelerating materials discovery. We analyze the current state of established repositories, evaluating their adherence to FAIR guidelines and assessing their impact on data accessibility for researchers. Specifically, we explore the technical and logistical challenges associated with implementing robust data sharing practices, considering metadata standards and data formats.  The increasing reliance on centralized and federated data repositories represents a crucial step towards enhancing the transparency and reliability of materials science research in 2024, ultimately promoting more efficient and impactful scientific endeavors.
