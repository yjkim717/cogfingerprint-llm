This study employs advanced quantum dynamics simulations to elucidate the conditions governing cavity-modified chemical kinetics under vibrational strong coupling (VSC). Our analysis demonstrates that significant alterations to reaction rates are not a universal consequence of VSC but are strictly contingent upon the system operating within the collective regime and under non-equilibrium conditions. These findings reconcile disparate experimental observations by establishing a rigorous theoretical framework, delineating that the dissipative nature of the driven-dressed states is essential for manifesting kinetic effects. This work provides critical design principles for polaritonic chemistry, steering future experimental efforts toward systems where these specific criteria are met to harness cavity-induced control over molecular transformations.
