**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of organoselenium chemistry continues to unveil the intricate mechanisms by which selenium-centered motifs mediate critical redox transformations. A principal focus of contemporary research involves the biomimetic design of small-molecule catalysts that replicate the sophisticated function of selenoenzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase. These synthetic systems exploit the unique redox activity of the selenium atom, facilitating the efficient reduction of reactive oxygen species like hydrogen peroxide and hydroperoxides. Concurrently, the synthetic utility of organoselenium compounds is exemplified by reactions such as the selenoxide elimination, a key step in constructing complex olefinic architectures. Despite these advances, significant challenges persist in translating this catalytic proficiency into viable pharmacological agents. Current investigations are directed toward enhancing the selectivity and bioavailability of organoselenium-based therapeutics while mitigating potential off-target effects. This perspective highlights recent progress in elucidating novel catalytic cycles and explores emerging strategies to overcome the translational barriers that have historically limited the clinical application of organoselenium compounds.
