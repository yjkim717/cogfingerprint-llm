In 2024, the integration of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data practices in materials chemistry research is paramount. By implementing standardized data repositories, researchers can facilitate scientific collaboration and accelerate knowledge discovery. FAIR data practices enhance the reproducibility and validity of research findings, fostering a culture of transparency and openness. As the field continues to evolve, the adoption of FAIR principles is poised to revolutionize materials chemistry research, enabling the development of novel materials and applications through data-driven insights and interdisciplinary collaboration.
