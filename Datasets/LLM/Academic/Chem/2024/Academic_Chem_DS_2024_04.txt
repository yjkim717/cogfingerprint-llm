In this investigation, we explore the manifestation of Fano-type quantum interference in lead-halide perovskite thin films, employing polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy as the primary analytical probe. The asymmetric line shapes observed in the low-frequency vibrational spectrum are quantitatively analyzed to elucidate the underlying coupling mechanisms between discrete longitudinal optical phonon modes and a broad electronic continuum. Our results demonstrate that the extracted Fano parameters are highly sensitive to variations in crystallographic phase and the density of free carriers, which are modulated through controlled stoichiometric engineering. This sensitivity provides a novel spectroscopic fingerprint for characterizing electron-phonon interactions, a critical determinant of charge carrier dynamics and recombination pathways in these materials. The findings establish Raman-based Fano resonance analysis as a powerful, non-invasive tool for probing fundamental photophysical processes in next-generation optoelectronic semiconductors, with direct implications for the rational design of high-performance solar cells and light-emitting devices.
