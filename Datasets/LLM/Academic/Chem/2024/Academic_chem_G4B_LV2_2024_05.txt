**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar ices represents a fundamental process in the prebiotic chemical evolution of planetary systems. This study presents novel insights into carbon atom condensation mechanisms on ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices, utilizing a combined approach of astrochemical modeling and high-level quantum chemical calculations. Specifically, we explored the thermal and photochemical pathways leading to carbonaceous species within these ices, focusing on the potential for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) formation.  Computational investigations, employing density functional theory (DFT), systematically assessed the stability of various proposed intermediates, ultimately demonstrating that methylamine emerges as the thermodynamically favored product under relevant interstellar conditions.  These findings challenge previous assumptions regarding the dominant carbonaceous species formed in these environments.  Furthermore, the results contribute to refined astrochemical models, providing a more accurate prediction of the carbon inventory within interstellar ices and influencing our understanding of the delivery of organic molecules to nascent planetary cores. Future work will incorporate rotational and vibrational effects to further constrain the reaction pathways.
