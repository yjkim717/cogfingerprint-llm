**Abstract**

The design of artificial molecular machines exhibiting coordinated multiaxial motion remains a pivotal challenge in supramolecular chemistry. This investigation details the synthesis and photophysical characterization of a novel class of bridged dithienylcyclopentene-based molecular motors. Upon irradiation with visible light (Î» = 450 nm), these systems undergo a unidirectional, four-step rotary cycle. Crucially, time-resolved spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the rotational trajectory of the upper hemisphere is not independent but is intrinsically coupled to a correlated, asynchronous motion within the lower stator framework. This dynamic interplay is mediated by a conformationally gated energy landscape featuring two distinct metastable intermediates. The presence of this double metastable state facilitates a relay of conformational strain, effectively enabling mechanical communication between the motor's subunits and preventing thermal randomization. This work, conducted in 2024, establishes a new design paradigm for achieving complex, coordinated dynamics in synthetic molecular systems, with significant implications for the development of advanced nanoscale actuators and information processing materials.
