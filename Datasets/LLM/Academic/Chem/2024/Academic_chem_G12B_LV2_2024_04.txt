## Abstract: Cavity-Modified Chemical Kinetics and Reactivity Tuning via Vibrational Strong Coupling

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers unprecedented opportunities to manipulate chemical reaction dynamics. This work, employing quantum dynamical methods and considering the influence of a dissipative solvent environment, explores the impact of vibrational strong coupling on chemical kinetics within optical cavities. Our simulations demonstrate a significant modification of chemical reactivity when reactants exhibit strong coupling to cavity photons, specifically under non-equilibrium conditions prevalent in the strong-coupling regime. We observe that the cavity field fundamentally alters the potential energy surface, leading to altered reaction pathways and modified reaction rates compared to conventional, uncoupled systems. Furthermore, the inclusion of a dissipative solvent bath introduces complex interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics, influencing the overall reaction efficiency. These findings highlight the potential for precisely tuning chemical reactivity through cavity-mediated interactions, opening avenues for controlled synthesis and novel catalytic processes. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of cavity-modified chemical kinetics and provides a framework for future investigations into the design of light-driven chemical transformations.
