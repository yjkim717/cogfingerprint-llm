**Abstract:**

The increasing complexity of materials chemistry research necessitates robust data management strategies. This study investigates the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles within the field, examining prominent data repositories and their influence on accelerating knowledge discovery. Analysis reveals that while significant progress has been made in establishing materials data infrastructure, challenges remain regarding consistent metadata application and ensuring long-term data preservation.  Effective implementation of FAIR principles is crucial for fostering collaborative research, validating computational predictions, and ultimately, driving innovation in materials design. This work advocates for standardized data sharing workflows and incentivizes repository alignment with evolving FAIR guidelines to maximize the societal impact of materials chemistry research in 2024 and beyond.
