## Cavity-Modified Chemical Kinetics: A Dissipative Quantum Dynamical Perspective on Vibrational Strong Coupling and Reactivity

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers unprecedented opportunities to manipulate and control chemical reactivity. This work explores the impact of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on chemical reaction dynamics, employing rigorous quantum dynamical simulations incorporating a dissipative solvent environment. Specifically, we investigate model reaction systems exhibiting VSC between a molecular vibrational mode and a high-finesse optical cavity mode. Our simulations reveal a nuanced interplay between coherent energy transfer within the VSC system and the underlying chemical reaction manifold. Contrary to some initial expectations, we demonstrate that substantial modifications to reaction rates and product distributions are predominantly observed under non-equilibrium conditions, arising from the dynamic interplay between coherent VSC effects and solvent-induced dissipation. Analysis of the system's non-Markovian dynamics reveals that the persistent cavity field influences reaction pathways and alters the population of intermediate states, leading to deviations from adiabatic dynamics. These findings highlight the critical role of dissipative effects in shaping cavity-modified chemical kinetics and suggest that achieving predictable and controllable reactivity enhancements necessitates careful consideration of system initialization and energy relaxation pathways within the cavity environment. The implications of this work extend to areas including photocatalysis and light-driven molecular transformations.
