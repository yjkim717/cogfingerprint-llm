**Abstract**

Recent advancements in quantum dynamics are increasingly applied to elucidate complex chemical kinetics, particularly within the context of optically enhanced reactivity. This study investigates the influence of vibrational strong coupling on chemical reaction pathways occurring within specifically designed optical cavities. Utilizing time-dependent density matrix formalism, we model the interplay between excited vibrational states and reactant molecules, demonstrating a measurable resonant modification of reaction rates.  Crucially, our simulations account for solvent effects, recognizing their significant impact on both vibrational energy transfer and reaction dynamics.  The observed cavity modification suggests a novel mechanism for non-equilibrium control of chemical processes, potentially enabling tailored reactivity profiles.  These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of collective chemical behavior and offer promising avenues for developing optically driven catalytic systems. Future research will focus on experimental validation and the exploration of analogous systems with tailored optical properties.
