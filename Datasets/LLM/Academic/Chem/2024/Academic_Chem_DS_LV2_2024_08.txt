This study employs advanced quantum dynamics simulations to investigate chemical reactivity under vibrational strong coupling (VSC) within an optical cavity. We demonstrate that the modification of chemical kinetics is not a universal phenomenon but is critically dependent on establishing non-equilibrium conditions. Our analysis reveals that the collective coupling regime between molecular ensembles and the cavity vacuum field selectively alters potential energy surfaces and reaction pathways. These cavity-induced effects manifest as significant changes in kinetic isotope effects and reaction rates only when the system is driven away from thermal equilibrium. These findings provide a crucial theoretical framework for reconciling disparate experimental observations and delineate the essential non-equilibrium prerequisites for harnessing VSC to control chemical transformations.
