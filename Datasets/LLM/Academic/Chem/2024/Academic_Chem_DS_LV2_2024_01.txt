Of particular significance in astrochemistry is the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) within interstellar ices, which are potential precursors to prebiotic species. This study investigates the low-temperature reaction dynamics between carbon atoms and ammonia (NH₃) in such ices, employing high-level quantum chemical calculations to map the potential energy surface. Our results demonstrate that carbon addition initiates a barrierless pathway, with subsequent hydrogenation steps leading preferentially to the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) over competing isomeric structures. The identified mechanism exhibits no significant kinetic impediments under dark cloud conditions. The integration of these findings into a comprehensive astrochemical kinetic model confirms methylamine as a dominant product, significantly enhancing its predicted abundance. This work provides a fundamental, non-energetic formation route for methylamine, resolving key uncertainties in interstellar nitrogen chemistry and reinforcing the molecular inventory available for nascent planetary systems.
