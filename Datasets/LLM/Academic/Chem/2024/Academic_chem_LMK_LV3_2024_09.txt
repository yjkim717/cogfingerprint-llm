Recent quantum chemical calculations (2024) have elucidated a novel mechanism for the formation of interstellar methylamine via carbon atom condensation on NH3-H2O ices. The process involves the stabilization of a CNH3 radical, thereby facilitating a low-energy pathway to methylamine. This astrochemical reaction sequence offers a plausible alternative to traditional routes involving methanimine hydrogenation. The findings underscore the significance of ice-phase chemistry in shaping the molecular composition of interstellar environments, with implications for our understanding of astrochemical kinetics and the origins of complex organic molecules.
