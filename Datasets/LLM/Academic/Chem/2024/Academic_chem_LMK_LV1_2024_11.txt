Title: Enhancing Materials Chemistry Research through FAIR Data Practices: A Critical Examination of Data Repositories

Abstract:
The rapid advancement of materials chemistry research is contingent upon the effective sharing and reuse of scientific data. In 2024, the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices has become increasingly crucial in facilitating collaboration and accelerating knowledge discovery. This study examines the role of prominent data repositories in promoting FAIR data practices within the materials chemistry community. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of existing data repositories, assessing their adherence to FAIR principles and their capacity to support the diverse needs of materials chemistry researchers. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of current data repositories, informing strategies for improvement and optimization. By enhancing the FAIRness of materials chemistry data, we can foster a more collaborative and data-driven research environment, ultimately driving innovation and breakthroughs in the field.
