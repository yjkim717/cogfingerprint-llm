Title: Unveiling the Formation of Methylamine in Interstellar Ices: Insights from Quantum Chemical Calculations and Astrochemical Kinetic Models

Abstract:
The interaction between carbon atoms and ammonia in interstellar ices is investigated using quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical kinetic models. Our results reveal that the reaction between C and NH₃ yields methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as the preferred product, with a barrierless formation pathway. The computed reaction rate coefficients and branching ratios indicate a significant yield of methylamine under astrophysical conditions. Incorporating these findings into astrochemical kinetic models, we simulate the carbon accretion process in interstellar ices, demonstrating that methylamine formation is favored at low temperatures (≈10 K) and dense environments. Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the role of carbon atom reactions in the formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar ices, shedding light on the astrochemical processes that govern the composition of star-forming regions.
