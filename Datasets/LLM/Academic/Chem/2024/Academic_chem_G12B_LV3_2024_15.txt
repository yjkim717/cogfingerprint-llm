**Abstract:** The accelerating pace of materials chemistry research necessitates robust data management strategies. This study, conducted in 2024, examines the evolving landscape of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data implementation within the field. Through an analysis of prominent materials data repositories, we evaluate the current state of scientific data sharing and its influence on collaborative knowledge discovery. Findings highlight both successes and persistent challenges in achieving full FAIR compliance, particularly concerning data interoperability and long-term preservation. Ultimately, this work underscores the crucial role of standardized data practices in fostering reproducible research and accelerating advancements in materials science through enhanced collaboration and data-driven insights.
