In this computational study, we investigate the formation pathways of methanimine (CH2NH) and methylamine (CH3NH2) via carbon (C) atom condensation on mixed ammonia-water (NH3–H2O) interstellar ice analogues. Employing high-level quantum chemical calculations, we map the intricate hydrogenation network initiated by the C + NH3 reaction. Our results demonstrate that this surface-mediated mechanism provides a highly efficient, alternative route to these prebiotic species, circumventing traditional gas-phase models. Crucially, the reaction energetics and kinetics reveal a pronounced thermodynamic preference for methylamine formation. This product selectivity is attributed to methylamine's enhanced stability against radical-induced hydrogen abstraction reactions under simulated cold molecular cloud conditions (T = 10–20 K). The identified pathway underscores the critical role of carbon atom chemistry within complex ices, significantly enriching our understanding of interstellar nitrogen-bearing complex organic molecule inventories and their potential delivery to planetary systems.
