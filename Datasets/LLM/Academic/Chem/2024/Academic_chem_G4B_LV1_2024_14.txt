**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments hinges critically on the initial phases of chemical processing, frequently involving the condensation of carbonaceous species onto icy substrates. This research presents a quantum chemical investigation into the condensation pathways of carbon atoms onto NH₃-H₂O ices, employing density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate the dominant reaction products. Specifically, we examined the energetics and transition states associated with carbon addition to these ices, considering the influence of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as a potential intermediate. Our findings demonstrate that methylamine emerges as the thermodynamically favored product under the simulated conditions. This preference is attributed to a combination of favorable bond dissociation energies and the stabilization afforded by the methyl group. These results contribute to a refined understanding of astrochemical kinetics within cold, dense interstellar clouds and highlight the significant role of simple nitrogen-containing molecules in the prebiotic chemical landscape.
