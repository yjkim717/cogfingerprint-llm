By 2050, the paradigm of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation will be fundamentally reshaped by the synergistic integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced computational frameworks. This perspective delineates a future where AI-driven multiscale models seamlessly bridge phenomena from electronic structure to mesoscopic assembly, overcoming traditional limitations in time and length scales. Central to this evolution will be the proliferation of autonomous, self-curating simulation databases that employ machine learning for intelligent data acquisition, hypothesis generation, and uncertainty quantification. These repositories will not merely archive trajectories but will actively guide computational campaigns, identifying knowledge gaps and proposing optimal simulation pathways. Consequently, the role of the computational chemist will evolve from manual simulator to orchestrator of a closed-loop, AI-augmented discovery engine. This transformation promises to unlock unprecedented predictive accuracy in modeling complex chemical processes, from catalyst design to biomolecular recognition, heralding a new era of data-centric physical chemistry.
