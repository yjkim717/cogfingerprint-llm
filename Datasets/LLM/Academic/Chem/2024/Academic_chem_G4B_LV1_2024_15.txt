**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of materials chemistry increasingly demands robust data management strategies to accelerate discovery and reproducibility. This study investigates the critical need for “FAIR” (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data practices within the discipline. Specifically, we analyze the efficacy of established data repositories as central infrastructure for facilitating scientific data sharing. Challenges related to data heterogeneity and a lack of standardized metadata formats impede comprehensive data integration.  We propose that enhanced repository design, incorporating explicit FAIR principles and promoting data interoperability through standardized ontologies, is paramount.  Further research should prioritize automated data validation and the development of user-friendly tools to facilitate widespread adoption of FAIR data workflows, ultimately bolstering the reliability and impact of materials chemistry research in 2024 and beyond.
