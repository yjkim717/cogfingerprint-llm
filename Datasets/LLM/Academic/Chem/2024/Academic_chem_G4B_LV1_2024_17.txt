**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments hinges critically on efficient carbon condensation mechanisms operating on icy substrates. This research presents a computational investigation into the carbonaceous chemistry occurring on NH₃-H₂O ices, utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate reaction pathways. Specifically, we examined the influence of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as a potential intermediate and stable product arising from the interaction of carbonaceous species with these icy reservoirs. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations were employed to assess reaction energetics and identify key transition states. Our findings demonstrate that methylamine exhibits significant stability upon formation, suggesting a viable pathway for its production within cold interstellar ices. Furthermore, astrochemical kinetics modeling incorporating these quantum chemical results provides insights into the potential abundance and spatial distribution of methylamine, a crucial building block for larger, prebiotic molecules. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the chemical evolution of interstellar ices and the delivery of organic material to nascent planetary systems, circa 2024.
