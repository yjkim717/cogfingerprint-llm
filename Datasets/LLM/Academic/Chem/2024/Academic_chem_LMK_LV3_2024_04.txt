Here is a formal academic-style abstract inspired by the given summary and keywords:

"In this 2024 study, we investigate the impact of vibrational strong coupling on chemical kinetics within an optical cavity. Employing advanced quantum dynamical methods, we reveal that cavity-modified reactivity can be resonantly altered under nonequilibrium conditions. Our findings demonstrate the potential for tailored modifications of chemical reactivity, offering new avenues for controlling reaction rates and pathways in complex molecular systems."
