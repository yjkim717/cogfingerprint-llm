Of particular interest in astrochemical chemistry is the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the condensed phase of interstellar ices. This study investigates the fundamental reaction pathways initiated by carbon atom addition to ammonia (NH₃) ices, a prevalent molecular solid in cold cosmic environments. We employ high-level quantum chemical calculations to map the potential energy surfaces and identify key intermediates. Our results demonstrate that sequential hydrogenation of the initial C–NH₃ adduct provides a thermodynamically favorable and kinetically viable route, culminating in the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as a stable terminal product. This non-diffusive, barrierless mechanism circumvents the limitations of gas-phase models and previous grain-surface reactions that require significant activation energy. The incorporation of these novel carbon condensation pathways into astrochemical kinetics models yields a marked increase in the predicted methylamine abundances, achieving closer alignment with observational data from protostellar and cometary sources. These findings fundamentally revise our understanding of molecular complexity in interstellar ices and underscore the critical role of atom addition chemistries in the interstellar synthesis of prebiotic molecules.
