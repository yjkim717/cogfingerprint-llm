**Abstract**

The imperative for reproducible research and accelerated discovery necessitates the widespread adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles within materials chemistry. This study examines the strategic integration of data repositories as a pivotal mechanism for achieving FAIRness and bolstering collaborative research efforts. Specifically, we analyze the current landscape of established and emerging repositories relevant to materials science, assessing their adherence to FAIR criteria and their impact on data accessibility. Our investigation highlights the potential for standardized metadata schemas and controlled vocabularies to facilitate robust data interoperability, ultimately streamlining knowledge synthesis and reducing redundant experimentation.  Furthermore, we propose a framework for incentivizing data deposition and promoting data stewardship within research groups, contributing to a more efficient and transparent scientific ecosystem by 2024.
