**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar ices represents a crucial step in the delivery of prebiotic materials to planetary systems. This research examines the fundamental carbon-nitrogen interactions occurring on NH3-H2O ices, utilizing quantum chemical calculations to elucidate reaction pathways. Specifically, we investigated the condensation of carbon atoms with ammonia and water, focusing on the potential for methylamine (CH3NH2) formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to assess the energetics and stability of various intermediates, demonstrating a statistically significant preference for methylamine as the dominant product under simulated interstellar conditions. 

These findings are integrated within astrochemical models, suggesting that methylamine formation via this carbon-nitrogen condensation route is a viable mechanism for processing interstellar ices. The identified pathway contributes to our understanding of the chemical complexity achievable within these cold, ices, and offers a potential explanation for observed abundances of this molecule in molecular clouds. Further investigation into the influence of ice grain properties and radiation fields is warranted.
