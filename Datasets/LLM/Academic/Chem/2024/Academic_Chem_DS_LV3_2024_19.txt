The implementation of FAIR data principles within materials chemistry has catalyzed a paradigm shift in 2024, fundamentally enhancing the reproducibility and velocity of materials discovery. By leveraging standardized metadata schemas and specialized digital repositories, researchers now achieve unprecedented levels of data interoperability and machine-actionability. This systematic approach not only streamlines collaborative workflows across institutions but also facilitates advanced data mining and predictive modeling, thereby accelerating the design of next-generation functional materials and solidifying a more open, efficient scientific ecosystem.
