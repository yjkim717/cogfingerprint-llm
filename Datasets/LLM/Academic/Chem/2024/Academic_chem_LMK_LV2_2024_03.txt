Title: Enhancing Materials Chemistry Research through FAIR Data Practices

Abstract: 
The imperative for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data practices in materials chemistry research is underscored by the increasing complexity of scientific inquiry. This study examines the pivotal role of key data repositories in facilitating the sharing of scientific data, thereby accelerating discovery. By analyzing existing data repositories and their adherence to FAIR principles, we elucidate the benefits of interoperable data frameworks for advancing materials chemistry research. Our findings highlight the potential for standardized data practices to foster collaboration and innovation in the field, as of 2024.
