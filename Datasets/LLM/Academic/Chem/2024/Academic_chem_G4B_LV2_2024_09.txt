**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments remains a central challenge in astrochemistry. This work presents a novel theoretical investigation into the potential for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) formation via carbon accretion onto ammonia (NH₃), utilizing quantum chemical calculations to assess reaction pathways. Employing density functional theory, we examined the energetics and stability of various carbon-containing intermediates resulting from ammonia’s interaction with elemental carbon and interstellar ices. Our calculations reveal that the addition of a single carbon atom to ammonia yields a remarkably stable methylamine structure, significantly exceeding the predicted stability of alternative pathways. 

This finding provides a compelling mechanism for the observed prevalence of methanimine in interstellar ices. Furthermore, we integrated these quantum mechanical results into astrochemical models, demonstrating the potential for methylamine to be a significant precursor molecule. These simulations suggest that methylamine formation could be a crucial step in the delivery of complex organic compounds to nascent planetary systems. Future research will explore the influence of varying ice temperatures and densities on this process.
