In this theoretical investigation, we employ advanced quantum dynamical simulations to elucidate the mechanisms of cavity-modified chemical kinetics within the collective vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regime. Our findings demonstrate that while equilibrium thermodynamic properties and conventional rate constants remain unperturbed by the optical cavity, significant alterations in chemical reactivity emerge exclusively under non-equilibrium conditions. This work establishes that the polaritonic states formed through strong light-matter interactions selectively influence reaction pathways only when the system is driven from thermal equilibrium, providing a crucial resolution to the ongoing debate surrounding VSC-mediated chemistry. The results fundamentally reshape our understanding of quantum cavity effects on molecular transformations, suggesting that harnessing VSC for chemical control requires strategic manipulation of system dynamics rather than equilibrium modifications. This insight opens new avenues for manipulating chemical reactions through non-equilibrium quantum electrodynamic environments.
