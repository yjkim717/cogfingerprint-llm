## Carbon Atom Condensation Pathways in Interstellar Ices: A Quantum Chemical Investigation of Methylamine Formation

**Abstract:** The chemical complexity observed in interstellar ices necessitates a thorough understanding of the pathways leading to the formation of organic molecules within these cold, radiation-processed environments. This study employs high-level quantum chemical calculations, specifically employing density functional theory (DFT) with dispersion corrections, to investigate the impact of carbon atom accretion onto ammonia-water ices (NH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O) at astrophysically relevant temperatures (10-20 K). We focused on elucidating the competitive reaction pathways involving C(<sup>3</sup>P) addition to various intermediates formed during ice hydrogenation. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to expectations favoring the formation of simple nitriles such as HCN and HNC, carbon atom incorporation significantly biases the reaction towards the production of methylamine (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>). Detailed analysis of reaction energetics reveals a kinetically favorable pathway involving initial C-addition to ammonia, followed by subsequent hydrogenation and rearrangement steps. This preference for methylamine generation has implications for the prebiotic synthesis of amino acids and other nitrogen-containing biomolecules in dense molecular clouds. The findings highlight the importance of considering carbon atom condensation as a crucial step in the synthesis of complex organic molecules in interstellar ices, challenging current astrochemical models and prompting further investigation into the role of ice morphology and radiation processing.
