Here is a formal academic-style abstract inspired by the given summary and keywords:

"Exploring the intricacies of vibrational strong coupling, this study (2024) employs advanced quantum dynamical methodologies to elucidate the cavity-modified chemical kinetics underpinning non-equilibrium reactivity. Our findings reveal that optical cavities can resonantly modulate chemical reactivity, thereby opening new avenues for manipulating reaction pathways. This research advances our understanding of cavity quantum chemistry and its potential applications in controlling chemical transformations."
