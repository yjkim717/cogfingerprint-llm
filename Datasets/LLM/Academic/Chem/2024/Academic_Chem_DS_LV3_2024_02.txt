In this computational astrochemical study, we elucidate a novel solid-state reaction mechanism for the formation of methanimine (CH2NH) and methylamine (CH3NH2) within interstellar ices. Employing high-level quantum chemical calculations, we demonstrate that the sequential condensation and hydrogenation of atomic carbon on mixed NH3â€“H2O icy grain surfaces provides a highly efficient, non-gaseous pathway. Our results reveal a detailed hydrogenation network, initiated by C-addition to ammonia, which proceeds through several radical intermediates under cryogenic conditions. This surface-mediated route demonstrates significantly lower energy barriers compared to previously proposed gas-phase reactions, particularly for the critical methylamine formation step. The revised kinetic model, incorporating these findings, resolves longstanding discrepancies between observed molecular abundances and theoretical predictions in cold molecular clouds. This work fundamentally expands our understanding of interstellar complex organic molecule genesis, highlighting the pivotal role of carbon atom chemistry in cosmic ice mantles.
