**Abstract**

The circumstellar envelopes of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (C-rich AGB) stars serve as prolific chemical factories, with their dynamics and morphology profoundly influenced by binary interactions. This investigation probes the molecular complexity within the envelope of the evolved binary system CIT 6, a well-studied carbon star. Utilizing high-angular-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we have spatially resolved the distributions of key carbon-bearing molecules in its circumstellar environment. Our analysis reveals a kinematically distinct, equatorial density enhancement—a structure consistent with a gravitationally confined outflow or a nascent circumbinary disk, shaped by the companion star. Within this region, we detect a suite of unsaturated carbon chain molecules, including C₄H, C₆H, and HC₃N, which exhibit markedly enhanced abundance ratios compared to the extended, spherically symmetric wind. We present quantitative abundance estimates derived from non-LTE radiative transfer modeling, indicating that these linear carbon chains are not merely present but are a dominant molecular component in the confined structure. These findings strongly suggest that the unique physical conditions—including enhanced densities and shielded ultraviolet radiation fields—within binary-shaped circumstellar structures provide a highly efficient reservoir for the synthesis and preservation of complex carbon chemistry, with significant implications for the chemical inventory that may be delivered to nascent planetary systems.
