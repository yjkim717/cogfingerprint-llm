**Abstract**

The chemical evolution of interstellar ices represents a critical area of investigation for understanding the origins of complex organic molecules. This study examines the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) via carbon accretion onto ammonia (NH₃) ices, employing high-resolution quantum chemical calculations to delineate reaction pathways. Our computational analysis reveals that methylamine emerges as the statistically favored product, exhibiting significantly enhanced resistance to hydrogen abstraction compared to alternative intermediates.  This stability is attributed to optimized electronic structure and reduced vulnerability to energetic processes prevalent in interstellar environments. These findings directly inform the development of refined astrochemical models, correcting for potential overestimation of less stable precursors.  Future research will integrate these quantum chemical insights with detailed radiative transfer simulations to further constrain the abundance of methylamine and related compounds throughout star-forming regions, solidifying our understanding of early organic chemistry.
