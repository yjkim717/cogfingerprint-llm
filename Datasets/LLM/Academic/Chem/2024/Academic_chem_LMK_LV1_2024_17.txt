Title: Elucidating the Formation of Nitrogen-Containing Organics via Carbon Atom Condensation on Interstellar Ices: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Kinetic Modeling Study

Abstract:
The condensation of carbon atoms with ammonia on interstellar ices is investigated using high-level quantum chemical calculations to unravel the mechanistic pathways leading to the formation of methanimine (CH₂NH) and methylamine (CH₃NH₂). Our computational results reveal that the barrierless reaction between C(³P) and NH₃ on icy surfaces yields a metastable H₂NCH complex, which subsequently rearranges to form methanimine. Further hydrogenation of methanimine leads to the production of methylamine. Astrochemical kinetic models incorporating these findings demonstrate that this mechanism can significantly contribute to the observed abundances of nitrogen-containing organics in star-forming regions. The results of this study (2024) provide new insights into the role of carbon atom condensation on interstellar ices in shaping the chemical complexity of the interstellar medium.
