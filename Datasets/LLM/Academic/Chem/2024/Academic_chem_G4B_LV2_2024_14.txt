**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments remains a central question in astrochemistry. This research presents novel insights into carbon accretion processes occurring on ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices, utilizing a combined approach of quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling. Specifically, we examined the condensation pathways of carbon atoms onto these ices, focusing on the potential for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) formation. Our calculations demonstrate that stable radical intermediates, notably methylidyne (CH₃•), are preferentially generated during carbon accretion. Subsequent hydrogenation of these radicals yields methylamine as the dominant product, surpassing alternative pathways such as formaldehyde or methanol formation.  These findings, validated through detailed astrochemical modeling incorporating realistic interstellar conditions, suggest that methylamine represents a significant and readily accessible precursor for more complex organic molecules. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the chemical evolution within cold, dense molecular clouds, and informs ongoing searches for prebiotic molecules in interstellar space.
