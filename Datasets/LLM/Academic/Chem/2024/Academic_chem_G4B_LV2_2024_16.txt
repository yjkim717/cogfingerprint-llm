**Abstract**

Recent advancements in quantum simulation have enabled a deeper investigation into the intricacies of chemical reactivity, particularly within complex environments. This research leverages quantum dynamics calculations to examine reaction pathways occurring within optical cavities coupled to a dissipative solvent medium. Specifically, we demonstrate the emergence of collective behavior and resonant modifications in these systems, attributable to vibrational strong coupling between the reacting molecules and the cavity modes. The inclusion of solvent effects, characterized by dissipation, significantly impacts reaction rates and pathways, shifting dynamics away from purely isolated molecule models. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of chemical kinetics, moving beyond traditional classical approaches.  Further computational exploration will focus on quantifying the influence of solvent viscosity and cavity geometry on observed reactivity changes.  The methodologies presented offer a valuable framework for simulating chemically relevant systems with enhanced predictive capabilities, relevant for diverse applications in photochemistry and catalysis (2024).
