By 2050, the synergistic integration of artificial intelligence with molecular dynamics is poised to fundamentally redefine the predictive power and scope of computational physical chemistry. This prospective analysis posits that the evolution of AI-driven methodologies will transcend current limitations in sampling rare events and navigating complex free energy landscapes. We anticipate the emergence of self-optimizing, multi-fidelity simulation frameworks that autonomously orchestrate computations across temporal and spatial scales, from electronic structure to mesoscopic phenomena. Concurrently, the establishment of large-scale, federated simulation databases, curated by machine learning agents, will serve as a collective knowledge substrate. This infrastructure will enable generative models to propose novel molecular designs and predict emergent physicochemical properties with unprecedented accuracy. The resulting paradigm shift will not only automate the traditional scientific workflow but also foster a data-centric approach to discovery, wherein AI uncovers latent physical laws directly from high-dimensional simulation data, thereby accelerating the design of advanced materials and pharmaceuticals.
