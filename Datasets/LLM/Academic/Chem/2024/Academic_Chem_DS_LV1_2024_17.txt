In this computational investigation, we elucidate the low-temperature formation mechanism of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) within interstellar ice analogues via sequential carbon atom addition to ammonia (NH₃). Employing high-level quantum chemical calculations (CCSD(T)-F12a/cc-pVTZ-F12), we characterized the potential energy surfaces for the C + NH₃ reaction and subsequent hydrogenation steps under barrierless conditions prevalent in dark molecular clouds. Our results demonstrate that the initial adduct, aminomethyl radical (•CH₂NH₂), forms efficiently upon carbon accretion onto ammonia, with exothermic hydrogen atom addition yielding methylamine as the terminal product. The identified non-energetic pathway exhibits a pronounced kinetic favorability over alternative radical-radical recombination routes. These mechanistic insights were integrated into a comprehensive astrochemical kinetic model, which successfully reproduces the observed methylamine abundances in star-forming regions like Sgr B2(N). This work substantiates carbon insertion as a fundamental grain-surface process for interstellar complex organic molecule formation, providing critical parameters for future astrochemical databases.
