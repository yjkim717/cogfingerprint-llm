**Abstract**

The chemical complexity observed in interstellar ices necessitates a detailed understanding of the pathways leading to the formation of prebiotic molecules. This study investigates the efficiency of carbon atom (C) accretion onto ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices, a prevalent environment in cold molecular clouds, using high-level quantum chemical calculations. Specifically, we explore the hydrogenation network initiated by C addition, focusing on the competitive formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂), alongside other nitrogen-containing species such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and cyanogen (HNC). Our results demonstrate that, under astrophysically relevant conditions, the pathway leading to methylamine exhibits a significantly lower energy barrier and a more favorable reaction probability compared to those producing HCN and HNC. This preference for methylamine formation arises from the stabilization of key intermediates through hydrogen bonding and steric effects within the ice matrix. These findings provide crucial insights into the efficient synthesis of amino precursors in interstellar environments and refine current astrochemical models regarding the origin of complex organic molecules in star-forming regions.



I aimed to:
