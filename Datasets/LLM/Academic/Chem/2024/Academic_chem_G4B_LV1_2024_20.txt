**Abstract**

The interplay between quantum dynamics and chemical kinetics presents a compelling challenge in understanding reaction pathways, particularly within complex environments. This work leverages advanced quantum mechanical simulations to explore the influence of vibrational strong coupling on chemical reactivity within an optical cavity permeated by a dissipative solvent. Utilizing a multi-level system approach, we investigate both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics, quantifying the impact of vibrational modes on excited-state lifetimes and reaction probabilities. Specifically, we examine how solvent interactions, modeled through a coupled oscillator framework, introduce dissipation and alter the radiative environment, thereby impacting the overall reaction rate. Our findings demonstrate a significant deviation from classical kinetic predictions, highlighting the necessity of incorporating quantum effects to accurately describe chemical processes in optically active systems.  Further research will focus on extending these methodologies to investigate complex reaction networks.
