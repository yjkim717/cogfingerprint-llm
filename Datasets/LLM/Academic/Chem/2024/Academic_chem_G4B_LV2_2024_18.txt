**Abstract**

The formation pathways of complex organic molecules within interstellar ices remain a central challenge in astrochemistry. This research presents a novel investigation into the carbon accretion process onto ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices, utilizing a combined approach of quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical kinetics. Specifically, we employed high-level theoretical methodologies to elucidate the mechanistic details of carbon incorporation, focusing on the subsequent evolution of reactive intermediates. Our quantum chemical modeling demonstrates that methylamine (CH₃NH₂) emerges as the thermodynamically favoured and kinetically stable product following carbon addition to the NH₃-H₂O ices. 

Astrochemical kinetic modeling, parameterized with these quantum chemical results, provides a predictive framework for assessing the relative abundances of key species within cold, dense molecular clouds. This work highlights the significant role of methylamine as a potential building block for more complex organic molecules, contributing to our understanding of the chemical origins of prebiotic compounds. Future research will expand this investigation to include the influence of ice grain properties and broader interstellar environments.
