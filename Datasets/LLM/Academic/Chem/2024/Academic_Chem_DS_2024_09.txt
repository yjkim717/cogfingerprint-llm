This study employs density functional theory to investigate amino acid-functionalized copper electrodes for CO₂ electroreduction. We demonstrate that molecular surface modification with glycine significantly lowers the kinetic barrier for C–C coupling, thereby promoting the selective formation of C₂₊ products. These findings highlight a promising strategy for enhancing catalytic efficiency through tailored interfacial molecular design.
