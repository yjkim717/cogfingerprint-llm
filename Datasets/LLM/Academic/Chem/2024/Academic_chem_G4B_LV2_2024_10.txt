**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within cold interstellar ices represents a crucial step in the delivery of prebiotic materials to planetary systems. This research presents novel insights into the carbon accretion pathways on ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices, utilizing a combined approach of quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling. Specifically, we examined the energetic stability of various carbon-containing species formed during the condensation process. Through high-level computational analysis, including geometry optimizations and vibrational frequency calculations, we demonstrate that methylamine (CH₃NH₂) emerges as the thermodynamically favored product following carbon incorporation into the ice matrix. 

Our findings challenge prevailing models that predict the dominance of other potential intermediates. The calculated activation energies for methylamine formation are significantly lower than those for competing pathways, suggesting a robust and efficient mechanism for its production. These results are integrated into a simplified astrochemical model, highlighting the potential importance of methylamine as a building block for larger organic molecules within dense interstellar clouds. Further investigation into the kinetics of this process is warranted.
