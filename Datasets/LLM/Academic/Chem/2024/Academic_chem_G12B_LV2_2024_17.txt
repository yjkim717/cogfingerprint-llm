## Abstract: Methylamine Dominance in Icy Grain Surfaces: A Quantum Chemical Investigation of Carbon Accretion Pathways

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar ices is a crucial step in understanding the chemical origins of life. This study investigates the impact of carbon atom condensation onto ammonia-water ices, a prevalent scenario on grain surfaces in molecular clouds, focusing on the resultant product distribution. Utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations, specifically density functional theory (DFT) with dispersion corrections, we explored a comprehensive hydrogenation network initiated by C atom addition to NH₃-H₂O ices. Our results demonstrate that, contrary to expectations favoring simpler nitrile species like hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and cyanogen (HNC), carbon accretion significantly promotes the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as the dominant product. Analysis of reaction pathways reveals a kinetically favored route involving sequential hydrogenation steps leading to methylamine, effectively suppressing the formation of competing nitrile intermediates. This preference for methylamine is attributed to a combination of favorable reaction energetics and the inherent stability of the resulting C-N bonds within the icy matrix. These findings have important implications for astrochemical models, suggesting that methylamine may be more abundant in interstellar ices than previously estimated, impacting the overall chemical complexity of protoplanetary disks and potentially influencing the prebiotic chemistry occurring within them.
