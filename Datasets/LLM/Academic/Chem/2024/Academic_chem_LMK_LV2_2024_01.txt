Title: Quantum Chemical Insights into the Formation of Methylamine via Carbon Atom Reaction with Ammonia on Interstellar Ices

Abstract:
The reaction of carbon atoms with ammonia on interstellar ices is a crucial process in astrochemical kinetic models, influencing the formation of complex organic molecules. Employing quantum chemical calculations, this study elucidates the mechanistic details of this reaction. Our results indicate that the reaction proceeds via a barrierless pathway, yielding methylamine as the preferred product. The computed reaction energetics and kinetics reveal a favorable formation route, consistent with observed methylamine abundances in interstellar environments. The findings of this study provide a fundamental understanding of the role of interstellar ices in facilitating the formation of complex organic molecules, shedding light on the astrochemical processes that underpin the evolution of molecular complexity in the interstellar medium.
