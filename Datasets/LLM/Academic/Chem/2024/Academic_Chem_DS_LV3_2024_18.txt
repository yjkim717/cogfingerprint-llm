In this computational study, we investigate the non-equilibrium reaction dynamics of atomic carbon on mixed NH3â€“H2O interstellar ice analogues. Employing high-level quantum chemical calculations, we elucidate novel, barrierless pathways for the formation of two critical prebiotic nitrogen-bearing species: methanimine (CH2NH) and methylamine (CH3NH2). Our results demonstrate that carbon condensation initiates a cascade of radical-mediated reactions, bypassing traditional gas-phase and surface-mediated formation routes. Crucially, the analysis of relative kinetics and thermodynamic stability reveals that methylamine is the dominant product under simulated dark cloud conditions. This dominance is attributed to its enhanced stability against hydrogen abstraction reactions compared to methanimine, which possesses a more reactive imine functional group. These findings fundamentally reshape our understanding of molecular complexity in cold interstellar environments, providing a robust, grain-surface mediated mechanism for the genesis of amines essential to astrochemical evolution.
