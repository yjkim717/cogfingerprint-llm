The implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles is revolutionizing materials chemistry by enabling robust data repositories. These structured platforms facilitate the systematic deposition of complex datasets, including synthesis protocols and characterization results. By enhancing data interoperability across disparate studies, they accelerate knowledge discovery and collaborative research. This paradigm shift not only promotes reproducibility but also unlocks new avenues for data-driven materials design, thereby fundamentally advancing the field's capacity for innovation and scientific progress.
