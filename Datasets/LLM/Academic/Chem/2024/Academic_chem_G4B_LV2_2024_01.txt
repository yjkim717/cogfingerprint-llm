**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments remains a central question in astrochemistry. This research presents novel quantum chemical calculations elucidating the carbon accretion pathways on hydrated ammonia (NH₃·H₂O) ices, a prevalent constituent of interstellar ices. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT), we systematically investigated the thermochemical stability and reaction energetics of various carbon-containing species formed via the condensation of elemental carbon onto these icy substrates. Our findings demonstrate a significant preference for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) formation as the dominant product, exceeding the yields predicted for alternative pathways such as methane or ethane. 

The observed selectivity is attributed to the favorable binding energies of methylamine relative to its precursors, driven by hydrogen bonding stabilization within the ice matrix. Furthermore, the study explores the potential for subsequent methylamine transformations, highlighting its role as a key building block in the synthesis of more complex organic molecules. These results contribute to a refined understanding of the chemical processing occurring within interstellar ices, informing the search for prebiotic chemistry and the delivery of organic material to planetary systems – a key focus for 2024 research.
