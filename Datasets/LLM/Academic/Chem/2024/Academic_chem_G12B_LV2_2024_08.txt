**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers unprecedented opportunities to manipulate chemical systems through light-matter interactions. This work investigates the impact of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on chemical reactivity, extending beyond equilibrium considerations to explore non-equilibrium dynamics. Utilizing quantum dynamical methods, we demonstrate a resonant modification of reaction pathways induced by VSC within an optical cavity. Specifically, we analyze how the hybridization of a vibrational mode with a cavity field alters the system's potential energy surface, influencing reaction rates and product distributions. Our simulations, incorporating a dissipative solvent environment, reveal that VSC can lead to both enhancement and suppression of reactivity depending on the specific coupling strength and system parameters. These findings highlight the potential of cavity-modified kinetics as a powerful tool for controlling chemical reactions, opening avenues for the design of novel catalytic processes and light-driven chemical synthesis strategies. Further research is warranted to explore the scalability and applicability of this approach to more complex molecular systems.
