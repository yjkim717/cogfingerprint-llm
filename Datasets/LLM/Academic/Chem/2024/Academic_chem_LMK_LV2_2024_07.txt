Title: Enhancing Materials Chemistry Research through FAIR Data Practices: A Review of Key Repositories

Abstract: 
The advancement of materials chemistry research relies heavily on the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices. This review examines the pivotal role of data repositories in facilitating scientific collaboration and knowledge discovery. By analyzing prominent materials chemistry data repositories, we assess their compliance with FAIR principles and their impact on research outcomes. Our analysis highlights best practices and identifies areas for improvement, providing a framework for optimizing data sharing and collaboration in materials chemistry research in 2024 and beyond.
