In this computational study, we investigate the low-temperature reactivity of carbon atoms with ammonia (NH₃) within interstellar ice analogues, a process of significant astrochemical relevance for prebiotic nitrogen-bearing molecule formation. Employing high-level quantum chemical calculations, we map the reaction pathways and energetics, revealing that sequential hydrogenation of the initial C–NH₃ adduct constitutes the dominant low-barrier mechanism. Our results robustly demonstrate that methylamine (CH₃NH₂) is the thermodynamically and kinetically favored product, rather than alternative isomers such as methanimine. Subsequent integration of these findings into a comprehensive astrochemical kinetic model confirms that this pathway can account for the observed abundances of methylamine in star-forming regions. This work provides a fundamental mechanistic understanding of carbon atom condensation chemistry in ices, resolving a key synthetic route for interstellar amine formation and informing our knowledge of molecular complexity in dark molecular clouds.
