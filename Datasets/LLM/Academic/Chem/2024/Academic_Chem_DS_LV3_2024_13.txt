In this 2024 astrochemical study, we investigate carbon atom condensation mechanisms on ammonia-enriched interstellar ice surfaces through combined quantum chemical calculations and kinetic modeling. Our computational results demonstrate that carbon accretion initiates efficient methylamine formation via sequential hydrogenation pathways, with activation barriers below 5 kJ mol⁻¹ under typical molecular cloud conditions (T = 10-20 K). The reaction network reveals that surface-mediated hydrogen transfer to C–N bonds proceeds through quantum tunneling, significantly enhancing production rates by three orders of magnitude compared to gas-phase analogues. These findings necessitate revision of current astrochemical models, as the identified mechanisms account for observed methylamine abundances in star-forming regions where traditional synthesis routes proved insufficient. The study establishes carbon condensation on icy grains as a fundamental process in interstellar amine chemistry, with implications for understanding molecular complexity in prestellar environments.
