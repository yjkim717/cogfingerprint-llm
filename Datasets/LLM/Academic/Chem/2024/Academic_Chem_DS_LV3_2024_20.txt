In this 2024 study, we employ advanced quantum dynamical simulations to elucidate how vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in optical cavities modifies chemical kinetics. Our findings reveal a critical distinction between equilibrium and non-equilibrium regimes: while equilibrium reaction rates remain unaltered, significant kinetic modifications emerge exclusively under out-of-equilibrium conditions. Through quantum dynamics calculations in the collective regime, we demonstrate that cavity-induced effects manifest through non-adiabatic energy transfer pathways inaccessible at thermodynamic equilibrium. This work establishes that VSC-mediated chemical control operates through state-specific population redistribution rather than static energetic stabilization. These insights resolve previous experimental discrepancies and provide a quantum mechanical framework for predicting cavity-catalyzed reactions, advancing our fundamental understanding of polaritonic chemistry and opening new avenues for controlling molecular transformations through tailored photonic environments.
