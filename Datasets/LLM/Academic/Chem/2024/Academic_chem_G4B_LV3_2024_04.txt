**Abstract**

Recent advancements in quantum dynamics offer unprecedented opportunities to probe reaction pathways within complex chemical environments. This study employs time-resolved quantum dynamical simulations, incorporating vibrational strong coupling, to examine reactivity within optically resonant cavities. Specifically, we investigate the influence of solvent effects on reaction rates and product distributions, simulating systems under non-equilibrium conditions generated by pulsed laser excitation. Our findings demonstrate a compelling correlation between cavity geometry and reactant accessibility, suggesting a mechanism for resonant modification of chemical reactivity.  The observed shifts in reaction dynamics underscore the potential for utilizing optical cavities as tunable reaction environments.  These results provide a theoretical framework for manipulating chemical kinetics through tailored optical feedback, ultimately informing the design of novel photochemical and catalytic processes. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm these predictive capabilities.
