In this computational investigation, we elucidate the carbon accretion pathway for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) formation within interstellar ice analogues via sequential carbon atom addition to ammonia (NH₃) and subsequent hydrogenation. Employing high-level quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level of theory, we mapped the reaction network and characterized the relevant transition states on the potential energy surface. Our results demonstrate that the initial barrierless association of a ground-state carbon atom ([³P]) with ammonia forms the aminomethyl radical (•CH₂NH₂), which subsequently undergoes efficient hydrogen atom addition at low temperatures. This non-diffusive mechanism provides a robust, solid-state route to methylamine, circumventing the significant gas-phase activation barriers. The derived kinetics, incorporated into a new astrochemical model, significantly enhance the predicted interstellar abundances of methylamine, reconciling longstanding discrepancies with observational data from the James Webb Space Telescope and affirming the critical role of carbon atom reactions in interstellar complex organic molecule synthesis.
