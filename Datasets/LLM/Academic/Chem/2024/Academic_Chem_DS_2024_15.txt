In this investigation, we explore the intricate coupling between discrete phononic modes and a broad electronic continuum in lead-halide perovskite thin films, employing polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy as a primary probe. The emergence of characteristic asymmetric Fano line shapes in the vibrational spectra serves as a direct signature of this coherent interaction. Our analysis focuses on quantifying the Fano resonance parameters, specifically the asymmetry factor (q) and linewidth, to elucidate the strength of electron-phonon coupling and the density of states within the electronic continuum. By systematically varying the sample temperature and halide composition, we demonstrate a tunable modulation of the Fano interference effect. These findings provide critical insights into the fundamental scattering processes governing charge carrier dynamics in these materials, with significant implications for the design of next-generation optoelectronic devices where such interactions dictate energy relaxation pathways and ultimate performance metrics.
