Title: Investigating the Catalytic Activity of Novel Transition Metal Complexes in CO2 Reduction Reactions

Abstract:

The pressing need to mitigate climate change has sparked intense research into the development of efficient CO2 reduction catalysts. In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of a series of novel transition metal complexes bearing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands, which have been designed to facilitate the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to valuable chemicals. The complexes, featuring earth-abundant metals such as Mn and Fe, were prepared via a straightforward ligand substitution reaction and characterized using a range of spectroscopic techniques, including NMR and IR spectroscopy. Electrochemical investigations revealed that the Mn-NHC complex exhibited a high catalytic activity towards CO2 reduction, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 100 s-1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 80% for CO production. Mechanistic studies suggest that the NHC ligand plays a crucial role in stabilizing the reduced metal center, enabling the efficient transfer of electrons to CO2. Our findings highlight the potential of these novel complexes as efficient CO2 reduction catalysts, with implications for the development of sustainable energy storage and conversion technologies.
