**Abstract:**

The imperative for reproducible and impactful research necessitates a fundamental shift towards “FAIR” (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data practices within materials chemistry. This study investigates the burgeoning need for robust data management strategies across the field, highlighting the critical role of dedicated data repositories in facilitating wider scientific engagement. We analyze current landscape of established repositories – including [mention 2-3 specific repositories, e.g., Materials Project, PubChem] – assessing their adherence to FAIR principles and evaluating their contribution to collaborative research efforts.  Improved data accessibility directly addresses persistent challenges in materials characterization and accelerates discovery.  Furthermore, we discuss the evolving infrastructure required to support long-term data preservation and standardized data formats, ultimately promoting greater transparency and accelerating innovation in materials chemistry research by 2024.
