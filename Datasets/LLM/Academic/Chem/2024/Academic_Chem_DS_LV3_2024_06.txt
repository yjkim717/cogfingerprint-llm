**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium (ISM) represents a critical stage in prebiotic chemical evolution. This investigation employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the hydrogenation network initiated by carbon (C) atom condensation on mixed molecular ices of ammonia (NH₃) and water (H₂O), a prevalent interstellar ice analogue. Our computational results demonstrate that this heterogeneous surface reaction provides a facile, barrierless pathway for the sequential synthesis of methanimine (CH₂NH). Subsequent hydrogenation steps are examined, revealing a pronounced thermodynamic and kinetic preference for the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) over alternative isomers or dissociation products. The stability of methylamine against destructive hydrogen abstraction reactions under simulated ISM conditions is identified as the key factor governing its dominance as the terminal product. These findings robustly validate a non-photonic, grain-surface mediated mechanism for interstellar amine formation, significantly advancing our molecular-level understanding of nitrogen-bearing COM inventories in star-forming regions.
