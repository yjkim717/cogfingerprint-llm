**Abstract**

The interplay between quantum dynamics and chemical kinetics remains a central challenge in understanding complex reaction pathways. This work presents a theoretical investigation employing advanced quantum mechanical techniques to elucidate the influence of vibrational strong coupling on chemical reactivity within optical cavity environments. Specifically, we model the impact of a dissipative solvent on the equilibrium and non-equilibrium behavior of reactions occurring within these systems. Our simulations incorporate vibrational modes coupled to the electronic states of reacting species, demonstrating a significant deviation from classical kinetic predictions.  The incorporation of solvent effects, parameterized through a dissipative model, further modulates reaction rates and product distributions. These findings suggest that vibrational strong coupling, coupled with solvent dynamics, represents a critical factor governing chemical reactivity in nanoscale optical systems, offering new avenues for controlling and manipulating photochemical processes.
