**Abstract**

The formation pathways of complex organic molecules within interstellar ices remain a central challenge in astrochemical modeling. This work reports upon quantum chemical investigations into the reaction network governing carbon’s interaction with ammonia ices, specifically targeting the synthesis of methylamine (CH₃NH₂). Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the CBS-level of theory, we systematically examined potential reaction mechanisms involving the initial abstraction of hydrogen from ammonia. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant pathway wherein a carbon atom, originating from a solid carbonaceous material, reacts with ammonia ice to yield methylamine, stabilized through a concerted hydrogen abstraction process.  Furthermore, astrochemical kinetics modeling, incorporating these calculated activation energies, suggests methylamine could represent a crucial intermediate in the delivery of prebiotic building blocks to nascent planetary systems.  The observed stability of the product warrants further investigation regarding its prevalence in interstellar ices and its role in early chemical evolution.
