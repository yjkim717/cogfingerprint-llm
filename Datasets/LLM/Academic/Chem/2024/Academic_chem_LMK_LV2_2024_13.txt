Title: Investigating Carbon Accretion on Interstellar Ices: A Quantum Chemical Analysis of Methanimine and Methylamine Formation via Ammonia Interactions

Abstract:
The accretion of carbon atoms onto interstellar ices is a crucial process in the formation of complex organic molecules. This study employs quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the interaction between carbon atoms and ammonia (NH3) on interstellar ice surfaces, focusing on the synthesis of methanimine (CH2NH) and methylamine (CH3NH2). Using high-level ab initio methods, we explore the potential energy surfaces governing these reactions, providing detailed insights into the mechanistic pathways involved. Our findings are subsequently integrated into astrochemical kinetic models to simulate the formation of these species under interstellar conditions. The results indicate that the reaction of carbon atoms with ammonia on interstellar ices is a viable route to the formation of methanimine and methylamine, shedding new light on the astrochemical processes shaping the molecular composition of interstellar environments. This work contributes to our understanding of the complex chemistry underlying the evolution of interstellar ices in 2024.
