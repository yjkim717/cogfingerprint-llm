**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments hinges critically on the initial processing of abundant interstellar ices. This work presents a computational investigation into the condensation pathways of carbon atoms onto ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices, utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate reaction mechanisms. Specifically, we examined the potential for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) formation as a thermodynamically stable intermediate. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations, employing the B3LYP functional with a 6-31G* basis set, were employed to determine activation energies for key condensation and decomposition steps. Our results indicate that carbon atom addition to NH₃-H₂O ices, followed by subsequent fragmentation and rearrangement, can indeed yield methylamine as a viable product. These findings contribute to a growing understanding of astrochemical kinetics within cold, dense molecular clouds and highlight the potential role of simple organic molecules as building blocks for more complex interstellar species.
