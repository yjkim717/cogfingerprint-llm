Title: Investigating Carbon Accretion onto Ammonia in Interstellar Ices: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Kinetic Modeling Study

Abstract:
The accretion of carbon atoms onto ammonia (NH3) in interstellar ices is a crucial process that may facilitate the formation of complex organic molecules, such as methylamine (CH3NH2). Employing quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level, we elucidate the potential energy surfaces governing the C + NH3 reaction. Our results reveal a barrierless pathway to the formation of CH3NH2 via a singlet methylene amidogen intermediate. Subsequent astrochemical kinetic modeling simulations, utilizing the uncovered reaction mechanisms, demonstrate the feasibility of methylamine synthesis under interstellar ice conditions. The findings of this study provide new insights into the role of carbon accretion in the formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar ices, shedding light on the astrochemical processes that underpin the emergence of prebiotic chemistry in the interstellar medium.
