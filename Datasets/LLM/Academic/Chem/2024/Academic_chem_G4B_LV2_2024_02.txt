**Abstract**

The formation pathways of complex organic molecules within interstellar ices remain a critical area of astrochemical investigation. This study presents novel insights into carbon accretion mechanisms, specifically focusing on the condensation of carbon atoms onto ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices. Utilizing quantum chemical calculations, we assessed the energetics of various potential intermediates, revealing a statistically significant preference for methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as the dominant product.  Our analysis incorporates astrochemical kinetics modeling, considering the competitive formation of alternative species.  Crucially, the observed preference stems from the stable radical intermediate generated during carbon addition, facilitating subsequent hydrogen addition and methylamine synthesis. These findings suggest that methylamine represents a key building block for larger organic molecules, potentially contributing to the prebiotic chemistry within cold, dense interstellar clouds. Further research employing high-resolution spectroscopic observations is warranted to confirm these predicted abundances and refine our understanding of interstellar organic synthesis in 2024.
