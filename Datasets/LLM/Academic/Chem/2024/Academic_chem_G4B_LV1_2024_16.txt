**Abstract**

The interplay between vibrational dynamics and chemical reactivity remains a significant challenge in understanding reaction mechanisms, particularly within complex environments. This work investigates the influence of vibrational strong coupling on chemical kinetics within optical cavities incorporating a dissipative solvent. Utilizing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) quantum dynamics calculations, we model the coupled vibrational modes of reactant molecules interacting with the cavity field and solvent bath. Our simulations demonstrate that strong coupling significantly alters the timescale of photochemical processes, leading to observable deviations from classical Arrhenius behavior. Furthermore, the solvent’s dissipative nature introduces a crucial feedback mechanism, enhancing vibrational relaxation and altering the radiative decay pathways. These findings suggest that incorporating solvent effects and quantum correlations is paramount for accurately predicting chemical reactivity in technologically relevant optical systems, offering a framework for designing enhanced light-harvesting and catalytic materials.
