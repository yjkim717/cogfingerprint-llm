The implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles is critically examined within the domain of materials chemistry. This analysis posits that structured data repositories, employing standardized metadata schemas and persistent identifiers, are fundamental to overcoming data heterogeneity. By facilitating machine-actionable data access, these platforms accelerate computational workflows and enable large-scale data mining for property prediction. Consequently, the systematic adoption of FAIR guidelines is demonstrated to be a pivotal enabler for novel knowledge discovery and the advancement of data-driven materials design paradigms.
