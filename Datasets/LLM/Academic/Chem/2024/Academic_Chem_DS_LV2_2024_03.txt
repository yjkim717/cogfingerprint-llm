This study evaluates the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles within materials chemistry, analyzing their impact on accelerating scientific discovery. Through systematic assessment of leading data repositories, we quantify enhancements in data accessibility and reuse. Our findings demonstrate that standardized metadata schemas and persistent identifiers significantly improve cross-platform data interoperability. Consequently, FAIR-aligned repositories facilitate more robust data-driven workflows, enabling high-throughput screening and machine learning applications. This structured approach to data stewardship is proving essential for addressing complex materials design challenges and fostering collaborative research ecosystems.
