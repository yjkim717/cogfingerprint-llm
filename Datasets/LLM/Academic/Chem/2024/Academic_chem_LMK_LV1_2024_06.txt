Title: Unveiling the Formation of Methylamine in Interstellar Ices via Carbon Atom-Ammonia Interactions: A Quantum Chemical Investigation

Abstract:
The formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) in interstellar environments has garnered significant attention due to its relevance to prebiotic chemistry. In this study, we employed quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the reaction pathway between carbon atoms and ammonia (NH₃) embedded in interstellar ices. Our computations, performed at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, reveal a barrierless reaction mechanism leading to the formation of methylamine via a series of radical-radical and radical-molecule interactions. The calculated reaction energetics and kinetics indicate that this pathway is feasible under interstellar conditions. Our findings provide a plausible explanation for the observed abundance of methylamine in certain astrophysical environments, shedding light on the molecular processes governing the chemistry of interstellar ices in 2024, our understanding of these processes continues to evolve.
