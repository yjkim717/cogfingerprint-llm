**Abstract**

Recent advancements in quantum dynamics are increasingly informing our understanding of complex chemical kinetics, particularly within the context of optical cavities. This study employs time-resolved quantum dynamical simulations to explore vibrational strong coupling effects during chemical reactions facilitated by optical confinement. We investigate how these interactions, modulated by solvent environments, fundamentally alter reaction pathways and transition state geometries. Specifically, our simulations demonstrate a pronounced shift in reactivity behavior under non-equilibrium excitation conditions, suggesting deviations from classical kinetic models.  The observed alterations highlight the critical role of quantum coherence and solvent polarization in mediating collective reactivity.  Furthermore, the results underscore the necessity for incorporating sophisticated polarization models and enhanced computational methodologies to accurately represent these systems.  Future research will focus on validating these quantum mechanical predictions with experimental spectroscopic data, contributing to a more comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding light-matter interactions in chemically relevant systems.
