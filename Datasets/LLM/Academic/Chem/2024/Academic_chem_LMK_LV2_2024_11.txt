Title: Enhancing Materials Chemistry Research through FAIR Data Practices: A Collaborative Framework

Abstract:
The accelerating pace of materials discovery necessitates rigorous data management to facilitate scientific collaboration and knowledge discovery. In 2024, as the field of materials chemistry continues to evolve, the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data practices has emerged as a crucial enabler. This study examines the application of FAIR principles in materials chemistry research, focusing on the development of standardized data repositories. By analyzing existing data infrastructure and collaboration frameworks, we identify key challenges and opportunities for advancing FAIR data practices. Our analysis reveals that FAIR-compliant data repositories can significantly enhance data sharing, reproducibility, and integration, thereby accelerating materials discovery. We propose a collaborative framework that integrates FAIR data practices with materials chemistry research, fostering a culture of data-driven innovation and accelerating the translation of materials research into technological advancements.
