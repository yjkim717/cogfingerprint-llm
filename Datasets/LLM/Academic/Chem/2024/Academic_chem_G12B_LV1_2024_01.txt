The formation of complex organic molecules within interstellar ices is a crucial step in the chemical evolution of star-forming regions and the potential emergence of prebiotic chemistry. This study utilizes high-level quantum chemical calculations, specifically employing explicitly correlated second-order perturbation theory (CCSD(T)-F12) with large basis sets, to investigate the reaction pathways and energetics of carbon atom (C) addition to ammonia (NH₃) under astrophysically relevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that the direct addition of C to NH₃ significantly favors the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) as the primary product, with a calculated barrier height of X.XX kJ/mol and a favorable exothermic energy release of Y.YY kJ/mol.  Competing pathways, such as the formation of imine intermediates, were found to be significantly less energetically favorable.  These findings challenge earlier assumptions regarding product distributions and provide a refined understanding of the initial steps in the synthesis of nitrogen-containing organic molecules within icy grain mantles.  The calculated rate constants for the dominant methylamine formation channel, considering temperature dependencies through variational transition state theory (VTST), offer valuable data for updating astrochemical kinetic models currently employed to simulate interstellar ice chemistry. This work contributes to a more accurate portrayal of the chemical network responsible for generating building blocks of life in space.
