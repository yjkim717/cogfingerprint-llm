**Abstract**

Recent advances in molecular machinery have highlighted the critical role of intramolecular communication in governing the dynamics of synthetic molecular motors. This investigation explores the design and photophysical characterization of a novel class of overcrowded alkenes engineered to exhibit coupled rotary cycles. Upon photoexcitation, the primary rotor unit undergoes a unidirectional 360Â° rotation, which is intrinsically linked to the conformational inversion of a secondary stator moiety. Spectroscopic and computational analyses confirm that this mechanical coupling is mediated by a double metastable state energy landscape, where the relaxation pathway of the photo-activated rotor directly dictates the subsequent reconfiguration of the stator component. This interdependent motion, a hallmark of coordinated function in biological systems, demonstrates a significant departure from previously reported motors where subunits operate with higher degrees of independence. The elucidation of this gear-like interplay provides a fundamental design principle for constructing advanced molecular systems with synchronized, multi-component dynamics, paving the way for next-generation nanoscale devices requiring complex, cooperative mechanical responses.
