The implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles within materials chemistry is critically examined. This study evaluates how structured data repositories and enhanced data-sharing protocols are catalysing a paradigm shift in 2024. By fostering systematic data reuse and interoperability, these practices are shown to accelerate the discovery of novel functional materials and deepen fundamental chemical insights, thereby establishing a more collaborative and data-driven research ecosystem for the discipline.
