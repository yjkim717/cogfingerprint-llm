**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar ices remains a critical area of astrochemical research. This work presents quantum chemical calculations investigating the low-temperature reaction pathways of carbon atoms with ammonia ices, a prevalent environment in dense molecular clouds. Our results demonstrate that carbon atom condensation on ammonia ice surfaces preferentially leads to the formation of methylamine (CH₃NH₂) compared to the production of simpler nitrile species such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and cyanogen (HNC). Detailed analysis of potential energy surfaces reveals a kinetically favorable reaction mechanism for methylamine synthesis, providing crucial data for refining astrochemical kinetic models. The findings highlight the importance of considering complex reaction networks beyond simple radical-radical processes in accurately simulating the chemical evolution of interstellar ices and, consequently, the abundance of nitrogen-bearing molecules in star-forming regions. These data contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of prebiotic chemical pathways in space.
