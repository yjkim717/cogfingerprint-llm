**Abstract**

The interplay between vibrational dynamics and chemical reactivity remains a significant challenge in understanding photophysical and photochemical processes. This research leverages advanced quantum mechanical techniques to probe the influence of vibrational strong coupling on chemical kinetics within an optical cavity environment. Specifically, we model systems where solvent interactions introduce dissipative effects, complicating reaction pathways and altering radiative lifetimes. Our simulations demonstrate that strong coupling between vibrational modes and the excited state significantly impacts reaction rates, leading to observable deviations from conventional Marcus theory. 

The optical cavity serves as a confining potential, amplifying these coupling effects and providing a platform for investigating quantum dynamics at the onset of chemical transformation.  Analyzing the response of the system to solvent perturbations reveals a nuanced relationship between vibrational coherence, radiative decay, and chemical reactivity. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive theoretical framework for predicting and controlling chemical reactions in complex, optically active media, with implications for areas ranging from photocatalysis to biological sensing (2024).
