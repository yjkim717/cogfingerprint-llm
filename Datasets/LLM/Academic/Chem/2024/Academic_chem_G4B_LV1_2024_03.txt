**Abstract**

The accelerating pace of materials chemistry research necessitates robust data management strategies to ensure reproducible outcomes and accelerate scientific discovery. This study investigates the critical role of “FAIR” data principles – Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable – within the context of specialized data repositories. We argue that widespread adoption of FAIR data practices is paramount for maximizing the utility of increasingly complex materials datasets. Specifically, enhanced interoperability between diverse repository formats and standardized metadata schemas are identified as key enablers.  Furthermore, this work explores the evolving landscape of curated repositories dedicated to materials science, highlighting their potential to foster collaboration and facilitate advanced data analytics.  Ultimately, prioritizing FAIR data infrastructure represents a foundational investment for the future of the field.
