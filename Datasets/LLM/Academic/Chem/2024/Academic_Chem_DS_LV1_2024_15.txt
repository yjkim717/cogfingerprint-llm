The implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles is fundamentally reshaping the landscape of materials chemistry research. This article examines how curated data repositories, employing standardized metadata schemas and persistent identifiers, are catalyzing a paradigm shift from isolated data generation to collaborative knowledge discovery. We argue that the systematic application of these practices not only enhances data provenance and reproducibility but also accelerates the design of novel functional materials by enabling advanced data mining and machine learning approaches. The resulting interconnected data ecosystem is posited as a critical enabler for addressing complex global challenges in sustainable energy and advanced manufacturing.
