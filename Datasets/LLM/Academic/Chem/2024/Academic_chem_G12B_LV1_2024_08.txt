## Abstract: Resonant Control of Non-Equilibrium Chemical Dynamics via Vibrational Strong Coupling in a Dissipative Environment

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics offers unprecedented opportunities to manipulate chemical reactions at a fundamental level. This work investigates the impact of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on non-equilibrium chemical dynamics, specifically focusing on resonant modifications of reaction rates within a dissipative solvent environment. Utilizing a combination of theoretical modeling and quantum dynamical simulations, we explore a prototypical bimolecular reaction subject to VSC with a molecular vibrational mode confined within an optical cavity. Our simulations reveal that resonant interactions between the reaction coordinate and the cavity mode lead to significant alterations in reaction kinetics, exhibiting deviations from traditional transition state theory predictions, particularly under non-equilibrium conditions.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that the dissipative nature of the surrounding solvent, modeled through a generalized Langevin equation, critically influences the robustness and timescale of these modifications.  Specifically, the coupling strength and cavity decay rate dictate the emergence of non-Markovian effects impacting the reaction pathway. These findings suggest a pathway towards the rational design of light-enhanced chemical processes by exploiting VSC to achieve resonant control over reaction rates, potentially offering new avenues for chemical synthesis and catalysis in 2024 and beyond.
