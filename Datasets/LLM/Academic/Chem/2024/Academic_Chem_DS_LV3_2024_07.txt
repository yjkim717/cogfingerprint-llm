The systematic implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles within materials chemistry is fundamentally transforming research methodologies in 2024. By leveraging domain-specific data repositories, the community has established robust frameworks that ensure unprecedented data accessibility and semantic interoperability. This paradigm shift facilitates advanced data mining and machine learning applications, directly accelerating the rate of novel materials discovery. Consequently, these standardized practices are fostering unprecedented levels of global scientific collaboration, enabling the integration of disparate datasets for complex, multi-faceted investigations. The resultant ecosystem not only enhances reproducibility but also establishes a new foundation for data-driven innovation in the design of next-generation functional materials.
