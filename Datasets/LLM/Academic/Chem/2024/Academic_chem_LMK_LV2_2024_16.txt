"In this study, we examine the impact of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on chemical kinetics within an optical cavity using quantum dynamical methods. Focusing on the collective VSC regime, we investigate how cavity-modified interactions influence reaction rates. By applying a rigorous quantum mechanical framework, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing VSC-modified chemical kinetics. Our results provide insight into the role of cavity-mediated collective effects on chemical reactivity, shedding light on the potential for VSC to modulate reaction pathways. This work contributes to the understanding of VSC's influence on chemical dynamics."
