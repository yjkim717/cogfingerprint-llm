Title: Unveiling the Role of Carbon Accretion in Interstellar Ices: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Kinetic Study

Abstract:
The accretion of carbon atoms onto interstellar ices is a pivotal process in the formation of complex organic molecules. This study investigates the interaction of carbon atoms with ammonia (NH3) in interstellar ices, employing quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical kinetic models. Our results demonstrate that the reaction of carbon atoms with NH3 initiates a hydrogenation network, yielding methylamine (CH3NH2) and other nitrogen-bearing species. The calculated reaction pathways and rate coefficients are incorporated into an astrochemical kinetic model, simulating the formation of these molecules under interstellar conditions. Our findings provide insights into the role of carbon accretion in the chemistry of interstellar ices, shedding light on the origins of complex organic molecules in star-forming regions. The results have implications for understanding the astrochemical evolution of molecular clouds. (2024)
