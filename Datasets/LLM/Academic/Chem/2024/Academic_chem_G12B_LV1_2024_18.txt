## Abstract: Formation Pathways of Methylamine in Interstellar Ices via Carbon Accretion onto Ammonia-Water Mixtures

Understanding the formation of complex nitrogen-containing molecules in interstellar ices is crucial for refining astrochemical models of star and planet formation. This study investigates the reaction pathways leading to methylamine (CH₃NH₂) within dense, cold environments, specifically focusing on the accretion of carbon atoms onto ammonia-water (NH₃-H₂O) ices. Utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations, including density functional theory (DFT) and explicitly correlated methods, we explore the energetics and reaction mechanisms of carbon addition to NH₃ within a realistic ice matrix. Our findings demonstrate that direct carbon accretion onto ammonia preferentially yields methylamine as the dominant product, bypassing the formation of less stable intermediates such as imines or formamides. The presence of water ice significantly influences the reaction landscape, providing a hydrogen-bonding network that stabilizes certain transition states and alters the relative product distributions. These results provide a computationally robust pathway for methylamine formation, consistent with recent observational detections.  The derived rate constants, incorporating temperature dependence, are presented and discussed in the context of their implications for astrochemical modeling, highlighting the importance of considering mixed-ice compositions when predicting the abundance of this key prebiotic molecule in interstellar environments.
