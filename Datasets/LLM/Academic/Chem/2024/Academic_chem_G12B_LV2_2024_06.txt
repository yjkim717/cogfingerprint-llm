## Abstract: Carbon Accretion Pathways in Interstellar Ices: Quantum Chemical Insights into Methylamine Formation

The chemical complexity observed in interstellar ices necessitates a thorough understanding of reaction pathways under low-temperature conditions. This study investigates the impact of carbon accretion on ammonia (NH₃), a ubiquitous molecule in interstellar environments, utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations. Specifically, we explore the viability of forming methylamine (CH₃NH₂) via carbon addition and subsequent hydrogenation within ice matrices. Our calculations, employing density functional theory and explicitly correlated methods, demonstrate that carbon addition to ammonia preferentially leads to methylamine formation compared to the production of simpler carbon-bearing species. The calculated reaction energetics reveal a kinetically favorable pathway towards methylamine, suggesting its accessibility under plausible astrophysical conditions.  These findings contribute to a refined understanding of the molecular evolution within interstellar ices and provide valuable insights into the origins of nitrogen-containing organic molecules, crucial building blocks for prebiotic chemistry. The implications of this work emphasize the importance of considering carbon accretion as a significant route for methylamine synthesis in dense molecular clouds, potentially influencing the chemical inventory available for planet formation.
