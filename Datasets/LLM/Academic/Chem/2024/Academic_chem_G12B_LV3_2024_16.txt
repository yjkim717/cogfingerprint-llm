**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of vibrational strong coupling presents novel avenues for manipulating chemical reactivity. This study employs advanced quantum dynamics simulations to explore the impact of strong coupling between molecular vibrational modes and optical cavity fields on reaction kinetics. Our findings demonstrate that significant modifications to reaction rates and product distributions are predominantly manifested under non-equilibrium conditions, challenging prior assumptions of solely adiabatic behavior. Specifically, we observe transient enhancement and suppression of reactivity driven by coherent vibrational dynamics within the cavity. These results highlight the crucial role of time-resolved measurements and tailored pulsed excitation schemes for realizing effective control over chemical transformations. This work offers a theoretical framework for designing experimentally feasible protocols to modulate reactivity via strong coupling, paving the way for advancements in areas such as photocatalysis and selective synthesis.
