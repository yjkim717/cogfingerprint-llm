## Abstract: Resonant Control of Chemical Reactivity via Vibrational Strong Coupling in Dissipative Environments

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers unprecedented opportunities to manipulate chemical processes at the quantum level. This work investigates the impact of vibrational strong coupling (VSC) on chemical reactivity within an optical cavity, extending previous theoretical frameworks to incorporate the crucial role of a dissipative solvent environment. Employing quantum dynamical methods, we demonstrate that VSC induces a resonant modification of reaction rates, deviating significantly from predictions based on standard chemical kinetics. Specifically, we observe enhanced reactivity when vibrational modes of a reactant molecule are brought into strong coupling with a cavity field, leading to a breakdown of adiabatic approximations typically used to describe chemical dynamics. The inclusion of a dissipative solvent, modeled through a Lindblad master equation, reveals that while decoherence dampens the VSC effects, a judicious choice of cavity parameters allows for sustained, non-equilibrium control over reaction pathways. These findings highlight the potential for engineering chemical reactivity through resonant manipulation of molecular vibrations within cQED systems, offering a pathway toward novel chemical synthesis strategies.
