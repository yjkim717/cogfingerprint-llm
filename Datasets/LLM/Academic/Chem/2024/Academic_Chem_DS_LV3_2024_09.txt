In this computational study, we investigate the formation pathways of methanimine (CH2NH) and methylamine (CH3NH2) via carbon atom condensation on mixed NH3–H2O interstellar ice mantles. Utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations, including coupled-cluster theory and density functional theory with dispersion corrections, we map a previously unexplored hydrogenation network initiated by C(³P) atom addition. Our results demonstrate that carbon condensation onto an ammonia-water cluster efficiently yields key C1 species, which undergo sequential hydrogenation. The reaction coordinate reveals a low-energy barrier pathway for the conversion of methanimine to methylamine, a crucial prebiotic molecule, under simulated cold molecular cloud conditions (T = 10–20 K). This non-radical mechanism provides a robust alternative to traditional gas-phase or radical-mediated formation routes, significantly enhancing the predicted astrophysical abundances. These findings, contextualized within 2024 astrochemical models, underscore the critical role of heterogeneous grain-surface chemistry in the interstellar synthesis of complex organic molecules, with direct implications for the molecular inventory of star-forming regions and the origins of molecular complexity in space.
