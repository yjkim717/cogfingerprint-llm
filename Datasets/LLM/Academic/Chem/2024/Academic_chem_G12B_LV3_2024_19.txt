**Abstract:** The accelerating pace of materials chemistry research necessitates robust data management strategies to facilitate knowledge discovery and accelerate innovation. This study, conducted in 2024, examines the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles within the field, critically evaluating the efficacy of prominent data repositories. Our analysis assesses the current landscape of materials data sharing, highlighting challenges related to metadata standardization, data provenance, and long-term preservation. We argue that widespread adoption of FAIR practices is crucial for fostering collaborative research, minimizing redundancy, and ultimately, advancing the development of novel materials. The findings underscore the need for incentivizing data deposition and promoting community-driven efforts to ensure the continued growth of accessible and high-quality materials data resources.
