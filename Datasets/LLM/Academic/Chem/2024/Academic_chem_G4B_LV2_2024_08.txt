**Abstract**

The intricate interplay between chemical kinetics and quantum dynamics represents a burgeoning area of research, particularly when considering the influence of environmental factors. This work investigates the modification of reaction pathways within optical cavities, leveraging quantum dynamical methods to probe vibrational strong coupling effects. Specifically, we examine how the presence of a dissipative solvent impacts collective reactivity, a phenomenon previously observed in isolated quantum systems but requiring careful consideration within a coupled environment. Our simulations, conducted in 2024, reveal that vibrational strong coupling significantly alters the timescale and probability of key reaction intermediates, leading to observable shifts in the overall reaction rate. The optical cavity acts as a resonant environment, amplifying these quantum effects and creating a non-Markovian dynamics. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of chemical reaction mechanisms in complex, light-matter systems and offer potential pathways for tailored chemical control through optical manipulation.
