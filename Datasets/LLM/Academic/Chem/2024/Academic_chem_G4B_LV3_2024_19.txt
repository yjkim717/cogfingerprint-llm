**Abstract**

The imperative for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles is rapidly gaining prominence within materials chemistry. This study examines the strategic deployment of specialized data repositories as a critical enabler of accelerated research progress.  Effective data management, including metadata standardization and robust data sharing protocols, directly supports enhanced knowledge discovery and fosters more efficient collaborative endeavors.  We argue that widespread adoption of these practices—particularly concerning materials characterization data—is essential to mitigate bias, accelerate materials innovation, and ultimately, establish a more reproducible and trustworthy scientific record within the field by 2024.
