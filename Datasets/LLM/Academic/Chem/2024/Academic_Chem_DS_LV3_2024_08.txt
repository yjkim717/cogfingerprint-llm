In this theoretical investigation, we employ advanced quantum dynamical simulations to elucidate the mechanisms of cavity-modified chemical kinetics within the vibrational strong coupling (VSC) regime. Our findings demonstrate that the frequently reported alterations in chemical reactivity are not inherent thermodynamic effects but rather emergent phenomena strictly contingent upon non-equilibrium conditions. By precisely modeling the collective interaction between an ensemble of molecular dipoles and the quantized field of a Fabry–Perot optical cavity, we establish that the redistribution of vibrational energy landscapes alone is insufficient to modify reaction rates at thermal equilibrium. Consequently, this work provides a crucial theoretical framework distinguishing equilibrium from driven VSC effects and proposes targeted experimental protocols—utilizing specific infrared pumping schemes—to achieve measurable rate enhancements in condensed-phase systems, thereby reconciling longstanding controversies in polaritonic chemistry.
