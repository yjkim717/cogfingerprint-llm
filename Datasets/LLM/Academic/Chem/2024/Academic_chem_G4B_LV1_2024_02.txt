**Abstract: Formation of Methylamine on Ammonia-Water Ices in Interstellar Environments**

The prevalence of interstellar ices, particularly ammonia (NH₃) and water (H₂O) mixtures, necessitates a thorough understanding of their chemical evolution. This research presents a quantum chemical investigation into the carbon condensation pathways occurring on these ices, focusing on the formation of complex organic molecules. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we examined the energetics of various carbon-containing species reacting with NH₃ and H₂O. Our analysis demonstrates that methylamine (CH₃NH₂) emerges as the thermodynamically favored product under relevant interstellar conditions. 

Specifically, we observed a significant barrier to the formation of larger, less stable carbonaceous compounds.  Astrochemical kinetics modeling, informed by these quantum chemical results, suggests that methylamine’s stability – supported by its compact structure – allows for its preferential accumulation within interstellar ices. This finding contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting methylamine as a key intermediate in the prebiotic chemistry of cold, dark molecular clouds, with implications for the delivery of organic molecules to nascent planetary systems.
