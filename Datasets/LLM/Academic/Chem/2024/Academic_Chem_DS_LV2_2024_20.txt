This study employs advanced quantum dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of vibrational strong coupling within an optical cavity on chemical reaction kinetics. Our analysis reveals that significant cavity-induced modifications to reaction rates emerge exclusively under non-equilibrium conditions and are contingent upon operation within the collective strong coupling regime. These findings delineate a critical boundary for observing polaritonic chemistry effects, demonstrating that the mere presence of a cavity mode is insufficient to alter kinetics. The results provide a fundamental theoretical framework, resolving apparent contradictions in the literature by highlighting the essential role of collective vibrational responses and non-equilibrium molecular states in facilitating cavity-mediated control over chemical transformations.
