In this 2024 study, we employ advanced quantum dynamical simulations to elucidate cavity-modified chemical kinetics under vibrational strong coupling conditions. Our theoretical framework demonstrates that while equilibrium reaction rates remain unperturbed by optical cavity confinement, significant kinetic modifications emerge exclusively in non-equilibrium regimes. Through analysis of collective vibrational coupling in molecular ensembles, we establish that cavity-induced quantum coherences selectively alter reaction pathways when systems are driven from thermodynamic equilibrium. These findings fundamentally challenge prevailing interpretations of polaritonic chemistry by revealing that cavity control of chemical reactivity operates through non-equilibrium quantum dynamics rather than static rate modifications. This work provides crucial insights for designing cavity-assisted catalytic systems and establishes new theoretical paradigms for manipulating chemical transformations through quantum light-matter interactions.
