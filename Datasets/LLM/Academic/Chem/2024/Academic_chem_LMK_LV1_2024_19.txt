Title: Enhancing Materials Chemistry Research through FAIR Data Practices: A Critical Examination of Data Repositories

Abstract:
The advent of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices has revolutionized the field of materials chemistry by facilitating the sharing and integration of scientific data. As of 2024, the proliferation of data repositories has further accelerated the pace of knowledge discovery in this domain. This study undertakes a comprehensive analysis of prominent data repositories, including the Materials Project and the Cambridge Structural Database, to elucidate their role in promoting collaborative research. By examining the data curation and management protocols employed by these repositories, we identify best practices for ensuring the FAIRness of materials chemistry data. Our findings underscore the significance of standardized data reporting and metadata annotation in fostering a culture of data-driven innovation. Ultimately, this research highlights the potential of FAIR data practices to transform materials chemistry research by facilitating cross-disciplinary collaboration and expediting the discovery of novel materials.
