In this 2024 study, we employ quantum dynamical simulations to elucidate how vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in optical cavities modifies chemical kinetics. While conventional transition state theory predicts no equilibrium rate alterations, our findings demonstrate that significant reactivity changes emerge exclusively under out-of-equilibrium conditions. Through analysis of collective vibrational modes in the strong coupling regime, we establish that cavity-induced quantum coherences selectively enhance reaction pathways when molecular systems are driven from thermodynamic equilibrium. These results fundamentally challenge the paradigm of cavity-modified chemistry by revealing that collective quantum effects operate specifically in non-equilibrium scenarios, providing new design principles for controlling chemical transformations through photonic environments. This work establishes a foundational framework for manipulating reaction dynamics using quantum light-matter interactions.
