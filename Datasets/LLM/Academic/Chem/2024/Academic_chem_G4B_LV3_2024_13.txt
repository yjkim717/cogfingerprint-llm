**Abstract**

The formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments hinges critically on efficient pathways for carbon processing. This study utilizes quantum chemical calculations to examine the reaction kinetics of carbon atoms reacting with ammonia ices, a prevalent constituent of interstellar ices. Our investigations demonstrate that methylamine (CH₃NH₂) emerges as the statistically favored product, exhibiting significantly enhanced stability against hydrogen abstraction compared to alternative reaction pathways.  Astrochemical models incorporating this preferential methylamine formation rate are presented.  Furthermore, we explore the influence of vibrational modes within the ammonia ice matrix on reaction energetics, suggesting a nuanced interplay between quantum mechanical effects and interstellar conditions. These findings contribute to a refined understanding of the chemical complexity achievable in cold, dark molecular clouds and provide valuable constraints for interpreting observational data related to interstellar ices and carbon accretion.
