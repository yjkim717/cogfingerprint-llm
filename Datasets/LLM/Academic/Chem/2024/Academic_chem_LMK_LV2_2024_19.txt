In 2024, the imperative for FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices in materials chemistry is underscored by the burgeoning need for collaborative research and knowledge discovery. This study examines the pivotal role of data repositories in promoting data sharing and reuse. Key repositories are identified and their functionalities assessed. The findings highlight the significance of standardized data curation and metadata annotation in facilitating scientific collaboration. By advancing FAIR data practices, materials chemistry research can be accelerated, fostering innovation and expediting the discovery of novel materials with tailored properties.
