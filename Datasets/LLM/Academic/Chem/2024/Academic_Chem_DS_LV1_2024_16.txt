**Abstract**

The manipulation of chemical kinetics via vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in optical cavities represents a frontier in polaritonic chemistry. While initial studies proposed equilibrium ground-state modifications, our 2024 investigation demonstrates that the dominant mechanism for cavity-altered reaction rates arises under nonequilibrium conditions. By developing a quantum dynamical framework for an ensemble of molecules coupled to a cavity mode, we show that the formation of vibrational polaritons significantly perturbs the system's evolution on excited-state potential energy surfaces. This work establishes that the collective VSC regime primarily accelerates chemical processes by opening nonequilibrium photonic pathways, fundamentally revising our understanding of cavity influences on molecular quantum dynamics and offering new principles for controlling chemical reactivity.
