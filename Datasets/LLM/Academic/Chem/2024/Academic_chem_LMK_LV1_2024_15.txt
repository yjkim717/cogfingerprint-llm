Title: Enhancing Materials Chemistry Research through FAIR Data Practices: A Review of Key Data Repositories

Abstract:
The rapid advancement of materials chemistry research is contingent upon the effective sharing and reuse of scientific data. In 2024, the adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data practices has become crucial for facilitating collaboration and accelerating knowledge discovery. This review examines the role of prominent data repositories in promoting FAIR data practices within the materials chemistry community. We survey existing data repositories, assessing their compliance with FAIR principles and their capacity to support the curation, sharing, and integration of materials chemistry data. Our analysis highlights the benefits of FAIR data practices, including enhanced data discoverability, improved reproducibility, and increased scientific collaboration. By identifying best practices and areas for improvement, this review aims to inform the development of future data repositories and advance the field of materials chemistry through more effective data-driven research.
