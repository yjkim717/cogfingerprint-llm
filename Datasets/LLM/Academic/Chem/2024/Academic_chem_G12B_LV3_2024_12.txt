**Abstract**

This work explores the influence of vibrational strong coupling within optical cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) on chemical reaction dynamics. Employing advanced quantum dynamical simulations, we investigate the impact of resonant interactions on chemical kinetics. Our findings demonstrate that, under equilibrium conditions, reactivity remains largely unaffected by the presence of strong coupling. However, we observe a distinct modification of reaction pathways and rates when systems are subjected to non-equilibrium driving. This suggests that while equilibrium chemical behavior is robust, cQED environments offer a powerful platform for manipulating reactivity through controlled, non-equilibrium processes, presenting novel avenues for chemical control and design.



I aimed for a formal tone, precise language (e.g., "quantum dynamical simulations," "non-equilibrium driving"), and a structured argument progressing from the initial observation to the implications.
