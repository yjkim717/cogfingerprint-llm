This study critically evaluates the implementation of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data principles within materials chemistry. Through a systematic analysis of contemporary data repositories, we demonstrate that standardized metadata schemas and persistent identifiers are pivotal for enhancing data interoperability. Our findings indicate that such practices significantly accelerate knowledge discovery by enabling advanced data mining and machine learning applications. We conclude that robust, domain-specific data infrastructures are essential for fostering collaborative research and driving innovation in next-generation materials design, thereby solidifying the foundational role of data sharing in the field.
