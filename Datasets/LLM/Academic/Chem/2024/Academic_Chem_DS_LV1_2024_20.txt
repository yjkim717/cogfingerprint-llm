**Abstract**

The manipulation of chemical kinetics via vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in optical cavities represents a frontier in polaritonic chemistry. While experiments demonstrate rate modifications, a unified theoretical framework remains elusive. Herein, we employ a quantum dynamical model to elucidate the critical role of non-equilibrium conditions in the collective VSC regime. Our simulations reveal that the formation of vibrational polaritons alone is insufficient to alter reaction rates under thermal equilibrium. Significant kinetic changes emerge exclusively when a non-thermal distribution of vibrational states is established, typically through coherent optical excitation or rapid energy injection. These findings establish a fundamental prerequisite for cavity-modified chemistry, reconciling disparate experimental observations and guiding the design of polaritonic reactors for controlling molecular transformations.
