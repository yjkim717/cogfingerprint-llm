**Abstract**

The chemical complexity of interstellar ices, crucial for understanding the origins of prebiotic molecules, remains a significant area of astrochemical investigation. This study explores the dominant reaction pathways during carbon atom condensation within NH<sub>3</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O ices, a prevalent scenario in cold molecular clouds. Employing high-level quantum chemical calculations, we investigated a comprehensive hydrogenation network involving numerous intermediates and products formed upon exposure to atomic carbon. Our findings demonstrate a marked preference for the formation of methylamine (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>) over alternative nitrile species, such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and its isomer, cyanogen (HNC). Analysis of reaction energetics reveals that the incorporation of a methyl group onto ammonia represents a kinetically favorable route, effectively suppressing the formation of simpler, more linear nitriles. This observation challenges previous assumptions regarding the dominant carbon incorporation pathways in interstellar ices. The implications of this carbon atom condensation mechanism for the efficient synthesis of amino-containing molecules in the interstellar medium are discussed, highlighting the potential role of methylamine as a key precursor in the delivery of building blocks for life.
