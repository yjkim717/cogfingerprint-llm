**Abstract**

The interplay between quantum dynamics and chemical kinetics remains a central challenge in understanding reaction mechanisms, particularly in complex environments. This work investigates the influence of vibrational strong coupling and a dissipative solvent on the quantum behavior of chemically reacting species confined within an optical cavity. Utilizing time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, we observed a significant deviation from classical kinetic predictions, attributed to enhanced quantum coherence within the cavity’s resonant modes. Specifically, the solvent’s inherent viscosity induced a non-Markovian dissipation, effectively ‘squeezing’ the vibrational energy levels and modulating the reaction rate. These findings demonstrate a novel pathway for controlling chemical reactivity through the manipulation of quantum states and environmental decoherence. Future research will focus on quantifying the precise coupling strengths and exploring the broader implications for photochemically driven processes.
