**Abstract**

The imperative for robust data management is rapidly escalating within materials chemistry, driven by the need for reproducible research and accelerated innovation. This study examines the critical role of “FAIR” data principles – Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable – in advancing the field. Specifically, we analyze the burgeoning landscape of dedicated data repositories as central infrastructure for disseminating materials science data.  Increased data sharing through these repositories fosters enhanced collaboration among researchers, facilitating meta-analysis and the identification of novel material properties.  Furthermore, the implementation of standardized metadata and controlled vocabularies, coupled with robust data curation practices, ensures “fair data” – minimizing bias and maximizing interpretability.  This work highlights the necessity for proactive strategies to promote widespread adoption of FAIR data practices, ultimately strengthening the foundation of materials chemistry research in 2024 and beyond.
