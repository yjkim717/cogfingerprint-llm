**Abstract**

The accelerating pace of materials discovery necessitates a paradigm shift towards enhanced data management and sharing within the field of materials chemistry. This work investigates the imperative of implementing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles to optimize the utility and impact of experimental and computational datasets. Current challenges in materials science—including reproducibility crises and fragmented knowledge bases—are directly linked to inconsistent data deposition and inadequate metadata standards. We examine existing materials chemistry data repositories, evaluating their adherence to FAIR guidelines and identifying key areas for improvement. Furthermore, we explore the potential of emerging semantic technologies, such as ontologies and knowledge graphs, to facilitate knowledge discovery and accelerate materials innovation by enabling automated data integration and reasoning. The promotion of FAIR data practices is presented as a critical enabler for the development of predictive models, automated synthesis planning, and ultimately, a more efficient and collaborative materials research ecosystem. This study advocates for a community-wide adoption of FAIR principles and proposes actionable strategies for fostering a sustainable data infrastructure within materials chemistry.



I aimed for:

*   **Formal Tone:** Using precise language and avoiding colloquialisms.
*   **Chem-Specific Terminology:** Including words like "materials discovery," "metadata," "ontologies," and "knowledge graphs."
*   **Structured Reasoning:** Presenting a problem, exploring solutions, and concluding with an argument.
*   **Year Context:** Framing the need for these principles within the current urgency of materials science advancements.
