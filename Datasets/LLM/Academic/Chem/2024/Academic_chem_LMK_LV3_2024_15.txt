In 2024, the integration of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data practices in materials chemistry is revolutionizing scientific collaboration and knowledge discovery. By standardizing data repositories and fostering a culture of data sharing, researchers can accelerate the discovery of novel materials with tailored properties. This paradigm shift enables the global materials chemistry community to leverage collective knowledge, driving innovation and expediting the development of sustainable technologies. As a result, FAIR data practices are poised to become a cornerstone of modern materials research, facilitating breakthroughs and informing policy decisions.
