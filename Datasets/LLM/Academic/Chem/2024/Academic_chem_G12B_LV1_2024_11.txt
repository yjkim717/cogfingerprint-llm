**Abstract**

The accelerating pace of materials discovery necessitates a paradigm shift towards more efficient and reproducible research workflows. This work investigates the crucial role of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles in advancing materials chemistry, specifically focusing on the impact of curated data repositories. While significant experimental and computational efforts generate vast datasets characterizing material properties and synthesis procedures, the limited adoption of FAIR practices hinders knowledge discovery and slows the overall innovation cycle. We analyze current data landscape within materials chemistry, identifying bottlenecks in data deposition, standardization, and semantic interoperability. Furthermore, we explore emerging strategies leveraging ontologies, persistent identifiers (DOIs), and automated metadata generation to enhance data findability and reusability. This perspective argues that proactive implementation of FAIR data management protocols, coupled with increased community engagement in utilizing and contributing to specialized data repositories, is pivotal for accelerating materials design, validating computational predictions, and realizing the full potential of data-driven materials chemistry in 2024 and beyond.
