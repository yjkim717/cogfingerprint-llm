**Abstract**

The manipulation of chemical kinetics via vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in optical cavities represents a frontier in polaritonic chemistry. While initial experiments demonstrated significant rate modifications, the underlying quantum mechanisms, particularly in the collective regime, remain debated. This 2024 study employs a fully quantum dynamical framework to model the non-equilibrium reactivity of a molecular ensemble under strong light-matter coupling. Our simulations reveal that the formation of collective vibrational polaritons leads to a pronounced suppression of a model proton-transfer reaction. Crucially, this effect is contingent upon the initial preparation of a non-thermal vibrational state, as the system rapidly thermalizes under equilibrium conditions, erasing the catalytic effect. These findings establish non-equilibrium population as a critical prerequisite for VSC-mediated control, resolving key theoretical contradictions and guiding future experimental design.
