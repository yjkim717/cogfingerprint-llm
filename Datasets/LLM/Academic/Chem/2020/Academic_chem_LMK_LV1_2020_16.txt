Title: Exploring Polariton-Mediated Electron Transfer in the Ultra-Strong Coupling Regime

Abstract:
The manipulation of chemical reactions through cavity quantum electrodynamics has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this study, we investigate the phenomenon of polariton-mediated electron transfer within the framework of ultra-strong coupling. By employing a combination of analytic rate constant theory and quantum dynamical simulations, we examine the impact of strong light-matter interactions on charge transfer reactions. Our results demonstrate that the formation of polaritons can significantly enhance or suppress electron transfer rates, depending on the specific coupling strength and detuning. We observe a non-monotonic dependence of the rate constant on the cavity photon frequency, highlighting the complex interplay between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlling chemical reactivity through polariton-mediated electron transfer, with implications for the development of novel optoelectronic devices and photocatalytic systems.
