Of particular interest in contemporary materials chemistry are dynamic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) whose structures and properties can evolve over time in response to external stimuli. This perspective examines the fundamental challenges in engineering such spatiotemporal control within porous solids, focusing on the relationship between framework flexibility, energy barriers for structural transitions, and the resultant dynamic behavior. We analyze design strategies for modulating these energy landscapes through judicious selection of organic linkers and metal nodes, thereby enabling predictable and reversible transformations. The discussion highlights how a mechanistic understanding of these dynamic processes is critical for advancing applications in molecular separations, sensing, and catalysis, where time-dependent property adjustments offer significant functional advantages over static porous materials. This work provides a framework for the rational design of next-generation adaptive MOFs.
