In the interstellar medium, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) on amorphous solid water (ASW) ice surfaces represents a critical pathway for the formation of complex organic molecules, yet the mechanism enabling hydrogen (H) atom mobility at cryogenic temperatures remains incompletely understood. This study investigates the hypothesis that H atoms can diffuse through microscopic cracks and pores within the ASW matrix to access and react with embedded CO molecules, a process not limited to surface diffusion. Through a series of temperature-programmed desorption and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy experiments, we demonstrate that this diffusion-mediated mechanism facilitates the sequential hydrogenation of CO to formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) at temperatures as high as 70 K. These findings challenge the conventional model which attributes reactivity solely to H-atom diffusion on the ice surface. We conclude that the internal microstructure of ASW, particularly its network of cracks, is a crucial factor governing solid-state reaction efficiencies in astrophysical environments, with significant implications for our understanding of molecular complexity in star-forming regions.
