**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is increasingly focused on transitioning beyond static, crystalline architectures towards dynamic and responsive materials. This work addresses the nascent challenge of engineering *spatiotemporal* evolution within MOF frameworks, specifically investigating the feasibility of controlling their behavior across four dimensions – length, width, height, and time. Utilizing advanced computational modeling and theoretical frameworks, we examine the underlying mechanisms governing observed dynamic phenomena, such as morphological changes and guest molecule diffusion.  We hypothesize that precise control of framework topology and chemical functionality can induce predictable, multi-scale transformations.  This research highlights the potential for these “four-dimensional” framework materials to be utilized in advanced applications including adaptive sensing, controlled release systems, and stimuli-responsive catalysis. Further investigation is required to translate these theoretical insights into tangible material designs and robust, repeatable fabrication processes by 2020.
