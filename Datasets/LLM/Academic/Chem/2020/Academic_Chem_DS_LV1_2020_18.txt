**Abstract**

The relative abundance of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN) isomers in the interstellar medium (ISM) presents a significant challenge for contemporary astrochemical models. This investigation employs high-level quantum chemical calculations, including CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ single-point energies on ωB97X-D/6-311++G(d,p) optimized geometries, to elucidate the physicochemical parameters governing their formation and survival. Our results demonstrate that the observed Z/E ratio cannot be solely attributed to thermodynamic stability, as the energy difference is minimal at the ISM's low temperatures. Instead, we identify the significant disparity in molecular dipole moments (μ_Z >> μ_E) as the dominant factor. This finding supports a proposed 'relative dipole principle,' wherein the isomer with the larger dipole moment exhibits preferential radiative cooling and enhanced interaction with the pervasive interstellar radiation fields and polar grain surfaces, leading to its greater observed abundance. This principle provides a crucial, generalizable correction for gas-grain astrochemical networks, improving the predictive accuracy for complex organic molecule distributions in star-forming regions like Sgr B2(N).
