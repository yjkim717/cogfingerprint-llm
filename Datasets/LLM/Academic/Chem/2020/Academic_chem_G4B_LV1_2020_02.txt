**Abstract**

The investigation of low-temperature molecular species within interstellar media remains a critical area of astrochemistry. This work presents a detailed quantum chemical analysis of the Z- and E- isomers of cyanomethanimine (HC≡CCN), employing *ab initio* methods to accurately determine their respective vibrational and rotational energy levels. Utilizing a high-level coupled cluster basis set, we quantified thermodynamic parameters and spectroscopic properties relevant to interstellar abundance calculations. Subsequent astrochemical modeling, incorporating radiative decay rates and collisional quenching processes, was performed to assess the relative populations of these isomers under typical interstellar conditions.  Results suggest a significant disparity in predicted abundances, with the Z-isomer exhibiting a marginally higher prevalence. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of reactive intermediates and their distribution in cold, dense interstellar clouds, informing spectroscopic observations and furthering the search for complex organic molecules.
