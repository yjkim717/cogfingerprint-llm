**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers novel avenues for controlling chemical reaction dynamics. This study, conducted within the context of intensified interest in light-matter interactions for chemical applications (2020), explores the impact of polariton formation on photoinduced electron transfer (ET) processes. We demonstrate that strategically coupling molecular donor-acceptor systems to optical cavities enables precise manipulation of ET rates, achieving both enhancement and suppression of charge transfer even when involving otherwise inaccessible dark states. Our findings reveal a critical dependence of ET efficiency on the strength of the light-matter coupling and the detuning between the molecular transition and the cavity mode. This work highlights the potential of polariton chemistry as a powerful tool for engineering quantum dynamics in molecular systems, opening new possibilities for controlling reactivity and designing highly efficient light-harvesting and photocatalytic devices.
