**Abstract**

The incorporation of carbon monoxide (CO) into icy grain surfaces is a crucial process in the chemistry of interstellar molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. While CO ice mantles are frequently observed, the mechanisms governing their chemical evolution remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the hydrogenation of CO within amorphous solid water (ASW) matrices, a common form of ice found in space, at astrophysically relevant temperatures. We report that efficient hydrogenation of CO to form formaldehyde (CH₂O) and subsequent products occurs within ASW even at cryogenic temperatures as high as 70 K. Experimental results, utilizing [mention specific experimental techniques, e.g., infrared spectroscopy, temperature-programmed desorption], demonstrate a significant increase in CH₂O abundance with increasing CO exposure and temperature. These findings challenge previous assumptions regarding the temperature thresholds required for significant CO processing in ice mantles. The observed reactivity suggests that diffusive transport of hydrogen atoms within the ASW matrix facilitates hydrogenation reactions, potentially contributing to the observed abundance of complex organic molecules in space. This work provides compelling evidence for the dynamic chemical evolution of icy grain surfaces and highlights the importance of ASW as a reactive medium in astrochemical environments.
