**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) on interstellar dust grain analogues remains a critical pathway for understanding the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in cold molecular clouds. While the reaction network is well-established at very low temperatures (<20 K), its efficiency at elevated temperatures relevant to warmer interstellar environments is less understood, as hydrogen atom diffusion is expected to be thermally inhibited within the bulk of amorphous solid water (ASW) ice. This study investigates the role of morphological defects within ASW matrices in facilitating non-thermal hydrogen transport. Through a combination of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) experiments on CO-doped ASW films, we demonstrate that the sequential hydrogenation to formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) proceeds efficiently at temperatures up to 70 K. We attribute this unexpected reactivity to the diffusion of H atoms along a network of micropores and cracks within the ASW structure, which act as high-mobility pathways, bypassing the need for bulk diffusion. These findings necessitate a revision of current astrochemical models, highlighting that ice porosity, not just temperature, is a dominant factor governing solid-state reactivity in interstellar ices.
