**Abstract**

The interstellar chemical evolution of cyanomethanimine isomers represents a critical nexus for understanding prebiotic molecule formation in the interstellar medium. This investigation employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the non-equilibrium abundance ratio observed between the Z- and E-cyanomethanimine isomers in astronomical surveys. Our results demonstrate that the relative stability, derived from electronic structure computations, provides an incomplete picture of their interstellar prevalence. Instead, we establish that the differential destruction rates in ion-molecule reactions, a dominant process in cold molecular clouds, are the primary regulatory mechanism. Crucially, these reaction kinetics are governed by the relative dipole principle, wherein the distinct permanent dipole moments of the Z- and E-isomers significantly modulate their interaction cross-sections with incoming cations. The isomer with the larger dipole moment experiences a higher collision rate and thus a more rapid depletion. This finding, contextualized within 2020 astrochemical models, resolves the observed Z/E ratio by linking macroscopic abundance directly to a fundamental molecular property. Consequently, this work underscores the necessity of incorporating dipole-mediated kinetics into astrochemical networks for accurate predictions of complex organic molecule distributions in space.
