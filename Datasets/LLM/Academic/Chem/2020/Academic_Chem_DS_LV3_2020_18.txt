In this study, we employ high-level quantum chemical calculations to investigate the interstellar chemistry of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine isomers, key prebiotic molecules detected in the interstellar medium. Our computational results demonstrate that the observed abundance ratio between these structural isomers cannot be adequately explained by thermodynamic stability or formation pathways alone. Instead, we establish that their relative abundances are predominantly governed by differential ion-molecule destruction rates in interstellar environments. These destruction rates exhibit a strong correlation with the isomers' permanent dipole moments, leading us to formulate the "relative dipole principle" as a predictive framework for interstellar isomer populations. This principle posits that in environments dominated by ion-molecule chemistry, isomers with lower dipole moments will experience reduced destruction rates and consequently achieve higher relative abundances. Our findings, contextualized within 2020 astrochemical understanding, provide crucial insights into molecular survival in space and offer a quantitative method for predicting isomer distributions in star-forming regions, thereby advancing our capability to model chemical complexity in the universe.
