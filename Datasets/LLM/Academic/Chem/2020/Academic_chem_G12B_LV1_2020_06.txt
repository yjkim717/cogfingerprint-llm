**Abstract: Isomer Abundance Prediction in Astrochemistry: The Relative Dipole Principle and Application to Cyanomethanimine**

The accurate modeling of interstellar molecular abundances remains a significant challenge in astrochemistry. Isomers, differing only in their structural configuration, introduce complexity due to potentially disparate reaction pathways and observational signatures. This work investigates the isomeric abundances of cyanomethanimine (NCCNH<sub>2</sub>), specifically the *Z*- and *E*-isomers, within the context of dense, cold giant molecular clouds (GMCs). Utilizing recent experimental data on relevant reaction rates and incorporating astrochemical models, we demonstrate a strong correlation between predicted and observed relative abundances of these isomers.

We propose a ‘relative dipole principle’ to rationalize this observed behavior. This principle posits that the ratio of isomer abundances is primarily governed by the difference in their dipole moments, weighted by their respective reactivities towards prevalent interstellar processes, notably radiative association and dissociative recombination.  Specifically, a larger difference in dipole moments favors the isomer with the lower energy configuration, while the overall abundance is modulated by the relative ease of formation and destruction.

Our simulations, incorporating this principle, accurately reproduce the observed ratio of *Z*-NCCNH<sub>2</sub> to *E*-NCCNH<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, we extend this framework to speculate on the isomeric behavior of related imines and nitriles, suggesting that the relative dipole principle may offer a broadly applicable predictive tool for understanding isomer distributions in interstellar ices and gas-phase environments. Future work will focus on refining the principle through incorporation of non-equilibrium effects and exploring its applicability to larger, more complex molecular systems relevant to prebiotic chemistry.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Specificity:** I’ve included chemical formulas (NCCNH<sub>2</sub>) for clarity and precision.
*   **Contextualization:**  I've explicitly mentioned the challenges of interstellar chemistry and the importance of isomer modeling.
*   **Justification:** I’ve stated *why* the relative dipole principle is proposed (correlation with observations) and *how* it works (dipole moment differences and reactivities).
*   **Future Directions:** Briefly outlining future research directions is standard for abstracts.
*   **2020 Context:** The language and scope remain consistent with research trends in astrochemistry during that period.
