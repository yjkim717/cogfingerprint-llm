**Abstract**

Efficient electron transfer processes are fundamental to a broad range of chemical and biological phenomena. This study investigates the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) to significantly modulate these rates through the generation and manipulation of polaritons. Utilizing a light-matter coupling framework, we present quantum dynamical simulations demonstrating enhanced electron transfer pathways within a molecular system embedded within a photonic cavity. Specifically, the strong coupling between photons and molecular excitons leads to the formation of polariton quasiparticles, effectively mediating a hybridized state with altered electronic properties.  These simulations reveal a substantial increase in electron tunneling probability compared to conventional scenarios, contingent upon precise control of cavity resonance and excitation parameters.  The observed enhancement arises from the polariton’s ability to circumvent energy barriers, thereby accelerating the overall electron transfer kinetics.  Further investigation into tailored cavity designs and molecular selection promises to unlock novel strategies for controlled chemical reactions and optoelectronic device development.
