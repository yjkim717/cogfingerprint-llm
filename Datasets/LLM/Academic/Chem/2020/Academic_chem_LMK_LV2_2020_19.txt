Title: Unveiling the Spatiotemporal Evolution of Dynamic Metal-Organic Frameworks

Abstract:
The design of dynamic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored structural dynamics is a pressing challenge in the field of porous solids. Understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of these materials is crucial to unlock their full potential. In this context, the concept of four-dimensional (4D) frameworks emerges as a promising avenue to engineer MOFs with adaptive properties. By elucidating the intricate relationships between structural transformations, guest-host interactions, and external stimuli, researchers can develop novel dynamic materials with enhanced functionality. This article reviews the current state-of-the-art in the field, highlighting key challenges and potential routes to overcome them. Through a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of MOFs, we provide insights into the rational design of 4D frameworks with optimized structural dynamics, paving the way for innovative applications in various fields.
