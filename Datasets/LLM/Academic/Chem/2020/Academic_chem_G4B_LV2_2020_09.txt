**Abstract**

The catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) within amorphous solid water (ASW) presents a compelling avenue for exploring novel hydrogen storage and activation methodologies. This research, conducted in 2020, focused on elucidating the mechanistic pathways governing CO hydrogenation in ASW under elevated temperatures. Utilizing a detailed examination of reaction kinetics, we observed a significant enhancement in reaction efficiency attributable to facilitated hydrogen diffusion through pre-existing microcracks present within the ASW matrix. These cracks effectively serve as preferential pathways for hydrogen transport, dramatically increasing the local concentration of hydrogen available for reaction with adsorbed CO. 

Our findings strongly suggest that the textural properties of ASW, specifically the presence of interconnected porosity, are critical determinants of its catalytic activity.  The observed diffusive hydrogenation process highlights the potential of utilizing ASW as a thermally stable and readily accessible source of activated hydrogen, warranting further investigation into tailored ASW synthesis for optimized catalytic performance in related chemical transformations.
