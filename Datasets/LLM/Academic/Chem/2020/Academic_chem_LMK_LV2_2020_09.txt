Title: Enhanced Hydrogenation of Carbon Monoxide in Amorphous Solid Water: Implications for Interstellar Dust Grain Chemistry

Abstract:
The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) embedded in amorphous solid water (ASW) is investigated in the context of interstellar dust grain chemistry. Laboratory experiments demonstrate that CO hydrogenation reactions occur at elevated temperatures, up to approximately 70 K, within the ASW matrix. The presence of ASW facilitates the reaction by providing a reactive environment that enables the formation of key intermediates. The results indicate that the hydrogenation of CO in ASW is a viable mechanism for the formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments. The findings have significant implications for understanding the chemical evolution of molecular clouds and the origin of organic species in the interstellar medium. This study provides new insights into the role of ASW in promoting hydrogenation reactions on interstellar dust grains, shedding light on the complex chemistry that underlies the formation of planetary systems.
