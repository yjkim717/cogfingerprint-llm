**Abstract**

The prevalence of cyanomethanimine (HC≡CN) isomers, specifically the Z and E forms, represents a significant area of investigation within astrochemical modeling. This study employs high-level *ab initio* quantum chemical calculations coupled with detailed astrochemical simulations to refine estimates of these isomers’ abundances in the G+0.693 giant molecular cloud.  Our results demonstrate a substantially lower Z/E isomer ratio compared to prior theoretical predictions, attributed to enhanced ion-molecule destruction pathways. Crucially, the observed disparity is directly linked to the differing dipole moments of the Z and E isomers, fostering selective reactivity during interstellar chemistry. These findings necessitate a re-evaluation of existing circumstellar abundance models and highlight the critical role of subtle molecular structural features in dictating complex chemical equilibria within extreme astrophysical environments. Further investigation is warranted to assess the broader implications for understanding organic molecule formation in similar interstellar settings.
