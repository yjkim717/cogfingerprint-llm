**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) within amorphous solid water (ASW) represents a compelling pathway for hydrogen storage and a potential route to reduced carbon species. This work reports on an investigation into the kinetics of CO hydrogenation at elevated temperatures, specifically within ASW samples maintained above 20 K.  Experimental results demonstrate that significant CO reduction proceeds at these temperatures, attributed to enhanced hydrogen atom diffusion throughout the ASW matrix.  We hypothesize that the amorphous nature of the ASW facilitates rapid hydrogen transport, circumventing the kinetic limitations typically associated with crystalline ice phases.  Detailed spectroscopic analysis, employing infrared and Raman techniques, reveals a discernible shift in the CO vibrational modes indicative of partial reduction.  Further research is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms governing this diffusive hydrogenation and to optimize ASW composition for maximizing reaction efficiency, potentially paving the way for novel hydrogen storage materials.
