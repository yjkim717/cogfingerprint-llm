In this computational investigation, we elucidate the formation pathways and relative abundances of the Z- and E-isomers of cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN) within the interstellar medium. High-level quantum chemical calculations, employing coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)] with correlation-consistent basis sets, were utilized to determine the relative energetics, rotational constants, and dipole moments of both isomers. Our results confirm the greater thermodynamic stability of the Z-isomer, yet reveal a significantly larger dipole moment for the E-conformer. Subsequent astrochemical modeling, incorporating gas-phase and grain-surface reaction networks, was performed using the UDfA and KIDA databases. The simulated abundances challenge the conventional assumption that relative stability dictates isomer ratios in cold molecular clouds. Instead, we propose a "relative dipole principle," wherein the isomer with the larger dipole moment (E-cyanomethanimine) achieves a higher fractional abundance due to enhanced stabilization in the polar interstellar environment during formation and excitation processes. This principle provides a refined framework for interpreting rotational line surveys from observatories such as ALMA.
