**Abstract**

The chemical complexity of interstellar ice mantles remains a significant challenge to understanding molecular evolution in the cold, dense regions of space. This study investigates the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) within amorphous solid water (ASW) matrices, a prevalent scenario in interstellar environments. Experimental simulations, conducted at temperatures up to ∼70 K, reveal surprisingly efficient formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) from embedded CO following hydrogen exposure. These findings suggest that hydrogen atoms exhibit diffusive transport through micro-fractures and voids inherent in the ASW structure, facilitating reaction with CO despite the low temperatures. The observed reaction rates challenge traditional kinetic models and highlight the importance of considering ice morphology and heterogeneity when modeling gas-grain chemistry. These results contribute to a more accurate understanding of the pathways for complex organic molecule synthesis in interstellar ices, informing astrochemical models and furthering our comprehension of the origins of prebiotic molecules.
