**Abstract**

The catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) represents a critical pathway for H₂ utilization and the synthesis of valuable chemical feedstocks. This research explores the influence of amorphous solid water (ASW) as a support material on the efficiency of diffusive hydrogenation, specifically examining reaction dynamics at elevated temperatures.  Our investigation demonstrates that the presence of microcracks within the ASW matrix significantly enhances CO hydrogenation rates.  These cracks facilitate hydrogen diffusion, effectively circumventing kinetic barriers typically encountered in solid-state reactions.  Detailed analysis suggests that the ASW’s inherent porosity and fracture network create a localized concentration gradient of hydrogen, promoting rapid reaction with adsorbed CO.  The observed performance is attributed to the enhanced accessibility of hydrogen to the reaction sites.  These findings highlight the potential of utilizing ASW, with its inherent structural complexity, as a novel support for heterogeneous catalysts, enabling improved hydrogen diffusion and ultimately, enhanced CO conversion.
