Title: Investigating Isomeric Abundance of Cyanomethanimine in Interstellar Environments: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:
The astrochemical complexity of interstellar environments is influenced by the abundance of isomers, such as Z- and E-cyanomethanimine. This study, conducted in 2020, employs ab initio quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the energetic and thermodynamic properties of these isomers. Astrochemical models are subsequently utilized to simulate their formation and destruction pathways in various interstellar environments. Our results indicate that the Z-isomer is favored under typical interstellar conditions due to its lower energy state and more efficient formation routes. The modeled abundance ratios of Z- to E-cyanomethanimine are compared with observational data, providing insights into the chemical processes governing isomeric abundance in interstellar space. This research enhances our understanding of the chemistry underlying isomer abundance and has implications for the interpretation of observational data in astrochemistry, particularly in the context of complex organic molecule formation.
