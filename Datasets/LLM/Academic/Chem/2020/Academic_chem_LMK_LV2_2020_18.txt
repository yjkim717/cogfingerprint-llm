Title: Unveiling the Chemistry of Cyanomethanimine Isomers in Interstellar Environments: An Astrochemical Modeling and Quantum Chemical Investigation

Abstract:
The chemistry of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine in interstellar environments is investigated through a synergistic approach combining ab initio quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling. Employing high-level quantum chemical methods, we accurately determined the thermodynamic properties and isomerization pathways of cyanomethanimine isomers. Our results indicate that the Z-isomer is thermodynamically favored, while the E-isomer is kinetically stabilized. Astrochemical models, incorporating the computed rate coefficients and thermochemical data, were used to simulate the abundances of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine in various interstellar environments. The models reveal that the isomer abundances are sensitive to the physical conditions and chemical composition of the interstellar medium. Our findings provide new insights into the chemistry of cyanomethanimine and have implications for understanding the astrochemical processes governing the formation and evolution of complex molecules in interstellar space.
