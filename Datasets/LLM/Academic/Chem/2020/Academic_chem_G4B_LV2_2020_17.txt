**Abstract**

The catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) represents a critical pathway for H₂ utilization and the production of valuable chemical feedstocks. This research, conducted in 2020, explored the mechanisms governing CO hydrogenation within amorphous solid water (ASW) at elevated temperatures, specifically examining the role of hydrogen diffusion. Utilizing a novel experimental setup, we observed significant CO hydrogenation activity commencing above 20 K, a threshold directly correlated with the presence of discernible cracks and associated hydrogen diffusion pathways within the ASW matrix. 

These findings suggest that ASW, despite its traditionally low reactivity, can function as a catalytic support, facilitating hydrogen transport and enabling observable reaction kinetics. The observed diffusion through pre-existing microstructural features implies that the ASW’s inherent porosity, rather than its inherent chemical properties, dictates the initial reaction onset. Further investigation into the influence of crack morphology and hydrogen diffusion rates is warranted to fully elucidate the underlying catalytic principles governing this diffusive hydrogenation process.
