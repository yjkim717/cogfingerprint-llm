**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a prominent class of porous materials, yet their inherent static nature limits their utility in numerous applications. This work investigates the burgeoning field of four-dimensional (4D) MOF engineering, focusing on the spatiotemporal evolution of framework materials. Traditional MOF characterization typically confines observation to two or three dimensions; however, the realization of 4D materials – possessing tunable dimensionality and responsiveness – represents a significant paradigm shift. We posit that controlled manipulation of MOF synthesis and post-synthetic modification can elicit dynamic changes in pore size, connectivity, and even framework topology over time, responding to external stimuli. This research highlights the conceptual challenges and emerging strategies for inducing such spatiotemporal evolution, emphasizing the potential for creating truly adaptive and functional materials. Further investigation into the underlying mechanisms governing these transformations is crucial for unlocking the full potential of dynamic MOF systems.
