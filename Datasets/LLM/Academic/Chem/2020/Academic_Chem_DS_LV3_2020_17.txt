In interstellar chemistry, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide within amorphous solid water (ASW) ice mantles represents a critical pathway for molecular complexity in cold astrophysical environments. This 2020 study investigates the diffusion-mediated reaction mechanisms enabling the sequential hydrogenation of CO to formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) at cryogenic temperatures. Through temperature-programmed desorption and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy experiments, we demonstrate that hydrogen atoms efficiently penetrate porous ASW matrices, facilitating CO hydrogenation at temperatures up to 70 K. The persistence of this reactivity suggests that structural defects—specifically microscopic cracks and pores within the ice architecture—serve as conduits for atomic hydrogen diffusion rather than bulk ice mobility. These findings challenge previous models limited to surface-mediated reactions and establish that diffusive hydrogenation proceeds through vacancy-driven transport in disordered ice networks. The implications extend to molecular cloud and protostellar environments where such non-thermal diffusion mechanisms would substantially alter ice mantle composition. Our results provide experimental evidence that complex organic molecule formation can occur efficiently in colder regions of interstellar ices than previously theorized, fundamentally revising our understanding of chemical evolution in star-forming regions.
