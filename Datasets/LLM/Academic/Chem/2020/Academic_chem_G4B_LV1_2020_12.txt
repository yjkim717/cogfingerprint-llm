**Abstract**

The efficient transfer of electrons represents a fundamental challenge in numerous chemical and photochemical processes. This research explores a novel approach to accelerate electron transfer utilizing polariton formation within an optical cavity. Specifically, we demonstrate that strong light-matter coupling between an emitter and the cavity field generates polariton states, significantly enhancing the rate of electron transfer from a donor molecule to an acceptor.  Employing time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, we observed a marked increase in electron transfer kinetics compared to analogous systems lacking polariton generation.  The observed enhancement is attributed to the cooperative excitation of both the emitter and cavity modes, creating a highly resonant environment conducive to efficient energy and electron propagation.  These findings suggest a promising strategy for manipulating reaction dynamics through tailored light-matter interactions, offering potential applications in photocatalysis and molecular electronics. Further investigation into the precise dynamics of polariton-mediated electron transfer is warranted.
