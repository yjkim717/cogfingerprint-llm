The dynamic behavior of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represents an emerging frontier in materials chemistry, yet controlling their spatiotemporal evolution remains a fundamental challenge. This perspective examines strategies for engineering MOFs as four-dimensional dynamic materials, where programmable structural transformations occur over time. We analyze how external stimuli—including light, electric fields, and guest molecules—can be harnessed to direct framework reconfiguration with molecular precision. By establishing design principles that connect molecular-level coordination chemistry to macroscopic material responses, we demonstrate pathways toward creating MOFs with predictable temporal behavior. This approach enables the development of advanced porous solids capable of performing complex functions through controlled structural dynamics, opening new avenues for responsive separation systems, adaptive catalysts, and smart molecular devices. The integration of temporal control with three-dimensional framework architecture establishes a paradigm for next-generation functional materials.
