The burgeoning paradigm of four-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (4D MOFs) represents a pivotal frontier in materials chemistry, moving beyond static architectures to incorporate time as a programmable variable. This review, contextualized circa 2020, critically examines the fundamental mechanisms governing the structural dynamics of these porous solids. We analyze how external stimuli—such as light, guest molecules, or electric fields—induce predictable, reversible conformational changes, thereby enabling precise control over the spatiotemporal evolution of pore geometry and functionality. A central focus is placed on elucidating the intricate relationship between dynamic linker flexibility, framework topology, and emergent selective molecular recognition properties. By establishing design principles for engineering these temporal responses, this work addresses the challenge of harnessing 4D MOFs for advanced applications, including adaptive separation processes, stimuli-responsive drug delivery, and reconfigurable molecular sensing platforms.
