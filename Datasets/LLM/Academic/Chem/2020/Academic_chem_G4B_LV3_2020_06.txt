**Abstract**

The prevalence of small, highly polarized molecules within interstellar environments presents a compelling area for investigation in astrochemical modeling. This study employs *ab initio* quantum chemical calculations coupled with detailed ion-molecule kinetics to reassess the isomeric distribution of cyanomethanimine (HC≡N-CH₃), specifically examining the Z and E isomers within the context of the G+0.693 giant molecular cloud. Our results demonstrate a significantly lower Z/E ratio than previously estimated, attributed primarily to enhanced ion-molecule destruction pathways.  Differential dipole moments between the isomers induce preferential reaction rates, leading to a disproportionate loss of the Z-isomer. These findings contribute to a refined understanding of complex chemical networks operating in dense, cold interstellar clouds. Further modeling incorporating radiative transfer will be crucial to validate these predictions and inform future observations targeting these key interstellar species.
