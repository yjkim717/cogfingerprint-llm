**Abstract:**

Investigating the mechanisms of interstellar carbon monoxide (CO) processing presents a significant challenge due to the extreme conditions prevalent in dust environments. This work explores diffusive hydrogenation reactions within amorphous solid water (ASW) analogs, simulating astrophysical solids, under elevated temperatures (~70 K). Experimental results demonstrate a sustained and efficient generation of hydrogen, notably exceeding 20 K, attributed to hydrogen diffusion facilitated by inherent microcracks present within the ASW matrix.  The observed hydrogen formation kinetics suggest a viable pathway for CO reduction in interstellar dust grains.  These findings provide critical insights into the potential for localized, thermally-driven chemical transformations within these complex environments.  Further research will focus on characterizing the ASW microstructure and quantifying the diffusion coefficient of hydrogen to refine models of CO processing in interstellar dust, with implications for understanding the origins of complex organic molecules.
