**Abstract: Spectroscopic Constraints on Cyanomethanimine Isomers in Astrophysical Environments**

The prevalence of simple organic molecules within interstellar clouds remains a subject of ongoing investigation, particularly concerning the isomeric forms of cyanomethanimine (HCâ‰¡CN). Previous observational data exhibited a notable disparity in the reported abundances of Z- and E- isomers, prompting a theoretical re-evaluation of their formation and stability. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations, utilizing the B3LYP functional with 6-31G* basis sets, to rigorously examine the electronic structure and potential energy surfaces of both isomers. 

Our quantum chemical analysis elucidates subtle differences in their vibrational frequencies and rotational spectra, directly impacting their radiative decay pathways. Specifically, we demonstrate that the E-isomer exhibits a marginally lower energy state, potentially favoring its formation under conditions prevalent in interstellar environments.  Furthermore, we assess the impact of various gas-phase interactions and shielding effects, considering the influence of surrounding hydrogen atoms. 

These findings contribute to a refined understanding of the isomeric distribution within interstellar clouds and offer a plausible explanation for the observed discrepancies, suggesting a dynamic equilibrium between the Z- and E- isomers dictated by quantum mechanical factors.  The results are pertinent to ongoing astrochemical modeling efforts aimed at characterizing the chemical complexity of these remote astrophysical regions.
