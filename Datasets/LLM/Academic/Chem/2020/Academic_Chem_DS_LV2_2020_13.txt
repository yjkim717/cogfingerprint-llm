Of particular significance to astrochemical models is the understanding of surface-mediated hydrogenation reactions on interstellar dust grains, which are crucial for the synthesis of complex organic molecules in cold molecular clouds. This study investigates the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) embedded within amorphous solid water (ASW) ices, a prevalent component of the grain mantle. We demonstrate that the previously assumed temperature barrier of ~30 K for atomic hydrogen diffusion is not absolute. Through a combination of experimental techniques and kinetic modeling, we provide evidence for a non-thermal diffusion mechanism wherein hydrogen atoms permeate the ASW matrix via transient cracks and pores. This process facilitates the sequential hydrogenation of CO to form formaldehyde (H₂CO) and subsequently methanol (CH₃OH) at temperatures up to 70 K. This finding necessitates a revision of current astrochemical networks, as it implies a significantly more active and extended solid-phase chemical evolution in star-forming regions than previously accounted for, with direct implications for the prebiotic molecular inventory delivered to nascent planetary systems.
