In this study, we employ high-level quantum chemical calculations to investigate the interstellar chemistry of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN), key prebiotic isomers detected in the interstellar medium. Our computational methodology, utilizing coupled-cluster theory, precisely determines the isomers' relative energies, rotational constants, and crucially, their permanent dipole moments. The results reveal a significant dipole moment disparity, which we subsequently integrate into a comprehensive gas-grain astrochemical model. The simulation demonstrates that the observed Z/E abundance ratio in star-forming regions like Sgr B2(N) is not governed by thermodynamic stability but is instead a direct consequence of differential destruction rates in ion-molecule reactions. This kinetic dominance is quantitatively explained by the application of the relative dipole principle, wherein the isomer with the larger permanent dipole moment experiences a higher collision rate with polarizing ions. Our findings, contextualized within 2020's advancing astrochemical landscape, establish a fundamental link between molecular electronic structure and observed interstellar isomer ratios, providing a predictive framework for understanding molecular complexity in space.
