**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a promising class of porous materials; however, their inherent static structures often limit their applicability in dynamic systems. This study addresses the burgeoning need to engineer temporal and spatial control over MOF behavior, focusing on the development of four-dimensional (4D) materials exhibiting spatiotemporal evolution. We investigate the multifaceted challenges associated with inducing and sustaining dynamic structural changes within MOF architectures, considering timescales ranging from picoseconds to hours. Current methodologies, including guest molecule incorporation and external stimuli, are critically evaluated alongside emerging techniques leveraging mechanochemistry and electrochemical modulation.  The paper proposes a framework for rationally designing MOFs capable of undergoing controlled transformations, emphasizing the importance of correlating structural dynamics with macroscopic material properties.  Ultimately, this work highlights the potential of 4D MOFs to enable novel applications in sensing, catalysis, and adaptive materials, requiring further investigation into the fundamental mechanisms governing their spatiotemporal response.
