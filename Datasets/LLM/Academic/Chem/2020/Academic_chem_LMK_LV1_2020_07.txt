Title: Spatio-Temporal Engineering of Dynamic Metal-Organic Frameworks: Challenges and Prospective Strategies

Abstract:
The burgeoning field of dynamic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has garnered significant attention owing to their potential applications in various domains, including gas storage and separation. However, the structural dynamics inherent to these porous solids pose significant challenges in predicting and controlling their spatio-temporal evolution. In this context, the development of four-dimensional (4D) frameworks, which incorporate temporal changes in their structural configurations, is crucial. Herein, we discuss the intricacies associated with engineering the dynamic behavior of MOFs and propose potential routes to modulate their structural dynamics. By integrating advanced characterization techniques and computational modeling, we elucidate the underlying mechanisms governing the structural transformations in these dynamic materials. This understanding is anticipated to facilitate the design of next-generation MOFs with tailored properties, thereby expanding their applicability in diverse fields. As of 2020, research in this area continues to evolve, offering new avenues for innovation.
