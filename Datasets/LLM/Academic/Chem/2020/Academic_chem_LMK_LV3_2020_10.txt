Title: Investigating Isomeric Abundance of Cyanomethanimine in Interstellar Environments: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:
The abundance of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine isomers in interstellar environments has garnered significant attention in astrochemistry. This study employs ab initio quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the thermochemical properties and reaction kinetics of these isomers. Utilizing the CCSD(T) method with a cc-pVTZ basis set, we computed the potential energy surfaces for key reactions involving cyanomethanimine. Our results indicate that the Z-isomer is thermodynamically favored, whereas the E-isomer is kinetically stabilized. Astrochemical models, incorporating these quantum chemical data, were developed to simulate the isomeric abundance in various interstellar environments. Our simulations suggest that the Z/E ratio is sensitive to the temperature and density profiles of the interstellar medium. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the chemistry of cyanomethanimine isomers, shedding light on their role in the astrochemical evolution of interstellar environments, as observed in recent 2020 astronomical surveys.
