The rational engineering of spatiotemporal dynamics in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a frontier in developing advanced porous solids. This perspective examines the fundamental challenges and emergent strategies for programming structural dynamics in these four-dimensional materials. We analyze how intrinsic framework flexibility and extrinsic stimuli can be harnessed to achieve controlled, time-dependent evolution of pore architecture and functionality. Key considerations include the precise integration of molecular switches and the design of cooperative mechanisms to propagate local transformations across the material. By establishing design principles for spatiotemporal control, this work provides a roadmap for creating next-generation dynamic MOFs with applications in adaptive separation, sensing, and catalysis. The insights presented herein aim to bridge the gap between static porous materials and systems capable of complex, programmable behavior.
