In this 2020 computational chemistry study, we employ high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the interstellar chemistry of cyanomethanimine isomers. Our investigation focuses on the distinct reaction dynamics of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine with atomic hydrogen, a fundamental interstellar reactant. Through potential energy surface mapping and kinetic modeling, we demonstrate how differential energy barriers and transition state geometries govern isomer-specific reactivity pathways. Crucially, we establish a novel "relative dipole principle" correlating molecular dipole moments with observed spatial distributions in molecular clouds. This principle quantitatively explains the anomalous abundance ratios detected in astrochemical surveys, revealing how directional dipole interactions with interstellar electric fields influence isomer segregation. Our findings provide a mechanistic framework for predicting isomer abundances in star-forming regions, advancing our understanding of prebiotic molecule formation in the interstellar medium. This work bridges quantum chemistry with observational astrochemistry, offering predictive power for radioastronomical searches of complex organic molecules.
