**Abstract**

Recent observations of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments suggest that grain surface chemistry plays a crucial role in the formation of prebiotic species. This study, conducted in 2020, explores the unexpected efficiency of carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation to formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) within amorphous solid water (ASW) ice mantles at astrophysically relevant temperatures. Experimental results reveal that hydrogenation proceeds at notable rates even at temperatures as low as ∼70 K. We attribute this enhanced reactivity to the facilitated diffusion of hydrogen atoms through the disordered structure of ASW. Specifically, the presence of micro-cracks and voids within the ASW matrix provides pathways for rapid hydrogen atom transport, bypassing kinetic barriers typically associated with low-temperature surface reactions. These findings challenge previous assumptions regarding the thermal limitations of hydrogenation processes on interstellar dust grains and highlight the importance of ASW porosity in mediating chemical reactions within cold, dense molecular clouds. This work has implications for understanding the chemical evolution of interstellar ices and the potential delivery of complex organic molecules to protoplanetary disks.
