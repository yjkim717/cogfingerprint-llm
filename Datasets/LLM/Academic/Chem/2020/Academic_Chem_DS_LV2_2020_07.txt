Of particular interest in contemporary materials chemistry are dynamic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) whose structures and properties can evolve over time in response to external stimuli. This perspective, situated in the year 2020, critically examines the fundamental challenges and emerging design principles for engineering such spatiotemporal evolution. We analyze how the intrinsic flexibility of organic linkers and the lability of metal-node coordination spheres govern framework dynamics, with a focus on quantifying the associated energy barriers that dictate transformation kinetics. The discussion is structured around strategies to programmatically control dynamic behavior, including the incorporation of stimuli-responsive molecular switches and the design of metastable phases. By establishing connections between molecular-level structural dynamics and macroscopic property modulation, this work provides a framework for the rational design of next-generation porous solids for advanced applications in molecular separation, sensing, and controlled release.
