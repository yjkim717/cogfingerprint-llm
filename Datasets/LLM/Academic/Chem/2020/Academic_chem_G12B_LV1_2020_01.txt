**Abstract**

The formation of reduced carbon species via hydrogenation reactions remains a crucial area of investigation, particularly within the context of astrophysical ices and low-temperature planetary environments. This study explores the unexpected catalytic activity of amorphous solid water (ASW) towards carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation, leading to the formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) at cryogenic temperatures, specifically extending up to 70 K. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we examined the mechanism of CO hydrogenation within ASW, hypothesizing that the disordered nature of the ice matrix facilitates enhanced diffusive transport of hydrogen atoms. Our results indicate that the presence of ASW significantly lowers the activation energy barrier for H-atom addition to CO compared to predictions for isolated CO molecules.  Furthermore, computational analysis of hydrogen atom diffusion pathways within the ASW structure reveals a network of interconnected channels promoting efficient H₂ mobility, enabling rapid reaction kinetics.  These findings suggest that ASW can act as an effective, albeit previously underestimated, catalyst in low-temperature environments, potentially influencing the chemical evolution of icy grain mantles in star-forming regions and the surface chemistry of icy bodies in the outer solar system.  The implications for understanding the observed abundance of oxygen-bearing molecules in interstellar ices are discussed.
