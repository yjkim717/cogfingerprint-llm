**Abstract**

The efficient transfer of electrons across molecular interfaces is a fundamental challenge in numerous chemical and biological processes. This research explores the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) to modulate electron transfer rates, leveraging the formation of polaritons – hybrid light and matter excitations – as an intermediary state. Utilizing a robust light-matter coupling framework, we demonstrate how varying the strength of this interaction significantly impacts the dynamics of charge transfer reactions. Specifically, enhanced light-matter coupling promotes the delocalization of excitons within the cavity, facilitating increased polariton formation and subsequently, accelerated electron transfer. Conversely, weaker coupling leads to diminished polariton density and a corresponding suppression of the observed transfer rate. Our findings, presented within the context of polariton-mediated electron transfer, offer a novel perspective on controlling chemical reactivity through precisely engineered light-matter interactions. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of CQED’s role in manipulating nanoscale chemical phenomena and have implications for applications ranging from photocatalysis to molecular electronics (2020).
