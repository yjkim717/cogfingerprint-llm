## Abstract: Spatiotemporal Control of Structural Dynamics in Metal-Organic Frameworks: Opportunities and Challenges

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), crystalline porous materials constructed from metal nodes and organic linkers, have garnered substantial attention for applications ranging from gas storage to catalysis. While static MOF architectures offer predictable performance, the incorporation of dynamic behavior—the ability to alter structure and functionality in response to external stimuli—represents a paradigm shift with the potential to unlock unprecedented capabilities. This work examines the critical challenges and promising avenues for engineering dynamic behavior in MOFs across multiple spatiotemporal scales. Specifically, we focus on strategies to modulate structural transitions, encompassing linker exchange, node rearrangement, and guest-induced conformational changes. A key consideration is the characterization and manipulation of energy barriers governing these transitions, often requiring a combination of computational modeling and advanced spectroscopic techniques. The development of stimuli-responsive linkers and the utilization of external triggers, such as light, temperature, or chemical species, are discussed as potential routes toward achieving controlled dynamic MOF behavior. Ultimately, the realization of truly dynamic MOFs requires a holistic understanding of the interplay between material composition, architecture, and environmental conditions, paving the way for adaptive materials with tailored functionality.
