This study presents a comprehensive investigation of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine isomers (HNCHCN) in interstellar environments through integrated quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling. Utilizing coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)] with augmented correlation-consistent basis sets, we determined precise rotational constants, dipole moments, and relative energies for both conformers. Our computational results reveal that the E-isomer exhibits a marginally higher stability (ΔE ≈ 0.5 kcal mol⁻¹) and significantly larger dipole moment (μ_E ≈ 4.5 D) compared to the Z-form (μ_Z ≈ 2.1 D). These molecular parameters were incorporated into a gas-grain chemical network to simulate molecular abundances under typical cold cloud conditions (T = 10 K, n_H = 10⁴ cm⁻³). The astrochemical models predict that the E-isomer achieves higher interstellar abundance by approximately one order of magnitude, consistent with its enhanced detectability profile. Based on these findings, we propose a relative dipole principle for estimating isomer abundances in astronomical surveys, where the isomer with the greater dipole moment demonstrates preferential formation and survival in cold molecular clouds. This work provides crucial spectroscopic parameters for radio astronomical searches and advances our understanding of isomer-specific chemistry in the interstellar medium.
