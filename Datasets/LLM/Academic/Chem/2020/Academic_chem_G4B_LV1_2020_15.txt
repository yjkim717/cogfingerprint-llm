**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a burgeoning class of porous, crystalline materials exhibiting significant potential across diverse applications.  However, a fundamental challenge remains in fully understanding and controlling their dynamic behavior. This study investigates the spatiotemporal evolution of MOF structures, employing a four-dimensional (4D) characterization approach to track structural changes under varying stimuli.  We present a framework materials investigation focusing on the controlled manipulation of MOF architecture through [mention a specific stimulus, e.g., temperature, pressure, chemical modification].  Analysis reveals distinct mechanisms governing framework degradation and reorganization, characterized by localized phase transitions and alterations in pore connectivity.  The observed spatiotemporal evolution highlights the inherent plasticity of these materials and underscores the need for refined theoretical models to predict and engineer dynamic MOF systems.  These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of these materials’ long-term stability and inform the design of responsive, self-healing frameworks.
