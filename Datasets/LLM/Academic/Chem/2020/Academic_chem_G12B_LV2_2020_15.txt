**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), celebrated for their crystalline porosity and compositional versatility, are increasingly recognized as platforms for dynamic materials. This work addresses the critical challenge of engineering controlled structural dynamics within MOFs, encompassing both temporal evolution and spatial heterogeneity. While traditional MOF research has largely focused on static architectures, the realization of four-dimensional (4D) frameworks—materials exhibiting tunable structure-function relationships over time—demands a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms governing their behavior. We review current limitations in achieving predictable and reversible structural changes in MOFs, including kinetic barriers, thermodynamic stability considerations, and the difficulty in correlating structural evolution with macroscopic properties. Furthermore, we discuss emerging strategies for inducing dynamic behavior, such as photoresponsive linkers, guest-mediated structural rearrangements, and the incorporation of mechanically interlocked components. This perspective highlights the need for integrated experimental and computational approaches to decipher the spatiotemporal evolution of MOF structures and ultimately unlock their potential in applications ranging from adaptive separations to responsive catalysis.
