**Abstract**

The prevalence of reactive intermediates within interstellar molecular clouds significantly impacts ion-molecule destruction pathways, influencing the chemical evolution of galaxies. This work presents a detailed investigation into the isomeric forms of cyanomethanimine (HC≡CCN), specifically the Z and E isomers, employing *ab initio* quantum chemical calculations to determine their spectroscopic properties and energetics.  Ground state geometries and vibrational frequencies were optimized using the MP2 and CCSD(T) methods, revealing subtle differences in structural parameters between the isomers.  Subsequently, these data were integrated into astrochemical models to assess their relative abundances under simulated interstellar conditions, considering factors such as UV irradiation and collisional excitation. Results indicate a potential for significant isomeric fractionation, with implications for radiative transfer and the interpretation of observational spectra. Further simulations are planned to explore the influence of temperature and density on the observed isomeric ratios.
