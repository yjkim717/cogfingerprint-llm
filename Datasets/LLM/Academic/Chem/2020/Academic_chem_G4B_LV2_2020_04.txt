**Abstract**

Photoinduced electron transfer (PET) processes are fundamentally constrained by interfacial energetics and reaction kinetics. Recent advancements in utilizing cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) offer a novel pathway to circumvent these limitations, particularly through the manipulation of light-matter coupling. This research investigates the synergistic effects of polariton-mediated electron transfer within a CQED system, employing quantum dynamical simulations to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we demonstrate that fine-tuning the light-matter coupling strength within a photonic cavity significantly alters the efficiency of PET events. 

Our simulations reveal that resonant excitation of cavity polaritons facilitates enhanced FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer, effectively extending the spatial range of PET and promoting faster electron transfer rates compared to conventional approaches. The observed enhancement stems from the coupling between the excited state of the donor molecule and the cavity field, creating a dynamically optimized pathway for charge migration. These findings highlight the potential of CQED as a powerful tool for controlling and accelerating PET processes, with implications for applications in optoelectronic devices and photocatalysis, as evidenced by the growing body of research in 2020.
