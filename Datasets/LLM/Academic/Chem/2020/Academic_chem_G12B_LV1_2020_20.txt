**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers unprecedented opportunities to manipulate and control chemical processes through strong light-matter coupling. This work explores the influence of polariton formation on the dynamics of photoinduced electron transfer (PET) within a donor-acceptor-cavity system. Utilizing time-dependent density functional theory combined with a quantum mechanical treatment of the cavity field, we perform comprehensive quantum dynamical simulations to investigate the interplay between molecular electronic structure and the emergent polaritonic modes. Our simulations reveal that the coupling strength, characterized by the Purcell factor, critically dictates the PET efficiency. Specifically, we observe a non-monotonic dependence: moderate coupling strengths can significantly accelerate PET rates via resonant energy transfer facilitated by polaritons, while excessively strong coupling can lead to spectral broadening and ultimately suppress the charge transfer process due to dephasing effects. Further analysis reveals that the polariton dispersion and spatial localization profoundly impact the electron transfer pathway, altering both the rate and the ultimate charge distribution within the molecular complex. These findings highlight the potential of cQED to engineer photoinduced charge transfer, offering a pathway toward the design of light-responsive molecular devices and enhanced photocatalytic systems. The ability to tune PET dynamics through precise control of cavity parameters represents a significant advancement in the application of quantum optics to chemical phenomena.

**Notes on Choices & Rationale**

*   **Formal Tone & Vocabulary:** Iâ€™ve used terms like "burgeoning field," "unprecedented opportunities," "interplay," "non-monotonic dependence," "spectral broadening," "dephasing effects," and "emergent polaritonic modes" to establish a formal, academic tone.
*   **Structured Reasoning:**
    *   **Introduction/Context:** The first sentence places the work within the broader cQED field.
    *   **Methodology:** I specifically mentioned "time-dependent density functional theory combined with a quantum mechanical treatment of the cavity field" to indicate a computational approach. This is common in modern chemistry research.
    *   **Key Findings:** The core of the abstract states the non-monotonic effect of coupling strength and explains *why* it occurs (resonant energy transfer vs. dephasing).
    *   **Mechanism/Details:** I included the important detail about polariton dispersion and spatial localization influencing the pathway. This shows a deeper understanding.
    *   **Implications/Significance:** The final sentences discuss the potential applications (molecular devices, photocatalysis) and the broader significance of the work.
*   **Keywords Integration:** All the keywords were naturally incorporated into the text.
*   **Year Context (2020):**  The abstract reflects the state of the field around 2020. cQED applied to chemistry was gaining significant traction, and TDDFT was a widely used computational method.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for the requested ~237 words.
*   **Focus on Dynamics:**  The text emphasizes "dynamics" (photoinduced charge transfer *dynamics*) to align
