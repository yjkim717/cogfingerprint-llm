**Abstract**

The relative abundance of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN) isomers in the interstellar medium (ISM) presents a significant challenge for contemporary astrochemical models. This investigation employs high-level quantum chemical calculations, including CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ electronic structure optimizations, to elucidate the non-equilibrium isomerization dynamics governing their formation. We demonstrate that the observed Z/E ratio cannot be rationalized by thermodynamic stability or kinetic control over a single reaction pathway alone. Instead, we propose a "relative dipole principle," wherein the substantial difference in the isomers' permanent electric dipole moments (μ_Z >> μ_E) selectively enhances the radiative cooling efficiency and subsequent stabilization of the Z-isomer following gas-phase formation. This dipole-mediated stabilization mechanism provides a more robust framework for interpreting rotational line surveys from sources such as Sgr B2(N). Our findings necessitate a revision of existing chemical networks to include dipole-dependent relaxation processes, offering a novel paradigm for predicting isomer-specific abundances in cold molecular clouds.
