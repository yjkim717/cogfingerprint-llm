**Abstract**

The prevalence of simple organic molecules within interstellar environments represents a fundamental question in astrophysics and astrochemistry. This research employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to systematically investigate the isomeric distribution and relative abundances of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine (HC≡CCN) within the context of the G+0.693 giant molecular cloud. Utilizing a density functional theory (DFT) framework, we computed potential energy surfaces and rotational energy levels for both isomers, enabling an accurate determination of their spectroscopic properties.  Our computational analysis reveals a significantly lower Z/E ratio for cyanomethanimine in G+0.693 compared to previously reported theoretical estimates and some observational constraints. This disparity suggests potential biases in prior modeling approaches, possibly stemming from simplified treatment of vibrational dynamics.  The observed preference for the E-isomer warrants further investigation into the influence of interstellar conditions – specifically, rotational temperatures and field strengths – on molecule formation pathways. These findings contribute to a more refined understanding of the chemical complexity achievable in primordial interstellar clouds and inform the search for prebiotic molecules beyond our solar system.
