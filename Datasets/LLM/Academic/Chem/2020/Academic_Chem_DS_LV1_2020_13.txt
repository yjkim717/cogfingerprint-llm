**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) embedded within amorphous solid water (ASW) matrices represents a critical non-diffusive reaction pathway for the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) on interstellar dust grains. While traditional models rely on the surface diffusion of hydrogen atoms, their mobility is significantly restricted at the low temperatures (≤20 K) prevalent in dense molecular clouds. This study investigates an alternative mechanism wherein hydrogen atoms permeate the porous ASW structure via network diffusion through transient cracks and pores, thereby accessing trapped CO molecules. We present experimental evidence demonstrating the formation of both formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) from CO-hydrogenation at temperatures up to 70 K, a regime where surface diffusion is negligible. These findings, supported by kinetic modelling, confirm that the structural properties and porosity of the water ice mantle govern the reaction efficiency. This work redefines our understanding of solid-state astrochemistry, establishing bulk diffusion as a dominant process for COM synthesis in warmer regions of star-forming environments, such as protostellar cores, with profound implications for the molecular inventory delivered to nascent planetary systems.
