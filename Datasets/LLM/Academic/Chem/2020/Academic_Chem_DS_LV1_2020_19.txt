**Abstract**

The rational engineering of spatiotemporal dynamics in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a frontier in developing advanced functional materials. While the intrinsic porosity and structural tunability of three-dimensional MOFs are well-established, controlling their dynamic, time-dependent behavior—transforming them into four-dimensional (4D) systems—remains a significant challenge. This perspective, situated in the research landscape of 2020, analyzes the key hurdles in directing the structural evolution of these porous solids across both space and time. We critically examine design strategies for encoding programmable stimuli-responsiveness, focusing on the interplay between organic linker flexibility, metal-node lability, and guest-molecule interactions as the primary drivers of dynamic phenomena. By establishing a framework for understanding and manipulating these complex processes, we aim to guide the synthesis of next-generation MOFs with bespoke dynamic properties for applications in adaptive catalysis, selective separations, and molecular sensing.
