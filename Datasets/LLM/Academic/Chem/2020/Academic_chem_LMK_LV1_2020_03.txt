Title: Harnessing Structural Dynamics in Metal-Organic Frameworks: Strategies for Engineering Responsive Porous Architectures

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of four-dimensional framework materials has underscored the potential of dynamic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to revolutionize various applications, from gas storage to catalysis. However, the rational design of MOFs with tailored structural dynamics remains a formidable challenge. Recent advances in understanding the intricate relationships between MOF composition, topology, and responsiveness have illuminated potential pathways to engineering dynamic porous architectures. This perspective highlights emerging strategies for harnessing structural dynamics in MOFs, including the incorporation of flexible linkers, the exploitation of supramolecular interactions, and the use of external stimuli to modulate framework behavior. By elucidating the interplay between MOF structure and dynamics, this work aims to inform the development of next-generation MOFs with optimized responsiveness and functionality, thereby unlocking their full potential in a range of applications.
