Title: Polariton-Mediated Electron Transfer in the Ultra-Strong Coupling Regime: A Quantum Dynamical Study

Abstract:
The manipulation of chemical reactions through cavity quantum electrodynamics has garnered significant attention in recent years. This study investigates the role of polariton-mediated electron transfer in modulating charge transfer reactions. Employing quantum dynamical simulations, we examine the effects of light-matter interaction on electron transfer processes within the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Our results demonstrate that the ultra-strong coupling regime enables the manipulation of electron transfer rates, leading to either enhancement or suppression of charge transfer reactions. By modulating the cavity frequency and light-matter coupling strength, we show that the polariton-mediated electron transfer mechanism can be controlled, offering a novel approach to influencing chemical reactivity. The findings of this study provide insight into the quantum mechanical interplay between light and matter, shedding light on the potential applications of cavity quantum electrodynamics in controlling chemical reactions (2020).
