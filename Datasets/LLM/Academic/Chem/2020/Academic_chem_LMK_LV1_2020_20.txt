Title: Exploring Polariton-Mediated Electron Transfer in the Ultra-Strong Coupling Regime

Abstract:

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics has enabled the investigation of polariton-mediated electron transfer, a phenomenon where the hybridization of molecular excitons and cavity photons significantly influences charge transfer processes. In this study, we employ a combination of analytic rate constant theory and quantum dynamical simulations to examine the effects of ultra-strong coupling on electron transfer reactions. By analyzing the quantum dynamics of the coupled light-matter system, we reveal the intricate interplay between cavity photon dressing and molecular electronic states. Our results demonstrate that the ultra-strong coupling regime can substantially modify the electron transfer rate constants, leading to enhanced or suppressed transfer rates depending on the cavity parameters. The present work provides a comprehensive understanding of polariton-mediated electron transfer, shedding light on the potential applications of cavity quantum electrodynamics in controlling and manipulating charge transfer processes in various chemical and biological systems.
