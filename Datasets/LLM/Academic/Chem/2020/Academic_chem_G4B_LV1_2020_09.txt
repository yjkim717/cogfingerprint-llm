**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) within amorphous solid water (ASW) represents a compelling pathway for hydrogen storage and chemical synthesis. This research explores the mechanistic underpinnings of this process, focusing on the influence of temperature and hydrogen diffusion. Utilizing a high-temperature environment, we observed significant CO hydrogenation activity in ASW initiated above 20 K.  Our findings suggest that hydrogen diffusion, facilitated by microstructural cracks present within the ASW matrix, plays a critical role in driving reaction kinetics.  Specifically, the presence of these interconnected pathways enables hydrogen transport to reactive sites, circumventing diffusion limitations typically associated with bulk ASW.  This diffusion-mediated activation promotes the formation of stable, hydrogen-rich species. Further investigation into the morphology and extent of cracking within ASW is warranted to optimize performance and elucidate the precise hydrogen diffusion pathways involved in this promising catalytic process.
