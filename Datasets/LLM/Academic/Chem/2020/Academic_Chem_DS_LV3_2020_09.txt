**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) within interstellar ice analogues represents a critical pathway for the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium. This study investigates the diffusion-mediated hydrogenation of CO embedded in amorphous solid water (ASW) at astrophysically relevant temperatures. Our experimental results demonstrate that the reaction proceeds efficiently to form formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) at temperatures up to approximately 70 K. This observed reactivity at temperatures significantly above the hydrogen atom diffusion threshold in pure ASW suggests that the ice matrix does not present a monolithic barrier. Instead, we propose that hydrogen atoms access the embedded CO reactants through a network of transient, nanoscale cracks and pores that persist within the amorphous water structure. This mechanism of diffusion through structural defects provides a compelling explanation for the synthesis of hydrogenated species in cold cosmic ice mantles, where thermal diffusion is conventionally considered negligible. Our findings necessitate a revision of current astrochemical models to incorporate non-thermal diffusion processes that govern molecular genesis in icy grain mantles.
