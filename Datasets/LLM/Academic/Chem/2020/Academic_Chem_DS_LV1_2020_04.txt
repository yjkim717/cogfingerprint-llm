**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers a transformative paradigm for controlling chemical reactivity at the quantum level. This theoretical investigation explores the manipulation of ultrafast electron transfer (ET) processes within a molecular dimer, strategically embedded in an optical cavity. By engineering the system into the ultra-strong coupling regime, where the light-matter interaction energy constitutes a significant fraction of the transition energies, we demonstrate the emergence of a novel reaction coordinate: polariton-mediated electron transfer. Through high-level quantum dynamical simulations utilizing the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach, we quantify the profound impact of collective vibrational and photonic interactions on the non-adiabatic ET dynamics. Our results reveal that precise tuning of the cavity resonance frequency and coupling strength can either significantly enhance or suppress the inter-state charge transfer rate by orders of magnitude, effectively bypassing conventional Marcus theory predictions. This work, situated in the context of 2020's advances in quantum materials, establishes a foundational framework for the external, non-invasive control of photochemical and charge-separation processes, with direct implications for the design of next-generation optoelectronic devices and energy conversion systems.
