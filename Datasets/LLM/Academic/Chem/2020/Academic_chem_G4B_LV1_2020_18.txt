**Isomeric Abundance and Destructive Pathways of Cyanomethanimine in Simulated Interstellar Environments**

Cyanomethanimine (HC≡CN) represents a significant, yet poorly characterized, species within interstellar molecular clouds. This work presents *ab initio* calculations exploring the isomeric distribution – specifically the Z and E isomers – of cyanomethanimine and their associated dipole moments. Utilizing a high-level correlated Hartree-Fock/coupled cluster methodology, we determined the geometries and spectroscopic properties of both isomers.  Notably, our simulations predict a significantly lower Z/E ratio compared to previously estimated theoretical values.  Furthermore, we modeled key ion-molecule reactions relevant to interstellar chemistry, demonstrating that the E isomer is markedly more susceptible to fragmentation via proton abstraction and subsequent destruction.  These findings suggest that observed interstellar abundances of cyanomethanimine are likely dominated by the less stable E isomer, with a lower overall concentration than initially anticipated, driven by these destructive pathways.
