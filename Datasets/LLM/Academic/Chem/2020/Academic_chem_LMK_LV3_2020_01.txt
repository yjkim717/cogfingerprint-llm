Title: Investigating Diffusive Hydrogenation Reactions of CO in Amorphous Solid Water: Implications for Interstellar Chemistry

Abstract:
The hydrogenation of CO embedded in amorphous solid water (ASW) is a crucial process in interstellar environments, influencing the formation of complex molecules. This study (2020) examines the diffusive hydrogenation reactions of CO in ASW, employing temperature-programmed desorption and infrared spectroscopy. Our results reveal that CO hydrogenation reactions occur efficiently at temperatures up to approximately 70 K, facilitated by the diffusion of H atoms through the ASW matrix. The reaction rates and product yields are found to be sensitive to the ASW morphology and temperature. The findings have significant implications for understanding the chemistry of interstellar dust grains, where CO hydrogenation is a key step in the formation of methanol and other complex species. This research contributes to the understanding of the molecular evolution in astrophysical environments, shedding light on the role of diffusive reactions in shaping interstellar chemistry.
