**Abstract**

This research explores the influence of cavity quantum electrodynamics on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) dynamics between donor and acceptor molecules. Utilizing a combined analytic and quantum dynamical simulation approach, we demonstrate that coupling a molecular system to an optical cavity significantly modifies PET rates through the formation of polariton states. Specifically, strong light-matter coupling within the cavity promotes enhanced PET efficiency via resonant energy transfer, while weaker coupling can suppress transfer rates due to destructive interference. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how engineered photonic environments can be leveraged to control and optimize PET processes. The results contribute to advancements in areas such as molecular electronics and photocatalysis, highlighting the potential of cavity QED for directing and accelerating chemically relevant electron transport phenomena.
