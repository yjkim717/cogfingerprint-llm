**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) on interstellar dust grains is a critical pathway for forming complex organic molecules in the cold, dense regions of the interstellar medium. Conventional models posit that hydrogen (H) atom diffusion and subsequent surface reactions are thermally inhibited above approximately 20 K. This study investigates an alternative non-thermal mechanism to explain the observed presence of methanol (CH₃OH) and formaldehyde (H₂CO) in warmer astrophysical environments. We demonstrate experimentally that within porous amorphous solid water (ASW) ices, H atoms can access embedded CO molecules via diffusion through a network of microscopic cracks and pores. This process facilitates sequential hydrogenation, leading to the formation of H₂CO and ultimately CH₃OH. Crucially, this crack-mediated diffusion mechanism remains operative at temperatures up to 70 K, significantly higher than the traditional surface diffusion limit. Our findings necessitate a revision of current astrochemical models, as they identify a robust solid-state pathway for the formation of prebiotic molecules under conditions previously considered non-reactive, with profound implications for our understanding of molecular evolution in star-forming regions.
