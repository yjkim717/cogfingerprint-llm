Title: Investigating the Isomer Abundances of Cyanomethanimine in Interstellar Environments: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:
The chemistry of cyanomethanimine isomers, specifically Z- and E-cyanomethanimine, is investigated in the context of interstellar environments using a combination of ab initio quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling. The study employs high-level quantum chemical methods to determine the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of these isomers, which are subsequently incorporated into astrochemical models to predict their abundances in various interstellar environments. The results indicate that the Z- and E-isomers exhibit distinct abundance profiles, influenced by their differing thermodynamic stabilities and reactivity. The astrochemical models demonstrate that the isomer abundances are sensitive to the physical conditions and chemical composition of the interstellar medium. This study provides insights into the chemistry of cyanomethanimine in interstellar environments, shedding light on the complex interplay between quantum chemical properties and astrochemical processes.
