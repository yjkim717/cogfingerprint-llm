**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers unprecedented opportunities to manipulate photochemical processes through strong light-matter interaction. This study, conducted in 2020, explores the influence of polariton formation on photoinduced electron transfer (ET) within molecular dyads confined within optical microcavities. Our findings reveal that the coherent coupling between molecular excitons and cavity photons—manifesting as polaritons—provides a powerful mechanism to modulate ET rates and efficiencies. Specifically, we demonstrate that altering the cavity resonance frequency allows for precise tuning of the effective driving force governing ET, leading to either substantial enhancement or suppression of charge transfer dynamics. The observed effects are attributed to modifications in the electronic couplings mediated by the polaritonic states, showcasing a direct impact on the quantum dynamics of the system. These results highlight the potential of polariton chemistry as a transformative approach for controlling photochemical reactivity and designing novel molecular devices, paving the way for advanced optoelectronic applications.
