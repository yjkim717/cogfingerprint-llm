**Abstract**

The exploration of light-matter interaction within cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers novel avenues for controlling chemical reaction dynamics. This work examines the influence of polariton formation on photoinduced electron transfer (ET) processes in molecular systems. We demonstrate that strong coupling to optical cavity modes can dramatically modulate ET rates, exhibiting both enhancement and suppression effects dependent on the coupling strength and detuning. Notably, our simulations reveal the capacity to influence ET even from molecular dark states, a previously unexpected outcome. Accurate modeling necessitates the inclusion of counter-rotating wave terms and corrections for dipole self-energy, particularly in the ultra-strong coupling regime. These findings highlight the potential of cQED to engineer quantum dynamics and offer new strategies for controlling chemical reactivity, aligning with ongoing efforts to develop light-driven chemical technologies.
