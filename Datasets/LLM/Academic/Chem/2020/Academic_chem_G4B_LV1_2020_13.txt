**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) within amorphous solid water (ASW) represents a compelling avenue for exploring novel hydrogen storage mechanisms. This research reports on an investigation into the kinetics of CO hydrogenation in ASW samples subjected to elevated temperatures, specifically examining conditions exceeding 20 K. Utilizing a microstructural analysis approach, we observed that observable reaction rates were significantly enhanced in ASW containing pre-existing microcracks. We hypothesize that these fissures facilitate diffusive transport of hydrogen atoms, acting as preferential pathways for reaction with adsorbed CO.  The presence of an ice mantle within the ASW matrix appears to influence the crack network morphology and, consequently, the overall hydrogenation efficiency.  These findings suggest that controlled defect engineering within ASW could substantially improve its viability as a hydrogen-rich material, warranting further investigation into the interplay between hydrogen diffusion, surface reactivity, and material microstructure.
