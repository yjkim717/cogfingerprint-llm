In this study, we investigate the role of polariton formation in mediating electron transfer processes within optical cavities, leveraging principles of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED). Under strong light-matter coupling regimes, hybrid light-matter states—polaritons—emerge, fundamentally altering charge transfer dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that resonant and off-resonant conditions between molecular transitions and cavity modes enable precise tuning of effective electronic driving forces and non-adiabatic couplings. Through quantum dynamical simulations and model Hamiltonian analyses, we establish that such tuning can either enhance or suppress electron transfer rates by orders of magnitude, depending on the energetic alignment and coupling strength. This control mechanism, elucidated here for donor-bridge-acceptor systems embedded in Fabry–Pérot resonators, provides a novel paradigm for manipulating charge transport at the nanoscale. The implications extend to photocatalysis, organic photovoltaics, and quantum information science, where polaritonic strategies offer a pathway to circumvent conventional kinetic limitations. Our work, positioned within the broader context of quantum electrochemical control, underscores the transformative potential of cQED in reengineering molecular reactivity and charge transfer phenomena.
