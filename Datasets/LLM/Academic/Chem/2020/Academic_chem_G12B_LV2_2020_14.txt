Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, aiming for ~231 words, suitable for a chemistry publication, and reflecting a 2020 timeframe. I've focused on precision, structured reasoning, and incorporating the keywords provided.  I've also included a brief justification for certain choices at the bottom.

**Abstract**

The isomeric cyanomethanimine species, *Z*- and *E*-cyanomethanimine (NCCNH), represent potentially significant, yet poorly understood, molecular constituents of interstellar ices and gas phases. This work presents a detailed quantum chemical investigation of the isomeric equilibrium and destruction pathways of NCCNH, utilizing high-level computational methods including CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations to accurately determine structural parameters, vibrational frequencies, and reaction energetics. Our findings reveal that, contrary to previous assumptions based solely on thermal equilibrium considerations, the observed interstellar abundance ratio of *Z*-NCCNH to *E*-NCCNH is not primarily dictated by isomerization energy differences. Instead, we demonstrate that ion-molecule reactions, specifically protonation and subsequent fragmentation, exhibit a strong dependence on the molecular dipole moment orientation.  We propose a ‘relative dipole principle’ to explain this phenomenon: the isomer with a larger projected dipole moment along the approach vector of the reacting ion will preferentially undergo reaction. This principle accounts for the observed preference for *Z*-NCCNH destruction in simulated interstellar conditions. This study highlights the critical importance of considering non-thermal processes, specifically reaction kinetics influenced by molecular dipole alignment, when modelling the chemical evolution of complex organic molecules in astrophysical environments. The implications extend beyond cyanomethanimine, suggesting a broader role for this ‘relative dipole principle’ in controlling the isomeric distributions of other polarized molecules within interstellar ices.

**Justification of Choices & Notes:**

*   **Level of Detail:** I included the computational method (CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ) to establish the rigor of the calculations. This is standard practice in chem. abstracts.
*   **Emphasis on Novelty:** The abstract stresses the *departure* from previous assumptions and the introduction of the 'relative dipole principle'. This highlights the key contribution.
*   **Structured Argument:** The abstract follows a logical flow: introduction of the species, description of the methodology, presentation of findings (including the key deviation from expectations), the proposed principle, and finally, implications and broader relevance.
*   **2020 Context:** The level of computational sophistication and the focus on interstellar ices and ion-molecule reactions are consistent with research trends around 2020.
*   **Terminology:** I used precise terms like "isomeric equilibrium," "ion-molecule reactions," "fragmentation," and "projected dipole moment."
*   **Word Count:** The abstract is approximately 231 words.
