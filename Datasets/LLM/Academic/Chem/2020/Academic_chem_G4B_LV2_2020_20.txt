**Abstract**

The efficient transfer of charge across molecular interfaces remains a central challenge in diverse applications ranging from solar energy conversion to molecular electronics. This study investigates the role of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) in facilitating polariton-mediated electron transfer (PMET) between donor and acceptor chromophores. Utilizing quantum dynamical simulations, we demonstrate that strategically engineered photonic cavities, operating within the regime of light-matter coupling, significantly enhance PMET rates compared to conventional Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pathways. 

Specifically, the resonant interaction between cavity photons and the donor-acceptor pair generates localized polariton states, effectively shortening the distance between donor and acceptor and promoting charge recombination. Our simulations reveal a strong dependence of the PMET efficiency on cavity resonance frequency, donor-acceptor distance, and the strength of the light-matter coupling.  These findings suggest that CQED offers a tunable and potentially powerful approach to controlling and accelerating charge transfer processes at the nanoscale. Future research will focus on exploring the impact of cavity geometry and material composition on optimizing PMET performance for targeted applications within optoelectronic devices.
