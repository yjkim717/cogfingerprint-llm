**Abstract**

The interstellar formation of adenine, a crucial component of RNA, remains a significant challenge in astrochemistry. This work explores the chemical behavior of cyanomethanimine (NCCNH), a proposed precursor, focusing on the isomeric forms Z- and E-. Utilizing high-level quantum chemical calculations to determine molecular geometries and dipole moments, we investigate the relative abundances of these isomers within astrochemical models representative of cold interstellar clouds.  We propose a ‘relative dipole principle’ as a novel approach to estimating isomer ratios, based on the influence of dipole moment differences on radiative stabilization. Simulations incorporating this principle predict a [Z/E] ratio of approximately 3, a value lower than previously reported observational estimates. This discrepancy highlights the need for refined observational techniques and a deeper understanding of isomeric stabilization mechanisms in interstellar environments to accurately model the prebiotic chemical landscape.
