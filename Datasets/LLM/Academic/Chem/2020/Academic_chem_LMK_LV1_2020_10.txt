Title: Unveiling the Isomeric Abundances of Cyanomethanimine in Interstellar Environments: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:

The detection of cyanomethanimine (NHCNH) in various interstellar environments has sparked significant interest in understanding its isomeric chemistry. In this study, we employ a synergistic approach combining quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling to investigate the abundances of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine isomers. High-level quantum chemical computations are performed to determine the thermochemical properties and reaction rate coefficients of these isomers. The results are subsequently incorporated into a comprehensive astrochemical model to simulate the chemistry of NHCNH in different interstellar environments. Our simulations reveal that the Z-/E- ratio is sensitive to the temperature and density conditions prevalent in these environments. The findings provide valuable insights into the isomeric abundances of cyanomethanimine, shedding light on the complex chemistry governing interstellar environments. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of cyanomethanimine in the astrochemical evolution of the interstellar medium, as observed since its detection in 2013 and reaffirmed by recent observations in 2020.
