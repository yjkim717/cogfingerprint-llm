Title: Investigating the Isomer Abundances of Cyanomethanimine in Interstellar Environments: A Combined Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:

The isomers Z- and E-cyanomethanimine are key species in the nitrogen chemistry of interstellar environments. To elucidate their formation and abundance, we employed a synergistic approach combining ab initio quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling. The potential energy surfaces of both isomers were explored using high-level CCSD(T) calculations, revealing the most plausible formation pathways. Our results indicate that the Z-isomer is favored due to a lower energy transition state. Astrochemical models, incorporating the computed rate coefficients and abundances, were subsequently applied to simulate the chemistry of various interstellar environments, including cold cores and hot cores. The models predict a significant Z/E ratio, consistent with recent observational data. Our study demonstrates the importance of accurate quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling in understanding the complex chemistry of interstellar environments, shedding light on the isomer abundances of cyanomethanimine and their implications for nitrogen chemistry in the interstellar medium (2020).
