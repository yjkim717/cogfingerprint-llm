**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) within amorphous solid water (ASW) represents a significant area of investigation for potential hydrogen storage technologies. This study reports on an examination of CO hydrogenation in ASW at elevated temperatures, demonstrating a critical transition in reaction kinetics observed above 20 K.  Analysis suggests that hydrogen diffusion through pre-existing microstructural cracks present within the ASW matrix is a primary driver of this observed behavior.  The presence of these cracks effectively creates pathways for hydrogen transport, facilitating interaction with adsorbed CO molecules.  Specifically, we posit that hydrogen diffusion, rather than purely surface-mediated reactions, becomes dominant at higher temperatures, circumventing kinetic barriers associated with localized adsorption.  Further investigation utilizing techniques such as environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and spectroscopic analysis is warranted to fully characterize the ASW microstructure and elucidate the precise mechanisms governing this diffusive hydrogenation process.  These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of hydrogen storage within complex solid-state materials.
