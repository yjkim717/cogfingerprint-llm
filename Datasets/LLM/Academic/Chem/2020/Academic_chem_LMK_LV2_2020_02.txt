Title: Investigating Cyanomethanimine Isomer Abundances in Interstellar Environments: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:
The chemistry of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine in interstellar environments is investigated using a combination of ab initio quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling. Employing high-level quantum chemical methods, we computed the thermodynamic properties and reaction rate coefficients for key reactions involving these isomers. Our results indicate that the Z-isomer is thermodynamically favored, with a relative energy difference of approximately 1.5 kcal/mol compared to the E-isomer. Astrochemical models incorporating these calculated parameters reveal that the abundance ratio of Z- to E-cyanomethanimine is sensitive to the temperature and density conditions characteristic of various interstellar environments. Our findings suggest that observational determinations of isomer abundances can provide valuable insights into the chemical and physical conditions of interstellar media, shedding light on the complex chemistry governing these environments. The results of this study have implications for understanding the molecular evolution in interstellar space.
