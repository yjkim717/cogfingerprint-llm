**Abstract:**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), celebrated for their tunable porosity and compositional diversity, are increasingly recognized as platforms for dynamic materials. This work examines the nascent field of four-dimensional (4D) MOF frameworks – materials exhibiting structural changes in response to external stimuli across both space and time – and highlights the significant challenges hindering their widespread realization. While initial demonstrations of MOF gating, breathing, and isomerization have proven promising, achieving predictable and complex spatiotemporal evolution remains elusive. We discuss limitations arising from kinetic barriers associated with structural rearrangements, the difficulty in decoupling multiple response pathways, and the lack of robust, high-throughput screening methods for identifying dynamically adaptable MOFs. Further, we explore strategies to overcome these hurdles, including the incorporation of photoresponsive, redox-active, and mechanoresponsive linkers; the design of hierarchical MOF architectures promoting cooperative motions; and the utilization of computational modeling to predict and optimize dynamic behavior. The development of advanced characterization techniques capable of resolving structural changes at relevant timescales will be crucial for advancing the field. Ultimately, controlled 4D MOFs hold transformative potential for applications in sensing, drug delivery, and adaptive catalysis.
