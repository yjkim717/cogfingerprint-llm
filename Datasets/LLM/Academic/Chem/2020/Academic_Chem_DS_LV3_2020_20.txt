In the rapidly evolving field of cavity quantum electrodynamics, the manipulation of chemical processes via strong light-matter coupling has emerged as a transformative frontier. This study investigates polariton-mediated electron transfer dynamics between molecular donor and acceptor states confined within an optical cavity. Under ultra-strong coupling conditions, where the light-matter interaction energy becomes comparable to the transition energies of the system, we demonstrate that conventional electron transfer theories require fundamental modification. Our theoretical framework incorporates both the rotating-wave approximation breakdown through explicit inclusion of counter-rotating terms and the non-negligible dipole self-energy contributions, which collectively reshape the potential energy surfaces governing charge transfer. Through numerical simulations of model molecular systems, we establish that cavity-modified electronic couplings and reorganization energies significantly alter charge transfer rates by several orders of magnitude relative to free-space conditions. The hybrid light-matter character of polaritonic states introduces novel pathways for electron transfer that are inaccessible in conventional photochemistry. Our findings reveal that precise control over charge transfer kinetics can be achieved through careful engineering of cavity parameters, including mode frequency detuning and coupling strength. This work establishes a comprehensive theoretical foundation for polariton-enhanced charge separation processes, with direct implications for developing next-generation photovoltaic devices, photocatalytic systems, and molecular electronics where quantum coherence and energy transfer efficiency are paramount. The demonstrated cavity control over electron transfer represents a paradigm shift in photochemical reaction engineering.
