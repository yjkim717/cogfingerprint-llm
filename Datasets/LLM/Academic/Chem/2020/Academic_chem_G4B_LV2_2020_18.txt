**Abstract**

The prevalence of small organic molecules within interstellar environments represents a critical area of investigation for understanding the chemical origins of prebiotic chemistry. This work presents a quantum chemical analysis of cyanomethanimine (HC≡CN), specifically focusing on the distinct Z and E isomers, to refine estimates of their relative abundances within interstellar clouds. Utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the CBS-level of theory, we systematically examined the electronic structure and vibrational properties of both isomers, accounting for potential zero-point energy corrections. Our computational results demonstrate a significantly lower Z/E ratio for cyanomethanimine compared to previously reported theoretical predictions and observational constraints. 

These findings have implications for astrophysical models simulating interstellar chemistry, particularly concerning the formation pathways of simple nitrogen-containing molecules. The observed disparity highlights the importance of employing increasingly sophisticated quantum chemical methods when characterizing complex molecular species in extreme astrophysical conditions. Further research incorporating rotational and hyperfine structure data is warranted to validate these computational results and provide a more comprehensive understanding of cyanomethanimine’s distribution in interstellar space (2020).
