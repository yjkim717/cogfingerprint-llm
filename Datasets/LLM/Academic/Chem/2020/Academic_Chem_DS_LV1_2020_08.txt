**Abstract**

The manipulation of chemical reactivity via quantum light-matter interactions represents a frontier in physical chemistry. In this work, we theoretically investigate the control of non-adiabatic electron transfer (ET) reactions within optical cavities operating in the ultra-strong coupling regime. By employing numerically exact quantum dynamical simulations of a model donor-acceptor system, we demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—dramatically alters the reaction pathways and kinetics. Our results reveal that the cavity vacuum field can either suppress or enhance the ET rate by orders of magnitude, contingent on the resonance condition between the cavity mode and key vibrational transitions. This control is mediated through the restructuring of the polaritonic potential energy surfaces, which modifies the non-adiabatic couplings and the effective energy barrier. These findings, established in 2020, provide a foundational framework for cavity-modified chemistry and suggest a novel paradigm for controlling quantum dynamics in condensed phases without external driving fields, with implications for photocatalysis and quantum information science.
