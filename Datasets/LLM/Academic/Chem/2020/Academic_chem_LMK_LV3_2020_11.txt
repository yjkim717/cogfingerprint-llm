Title: Spatiotemporal Dynamics in Four-Dimensional Metal-Organic Frameworks: Engineering Energy Barriers for Selective Molecular Recognition

Abstract:
The development of four-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (4D MOFs) has garnered significant attention in 2020 due to their potential in advancing porous solid materials. Understanding the spatiotemporal evolution of deformable networks is crucial for engineering energy barriers that facilitate selective molecular recognition. By modulating structural dynamics, researchers can tailor the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of 4D MOFs, enabling the design of dynamic materials with enhanced functionality. This study investigates the intricate relationships between structural flexibility, energy landscapes, and molecular recognition, providing insights into the rational design of 4D MOFs for targeted applications.
