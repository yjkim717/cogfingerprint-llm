**Abstract**

This research explores the utilization of polariton formation within an optical cavity to engineer enhanced electron transfer processes. Leveraging cavity quantum electrodynamics, we demonstrate a tunable driving force for electron transfer mediated by these hybrid light-matter quasiparticles. Specifically, the strong light-matter coupling observed within the cavity significantly alters electronic couplings, facilitating accelerated charge transfer rates. Experimental results, obtained in 2020, reveal improved transfer efficiencies under both resonant and off-resonant excitation conditions.  The observed enhancement stems from the polariton’s unique ability to concentrate electromagnetic fields, effectively amplifying the interaction between donor and acceptor molecules.  These findings suggest a novel strategy for controlling and accelerating chemical reactions, with potential applications in areas such as photocatalysis and molecular electronics. Further investigation into the dynamics of these coupled quantum systems is warranted.
