"Polariton-Mediated Electron Transfer in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics"

By harnessing the principles of cavity quantum electrodynamics, we investigate the modulation of electron transfer reactions via strong light-matter coupling. Our theoretical framework reveals that polariton-mediated electron transfer rates can be significantly enhanced or suppressed through tunable coupling strengths. By manipulating the photonic environment, we demonstrate the potential to control charge transfer dynamics, offering new avenues for optimizing chemical reactivity. This study provides insight into the quantum dynamics underlying polariton-mediated electron transfer, shedding light on the interplay between light, matter, and chemical reactivity. (2020)
