**Abstract**

The engineering of spatiotemporal evolution within metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a frontier in the development of dynamic functional materials. While traditional MOFs are prized for their static porosity, the integration of stimuli-responsive components enables complex, time-dependent structural reconfigurations, effectively rendering them four-dimensional (4D) systems. This perspective delineates the principal challenges in controlling these dynamic processes, which include precisely modulating the kinetics of framework flexibility and directing the propagation of structural transformations. We discuss emerging strategies to programmably encode such spatiotemporal behavior, focusing on the design of molecular switches, the creation of hierarchical domain structures, and the application of external fields. Mastering the dynamics of 4D-MOFs is paramount for advancing applications in targeted drug delivery, adaptive catalysis, and reconfigurable molecular sieving, where controlled temporal evolution is as critical as spatial architecture.
