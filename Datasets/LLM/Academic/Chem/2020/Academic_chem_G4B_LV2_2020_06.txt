**Abstract**

The prevalence of simple organic molecules within interstellar environments remains a central challenge in astrochemistry. This research employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to re-evaluate the relative abundances of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine (HCâ‰¡CCN), a key precursor to glycine, within dense interstellar clouds. Previous observational data exhibited a notable discrepancy regarding the observed ratio of these isomers, prompting a critical reassessment of theoretical predictions. Utilizing a concerted potential energy surface derived from *de novo* calculations, we systematically examined thermochemical stability and rotational barriers for both isomers. Our results demonstrate that the E-isomer exhibits a significantly lower energy state, rendering it the thermodynamically favoured species under typical interstellar conditions. This finding effectively resolves the observed observational anomaly, suggesting that the previously underestimated abundance of the E-isomer contributes substantially to the overall cyanomethanimine population. Furthermore, the implications extend to understanding glycine formation pathways and the chemical complexity of nascent stellar systems, highlighting the utility of quantum chemical methodologies in addressing fundamental questions within astrophysical chemistry.
