Title: Investigating Isomeric Abundance of Cyanomethanimine in Interstellar Environments: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:
The isomeric abundance of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine in interstellar environments is investigated using a combination of ab initio quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling. Employing high-level quantum chemical methods, we computed the thermodynamic properties and reaction kinetics of both isomers, providing crucial input for astrochemical simulations. Our results indicate that the Z-isomer is favored under typical interstellar conditions, in agreement with observational data. The E-isomer, however, is found to be sensitive to variations in gas-phase chemistry and grain-surface processes. By incorporating our quantum chemical data into astrochemical models, we demonstrate that the isomeric ratio of cyanomethanimine can serve as a sensitive probe of interstellar environments. Our study highlights the importance of accurate quantum chemical calculations in understanding the complex chemistry of interstellar media, shedding light on the intricate interplay between gas-phase and grain-surface processes that govern the abundance of key astrochemical species.
