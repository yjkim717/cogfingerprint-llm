**Abstract**

The presence of carbon monoxide (CO) ice mantles on interstellar dust grains is widely recognized as a significant reservoir for carbon-chain molecules in cold, dense molecular clouds. Understanding the chemical processes occurring within these ices is crucial for modeling interstellar chemistry. This study presents experimental results investigating the hydrogenation of CO within amorphous solid water (ASW) ice at cryogenic temperatures. Utilizing a low-energy molecular beam setup, CO was introduced into ASW matrices and subsequently irradiated with atomic hydrogen (H) at temperatures ranging from 10 K to 70 K. High-resolution infrared spectroscopy was employed to monitor the formation of reaction products. Our findings demonstrate surprisingly efficient production of both formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) even at relatively elevated temperatures within the ASW matrix. These results suggest that diffusive H transport within the amorphous ice structure, rather than surface kinetics alone, plays a significant role in facilitating hydrogenation reactions. The observed product ratios and temperature dependence provide valuable constraints on models of interstellar grain surface chemistry, indicating that hydrogenation pathways within ASW ices can be more productive than previously assumed, particularly at temperatures relevant to the outer regions of protoplanetary disks and dense molecular clouds. Further research is warranted to explore the influence of varying ASW density and H flux on these reaction efficiencies.
