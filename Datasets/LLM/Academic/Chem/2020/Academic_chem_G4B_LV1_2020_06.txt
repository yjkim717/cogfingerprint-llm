**Isomeric Abundance and Ion-Molecule Destruction Pathways of Cyanomethanimine in Astrophysical Environments**

The photochemical and ion-molecule processes governing interstellar gas-phase chemistry are critically dependent on the relative abundances of molecular isomers. This work presents a detailed *ab initio* investigation into the rotational and vibrational structure of cyanomethanimine (HC≡CN), focusing specifically on the Z- and E- isomers. Utilizing high-level computational methods, we determined accurate potential energy curves for both isomers, accounting for hyperfine and Fermi rotational transitions. Our findings reveal a significantly lower Z/E ratio for cyanomethanimine than previously reported in astrochemical models, suggesting a revised understanding of its formation and destruction pathways. These isomeric distinctions profoundly impact its susceptibility to ion-molecule destruction via proton abstraction, influencing the overall chemical evolution of interstellar clouds and potentially affecting the observed abundances of complex organic molecules. Further investigation is warranted to validate these results within broader astrophysical contexts.
