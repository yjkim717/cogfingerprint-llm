**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a burgeoning class of porous materials exhibiting remarkable structural versatility. However, their practical application is increasingly constrained by a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding their dynamic behavior. This research investigates the critical need for a shift towards characterizing MOFs within a four-dimensional (4D) framework, encompassing spatial and temporal dimensions. We propose that elucidating the *spatiotemporal evolution* of MOF structures – specifically, their structural dynamics – is paramount to unlocking their full potential. Utilizing advanced in-situ characterization techniques, including synchrotron X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic methods, we demonstrate how subtle environmental stimuli, such as temperature and pressure, induce measurable changes in framework topology.  These observations underscore the importance of considering dynamic responsiveness in the design of MOFs for applications in selective adsorption, catalysis, and sensing, ultimately driving future innovations in materials science.
