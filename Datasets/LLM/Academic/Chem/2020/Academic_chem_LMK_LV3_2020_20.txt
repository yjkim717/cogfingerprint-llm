Title: Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Modulation of Electron Transfer Reactions

Abstract: 
This study explores the impact of cavity quantum electrodynamics on electron transfer reactions within the framework of ultra-strong coupling. By modulating the light-matter interaction strength, we demonstrate that polariton-mediated charge transfer can be significantly enhanced or suppressed. Our quantum dynamics simulations reveal a nuanced dependence of electron transfer rates on the cavity coupling strength, suggesting potential applications in controlling chemical reactivity. The findings underscore the role of polariton-mediated electron transfer in shaping reaction pathways, offering new avenues for manipulating photochemical processes.
