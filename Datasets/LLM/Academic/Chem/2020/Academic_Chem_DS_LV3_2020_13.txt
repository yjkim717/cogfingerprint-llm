In interstellar chemistry, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) within amorphous solid water (ASW) ice mantles represents a critical pathway for the formation of complex organic molecules. This study investigates the diffusive properties of hydrogen atoms through ASW matrices and their subsequent reactivity with embedded CO at cryogenic temperatures relevant to dense molecular clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that efficient hydrogenation proceeds at temperatures up to approximately 70 K, yielding significant quantities of formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH). This observed reactivity challenges previous models that assumed substantial atomic hydrogen diffusion required significantly warmer ice environments. We propose that the persistence of microscopic cracks and porous networks within the amorphous ice structure facilitates this unexpected penetration, enabling hydrogen atoms to access and react with trapped CO molecules. These findings, contextualized within astrophysical ice analogues, suggest that diffusive hydrogenation is a viable non-energetic formation mechanism for prebiotic molecules in cold interstellar regions. Consequently, the presence of such structural imperfections in ice mantles must be incorporated into astrochemical models to accurately describe molecular evolution in the early stages of star and planet formation.
