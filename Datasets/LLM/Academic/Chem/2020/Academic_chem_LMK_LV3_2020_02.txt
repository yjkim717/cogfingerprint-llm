Title: Investigating Cyanomethanimine Isomer Abundance in Interstellar Environments: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Approach

Abstract:

The relative abundance of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine isomers in interstellar environments has garnered significant attention in recent astrochemical research. Utilizing ab initio quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling, this study elucidates the chemical processes governing the isomer abundance of cyanomethanimine. Quantum chemical calculations performed at the CCSD(T) level of theory provide accurate thermochemical data for the isomers, while astrochemical models simulate the formation and destruction pathways in various interstellar environments. Our results indicate that the Z/E ratio is sensitive to the temperature and density conditions prevalent in these environments. The findings of this study, contextualized within the 2020 updates to the astrobiological and astrochemical literature, contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex chemistry underlying interstellar environments and have implications for the detection of these isomers in astronomical observations.
