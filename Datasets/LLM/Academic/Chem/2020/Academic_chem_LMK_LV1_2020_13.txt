Title: Investigating the Thermal Limits of CO Hydrogenation in Amorphous Solid Water: Implications for Interstellar Chemistry

Abstract:

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) on interstellar dust grains is a crucial process in the formation of complex organic molecules in astrophysical environments. In this study, we examine the temperature-dependent hydrogenation reactions of CO embedded in amorphous solid water (ASW), a key component of interstellar ices. Using a combination of laboratory experiments and computational simulations, we demonstrate that CO hydrogenation reactions occur at elevated temperatures, up to approximately 70 K, in ASW matrices. Our results indicate that the reaction kinetics are influenced by the structural properties of ASW, including its porosity and surface area. The findings of this research have significant implications for our understanding of the chemical processes that occur in interstellar environments, particularly in the context of star-forming regions. By elucidating the thermal limits of CO hydrogenation in ASW, we provide new insights into the complex chemistry that underlies the formation of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium.
