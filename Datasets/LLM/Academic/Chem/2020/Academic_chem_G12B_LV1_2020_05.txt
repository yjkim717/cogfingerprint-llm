**Abstract**

The presence of carbon monoxide (CO) ice mantles on interstellar dust grains is a critical factor in the chemical evolution of molecular clouds and the formation of complex organic molecules. While laboratory studies have demonstrated CO hydrogenation on crystalline ice surfaces, the behavior within amorphous solid water (ASW), a more realistic analogue of interstellar ice, remains comparatively less explored, particularly concerning reaction kinetics at elevated temperatures. This work presents a novel investigation into the diffusive hydrogenation of CO trapped within ASW, utilizing temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and infrared spectroscopy to monitor reaction progress. Our findings demonstrate unexpectedly efficient hydrogenation of CO to form methane (CHâ‚„) and other hydrocarbons even at temperatures as high as 100 K. Isotopic tracer experiments utilizing deuterium (D) reveal a significant role for hydrogen atom diffusion through pre-existing microcracks and voids within the ASW matrix. These diffusion pathways bypass the typically rate-limiting surface reaction barriers observed in crystalline ice systems, thereby facilitating efficient hydrogenation. This mechanism suggests that ASW provides a more reactive environment than previously anticipated for CO processing in cold molecular clouds, potentially contributing to the observed abundance of simple hydrocarbons in protostellar outflows and cometary ices. Further modelling is required to fully quantify the impact of ASW porosity on hydrogenation reaction rates and to constrain the chemical complexity achievable under astrophysical conditions.
