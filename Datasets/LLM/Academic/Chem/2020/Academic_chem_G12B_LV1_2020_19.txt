**Engineering Spatiotemporal Functionality in Metal-Organic Frameworks via Four-Dimensional Architectures**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), celebrated for their tunable porosity and compositional diversity, have traditionally been considered static, crystalline materials. However, the burgeoning field of dynamic MOFs highlights the potential to introduce responsive behavior, enabling adaptation to external stimuli. This work proposes a paradigm shift towards the conception and engineering of *four-dimensional (4D) frameworks*, explicitly incorporating timescale as a design parameter alongside the conventional three spatial dimensions. We argue that the deliberate orchestration of structural dynamics—the spatiotemporal evolution of MOF topology—represents a crucial avenue towards realizing advanced functional materials.  The controlled modulation of bond rearrangement, guest diffusion, and phase transitions within MOFs offers opportunities for applications ranging from adaptive separations and responsive catalysis to sophisticated sensing platforms. This perspective examines the current limitations in characterizing and predicting these dynamic processes, particularly at relevant timescales (microseconds to hours). It highlights emerging synthetic strategies utilizing reversible covalent and coordination linkages, alongside stimuli-responsive components, that enable programmed structural changes.  Finally, we outline future research directions focusing on integrating computational modeling with experimental validation to facilitate the rational design of 4D MOFs exhibiting predictable and tailored spatiotemporal functionalities, thus unlocking a new generation of dynamic materials.
