Title: Enhanced Hydrogenation of CO in Amorphous Solid Water: Implications for Interstellar Chemistry

Abstract:
The hydrogenation of CO embedded in amorphous solid water (ASW) is a crucial process in interstellar ice mantles, influencing the chemical composition of astrophysical environments. Recent laboratory experiments conducted in 2020 have demonstrated that CO hydrogenation reactions occur efficiently at elevated temperatures, up to approximately 70 K, within ASW. This diffusive reaction process is facilitated by the porous structure of ASW, enabling the mobility of H atoms and subsequent reaction with CO. The findings suggest that interstellar ices can undergo significant chemical transformations, even at relatively high temperatures. The results have important implications for understanding the formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar space, highlighting the role of ASW in promoting hydrogenation reactions. This study contributes to our understanding of the chemical processes governing the evolution of interstellar ice mantles, shedding light on the intricate chemistry of astrophysical environments.
