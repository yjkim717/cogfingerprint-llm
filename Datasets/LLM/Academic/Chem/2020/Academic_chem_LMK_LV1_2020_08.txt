Title: Quantum Dynamical Simulations of Polariton-Mediated Electron Transfer in the Ultra-Strong Coupling Regime

Abstract:
The manipulation of chemical reactions through cavity quantum electrodynamics has garnered significant attention in recent years. We investigate the phenomenon of polariton-mediated electron transfer, wherein the strong interaction between molecular excitations and cavity photons modulates charge transfer reactions. Employing a combination of analytic rate constant theory and quantum dynamical simulations, we explore the impact of ultra-strong coupling on electron transfer dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the rate constant of charge transfer reactions can be significantly enhanced or suppressed, depending on the cavity photon energy and the strength of light-matter interaction. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms governing polariton-mediated electron transfer, our study provides new insights into the control of chemical reactivity in the ultra-strong coupling regime, with potential implications for the development of novel optoelectronic devices and quantum technologies.
