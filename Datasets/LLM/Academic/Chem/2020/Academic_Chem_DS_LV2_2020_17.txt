In the interstellar medium, the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces represents a critical pathway for the formation of complex organic molecules, yet the mechanisms enabling these reactions at cryogenic temperatures remain incompletely understood. This study investigates the role of hydrogen atom diffusion through porous networks and cracks within ASW ices to facilitate the sequential hydrogenation of CO to formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH). Experimental results demonstrate that these reactions proceed efficiently at temperatures up to 70 K, challenging previous models that required significantly higher thermal energy or alternative energy inputs. The findings indicate that the microporous structure of ASW provides conduits for H-atom mobility, thereby enabling sustained reactivity under astrophysically relevant conditions. This work substantiates a physicochemical framework wherein the morphology of interstellar ice mantles directly governs molecular synthesis, offering a plausible explanation for the observed abundances of H₂CO and CH₃OH in cold molecular clouds and protostellar environments.
