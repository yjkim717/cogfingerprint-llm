**Polariton-Mediated Control of Photoinduced Electron Transfer in Molecular Systems: A Quantum Dynamical Investigation**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers unprecedented opportunities to manipulate chemical processes through strong light-matter coupling. This work explores the influence of polariton formation on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) within a model molecular system embedded within an optical cavity. Utilizing real-time quantum dynamical simulations incorporating both electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, we investigate the dynamics of PET under varying cavity detuning and molecular excitation conditions. Our results demonstrate that the formation of polaritons can significantly alter the efficiency and timescale of PET compared to the non-cavity case. Specifically, we observe regimes of both enhanced and suppressed PET rates, dependent on the interplay between the polariton dispersion, the molecular electronic structure, and the coupling strength.  A detailed analysis reveals that the resonant coupling between the molecular transition and specific polariton branches can facilitate efficient charge transfer by effectively mediating the electronic coupling and modulating the potential energy surface. Conversely, non-resonant interactions may lead to destructive interference, inhibiting PET. These findings highlight the potential of cQED to exert fine-grained control over chemical reactivity by harnessing the unique properties of polaritonic states. This research contributes to the growing understanding of how light can be leveraged to engineer and optimize photochemical processes, potentially impacting areas such as artificial photosynthesis and optoelectronic devices.
