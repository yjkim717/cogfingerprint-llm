**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers a paradigm for manipulating chemical dynamics at the quantum level. This study investigates the control of electron transfer (ET) reactions via the formation of vibrational polaritons in the ultra-strong coupling regime. By embedding molecular ensembles within an optical cavity, we achieve a hybridization of molecular vibrational modes with the confined electromagnetic field, creating new light-matter hybrid states. We demonstrate theoretically that the rate constant for non-adiabatic charge transfer can be significantly enhanced or suppressed by precisely tuning two key parameters: the vacuum Rabi splitting, which quantifies the light-matter coupling strength, and the molecule-cavity detuning. Our quantum dynamical simulations reveal that resonant conditions, where the cavity frequency is tuned to a specific molecular vibration involved in the reaction coordinate, lead to the most pronounced effects. These findings, established in 2020, provide a foundational framework for leveraging quantum light-matter interactions to control charge and energy transfer processes, with potential applications in photocatalysis, organic photovoltaics, and the design of novel quantum-enhanced materials.
