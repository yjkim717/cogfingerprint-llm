Here we demonstrate that strong light-matter coupling within optical cavities fundamentally alters non-adiabatic electron transfer processes, establishing polariton formation as a potent tool for quantum control of chemical dynamics. By employing a quantum electrodynamical framework, we systematically investigate how hybrid light-matter states—polaritons—modulate electronic couplings and reorganization energies in model charge transfer systems. Our theoretical analysis reveals that cavity confinement conditions and Rabi splitting energies directly govern the rate enhancement or suppression observed in polariton-mediated electron transfer. Through exact numerical simulations of coupled electron-photon systems, we quantify how resonant cavity modes selectively enhance specific molecular transitions while suppressing competing pathways. The observed effects demonstrate that vacuum field fluctuations can significantly modify potential energy surfaces and non-adiabatic couplings, leading to transfer rate modifications exceeding an order of magnitude under optimal strong coupling conditions. These findings establish cavity quantum electrodynamics as a transformative approach for manipulating charge transfer processes, with profound implications for photocatalysis, organic photovoltaics, and quantum-enhanced molecular devices operating under ambient conditions.
