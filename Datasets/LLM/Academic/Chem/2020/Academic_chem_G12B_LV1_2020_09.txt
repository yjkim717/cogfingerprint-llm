**Abstract: Enhanced Hydrogenation of Carbon Monoxide Embedded within Amorphous Solid Water Ice Mantles**

The prevalence of carbon monoxide (CO) within icy grain mantles in interstellar molecular clouds represents a significant reservoir of volatile carbon. Understanding the chemical evolution of these ices, particularly the fate of CO, is crucial for modeling the formation of complex organic molecules and the emergence of prebiotic chemistry. This work explores the hydrogenation of CO molecules physically embedded within amorphous solid water (ASW) ice, a prevalent form of ice in astrophysical environments. Utilizing low-energy (≤ 1 eV) hydrogen atom irradiation at temperatures ranging from 10 K to 70 K, we demonstrate that surprisingly efficient hydrogenation of CO occurs, leading to the formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) even at relatively elevated temperatures within this cryogenic matrix.  Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy reveals a distinct pathway involving initial H₂CO formation followed by subsequent hydrogenation to CH₃OH.  The observed reaction efficiency is attributed to enhanced diffusive transport of hydrogen atoms within the ASW matrix, facilitated by the disordered structure of the ice. This contrasts with previous observations in crystalline ice, where diffusion is significantly limited. Our findings suggest that ASW ice mantles provide a more reactive environment for CO hydrogenation than previously appreciated, potentially influencing the production of key precursors to more complex organic species in dense interstellar cores. Further investigations are underway to explore the role of varying ASW density and hydrogen flux on the reaction kinetics.
