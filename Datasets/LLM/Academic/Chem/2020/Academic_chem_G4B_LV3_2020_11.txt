**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are increasingly recognized for their potential in diverse applications, yet a fundamental challenge remains: fully elucidating their complex dynamics. This work introduces the concept of “four-dimensional MOFs,” representing a paradigm shift towards characterizing materials not merely in terms of static structure but encompassing spatiotemporal evolution.  We argue that current methodologies are insufficient to capture the nuanced changes within MOFs occurring across multiple timescales – from picoseconds to years – influencing their performance.  Specifically, advanced spectroscopic techniques coupled with computational modeling are required to track structural rearrangements, guest molecule diffusion, and framework degradation.  Engineering strategies predicated on a thorough understanding of these dynamics are therefore crucial.  Future research must prioritize the development of novel experimental and theoretical tools to facilitate the systematic investigation of MOF behavior, ultimately enabling the rational design of robust and adaptable materials for targeted applications by 2020.
