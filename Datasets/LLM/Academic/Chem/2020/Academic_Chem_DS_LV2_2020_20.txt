**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers a novel paradigm for manipulating chemical dynamics at the nanoscale. This theoretical investigation explores the control of polariton-mediated electron transfer between molecular states confined within an optical cavity. By quantizing the electromagnetic field, we establish that the formation of hybrid light-matter states (polaritons) fundamentally alters the potential energy landscapes governing charge transfer processes. Our analysis, supported by high-level quantum dynamical simulations, demonstrates that the electron transfer rate can be coherently enhanced or suppressed by precisely tuning two key parameters: the light-matter coupling strength and the cavity resonance frequency relative to the molecular electronic transitions. This work provides a rigorous theoretical framework for polariton-mediated charge transfer, demonstrating that strong coupling can bypass conventional limitations imposed by Franck-Condon factors and electronic coupling elements. These findings, situated within the 2020 research landscape, establish cQED as a powerful tool for controlling charge and energy flow in molecular and material systems, with significant implications for the development of novel photochemical devices and quantum-enhanced energy transport technologies.
