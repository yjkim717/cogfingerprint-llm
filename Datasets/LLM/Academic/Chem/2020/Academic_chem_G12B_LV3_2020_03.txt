**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has traditionally prioritized static structural properties; however, harnessing their inherent dynamic potential represents a critical frontier for advanced material applications. This work presents a novel design paradigm that incorporates timescale as a fourth dimension in MOF engineering, moving beyond equilibrium descriptions. We demonstrate a strategy for controlling the spatiotemporal evolution of MOF structures, enabling targeted manipulation of molecular recognition capabilities. By precisely modulating structural dynamics—including conformational changes and network rearrangements—we aim to overcome limitations in selectivity and responsiveness. The research elucidates the role of energy barriers in governing these dynamic processes and proposes methods for their manipulation through ligand design and external stimuli. This approach facilitates a deeper understanding of MOF deformation mechanisms and paves the way for the development of adaptive materials with tailored functionality.
