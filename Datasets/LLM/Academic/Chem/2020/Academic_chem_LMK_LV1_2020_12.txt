Title: Exploring Polariton-Mediated Electron Transfer in the Ultra-Strong Coupling Regime: A Quantum Dynamical Study

Abstract:
The manipulation of chemical reactions through cavity quantum electrodynamics has garnered significant attention in recent years. By exploiting the ultra-strong coupling regime, where the light-matter interaction strength rivals the bare excitation energies, novel pathways for controlling photochemical processes emerge. This study employs quantum dynamical simulations to investigate polariton-mediated electron transfer reactions within a cavity. Our approach integrates the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method with a cavity quantum electrodynamics framework, enabling the accurate description of the coupled electron-photon dynamics. The results demonstrate that, in the ultra-strong coupling regime, the polariton-mediated electron transfer rate is significantly enhanced, exhibiting a non-trivial dependence on the cavity photon frequency and coupling strength. These findings provide insight into the mechanisms governing polariton-mediated electron transfer and highlight the potential for cavity-controlled chemistry.
