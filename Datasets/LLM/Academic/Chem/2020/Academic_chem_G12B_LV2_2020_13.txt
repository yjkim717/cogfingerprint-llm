**Abstract**

The chemical evolution of icy grain mantles in interstellar environments is a crucial process for the formation of complex organic molecules. This study investigates the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) trapped within amorphous solid water (ASW) ice, a prevalent scenario in cold molecular clouds. Utilizing laboratory simulations, we demonstrate a surprisingly facile production of formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) at temperatures as high as 20 K. Our findings reveal that the efficiency of these hydrogenation reactions is primarily governed by the diffusive transport of atomic hydrogen (H) through the ASW matrix. Specifically, the observed product yields indicate that H diffusion is not a rate-limiting factor, even within the dense ASW environment. This challenges previous assumptions regarding the thermal activation energies required for hydrogenation within ice mantles. The results suggest that CO hydrogenation can occur at significantly higher temperatures than previously considered, potentially broadening the range of environments where these key prebiotic molecules can be synthesized. These findings have implications for understanding the chemical inventory of protoplanetary disks and the delivery of organic material to early Earth.
