Title: Unveiling the Astrochemical Dynamics of Cyanomethanimine Isomers: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:

The detection of cyanomethanimine (C2H2N2) in various interstellar environments has sparked significant interest in understanding its isomeric abundance ratios. In this study, we employ a synergistic approach combining quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling to investigate the chemistry of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine. Utilizing high-level quantum chemical methods, we accurately determined the thermodynamic properties and reaction rate coefficients for key formation and destruction pathways. Our results indicate that the Z- and E-isomers exhibit distinct reactivity patterns, influencing their relative abundances in interstellar environments. Astrochemical models, incorporating our computed rate coefficients, successfully reproduced the observed isomer abundance ratios in select astrophysical sources. Our findings provide new insights into the astrochemical dynamics governing cyanomethanimine isomerism, shedding light on the complex chemistry underlying interstellar environments. The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between chemistry and astrophysics in shaping the molecular composition of interstellar space.
