**Abstract**

The rational engineering of spatiotemporal evolution in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a frontier in developing advanced dynamic materials. While traditional research has focused on static porous architectures, recent efforts aim to program structural dynamics across both space and time to create four-dimensional (4D) systems with life-like functionalities. This perspective, contextualized in 2020, analyzes the primary challenges in controlling dynamic phenomena, such as orchestrating cooperative bond formation/cleavage and directing the propagation of crystalline transitions. We discuss emerging design strategies that leverage external stimuli—including light, electric fields, and chemical gradients—to precisely dictate the kinetics and spatial directionality of framework reconfiguration. By integrating concepts from supramolecular chemistry and materials science, we outline a roadmap for achieving predictable spatiotemporal control, which is critical for next-generation applications in adaptive catalysis, molecular sensing, and programmable drug delivery.
