**Abstract:**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a burgeoning class of porous framework materials with increasing relevance across diverse scientific disciplines. However, a critical gap exists in our understanding of their behavior â€“ specifically, the spatiotemporal evolution of their dynamic properties. This study addresses this deficiency by investigating the nascent field of four-dimensional (4D) MOFs, materials exhibiting structural changes in response to external stimuli over extended timescales. We posit that traditional characterization techniques are insufficient to capture the intricate transformations occurring within these systems. Consequently, we advocate for the development of novel methodologies capable of monitoring structural rearrangements at multiple length scales, from picoseconds to months.  Specifically, advanced spectroscopic techniques coupled with computational modeling are crucial to elucidate the mechanisms governing framework material dynamics.  The successful implementation of 4D MOF research will not only refine our theoretical models but also enable targeted engineering of these materials for applications in sensing, catalysis, and controlled release, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced appreciation of their complex behavior.
