**Abstract**

The manipulation of chemical reactivity via the vacuum electromagnetic field of an optical cavity represents a frontier in polaritonic chemistry. In this theoretical study, we employ high-level quantum dynamical simulations to investigate polariton-mediated electron transfer (ET) reactions in the ultra-strong coupling regime. We demonstrate that the formation of hybrid light-matter states (polaritons) through cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful mechanism to exert quantum coherent control over ET kinetics. By systematically tuning the light-matter coupling strength and detuning the cavity frequency from the molecular transition, we modulate the potential energy surfaces and the effective driving force governing the reaction. Our results reveal that the reaction rate can be either significantly enhanced or suppressed by orders of magnitude relative to the free-space reaction, depending on the specific cavity parameters. This non-perturbative control, achieved without external driving fields, underscores the potential of cavity QED as a novel paradigm for steering fundamental chemical processes, with implications for quantum-enhanced catalysis and energy conversion.
