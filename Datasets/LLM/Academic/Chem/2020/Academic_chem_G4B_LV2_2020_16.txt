**Abstract**

Electron transfer (ET) processes are fundamental to numerous chemical and biological phenomena, yet efficient control remains a significant challenge. This research explores the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) to modulate ET rates between donor and acceptor molecules, leveraging the intricate interplay of light-matter coupling. Utilizing a combination of theoretical quantum simulations and a focus on polariton-mediated ET, we demonstrate how engineered optical cavities can dramatically alter the efficiency of these charge transfer reactions. 

Specifically, our modeling reveals that strong light-matter coupling within the cavity creates localized polariton modes, effectively funneling energy and enhancing the probability of electron hopping. Conversely, specific cavity designs can suppress ET by introducing energy bottlenecks or altering the electronic landscape. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the quantum mechanical underpinnings of ET and offer a novel pathway for designing tailored chemical systems with enhanced or inhibited reactivity. The results, obtained in 2020, underscore the promise of CQED as a tool for precision chemical control, opening avenues for applications in areas ranging from photocatalysis to molecular electronics.
