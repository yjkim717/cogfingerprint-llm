Abstract: The paradigm-shifting emergence of four-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (4D MOFs) represents a frontier in materials chemistry, where time is explicitly integrated as a manipulable design parameter. This conceptual advance addresses the critical challenge of engineering dynamic porous solids whose structures and functionalities evolve spatiotemporally in response to external stimuli. By leveraging programmable ligand flexibility and metal-node lability, 4D MOFs exhibit precisely controlled structural transitions that govern selective molecular recognition and diffusion kinetics. Current research focuses on elucidating the fundamental mechanisms driving these temporal evolutions, employing advanced in situ characterization techniques to capture transient states. The strategic incorporation of photoresponsive linkers and redox-active centers enables unprecedented spatiotemporal control over pore geometry and chemical environment. As of 2020, these developments are paving the way for smart materials with applications in targeted drug delivery, adaptive catalysis, and molecular separation technologies, marking a departure from static porous materials toward systems with life-like temporal complexity.
