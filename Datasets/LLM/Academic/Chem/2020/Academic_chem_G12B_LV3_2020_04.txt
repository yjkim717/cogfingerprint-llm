**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers unprecedented opportunities to manipulate chemical reaction dynamics through enhanced light-matter interaction. This study, conducted within the context of increasingly accessible ultra-strong coupling regimes, explores the influence of polariton formation on electron transfer (ET) processes in molecular systems. We demonstrate that embedding molecular donors and acceptors within optical cavities can drastically modulate ET rates, exhibiting both enhancement and suppression depending on cavity parameters. Crucially, our analysis highlights the necessity of incorporating counter-rotating terms and accurately accounting for dipole self-energy effects to obtain quantitatively reliable predictions, particularly when dealing with dark states. These findings underscore the potential of polariton chemistry to control charge transfer pathways and open avenues for designing novel molecular devices and photocatalytic systems, pushing the boundaries of chemical reactivity beyond traditional paradigms.
