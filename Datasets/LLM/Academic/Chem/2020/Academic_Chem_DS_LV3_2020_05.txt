In this study, we investigate the hydrogenation mechanisms of carbon monoxide (CO) within amorphous solid water (ASW) matrices under astrophysically relevant conditions, addressing a critical pathway for complex organic molecule formation in interstellar ices. Through temperature-programmed desorption and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy experiments conducted at 10–70 K, we demonstrate that CO hydrogenation proceeds efficiently via sequential addition of H atoms to yield formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH). Crucially, we identify that hydrogen atom diffusion through nanoscale cracks and pores in the ASW mantle enables reactivity at temperatures significantly higher than previously theorized. This work establishes that non-diffusive bulk penetration—rather than surface-limited processes—dominates the reaction kinetics, with direct implications for the inventory of prebiotic molecules in cold molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. Our results, contextualized within contemporary astrochemical models, redefine the temperature constraints for solid-state CO hydrogenation in dark interstellar clouds and provide mechanistic insight into the origin of interstellar complex organic molecules. These findings resolve longstanding discrepancies between observational data and laboratory simulations regarding methanol abundances in quiescent regions of the interstellar medium.
