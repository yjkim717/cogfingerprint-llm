**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has traditionally prioritized structural design for static functionalities. This work presents a paradigm shift towards dynamic MOF engineering, introducing timescale as a critical fourth dimension in materials design. We propose a framework for controlling the spatiotemporal evolution of MOF structures, enabling the realization of adaptive materials exhibiting tunable molecular recognition properties. By incorporating stimuli-responsive linkers and nodes, we aim to induce reversible structural rearrangements across multiple length scales. This approach allows for the precise orchestration of guest molecule binding and release, offering unprecedented control over separation, catalysis, and sensing applications. This research leverages recent advances in dynamic covalent chemistry and supramolecular interactions to achieve predictable and programmable structural dynamics within MOF architectures, a critical step towards the development of truly adaptive and responsive materials.
