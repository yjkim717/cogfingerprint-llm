**Abstract**

The rational engineering of spatiotemporal dynamics in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a frontier in the design of advanced functional materials. While the intrinsic porosity and structural versatility of three-dimensional MOFs are well-established, achieving predictable, time-dependent four-dimensional (4D) behavior—where structures evolve in both space and time in response to stimuli—remains a significant challenge. This perspective, situated in the context of 2020, analyzes the primary obstacles to controlling these dynamic processes, including the precise modulation of energy barriers for framework transformations and the synchronization of dynamic events across multiple length scales. We discuss emerging strategies that leverage computational modeling, in situ characterization techniques, and linker design to program hierarchical dynamics. By establishing design principles for spatiotemporal control, this work aims to guide the development of next-generation MOFs for applications in adaptive catalysis, selective separations, and responsive sensing, where temporal programmability is paramount.
