**Abstract**

The design of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has traditionally prioritized structural stability and porosity. However, this study introduces a paradigm shift by incorporating timescale as a critical design parameter, enabling the engineering of dynamic materials exhibiting controlled spatiotemporal evolution. We propose a framework for understanding and manipulating structural dynamics within MOFs, utilizing concepts of energy barriers to govern transformations. This approach facilitates the creation of MOFs capable of adaptive molecular recognition, responding to external stimuli with predictable and reversible structural changes. By characterizing the kinetics of these transformations, we aim to unlock new functionalities, including selective separations, responsive catalysis, and advanced sensing applications. This work represents a significant step towards realizing a new generation of MOFs â€“ dynamic, adaptable materials with tailored responses to complex chemical environments.
