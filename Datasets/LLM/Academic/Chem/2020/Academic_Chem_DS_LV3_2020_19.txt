The burgeoning domain of four-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (4D MOFs) represents a paradigm shift in materials chemistry by incorporating time as a programmable dimension, enabling unprecedented control over dynamic structural transformations. This research addresses the critical challenge of engineering predictable spatiotemporal evolution in porous solids, which is essential for advanced applications in selective molecular recognition, adaptive separation processes, and stimuli-responsive drug delivery. Methodologically, we integrate in situ diffraction techniques, multiscale modeling, and post-synthetic modification to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning framework flexibility and guest-induced phase transitions. Our findings demonstrate that precise ligand design and metal-node engineering can modulate kinetic parameters and energy barriers, thereby dictating the trajectory of structural dynamics. By establishing design principles for temporally controlled porosity and functionality, this work lays the foundation for next-generation smart materials whose properties evolve in a predetermined manner, offering transformative potential for nanotechnology and sustainable chemistry in the 2020s.
