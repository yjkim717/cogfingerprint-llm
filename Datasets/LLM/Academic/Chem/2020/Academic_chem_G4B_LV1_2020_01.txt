**Abstract**

The catalytic hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) represents a critical pathway for hydrogen storage and chemical feedstock production. This research explores the mechanistic underpinnings of CO hydrogenation within amorphous solid water (ASW) matrices at elevated temperatures, specifically investigating the role of hydrogen diffusion. Utilizing a diamond anvil cell, we observed significant CO reduction activity commencing above 20 K, indicative of a transition beyond purely thermal activation.  Detailed analysis suggests that hydrogen diffusion through the ASW ice mantle is a key driver of this enhanced reactivity.  The observed temperature dependence of the reaction rate strongly implies a network of mobile hydrogen species facilitating CO adsorption and subsequent hydrogenation.  Further investigation into the ASW’s structural dynamics and hydrogen transport mechanisms is warranted to optimize catalytic performance and elucidate the precise nature of the active sites within this intriguing solid-state hydrogen storage medium.
