Title: Investigating the Temperature-Dependent Hydrogenation of CO on Interstellar Dust Grains: An Experimental Study

Abstract:

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) on interstellar dust grains is a crucial step in the formation of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium. In this study, we experimentally investigate the reaction kinetics of CO hydrogenation in amorphous solid water (ASW) at elevated temperatures. Using a ultrahigh vacuum setup, CO was co-deposited with H atoms on a substrate held at 10 K, and the subsequent reaction was monitored via temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS). Our results show that CO hydrogenation occurs efficiently in ASW up to âˆ¼70 K, with a reaction rate that increases with temperature. The findings suggest that the ice mantle composition on interstellar dust grains is influenced by the temperature-dependent hydrogenation of CO, with implications for the formation of complex organic molecules in star-forming regions. This study provides new insights into the chemistry of interstellar ices and sheds light on the role of hydrogenation reactions in the interstellar medium.
