**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a burgeoning class of porous materials, yet their inherent structural rigidity has traditionally limited their application in dynamic systems. This work addresses the critical need to manipulate and control the spatiotemporal evolution of MOF structures, proposing a framework for engineering four-dimensional (4D) dynamic materials.  Existing research predominantly focuses on static MOF architectures, neglecting the crucial aspects of structural reconfiguration under external stimuli. We argue that achieving true dynamism necessitates a shift towards understanding and modulating the underlying mechanisms governing MOF assembly, disassembly, and rearrangement. 

Specifically, this study investigates the challenges associated with inducing controlled spatiotemporal evolution – encompassing changes in topology, pore size, and connectivity – within MOF networks.  We posit that incorporating responsive linkers and strategically designed frameworks can facilitate predictable structural dynamics.  Further research is required to fully elucidate the relationship between material design, environmental stimuli, and the resultant spatiotemporal patterns observed in these dynamic systems.  Ultimately, this work lays the groundwork for the development of adaptable MOF materials with tailored functionalities.
