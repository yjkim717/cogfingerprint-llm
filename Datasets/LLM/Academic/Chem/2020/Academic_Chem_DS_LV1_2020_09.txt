**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) on interstellar dust grain analogues is a cornerstone reaction in the formation of complex organic molecules (COMs) in the interstellar medium. While the initial hydrogenation step to formyl radical (HCO) is well-established at low temperatures (~10-20 K), the subsequent steps leading to methanol (CH₃OH) have been challenging to reconcile with astrochemical models, as they appear to require significantly higher mobility of hydrogen atoms than predicted for dense amorphous solid water (ASW) ices. In this study, we employ temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) to investigate the non-diffusive hydrogenation of CO embedded within porous ASW. Our results demonstrate that CH₃OH formation proceeds efficiently at temperatures up to 70 K, a regime where bulk hydrogen diffusion is considered negligible. We propose a revised mechanism wherein hydrogen atoms propagate not through the bulk ice matrix, but via a network of interconnected pores and micro-cracks inherent to the ASW structure. This surface-facilitated diffusion pathway effectively lowers the activation barrier for hydrogen transport, enabling sequential hydrogenation through H₂CO to CH₃OH. These findings necessitate a re-evaluation of hydrogenation kinetics in astrochemical models, highlighting the critical role of ice morphology, rather than just temperature, in governing solid-state reactivity.
