Title: Spatio-Temporal Engineering of Dynamic Metal-Organic Frameworks: Challenges and Opportunities

Abstract:
The design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored structural dynamics have garnered significant attention in recent years. Four-dimensional (4D) MOFs, which exhibit temporal evolution in addition to their spatial structure, offer a promising platform for advancing our understanding of porous solids. However, the spatio-temporal engineering of these dynamic materials remains a significant challenge. In this context, we discuss the potential routes to controlling the temporal evolution of 4D MOFs, focusing on the interplay between framework flexibility, guest-host interactions, and external stimuli. By elucidating the complex relationships between these factors, we aim to provide a framework for the rational design of MOFs with programmable structural dynamics. Our analysis highlights the opportunities and challenges associated with engineering the spatio-temporal behavior of MOFs, with implications for applications in gas storage, separation, and catalysis. As of 2020, further research is needed to fully harness the potential of these dynamic materials.
