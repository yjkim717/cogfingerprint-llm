**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), crystalline porous materials exhibiting exceptional tunability, have traditionally been investigated with a focus on static structural properties. However, the inherent flexibility of their organic linkers and metal nodes suggests the possibility of dynamic behavior across a range of timescales. This work examines the emerging field of four-dimensional (4D) frameworks, expanding the conventional three-dimensional structural description to incorporate temporal evolution as a critical design parameter. We highlight the challenges associated with characterizing and controlling structural dynamics in MOFs, including the diverse mechanisms governing motions ranging from picosecond vibrations to macroscopic phase transitions. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of leveraging these dynamic properties to create responsive materials capable of spatiotemporal adaptation to external stimuli, such as light, temperature, or chemical environment. Achieving predictable and programmable structural evolution remains a key hurdle; however, recent advances in advanced spectroscopic techniques, computational modeling, and rational linker design offer promising avenues for engineering dynamic MOFs with tailored functionality for applications in sensing, catalysis, and separation technologies.
