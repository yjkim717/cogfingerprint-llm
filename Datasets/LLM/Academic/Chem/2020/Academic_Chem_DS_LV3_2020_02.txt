In this computational astrochemical investigation, we elucidate the interstellar formation and destruction mechanisms of the Z- and E-isomers of cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN). Employing high-level quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level of theory, we characterized the potential energy surfaces for their formation via neutral-neutral reactions, such as the CN + CH2NH pathway. Our results indicate that formation routes are largely isoenergetic, yielding a near-statistical isomer ratio. However, subsequent astrochemical modeling, incorporating the UMIST RATE12 network, reveals a significant deviation from this initial distribution in cold molecular clouds. The observed Z/E abundance ratio is not governed by thermodynamic stability or formation kinetics but is instead dictated by differential destruction rates in ion-molecule reactions. We demonstrate that this selectivity is a direct consequence of the relative dipole principle, wherein the larger permanent dipole moment of the E-isomer increases its collision cross-section with polarizing ions like H3+, leading to its preferential depletion. This finding, established through rigorous modeling, provides a fundamental framework for predicting molecular isomer ratios in the interstellar medium, directly linking quantum mechanical properties to observable astrophysical phenomena.
