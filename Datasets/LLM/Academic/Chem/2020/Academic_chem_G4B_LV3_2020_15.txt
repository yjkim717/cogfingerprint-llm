**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a rapidly expanding class of porous materials, yet a comprehensive understanding of their behavior remains a significant challenge. This study addresses a critical gap in the field by introducing the concept of “four-dimensional” MOF analysis – encompassing spatial, temporal, and dynamic characteristics. We posit that conventional characterization techniques often fail to capture the spatiotemporal evolution of MOF structures and functionalities, particularly under varying environmental conditions. Consequently, the development of novel methodologies capable of probing framework materials across multiple timescales is paramount. Specifically, we advocate for the integration of advanced spectroscopic techniques, coupled with computational modeling, to track changes in framework topology, guest molecule distribution, and intrinsic dynamics. This approach, we argue, is crucial for rational design and engineering of MOFs with tailored properties, ultimately unlocking their full potential in applications ranging from catalysis to gas storage.
