"Advancements in four-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (4D MOFs) rely on elucidating the spatiotemporal dynamics of deformable networks. By modulating energy barriers, these porous solids can be engineered for selective molecular recognition. This study investigates the structural dynamics of 4D MOFs, revealing a correlation between framework flexibility and guest molecule affinity. Our findings demonstrate that tailored energy landscapes can be designed to enhance molecular separation and sensing capabilities. These insights pave the way for the development of dynamic materials with tunable properties, offering promising applications in chemical sensing and separation technologies, as reported in 2020."
