Here we demonstrate how strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities fundamentally alters electron transfer dynamics, a cornerstone process in chemistry. By confining reactants within a Fabry-Perot resonator tuned to molecular transitions, we establish hybrid polariton states that dramatically modify charge transfer pathways. Our quantum electrodynamics calculations reveal that polariton formation enhances electronic couplings between donor and acceptor states by up to two orders of magnitude compared to free-space conditions. The transfer rate exhibits a pronounced dependence on the vacuum Rabi splitting, reaching maximum enhancement at resonance conditions where light-matter hybridization is complete. Through exact numerical simulations of model charge-transfer systems, we identify three distinct regimes: weak coupling where conventional Marcus theory applies, strong coupling exhibiting rate enhancement, and ultra-strong coupling where new reaction channels emerge. These findings, experimentally verified through ultrafast spectroscopy of cavity-embedded molecular dyads, establish polariton-mediated charge transfer as a powerful paradigm for controlling chemical reactivity. This work opens avenues for manipulating electron transfer processes in photocatalysis and molecular electronics through quantum vacuum engineering.
