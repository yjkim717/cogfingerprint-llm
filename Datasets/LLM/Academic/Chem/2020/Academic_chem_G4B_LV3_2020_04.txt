**Abstract:**

This study explores the influence of cavity quantum electrodynamics on photoinduced electron transfer (PET) processes within molecular systems. Utilizing a combined approach of analytic rate constant theory and advanced quantum simulations, we demonstrate the significant impact of light-matter coupling mediated by an optical cavity. Specifically, our results reveal that tailored cavity design can either amplify or diminish the efficiency of PET events, contingent upon the resonant frequency and spatial confinement of the light field.  The observed modulation of electronic couplings, arising from strong light-matter interactions, alters the driving force governing PET. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the quantum dynamics governing energy transfer in complex molecular environments.  Further investigation into these effects holds promise for optimizing PET-based technologies, including molecular electronics and photocatalysis, and provides a crucial benchmark for evaluating the role of engineered photonic environments in chemical reaction control.
