**Abstract**

The manipulation of chemical reactivity via the vacuum field of an optical cavity represents a frontier in polaritonic chemistry. Herein, we employ numerically exact quantum dynamical simulations to elucidate the coherent control of intramolecular electron transfer (ET) processes within the ultra-strong light-matter coupling regime. By embedding a model donor-acceptor system in a Fabry-PÃ©rot microcavity, we demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons can significantly modulate the reaction rate. Our results reveal a dual regulatory mechanism: the hybridization of electronic and photonic states through the Rabi splitting directly alters the electronic coupling matrix element, while the dressing of molecular vibrations suppresses the activation barrier by reshaping the potential energy surfaces. The interplay between these effects enables the reaction rate to be either enhanced or suppressed by over an order of magnitude, contingent upon the precise resonance condition between the cavity mode and key vibrational transitions. This work, situated in the context of 2020's advances in cavity quantum electrodynamics, provides a foundational framework for harnessing quantum optical environments to steer ground-state chemical transformations, with implications for photocatalysis and quantum-controlled synthesis.
