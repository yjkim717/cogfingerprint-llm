Title: Investigating the Isomer Abundances of Cyanomethanimine in Interstellar Environments: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:

The detection of cyanomethanimine (C2H2N2) in interstellar environments has sparked interest in understanding the chemistry of this prebiotic molecule. In this study, we employ a combined approach of quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling to investigate the isomer abundances of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine. Using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level, we computed the thermodynamic properties and reaction rate coefficients for the formation and destruction pathways of both isomers. Our results indicate that the Z-isomer is favored under interstellar conditions due to its lower energy state. Astrochemical simulations using the Nautilus code reveal that the Z/E ratio is sensitive to the temperature and density of the interstellar environment. Our findings provide insights into the chemistry of cyanomethanimine and have implications for understanding the formation of complex organic molecules in space. This study contributes to the ongoing efforts to elucidate the astrochemical processes governing the emergence of prebiotic chemistry.
