Title: Investigating Polariton Mediated Electron Transfer in the Strong Coupling Regime

Abstract:
The emerging field of cavity quantum electrodynamics has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its potential to manipulate and control chemical reactions through light-matter interactions. In this study, we investigate polariton mediated electron transfer reactions within the framework of ultra-strong coupling. Employing a combination of analytic rate constant theory and quantum dynamical simulations, we elucidate the role of polaritons in modulating electron transfer dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the formation of polaritons significantly influences the electron transfer rate constant, leading to enhancements or suppressions depending on the cavity parameters. The insights gained from this work provide a fundamental understanding of the interplay between light-matter interactions and electron transfer reactions, shedding light on the potential applications of cavity quantum electrodynamics in controlling chemical reactivity. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on the manipulation of chemical reactions through cavity quantum electrodynamics. (2020)
