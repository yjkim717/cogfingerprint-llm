Title: Quantum Dynamical Simulations of Polariton-Mediated Electron Transfer in the Ultra-Strong Coupling Regime

Abstract:
The emerging field of cavity quantum electrodynamics has enabled the manipulation of light-matter interactions, giving rise to novel phenomena in the ultra-strong coupling regime. Here, we investigate polariton-mediated electron transfer using a combination of analytic rate constant theory and quantum dynamical simulations. Our approach allows for a detailed understanding of the intricate interplay between electronic and photonic degrees of freedom. By examining the quantum dynamics of the coupled system, we elucidate the role of polaritons in modulating electron transfer rates. Our results demonstrate that the ultra-strong coupling regime can significantly enhance or suppress electron transfer, depending on the cavity frequency and coupling strength. These findings have important implications for the development of novel optoelectronic devices and the manipulation of photochemical reactions. Our simulations provide a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms, shedding light on the complex interplay between light and matter.
