In this study, we investigate the non-diffusive hydrogenation mechanisms of carbon monoxide (CO) embedded within amorphous solid water (ASW) ice matrices under astrophysically relevant conditions. While prior research (e.g., Fuchs et al., 2009) established the significance of H-atom diffusion through ice pores for surface-mediated reactions, our experiments conducted at 2020 reveal that efficient formation of formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH) proceeds at temperatures up to 70 K, a regime where bulk diffusion is conventionally considered negligible. We propose that this unexpected reactivity is facilitated by a network of persistent microscopic cracks within the ASW structure, which serve as conduits for hydrogen atom penetration into the ice mantle's interior. Through temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS), we quantitatively monitored the reaction kinetics and product distribution. Our results demonstrate that crack-mediated hydrogenation represents a dominant pathway for complex organic molecule synthesis in cold interstellar environments, such as molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks. This mechanistic insight fundamentally alters our understanding of ice mantle chemistry, suggesting that solid-state astrochemical models must account for the microstructural properties of ices to accurately predict molecular abundances.
