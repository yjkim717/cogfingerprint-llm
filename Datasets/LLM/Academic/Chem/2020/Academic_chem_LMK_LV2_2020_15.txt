Title: Harnessing Structural Dynamics in Metal-Organic Frameworks: Challenges and Opportunities

Abstract:
Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a prominent class of porous solids, distinguished by their tunable structures and diverse applications. The dynamic nature of MOFs, characterized by their ability to undergo structural transformations in response to external stimuli, has garnered significant attention in recent years. However, the rational design of dynamic MOFs remains a formidable challenge, largely due to the complexities associated with controlling their spatiotemporal evolution. In this context, we examine the current state of knowledge regarding the structural dynamics of MOFs and discuss potential strategies for engineering dynamic materials with tailored properties. By exploring the interplay between MOF structure, flexibility, and functionality, we highlight opportunities for advancing the field and unlocking the full potential of these versatile materials. As of 2020, significant progress is expected through the integration of cutting-edge characterization techniques and computational modeling.
