Title: Polariton-Mediated Electron Transfer: A Quantum Dynamical Study

Abstract:

The emerging field of cavity quantum electrodynamics has revitalized interest in the manipulation of light-matter interactions, particularly in the context of polariton-mediated electron transfer. In this study, we investigate the role of polaritons in facilitating electron transfer reactions within a cavity. By employing a combination of analytic rate constant theory and quantum dynamical simulations, we elucidate the intricate interplay between the electronic, photonic, and vibrational degrees of freedom. Our results demonstrate that the formation of polaritons significantly influences the electron transfer rate, exhibiting a pronounced dependence on the cavity frequency and coupling strength. The simulations reveal a nuanced interplay between the coherent polaritonic dynamics and the dissipative effects arising from the environment. This work provides a fundamental understanding of polariton-mediated electron transfer, shedding light on the potential for controlling chemical reactivity through tailored light-matter interactions. The findings have implications for the development of novel quantum-inspired technologies.
