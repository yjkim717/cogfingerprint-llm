Title: Unveiling the Dynamics of Open Metal-Organic Frameworks: A Pathway to Novel Four-Dimensional Materials

Abstract:
The development of four-dimensional materials with tailored spatio-temporal properties is contingent upon a profound understanding of the structural dynamics inherent to open metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). As a class of porous solids, MOFs exhibit dynamic behavior that is intricately linked to their structural flexibility and responsiveness to external stimuli. In 2020, ongoing research has underscored the significance of elucidating the dynamics of MOFs to engineer novel materials with precisely controlled properties. By investigating the intricate relationships between MOF structure, dynamics, and functionality, this study aims to contribute to the advancement of four-dimensional materials science. Through a comprehensive analysis of the structural dynamics of open MOFs, we demonstrate the potential for designing dynamic materials with engineered spatio-temporal evolution, thereby paving the way for innovative applications in fields such as catalysis, gas storage, and sensing.
