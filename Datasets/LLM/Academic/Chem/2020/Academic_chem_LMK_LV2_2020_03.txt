Title: Engineering Dynamic Metal-Organic Frameworks: Challenges and Opportunities

Abstract:

The design and synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with dynamic properties have garnered significant attention in recent years. Four-dimensional frameworks, which exhibit structural dynamics, offer promising applications in porous solids. However, engineering such dynamic materials poses significant challenges. This review aims to highlight the potential routes to achieving dynamic MOFs, with a focus on the underlying structural and chemical factors that govern their behavior. By examining the interplay between framework flexibility, guest molecule interactions, and external stimuli, we elucidate the key design principles for creating MOFs with tailored dynamic properties. The insights gained from this analysis will inform the development of next-generation MOFs with enhanced functionality and responsiveness, driving innovation in fields such as gas storage, separation, and catalysis. As of 2020, this area remains a vibrant and rapidly evolving field of research.
