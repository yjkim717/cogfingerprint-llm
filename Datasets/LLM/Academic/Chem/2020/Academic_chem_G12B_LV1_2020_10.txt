**Abstract**

The detection and characterization of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments provide critical insights into the chemical pathways operating in star-forming regions. This work focuses on the isomeric cyanomethanimines (NCCI), specifically the *Z*- and *E*-isomers, and their predicted abundances within dense molecular clouds. Utilizing quantum chemical calculations, we have determined accurate dipole moment values for both isomers, revealing a significant difference in their dipole strengths.  These differences are then incorporated into an updated astrochemical model, considering gas-phase reactions, photodissociation, and radiative processes relevant to typical molecular cloud conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that the isomeric ratio of *Z*-NCCI to *E*-NCCI is strongly sensitive to the local electric field environment.  We propose a “relative dipole principle,” whereby the observed isomeric abundance is governed not simply by the absolute dipole moment of each isomer, but by the *ratio* of their dipole moments, coupled with the local field strength and geometry. This principle suggests that regions with higher densities and stronger electric fields may preferentially stabilize the isomer with the lower dipole moment.  This study highlights the importance of considering molecular dipole moment ratios, rather than individual values, in accurately predicting COM abundances and interpreting observational data from interstellar environments, potentially offering a new diagnostic tool for probing the physical conditions within star-forming regions.
