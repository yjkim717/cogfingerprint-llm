**Abstract**

The advent of dynamic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has shifted the paradigm of porous solids from static hosts to stimuli-responsive materials. However, a fundamental challenge in this field is the transition from observing bulk transformations to actively engineering the spatiotemporal evolution of their structural dynamics. This perspective, framed within a four-dimensional materials design concept, posits that the deliberate incorporation of kinetic and spatial control mechanisms is paramount. We discuss how advanced synthetic methodologies, including gradient incorporation of functional linkers and post-synthetic defect engineering, can create energy landscapes that guide dynamic processes along predefined pathways. Furthermore, we highlight the critical role of in situ and time-resolved characterization techniques in mapping these transformations. By establishing design principles for the spatiotemporal control of framework flexibility, we envision the development of next-generation smart materials with applications in molecular sensing, selective separations, and programmable drug release, where the *pathway* of change is as crucial as the initial and final states.
