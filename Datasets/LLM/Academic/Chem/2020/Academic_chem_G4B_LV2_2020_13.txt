**Abstract**

The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) represents a significant pathway for hydrogen storage, and amorphous solid water (ASW) presents a potentially viable, low-temperature medium. This research explored the efficacy of ASW as a catalyst support for CO hydrogenation, focusing on the influence of temperature on reaction kinetics. Utilizing a novel experimental setup, we investigated CO hydrogenation within ASW samples maintained at elevated temperatures, extending the study range above 20 K.  Crucially, we observed substantial reaction rates, indicating that hydrogen diffusion through pre-existing microcracks within the ASW matrix facilitated effective reactant transport.  These findings challenge prevailing assumptions regarding the limitations of ASW at cryogenic temperatures.  The observed diffusion pathways, coupled with the ASW’s inherent hydrogen-binding capacity, suggest a mechanism wherein crack networks act as conduits for hydrogen, promoting diffusive hydrogenation.  Further investigation into the structural characteristics of these cracks and their impact on hydrogen mobility is warranted to optimize ASW’s performance in CO hydrogenation applications.
