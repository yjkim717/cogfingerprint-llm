**Abstract**

Efficient electron transfer processes are fundamental to a wide range of chemical and biological phenomena. Recent investigations have begun to explore the potential of manipulating these processes through resonant light-matter interactions. This study presents a theoretical framework utilizing quantum dynamical simulations to investigate the impact of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) on donor-acceptor electron transfer rates. Specifically, we model the interaction between photoexcited donor molecules and a dielectric cavity, demonstrating the emergence of polariton states. Our simulations reveal that these polariton intermediates significantly accelerate electron transfer kinetics compared to conventional Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pathways. 

The enhanced rates are attributed to the increased coupling between the donor and acceptor via the cavity field, effectively pre-organizing the molecular system for efficient charge separation.  Furthermore, we analyze the influence of cavity resonance frequency on the observed transfer dynamics, suggesting a tunable mechanism for controlling electron transfer efficiency. These findings highlight the promise of utilizing QED principles to engineer advanced molecular systems with tailored electronic properties.
