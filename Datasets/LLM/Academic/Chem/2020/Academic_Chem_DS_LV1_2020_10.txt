**Abstract**

The relative abundance of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN) isomers in the interstellar medium (ISM) presents a significant challenge for astrochemical models. This investigation employs high-level quantum chemical calculations (CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ) to characterize the isomers' electronic structures and subsequently model their gas-phase chemistry. We demonstrate that the relative dipole moment, a property previously underexplored in isomer-specific kinetics, is the dominant factor governing their observed abundance ratio. The E-isomer's larger dipole moment results in a significantly enhanced rate constant for destructive ion-molecule reactions with H3+, as determined via capture theory. This effect outweighs differences in formation pathways and thermal equilibrium, leading to the preferential depletion of the E-isomer relative to its Z-counterpart. Our findings, validated against observational data from the G+0.693 molecular cloud, necessitate a revision of astrochemical networks to incorporate dipole-mediated kinetic effects, providing a more robust framework for predicting molecular distributions of complex organic isomers in the ISM.
