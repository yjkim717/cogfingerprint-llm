Title: Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Modulation of Electron Transfer Reactions via Polariton Formation

Abstract:
The manipulation of electron transfer reactions through cavity quantum electrodynamics has garnered significant attention in recent years. By coupling a molecular system to a quantized radiation field, the formation of polaritons – hybrid light-matter states – can substantially influence charge transfer dynamics. Our study, conducted in 2020, investigates the role of polariton-mediated electron transfer reactions within the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics. We demonstrate that the strong light-matter coupling regime can either enhance or suppress electron transfer rates, depending on the cavity frequency and coupling strength. Quantum dynamical simulations reveal that polariton formation modulates the potential energy landscape, thereby altering the reaction pathways. These findings underscore the potential of cavity quantum electrodynamics to control and manipulate electron transfer reactions, offering novel avenues for the development of quantum technologies and the optimization of chemical reactions. Our results contribute to the burgeoning field of polariton chemistry.
