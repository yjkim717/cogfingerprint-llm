**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile materials, yet their inherent static nature presents a significant barrier to realizing their full potential in dynamic applications. This work addresses the growing need to manipulate and control the structural evolution of MOFs across a range of timescales, positioning them within the nascent field of four-dimensional (4D) materials. We investigate the complexities associated with engineering spatiotemporal dynamics within MOF frameworks, recognizing the limitations of traditional characterization techniques in capturing these transformations. Specifically, the study highlights the challenges in observing and influencing structural rearrangements occurring on picosecond to minute timescales.  The potential for utilizing stimuli-responsive components and carefully designed architectures to induce controlled, dynamic behavior is discussed.  Ultimately, this research underscores the importance of developing novel methodologies to probe and harness the inherent structural plasticity of MOFs, paving the way for advanced applications in sensing, catalysis, and adaptive materials science â€“ a critical step toward realizing the promise of dynamic MOF systems by 2020.
