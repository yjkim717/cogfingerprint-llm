Title: Spatiotemporal Dynamics in Four-Dimensional Metal-Organic Frameworks: Engineering Porous Solids through Structural Evolution

Abstract:
The development of dynamic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has garnered significant attention in recent years, driven by their potential applications in fields such as catalysis, gas storage, and molecular separation. However, the complexity of their structural dynamics poses significant challenges to their rational design. In this context, four-dimensional (4D) framework materials, which incorporate temporal evolution as a fourth dimension, offer a promising avenue for engineering porous solids with tailored properties. By elucidating the spatiotemporal evolution of MOFs, researchers can gain insight into the intricate relationships between structural dynamics, guest-host interactions, and functional properties. This understanding can, in turn, inform the development of novel design strategies, enabling the creation of MOFs with optimized performance and adaptability. This review highlights recent advances in the field, discussing potential routes to engineering dynamic MOFs through the manipulation of their 4D structural evolution.
