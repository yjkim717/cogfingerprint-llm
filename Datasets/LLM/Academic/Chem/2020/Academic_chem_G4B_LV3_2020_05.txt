**Abstract**

The mechanisms governing hydrogen incorporation into interstellar dust grains remain a significant challenge in astrochemistry. This research explores diffusive hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) within amorphous solid water (ASW) matrices, utilizing elevated temperatures to simulate astrophysical conditions.  Experimental results demonstrate a pronounced enhancement of hydrogen formation rates, exceeding 20 K, attributable to facilitated hydrogen diffusion via pre-existing microcracks present within the ASW structure. These findings indicate that ASW, particularly when possessing a network of interconnected voids, can serve as an exceptionally effective hydrogenating agent.  The observed efficiency suggests a plausible pathway for the observed enrichment of molecular hydrogen in interstellar dust, offering a compelling model for the formation of this crucial interstellar molecule. Further investigation into ASW’s structural heterogeneity is warranted to refine these predictive capabilities.
