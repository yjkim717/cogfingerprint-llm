Title: Spatiotemporal Dynamics in Four-Dimensional Metal-Organic Frameworks: Engineering Energy Barriers for Selective Molecular Recognition

Abstract:
The development of four-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (4D MOFs) has garnered significant attention in 2020, driven by their potential to revolutionize molecular recognition and separation technologies. By elucidating the spatiotemporal evolution of deformable networks within these porous solids, researchers can engineer tailored energy barriers to facilitate selective guest molecule adsorption. This study investigates the structural dynamics of 4D MOFs, focusing on the intricate relationships between framework flexibility, energy landscapes, and molecular recognition. Our findings provide insights into the rational design of dynamic materials with optimized performance for various applications.
