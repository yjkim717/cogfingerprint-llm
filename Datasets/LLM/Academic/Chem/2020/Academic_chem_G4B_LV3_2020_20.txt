**Abstract**

This study investigates the manipulation of electron transfer dynamics within a chemically defined system leveraging cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED). Utilizing precisely tuned light-matter coupling, we demonstrate a significant enhancement of polariton-mediated electron transfer between donor and acceptor molecules embedded within a photonic cavity. Our findings reveal that resonant light-matter interactions, coupled with the formation of polariton states, facilitate accelerated charge transfer rates compared to conventional approaches. Specifically, the engineered cavity environment modulates the electronic coupling landscape, effectively ‘funneling’ electron flow. Spectroscopic analysis, incorporating time-resolved techniques, confirms a substantial increase in electron transfer efficiency. These results highlight the potential of CQED as a versatile tool for controlling chemical reactivity and represent a key step toward designing novel optoelectronic devices and advanced catalytic systems. The observed phenomena underscore the importance of light-matter interactions in dictating quantum dynamics within complex chemical environments.
