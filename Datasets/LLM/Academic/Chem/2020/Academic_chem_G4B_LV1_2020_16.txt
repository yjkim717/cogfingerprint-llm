**Enhanced Electron Transfer Mediated by Polariton Dynamics in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics**

The efficient transfer of electrons remains a critical challenge in diverse chemical and biological processes. This research demonstrates a novel approach to accelerate electron transfer utilizing cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED). Specifically, we report the observation of enhanced electron transfer rates between spatially separated molecules facilitated by the formation of polariton states within a dielectric microcavity.  Light-matter coupling, achieved through judicious selection of the cavity’s resonant frequency, effectively mediates strong interactions between the molecules and the quantized electromagnetic field.  These interactions promote the delocalization of electronic wavefunctions, leading to the generation of hybrid polariton quasiparticles.  Theoretical modeling and spectroscopic analysis reveal a significant enhancement in electron transfer kinetics compared to conventional Förster resonance energy transfer.  These findings suggest a promising strategy for manipulating reaction rates and potentially enabling novel catalytic systems leveraging the tunable properties of engineered CQED environments.
