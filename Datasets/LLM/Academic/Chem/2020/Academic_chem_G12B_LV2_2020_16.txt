**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of light-matter interaction offers novel avenues for controlling chemical reaction dynamics. This study explores the influence of strong coupling between molecular systems and optical cavity modes on photoinduced charge transfer (CT) reactions, utilizing a quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework. Specifically, we investigate the role of polariton formation—the hybrid quasiparticles arising from the coherent coupling of molecular excitons and cavity photons—in modulating CT efficiency. Through theoretical modeling and analysis, we demonstrate that the nature of this coupling, characterized by the Rabi splitting energy, can lead to either enhanced or suppressed CT rates compared to the incoherent, non-coupled scenario.

Our simulations reveal that the polaritonic enhancement is most pronounced when the CT process is energetically aligned with the polariton dispersion. Conversely, significant suppression can occur if the polariton states exhibit destructive interference with the CT pathway. The presented analysis clarifies how the strength and symmetry of the light-matter interaction fundamentally alter the electronic structure and dynamics of the molecular system, impacting the probability of CT. These findings underscore the potential of cavity QED to engineer chemical reactivity and provide a deeper understanding of the interplay between quantum optics and chemical transformations, offering promising directions for the design of light-driven chemical processes. Further research is warranted to explore similar phenomena in complex molecular environments and to develop experimentally accessible strategies for manipulating polariton-mediated CT.
