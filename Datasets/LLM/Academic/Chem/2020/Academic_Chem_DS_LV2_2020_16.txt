**Abstract**

The manipulation of chemical reactivity via quantum light-matter interactions represents a frontier in physical chemistry. This theoretical study investigates the control of polariton-mediated electron transfer (ET) within a Fabry-PÃ©rot optical cavity. We employ high-level quantum dynamical simulations to model a donor-acceptor system strongly coupled to a confined photonic mode, treating the nuclei fully quantum mechanically. Our results demonstrate that the ET rate constant can be significantly enhanced or suppressed relative to the free-space reaction by tuning the cavity frequency and light-matter coupling strength. This control emerges from the formation of hybrid light-matter states (polaritons), which alter the potential energy landscapes and open interference-based pathways that are otherwise inaccessible. The observed non-monotonic dependence of the rate on coupling strength highlights the quantum nature of this phenomenon, distinct from classical field effects. These findings, established in a 2020 research context, provide a foundational framework for leveraging cavity quantum electrodynamics to steer photochemical processes and electron dynamics at the nanoscale, with implications for solar energy conversion and quantum-controlled chemistry.
