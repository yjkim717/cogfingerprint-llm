Title: Unveiling the Isomeric Abundances of Cyanomethanimine in Interstellar Environments: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:
The chemistry of cyanomethanimine (C2H2N2) in interstellar environments is investigated through a comprehensive study combining quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling. The Z- and E-isomers of cyanomethanimine are examined, with a focus on their relative abundances in various interstellar conditions. Quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory provide accurate thermochemical data, which are subsequently incorporated into astrochemical models to simulate the chemistry of these isomers in different interstellar environments. The results reveal that the Z-isomer is favored in cold, dense regions, whereas the E-isomer becomes more abundant in warmer, diffuse environments. The modeled isomer abundances are compared with observational data, providing insights into the chemical processes governing the formation and destruction of cyanomethanimine in interstellar space, as reported in recent studies (2020). This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the complex chemistry underlying interstellar environments.
