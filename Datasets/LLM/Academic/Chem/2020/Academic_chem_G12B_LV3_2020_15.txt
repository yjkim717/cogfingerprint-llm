**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently expanded to encompass four-dimensional (4D) materials exhibiting time-dependent structural changes. This work investigates the challenges inherent in engineering the spatiotemporal evolution of MOF frameworks, with a focus on achieving sophisticated molecular recognition capabilities. Controlling structural dynamics within MOFs necessitates a detailed understanding of the energy barriers governing conformational transitions and the development of stimuli-responsive linkers or metal nodes. We explore strategies for modulating these barriers through external stimuli such as light, temperature, and chemical agents, aiming to induce predictable and reversible structural rearrangements. Achieving precise control over these dynamic processes is crucial for applications including selective gas separation, responsive catalysis, and advanced sensing technologies. This perspective highlights critical research directions needed to realize the full potential of 4D MOFs as adaptive materials for chemical separations and beyond.
