**Abstract**

The exploration of prebiotic molecular pathways in interstellar environments remains a critical area of astrochemical research. This study presents a quantum chemical investigation into the isomeric forms (Z- and E-) of cyanomethanimine (NCCNH₂), a key precursor to adenine biosynthesis. Utilizing high-level computational methods, we determined structural and energetic properties of both isomers, subsequently incorporating these data into astrochemical models simulating conditions prevalent in dense molecular clouds. A novel ‘relative dipole principle’ is proposed to estimate the expected Z/E isomer abundance ratio, leveraging differences in molecular dipole moments to predict preferential formation pathways. Simulation results indicate a predicted [Z/E] ratio of approximately 3 under typical interstellar conditions. These findings contribute to a refined understanding of the chemical complexity driving the emergence of nucleobases and offer a predictive framework for assessing isomer distributions in astrophysical contexts.
