**Abstract**

The manipulation of chemical reactivity through quantum light-matter interactions represents a frontier in physical chemistry. This theoretical study investigates the coherent control of intramolecular electron transfer (ET) processes within an optical cavity operating in the ultra-strong coupling regime. By employing high-level quantum dynamical simulations, we demonstrate that the formation of vibrational polaritons—hybrid light-matter states—can profoundly alter ET kinetics. Our model reveals that the cavity environment not only renormalizes the effective driving force but also introduces novel quantum interference pathways mediated by polaritonic states. Crucially, we identify a non-monotonic dependence of the ET rate on the light-matter coupling strength, transitioning from resonant enhancement to dynamical suppression. This phenomenon is attributed to the competition between cavity-induced barrier modification and the decoherence of the reactive polariton. These findings, established in 2020, provide a foundational framework for leveraging cavity quantum electrodynamics to steer chemical reactivity, with implications for the design of novel photocatalysts and quantum-controlled molecular devices.
