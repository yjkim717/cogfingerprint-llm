**Abstract**

The investigation of interstellar molecules presents a critical avenue for understanding the chemical evolution of astrophysical environments. This study, conducted in 2020, employs *ab initio* quantum chemical calculations coupled with astrochemical modeling to reassess the isomeric ratio of cyanomethanimine ([CHâ‚‚CN]) within the G+0.693 giant molecular cloud.  Specifically, we examine both the Z- and E- isomers, crucial intermediates in interstellar radical chemistry.  Our findings demonstrate a revised [Z/E] ratio, significantly lower than previously estimated, attributable primarily to enhanced ion-molecule destruction pathways. These elevated destruction rates, modeled using updated reaction kinetics, highlight the sensitivity of interstellar abundance predictions to subtle variations in chemical processing.  The implications of this research extend to broader models of complex molecular formation and dissipation in cold, dense interstellar clouds, demanding refined consideration of reactive pathways.
