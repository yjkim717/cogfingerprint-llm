**Isomeric Abundances of Cyanomethanimine and the Influence of Ion-Molecule Destruction in Interstellar Environments**

The spectroscopic properties of cyanomethanimine (HCâ‰¡CN) are of significant interest to astrochemical modeling, given its potential role in interstellar ion-molecule destruction pathways. This work presents an *ab initio* investigation into the isomeric forms, Z- and E-cyanomethanimine, utilizing high-level computational methods to determine their respective rotational and vibrational energy levels.  Analysis reveals a notably lower Z/E ratio compared to predictions based on simple statistical mixtures.  We attribute this disparity to the preferential photodissociation of the E-isomer, a process exacerbated by its greater absorption cross-section.  Furthermore, our findings are integrated within the context of existing astrochemical models, demonstrating a reduced abundance of cyanomethanimine relative to its precursor, hydrogen cyanide, under typical interstellar conditions.  These results contribute to a more refined understanding of complex chemical networks operating in space.
