Title: Investigating the Temperature-Dependent Hydrogenation of Carbon Monoxide in Amorphous Solid Water on Interstellar Dust Grains

Abstract:
The hydrogenation of carbon monoxide (CO) on interstellar dust grains is a crucial process in the formation of complex molecules within molecular clouds. In this study, we examine the temperature-dependent hydrogenation reactions of CO in amorphous solid water (ASW), a key component of interstellar ices. Using laboratory experiments and spectroscopic analysis, we demonstrate that CO hydrogenation occurs on ASW surfaces at elevated temperatures, up to 70 K. Our results indicate that the reaction is facilitated by the increased mobility of hydrogen atoms on the ASW surface at higher temperatures. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of the chemistry of molecular clouds and the formation of complex organic molecules in interstellar environments. This research contributes to the ongoing investigation into the role of interstellar dust grains in shaping the chemical composition of the interstellar medium.
