**Abstract**

The detection of complex organic molecules (COMs) in interstellar environments, particularly within giant molecular clouds (GMCs), provides crucial insights into the chemical origins of life. This study focuses on the isomeric behavior of cyanomethanimine (NCCNH₂), a potentially significant COM, and its implications for astrochemical modeling. Quantum chemical calculations, employing high-level methods, were performed to determine the relative energies, dipole moments, and spectroscopic properties of the *Z*- and *E*-isomers of cyanomethanimine. Our findings reveal a surprisingly small energy difference between the isomers, suggesting that their abundances are highly sensitive to kinetic factors and environmental conditions. To address this sensitivity, we introduce a 'relative dipole principle' – a novel approach that correlates the relative abundances of isomeric species with the ratio of their calculated dipole moment differences to a characteristic energy scale representing the dominant excitation pathway (e.g., thermal or radiative). Application of this principle within astrochemical models, incorporating updated rate coefficients derived from our calculations, demonstrates a significant impact on predicted isomer ratios compared to traditional thermal equilibrium assumptions. This refined modeling capability offers a more accurate representation of the complex chemical landscape within GMCs and potentially clarifies the role of isomeric species in interstellar chemical networks. Further observational verification of these predictions is crucial for validating the principle and advancing our understanding of COM formation in the cosmos.
