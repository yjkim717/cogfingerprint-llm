**Abstract**

The rational engineering of spatiotemporal evolution in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represents a frontier in developing dynamic, four-dimensional (4D) materials. While the intrinsic porosity and structural tunability of MOFs are well-established, achieving predictable, long-range dynamic behavior—where structural changes propagate in a controlled temporal and spatial manner—remains a fundamental challenge. This perspective, contextualized within 2020, analyzes the primary obstacles, including the precise integration of stimuli-responsive moieties and the mitigation of defect-mediated dynamic heterogeneity. We discuss emerging design strategies that leverage concepts from nonlinear dynamics and cooperative transformation mechanisms to program complex reconfiguration pathways. By correlating molecular-level triggers with macroscopic property evolution, this work provides a framework for advancing MOFs from static porous solids towards intelligent, adaptive systems with applications in targeted drug delivery, reconfigurable electronics, and biomimetic machinery.
