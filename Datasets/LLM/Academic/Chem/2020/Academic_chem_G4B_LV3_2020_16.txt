**Abstract**

This research investigates the influence of optical cavity engineering on electron transfer dynamics within donor-acceptor systems, leveraging principles of cavity quantum electrodynamics. Specifically, we demonstrate that strategically coupling donor and acceptor molecules to an optical cavity dramatically modifies the rate of electron transfer mediated by polariton formation. Tuning the cavity’s resonant frequency effectively adjusts the effective driving force experienced by the donor-acceptor pair, coupled with optimized light-matter interactions.  Quantitative analysis, incorporating both electronic coupling constants and cavity field strength, reveals a non-linear relationship between these parameters and observed electron transfer kinetics. These findings highlight the potential for utilizing cavity QED to precisely control and accelerate electron transfer processes – a crucial consideration for applications in molecular electronics and photocatalysis.  Further investigation into the underlying quantum dynamics is warranted.
