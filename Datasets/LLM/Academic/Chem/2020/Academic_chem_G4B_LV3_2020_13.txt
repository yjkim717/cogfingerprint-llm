**Abstract:**

Recent investigations into the chemical complexity of interstellar environments have highlighted the crucial role of diffusive hydrogenation processes. This study, conducted in 2020, examined the reaction pathways of carbon monoxide (CO) within amorphous solid water (ASW) at elevated temperatures, specifically exploring conditions relevant to molecular cloud chemistry. Utilizing a novel experimental approach, we observed significant and sustained hydrogenating efficiencies exceeding 20 K, attributable to the facilitated diffusion of hydrogen atoms through pre-existing microcracks present within the ASW matrix. These findings challenge prevailing models suggesting limited hydrogenation activity at cryogenic temperatures. The observed efficiency suggests that ASW, a prevalent constituent of interstellar dust grains, may serve as a more active hydrogenation reservoir than previously assumed.  Consequently, this research offers new insights into the mechanisms driving chemical evolution within molecular clouds and the formation of complex organic molecules.
