This study employs high-level quantum chemical calculations at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) level of theory to characterize the gas-phase formation and destruction pathways of the Z- and E-isomers of cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN), a prebiotic molecule of significant astrochemical interest. Our computational results, integrated into a time-dependent gas-grain astrochemical model of a typical cold molecular cloud, demonstrate that the two isomers are formed with near-equilibrium abundances via radical-radical reactions on interstellar ice mantles. However, their subsequent gas-phase evolution diverges markedly. The observed molecular abundance ratio, [Z]/[E] > 1, is not a direct consequence of their formation thermodynamics or kinetics but is predominantly governed by their differential destruction rates via ion-molecule reactions. We quantitatively link this disparity to the isomers' distinct permanent dipole moments, formalizing a "relative dipole principle" wherein the isomer with the larger dipole moment (E-) undergoes more rapid depletion, thereby enriching the gas in the more stable Z-isomer. This finding underscores the critical role of molecular electrostatic properties in dictating isomer-specific chemistry in the interstellar medium.
