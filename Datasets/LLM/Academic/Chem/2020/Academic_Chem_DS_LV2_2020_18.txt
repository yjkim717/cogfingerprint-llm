This study employs high-level quantum chemical calculations to elucidate the astrochemical behavior of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN) isomers in the interstellar medium. We computed key molecular properties, including relative energies and dipole moments, using the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level of theory. Our results confirm the greater thermodynamic stability of the Z-isomer, yet our gas-grain astrochemical model, incorporating the latest reaction networks, predicts a divergent chemical evolution. The analysis reveals that the observed Z/E abundance ratio in molecular clouds such as Sgr B2(N) is not governed by thermodynamic control or formation pathways, but is instead dictated by differential destruction rates in ion-molecule reactions. We demonstrate that the significantly larger dipole moment of the E-isomer leads to a higher rate constant for reactions with prevalent cations like HCO+, in accordance with the relative dipole principle. This finding establishes dipole-moment-driven reactivity as a critical, non-equilibrium factor determining isomer distributions in cold interstellar environments, providing a refined framework for interpreting rotational spectra from radio astronomical observations.
