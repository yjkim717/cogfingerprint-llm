"Polariton-Mediated Electron Transfer in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics"

By harnessing the principles of cavity quantum electrodynamics, we demonstrate that strong light-matter interactions can profoundly influence electron transfer reactions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that coupling a molecular system to a quantized radiation field can modulate charge transfer rates, either enhancing or suppressing them. As of 2020, these findings underscore the potential for polariton-mediated electron transfer to revolutionize our understanding of quantum dynamics in chemical reactions, with significant implications for the development of novel optoelectronic materials and devices. Further research is warranted to explore the broader applications of this phenomenon.
