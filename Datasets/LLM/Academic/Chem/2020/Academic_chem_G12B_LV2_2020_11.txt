**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as versatile platforms for a wide range of applications; however, realizing their full potential necessitates the development of dynamically responsive materials. This work addresses the critical challenges associated with engineering structural dynamics within MOFs, particularly concerning controlled spatiotemporal evolution and its impact on molecular recognition capabilities. We examine strategies to induce and modulate structural transformations, encompassing stimuli-responsive linkers, guest-induced reconstructions, and the exploitation of inherent flexibility in the framework itself. A key focus lies on understanding the energy barriers governing these dynamic processes and how they dictate the rates and pathways of structural change. Achieving predictable and reversible dynamic behavior requires careful consideration of both thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Ultimately, enhanced control over structural dynamics in MOFs promises to unlock new functionalities, including adaptive separation, responsive catalysis, and advanced sensing applications.
