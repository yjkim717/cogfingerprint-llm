The burgeoning domain of four-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (4D MOFs) represents a paradigm shift in porous materials science, wherein time is explicitly integrated as a functional design parameter. This perspective critically addresses the inherent structural dynamics of MOFs, moving beyond static porosity models to interrogate their spatiotemporal evolution under external stimuli. By systematically engineering framework flexibility and dynamic bond behavior, researchers can precisely modulate pore aperture and functionality over time, unlocking unprecedented capabilities in selective molecular recognition and separation. This work synthesizes recent advances in characterizing and harnessing these dynamic processes, highlighting their potential to revolutionize applications from adaptive catalysis to smart sensing. The primary challenge remains the precise prediction and control of these complex, time-dependent structural transformations, a frontier demanding advanced in situ characterization techniques and computational modeling to fully realize the potential of 4D materials in next-generation chemical technologies.
