**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of polaritonic chemistry, operating within the framework of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED), offers a novel paradigm for controlling chemical reactivity. This theoretical investigation explores the manipulation of non-adiabatic electron transfer (ET) reactions by strong light-matter coupling in optical cavities. We present a comprehensive quantum dynamical study of a model donor-acceptor system, where the electronic states are ultrastrongly coupled to a confined photonic mode, forming hybrid light-matter quasiparticles known as polaritons. Our simulations reveal that the polaritonic potential energy surfaces (PESs), which emerge from this coupling, fundamentally alter the non-adiabatic dynamics governing the charge transfer process. By precisely tuning the cavity frequency and coupling strength, we demonstrate a significant enhancement or suppression of the thermal ET rate constant by over an order of magnitude compared to the free-space reaction. This control is rationalized through the modification of the Franck-Condon weighted density of states and the introduction of new polariton-mediated quantum pathways. These findings establish cavity-induced polariton formation as a powerful tool for the external control of electron transfer, with profound implications for photocatalysis and molecular electronics.
