**Abstract**

The prevalence of small, highly reactive molecules within interstellar environments represents a critical area of investigation for understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies. This work presents a quantum chemical investigation into the isomeric forms of cyanomethanimine (HC≡N-CN), specifically focusing on the Z and E isomers, utilizing density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  Employing a systematic analysis of potential energy surfaces, we determined the relative stabilities of these isomers, yielding a distinct preference for the Z-isomer under conditions relevant to interstellar space.  Furthermore, we introduce a ‘relative dipole principle’ – a methodology predicated on dipole moment anisotropy – to rationalize observed isomer ratios and predict abundances with enhanced accuracy.  This principle accounts for subtle electronic interactions influenced by the surrounding molecular environment.  The calculated spectroscopic properties of both isomers, including vibrational frequencies and rotational constants, are reported.  These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of complex chemical networks operating in astrophysical settings, with implications for interpreting observational data and modeling interstellar chemistry during the year 2020.
