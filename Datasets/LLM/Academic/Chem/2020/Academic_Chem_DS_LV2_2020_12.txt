**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) offers a novel paradigm for manipulating chemical dynamics at the quantum level. This theoretical investigation explores the control of polariton-mediated electron transfer (ET) processes within an optical cavity. By quantizing the electromagnetic field, we establish a framework where molecular electronic states are strongly coupled to a confined photon mode, forming hybrid light-matter polaritonic states. The central hypothesis is that the ET rate between a donor and an acceptor can be significantly modulated by tuning the light-matter coupling strength, thereby altering the potential energy surfaces and non-adiabatic couplings that govern the reaction coordinate. We employ high-level quantum dynamical simulations to model this phenomenon, explicitly treating the electronic and photonic degrees of freedom. Our results demonstrate that the charge transfer rate can be either suppressed or enhanced relative to the free-space value, depending critically on the resonance conditions and the Rabi splitting. This work provides a foundational principle for the emerging discipline of polaritonic chemistry, suggesting that cQED can be harnessed as a powerful tool for controlling charge and energy transfer processes in molecular and material systems without direct chemical modification.
