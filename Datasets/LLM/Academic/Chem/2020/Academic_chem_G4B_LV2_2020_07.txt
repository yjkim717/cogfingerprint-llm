**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a burgeoning class of porous materials, yet their inherent structural stability has traditionally limited investigation into their dynamic properties. This work addresses the critical need to understand and manipulate the spatiotemporal evolution of MOF behavior, positioning them within the emerging field of four-dimensional (4D) materials. We examine the multifaceted challenges associated with observing and controlling framework dynamics across diverse timescales, from picoseconds to hours. Current methodologies often struggle to capture the nuanced transformations occurring within these complex architectures.  This paper proposes a framework for rational design strategies, incorporating stimuli-responsive linkers and hierarchical pore structures, to induce predictable and controlled framework rearrangements.  Ultimately, harnessing these dynamic characteristics – a core feature of dynamic materials – will unlock unprecedented functionalities in areas such as catalysis, sensing, and adaptive materials science.
