Title: Spatiotemporal Modulation of Metal-Organic Frameworks: A Pathway to Dynamic Porous Solids

Abstract:
The development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored structural dynamics is crucial for advancing their applications in fields such as gas storage and separation. However, engineering dynamic MOFs requires a comprehensive understanding of their spatiotemporal evolution. Recent advances in in situ characterization techniques have enabled the investigation of MOF structural transformations at the atomic scale. By elucidating the relationships between framework topology, guest molecule interactions, and lattice flexibility, researchers can now design four-dimensional (4D) MOFs that exhibit adaptive porosity. This 4D framework concept involves the deliberate modulation of MOF structure and properties over time, thereby creating dynamic materials with enhanced functionality. Herein, we discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with spatiotemporal modulation of MOFs, highlighting potential routes to engineer dynamic porous solids with optimized performance. By bridging the gap between MOF structure and dynamics, we can unlock new avenues for the development of responsive and adaptive materials.
