**Abstract**

Efficient electron transfer processes are fundamental to numerous chemical and biological phenomena. This research investigates the potential for manipulating these processes through the utilization of polariton formation within an optical cavity. Employing quantum dynamical simulations, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in electron transfer rates when exploiting light-matter coupling via polariton generation. Specifically, the strong interaction between photons and a transition metal complex embedded within the cavity facilitates a cooperative excitation regime.  These simulations reveal a pronounced dependence of the reaction kinetics on the cavity’s resonant frequency and the complex’s spectral overlap with the cavity field.  The observed acceleration in electron transfer suggests a novel approach to controlling chemical reactivity at the nanoscale.  Future work will focus on exploring the influence of varying complex geometries and environmental conditions on the polariton-mediated electron transfer pathway, furthering our understanding of this emergent quantum phenomenon.
