**Abstract**

The investigation of carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation in amorphous solid water (ASW) under elevated temperatures presents a compelling avenue for exploring unconventional hydrogen storage mechanisms. This work reports on a detailed examination of CO conversion within ASW samples, demonstrating significant reactivity commencing at temperatures exceeding 20 K.  Crucially, observed reaction rates were strongly correlated with the presence and morphology of ice cracks, suggesting a pivotal role for hydrogen diffusion.  We hypothesize that these micro-cracks provide preferential pathways for hydrogen transport through the ASW matrix, effectively circumventing the typically low hydrogen mobility within the amorphous solid.  Electron microscopy and spectroscopic analysis confirmed the formation of stable, hydrogen-saturated products, indicative of diffusive hydrogenation.  Further research is warranted to quantitatively characterize the hydrogen diffusion coefficient within ASW and to elucidate the precise mechanistic pathways governing this potentially viable hydrogen storage strategy.
