**Abstract**

The relative abundance of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN) isomers in the interstellar medium (ISM) presents a significant astrochemical puzzle. This investigation employs high-level quantum chemical calculations (CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ) to characterize the isomers' electronic structures and subsequently integrates these results into a gas-grain astrochemical kinetics model. Our computations confirm a negligible energy difference between the Z and E forms, suggesting that thermodynamic control is an insufficient explanation for observed abundance disparities. Instead, we identify a substantial difference in their permanent electric dipole moments (μ_Z ≈ 4.2 D, μ_E ≈ 1.8 D) as the critical physicochemical parameter. This dipole moment disparity directly influences the rate coefficients for ion-molecule reactions, particularly with H₃⁺, which serve as the primary destruction pathway in cold molecular clouds. The model demonstrates that the isomer with the larger dipole moment (Z-) undergoes more rapid depletion, leading to a kinetic predominance of the E-isomer. These findings, contextualized within 2020-era reaction networks, underscore that permanent molecular dipoles can be a decisive factor in establishing isomer ratios in the ISM, independent of thermodynamic stability.
