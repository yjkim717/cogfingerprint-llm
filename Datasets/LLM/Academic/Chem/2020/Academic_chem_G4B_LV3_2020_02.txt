**Abstract**

The prevalence of complex organic molecules within interstellar environments presents a critical area of investigation for understanding the origins of prebiotic chemistry. This work reports on a detailed examination of cyanomethanimine (HC≡CN), specifically its Z and E isomers, leveraging a combined approach of *ab initio* quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling.  Applying high-level computational methods, we determined the isomeric dipole moments of cyanomethanimine, subsequently incorporating these values into kinetic models simulating ion-molecule reactions within the G+0.693 giant molecular cloud. Our findings demonstrate a significantly lower Z/E ratio of cyanomethanimine compared to previously reported estimates. This disparity is directly attributed to enhanced rates of photochemical and chemical destruction, primarily driven by the influence of isomeric dipole moments on reaction pathways. These results highlight the importance of accurately accounting for molecular geometry in astrochemical modeling and contribute to a refined understanding of organic molecule distribution in astrophysical settings.
