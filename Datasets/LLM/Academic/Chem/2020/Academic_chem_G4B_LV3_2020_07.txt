**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are increasingly recognized for their versatility in catalysis, gas storage, and sensing. However, their complex, dynamic behavior remains a significant challenge to effective material design. This work introduces the concept of ‘four-dimensional’ MOF characterization, extending traditional analysis beyond the three spatial dimensions to encompass temporal evolution. We posit that a comprehensive understanding of MOF dynamics – encompassing structural changes, guest molecule interactions, and surface reactivity – is paramount for rational engineering. Current methodologies often lack the requisite spatiotemporal resolution to capture these intricate processes. Consequently, this research advocates for the development of novel experimental techniques, integrating advanced spectroscopy and in-situ microscopy, to monitor MOF behavior under varying conditions.  Specifically, we highlight the need for integrated approaches capable of tracking structural transformations and guest diffusion across multiple timescales, ultimately enabling the precise control and optimization of MOF performance.
