**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), celebrated for their compositional and structural versatility, are increasingly recognized as promising building blocks for dynamic materials. While significant advancements have been made in static MOF design, achieving controlled, predictable structural dynamics across multiple length and time scales remains a substantial challenge. This work reviews the current landscape of research aimed at engineering four-dimensional (4D) MOF behavior—integrating spatial structure with temporal evolution—and highlights key limitations hindering widespread implementation. We discuss strategies for inducing dynamic transformations, including stimuli-responsive linkers, guest-mediated structural rearrangements, and the exploitation of inherent flexibility within the MOF framework. Furthermore, this perspective examines the analytical techniques required to characterize the complex spatiotemporal evolution of these systems, emphasizing the need for advanced in-situ spectroscopic and diffraction methods. Addressing these challenges is crucial for realizing the full potential of MOFs in applications ranging from adaptive separations to responsive catalysis and advanced sensing.
