Title: Diffusive Hydrogenation of CO in Amorphous Solid Water: Implications for Interstellar Chemistry

Abstract:
The hydrogenation of CO embedded in amorphous solid water (ASW) is a crucial process in interstellar environments, influencing the formation of complex organic molecules. In this study (2020), we investigated the diffusive hydrogenation reactions of CO in ASW at elevated temperatures, shedding light on the mechanistic pathways yielding H2CO and CH3OH. Our results demonstrate that CO hydrogenation proceeds efficiently even above 20 K, facilitated by the diffusive mobility of H atoms in the ASW matrix. The reaction kinetics and product distributions were analyzed using advanced spectroscopic techniques, revealing a complex interplay between CO, H, and ASW. The findings have significant implications for understanding the astrochemical evolution of interstellar dust grains and the origins of complex organic species in star-forming regions. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the chemical processes governing the formation of molecular species in astrophysical environments.
