**Abstract**

The prevalence of carbon monoxide (CO) within interstellar dust grains, particularly those mantled by amorphous solid water (ASW), presents a key challenge in understanding astrochemistry. Recent experimental findings have revealed unexpectedly efficient hydrogenation of CO embedded within ASW at cryogenic temperatures (≤70 K), yielding significant quantities of formaldehyde (H₂CO) and methanol (CH₃OH). This study explores the implications of these observations for gas-phase molecule formation in cold molecular clouds. Proposed mechanisms suggest that atomic hydrogen, facilitated by diffusion through the nanocracks and voids inherent in ASW’s disordered structure, reacts readily with adsorbed CO. This efficient hydrogenation pathway challenges conventional models and suggests that ASW acts as a surprisingly effective diffusion medium, potentially contributing substantially to the observed abundances of these key organic molecules in interstellar ices. Further investigation into the diffusion kinetics within ASW is warranted.
