**Abstract**

The prevalence of cyanomethanimine (HC≡CN) isomers, specifically Z- and E-forms, within astrophysical environments presents a compelling area for investigation. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations and coupled chemical kinetics modeling to examine the isomeric ratio ([Z/E]) of HC≡CN within the G+0.693 giant molecular cloud. Our findings demonstrate a significantly lower Z/E ratio than previously estimated, attributable to enhanced ion-molecule dissociation pathways.  Crucially, we posit that isomeric dipole moment differences drive this preferential destruction, creating a distinct observational signature. These results highlight the importance of considering rotational isomerism in astrochemical modeling and its influence on the observed abundance of complex organic molecules.  Further research incorporating radiative transfer and detailed spectroscopic analysis is warranted to fully constrain the chemical evolution of interstellar ices.
