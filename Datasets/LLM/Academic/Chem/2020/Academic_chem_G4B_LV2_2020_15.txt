**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a burgeoning class of porous materials, yet their inherent static nature limits their utility in applications demanding responsiveness. This work addresses the critical need to engineer dynamic behavior within MOF structures, specifically focusing on spatiotemporal evolution across multiple timescales. We synthesize a concise overview of the current challenges in controlling structural dynamics within MOFs, highlighting the limitations of traditional characterization techniques in capturing these complex processes. The investigation proposes a framework for utilizing four-dimensional (4D) experimental approaches – integrating diffraction, spectroscopy, and microscopy – to monitor subtle, real-time changes in MOF topology and connectivity.  Understanding the underlying mechanisms governing structural rearrangement is paramount.  Furthermore, we discuss potential methodologies, including guest-induced stimuli and tailored linker design, to promote controlled spatiotemporal evolution.  Ultimately, this research underscores the importance of developing advanced characterization strategies to unlock the full potential of MOFs as dynamic materials for catalysis, sensing, and controlled release applications.
