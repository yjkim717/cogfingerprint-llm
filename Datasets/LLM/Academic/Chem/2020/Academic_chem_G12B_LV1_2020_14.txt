**Abstract**

The interstellar medium (ISM) presents a complex chemical environment where molecular isomer abundances often defy simple thermodynamic expectations. This work explores the photochemistry and gas-phase reactivity of cyanomethanimine (NCCNH), specifically focusing on the relative abundances of its *Z*- and *E*- isomers. Utilizing a detailed astrochemical model incorporating UV irradiation, radiative association, and dissociative recombination pathways, we investigate the factors governing the isomeric ratio under conditions prevalent in dense molecular clouds. Our calculations demonstrate that the observed depletion of the *Z*-isomer, relative to the *E*-isomer, cannot be solely explained by differences in zero-point energy or standard thermodynamic arguments. Instead, we propose a “relative dipole principle,” wherein the isomeric ratio is significantly influenced by the differing dipole moments of the *Z*- and *E*-cyanomethanimine. These differing dipole moments modulate the effectiveness of radiative association with abundant molecular ions, such as H<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>, and impact the susceptibility to dissociative recombination with various neutral species.  Model simulations, incorporating this principle, exhibit improved agreement with recent observational constraints derived from ALMA data. The implications of this work extend beyond cyanomethanimine, suggesting that a similar consideration of relative dipole moments may be crucial for understanding isomer distributions in other polyatomic interstellar molecules, providing a novel pathway for refining astrochemical models and ultimately furthering our understanding of complex organic molecule formation in the ISM.
