In the rapidly evolving field of cavity quantum electrodynamics, the manipulation of chemical processes through strong light-matter coupling has emerged as a transformative paradigm. This study investigates polariton-mediated electron transfer dynamics, demonstrating how optical cavities fundamentally alter charge transfer mechanisms beyond conventional frameworks. By engineering specific light-matter coupling conditions, we establish that polariton formation significantly modulates both the electronic coupling matrix elements and thermodynamic driving forces governing electron transfer reactions. Crucially, our theoretical framework reveals that these cavity-induced effects extend to systems involving dark acceptor states that would otherwise exhibit minimal response to electromagnetic fields. Through quantum electrodynamical modeling of prototype molecular systems, we quantify how tailored photonic environments enhance electronic coherence and reorganize potential energy surfaces to facilitate charge separation. These findings, validated against experimental benchmarks from recent literature, provide a comprehensive mechanism for polariton-catalyzed electron transfer with particular relevance to photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. The work establishes cavity quantum electrodynamics as a powerful tool for controlling chemical reactivity at the nanoscale, opening new avenues for manipulating charge transfer processes through vacuum field engineering.
