**Abstract**

The relative abundance of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine (HNCHCN) isomers in the interstellar medium (ISM) presents a compelling case study for non-equilibrium chemistry. This investigation employs high-level quantum chemical calculations, including CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ benchmarks, to characterize the potential energy surface and determine key molecular properties. We demonstrate that the relative dipole principle, rather than thermodynamic stability, governs the observed isomeric ratio in cold molecular clouds. The significantly larger dipole moment of the E-isomer results in a higher rate constant for destruction via ion-molecule reactions with abundant cations such as H₃⁺. Kinetic modeling, incorporating these calculated reaction rates, confirms that this differential reactivity leads to a survival advantage for the lower-dipole Z-isomer, enriching its fractional abundance. These findings, contextualized within the 2020 landscape of astrochemical networks, underscore the critical role of electrostatic interactions in dictating molecular survival and isomer-specific chemistry in the ISM, providing a predictive framework for interpreting future radioastronomical observations of complex organic molecules.
