**Abstract**

The efficient transfer of energy and charge remains a significant challenge in photochemical systems. This research investigates a novel approach to enhancing photoinduced charge transfer utilizing cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) and polariton mediation. Employing quantum dynamical simulations, we demonstrate how engineered optical cavities can dramatically accelerate charge transfer rates through the formation and manipulation of polariton states. Specifically, our simulations reveal that strong light-matter coupling within the cavity facilitates enhanced electronic interactions, effectively ‘funneling’ excitation energy towards donor molecules. This process leverages the nonlinear optical properties of polaritons – hybrid light-matter quasiparticles – to overcome limitations inherent in conventional charge transfer mechanisms.  The observed acceleration stems from a resonant coupling between the cavity field and the donor’s excited state, promoting a more efficient and rapid electron transfer pathway. These findings suggest a promising strategy for designing advanced optoelectronic materials and light-harvesting systems, capitalizing on the intricate interplay between light and matter at the quantum level.
