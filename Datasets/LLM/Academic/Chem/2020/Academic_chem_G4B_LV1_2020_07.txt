**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) represent a burgeoning class of porous framework materials exhibiting remarkable structural versatility. However, realizing their full potential necessitates a deeper understanding of their spatiotemporal evolution – a concept increasingly recognized within the field. This work investigates the nascent area of four-dimensional (4D) MOF engineering, moving beyond static characterization to encompass dynamic changes in structure and function under varying stimuli. We posit that controlling these transformations, particularly through manipulation of guest molecules and external fields, offers a pathway to creating truly responsive materials.  Current methodologies, primarily reliant on single-point measurements, are insufficient to capture the complex, interconnected dynamics inherent in MOF systems.  Therefore, this study proposes novel theoretical frameworks and experimental approaches – incorporating advanced spectroscopic techniques and computational modeling – to track and ultimately predict the spatiotemporal evolution of MOF architectures.  The successful development of 4D MOFs promises significant advancements in areas such as catalysis, sensing, and controlled release.
