Here's a formal academic-style abstract, aiming for ~175 words and appropriate for a chemistry-focused publication in 2020, based on your provided keywords and summary:

**Abstract**

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), crystalline porous materials constructed from metal ions and organic linkers, have garnered significant attention for their potential in diverse applications. However, realizing their full potential necessitates moving beyond static structures and engineering dynamic behavior. This work addresses the key challenges and emerging strategies for controlling structural dynamics in MOFs across both spatiotemporal scales. We examine the limitations imposed by energetic barriers to conformational changes and explore methodologies to overcome these, including the incorporation of mechanically flexible linkers, photo-responsive components, and external stimuli such as temperature, pressure, and light. The ability to modulate pore size, shape, and functionality in a controlled manner—achieving reversible structural transformations—is crucial for applications ranging from responsive separations and catalysis to drug delivery and sensing.  Future directions focus on developing predictive models for dynamic behavior and designing MOFs exhibiting complex, programmable spatiotemporal evolution, ultimately enabling the creation of adaptive materials with unprecedented functionality.



I've aimed for:

*   **Formal tone:** Using precise language and avoiding colloquialisms.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** Starting with background, stating the problem, outlining approaches, and ending with future directions.
*   **Relevant Terminology:** Incorporating keywords naturally.
*   **Year Context:** Reflecting the state of the field around 2020 (a period of growing interest in dynamic MOFs).
