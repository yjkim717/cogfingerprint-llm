**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) has recently witnessed increased interest in their potential as dynamic materials exhibiting time-dependent properties. This work investigates the challenges inherent in engineering four-dimensional (4D) MOFs – those demonstrating structural evolution with respect to both space and time – and proposes strategies to control their spatiotemporal behavior. Precise manipulation of these frameworks necessitates a detailed understanding of the energy barriers governing structural transformations, which are often complex and influenced by factors such as guest molecules and external stimuli. We explore methodologies for modulating these energy landscapes, focusing on the incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds and responsive linkers to facilitate controlled structural rearrangements. Achieving selective molecular recognition through dynamic MOFs requires a nuanced approach, demanding the precise orchestration of structural dynamics to create transient binding sites. Future research directions involve developing robust predictive models to guide the design of MOFs exhibiting programmable and reversible functionality.
