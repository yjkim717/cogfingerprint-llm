Title: Investigating Isomeric Abundance of Cyanomethanimine in Interstellar Environments: A Quantum Chemical and Astrochemical Modeling Approach

Abstract:
The isomeric abundance of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine in interstellar environments has garnered significant attention in astrochemistry. This study employs ab initio quantum chemical calculations and astrochemical modeling to elucidate the chemistry of these isomers. Using high-level quantum chemical methods, we computed the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters governing the formation and destruction pathways of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine. Our results indicate that the Z-isomer is favored under interstellar conditions due to its lower energy state and more efficient formation routes. Astrochemical models incorporating these quantum chemical calculations reveal that the Z/E ratio is sensitive to environmental conditions, such as temperature and density. The findings of this study provide insights into the chemistry of cyanomethanimine isomers in interstellar environments, shedding light on the complex astrochemical processes that govern their abundance. Our results have implications for understanding the role of these isomers in the interstellar medium as of 2020.
