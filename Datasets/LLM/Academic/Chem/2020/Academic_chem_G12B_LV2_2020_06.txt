## Abstract: Isomeric Abundances of Cyanomethanimine (NCCNH) in Interstellar Ices: A Quantum Chemical Perspective and the Relative Dipole Principle

Understanding the isomeric distributions of simple nitrile-containing molecules within interstellar ices is crucial for interpreting astrochemistry observations and modelling the chemical complexity of star-forming regions. This study presents a detailed quantum chemical investigation into the isomeric abundances of Z- and E-cyanomethanimine (NCCNH), focusing on their behaviour within the low-temperature conditions prevalent in interstellar environments. Utilizing high-level density functional theory calculations, we have determined accurate dipole moment values for both isomers, revealing a significant difference in their polarities. Analysis of these dipole moments, coupled with consideration of rotational energy level populations at relevant astrophysical temperatures (10-30 K), leads to the formulation of a novel 'relative dipole principle'. This principle posits that the relative abundance of isomers in interstellar ices is directly governed by the ratio of their dipole moments, weighted by their respective rotational degeneracies. Our findings suggest that the E-isomer of NCCNH, possessing a larger dipole moment, is expected to be preferentially stabilized at lower temperatures compared to the Z-isomer. These predictions have implications for understanding the observed spectral features of NCCNH and related imine species in interstellar sources, and provide a framework for predicting isomeric abundances of other polyatomic molecules in cold, dense environments. Further observational and experimental work is needed to validate the relative dipole principle and refine our understanding of interstellar molecular evolution.
