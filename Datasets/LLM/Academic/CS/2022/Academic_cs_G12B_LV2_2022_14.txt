**Abstract: Reinforcement Learning for Chain Collision Avoidance in Autonomous Vehicle Systems**

The increasing deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust and adaptable solutions for ensuring safe navigation in complex, dynamic environments. A critical safety concern arises from chain collisions – sequences of impacts initiated by an initial event, often cascading through a platoon or traffic stream. This paper investigates a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach to mitigate the risk of chain collisions within AV systems. We propose an actor-critic algorithm, specifically tailored to optimize driving policies that prioritize both collision avoidance and operational efficiency. Our method frames the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state space incorporates relative distances, velocities, and acceleration profiles of surrounding vehicles, while the action space defines discrete control inputs related to acceleration and braking.

The core contribution lies in the design of a reward function that balances safety – heavily penalizing collision events – with efficiency, encouraging smooth and timely vehicle maneuvers.  We evaluate the performance of our RL-based collision avoidance strategy in both simulated single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, utilizing a physics-based traffic simulator to model realistic vehicle dynamics and interactions.  The results demonstrate that the proposed actor-critic policy significantly reduces the probability of chain collisions compared to baseline rule-based control strategies, particularly in high-density traffic conditions.  Furthermore, we analyze the safety efficiency trade-off, showing that the RL agent can achieve substantial safety improvements without a significant degradation in average speed or throughput.

A key focus of this work is the exploration of scalability to multi-agent settings, addressing challenges related to partial observability and decentralized decision-making.  While initial results are promising, future research will concentrate on incorporating more sophisticated state representations, including predictive models of surrounding vehicle behavior, and exploring techniques for robust policy transfer across varying traffic conditions.  Finally, we plan to investigate the integration of this RL-based collision avoidance system with existing AV control architectures, considering real-world deployment constraints and validation requirements.
