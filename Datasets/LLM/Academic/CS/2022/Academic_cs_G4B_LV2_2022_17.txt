**Abstract**

The optimization of water resource utilization in agriculture necessitates intelligent irrigation strategies. This research explores the application of machine learning algorithms to enhance the predictive capabilities of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart irrigation systems, specifically focusing on soil moisture estimation. Traditional irrigation methods often rely on static schedules, leading to inefficiencies and potential water wastage.  We propose a system leveraging real-time soil moisture data collected via IoT sensors and employ a classification approach to accurately predict future moisture levels. 

The core methodology involves training a supervised machine learning model – specifically, a Random Forest classifier – on a dataset comprising historical IoT sensor readings alongside corresponding soil moisture measurements obtained through in-situ probes. Feature engineering, incorporating temporal trends and sensor variability, was implemented to improve model accuracy.  Preliminary results indicate a significant improvement in predictive performance compared to baseline methods, demonstrating the potential of machine learning to refine irrigation scheduling.  Further investigation will explore the integration of recurrent neural networks to capture temporal dependencies within the soil moisture dynamics.  This work contributes to the growing body of research on precision agriculture, advocating for data-driven irrigation management and promoting sustainable water usage practices.  Future work will address model robustness and scalability for diverse agricultural environments.
