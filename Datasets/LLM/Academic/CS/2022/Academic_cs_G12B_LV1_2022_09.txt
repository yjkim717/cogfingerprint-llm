**Abstract:**

This study investigates the influence of technology leadership and professional development initiatives on the degree of teacher technology integration within the Palestinian public school system. Utilizing a quantitative, correlational design, we examined the relationship between perceived technology leadership efficacy, the quality and frequency of technology-focused professional development, and observable teacher integration of technology within pedagogical practices. Data were collected via survey instruments and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with SmartPLS 3.0. Results demonstrate a statistically significant positive correlation between both technology leadership and professional development, and teacher technology integration. These findings suggest that fostering effective technology leadership and targeted, ongoing professional development represent critical factors in promoting successful technology integration within educational environments, particularly in contexts facing resource constraints. Keywords: Educational Technology, Technology Leadership, Teacher Professional Development, SEM, SmartPLS.
