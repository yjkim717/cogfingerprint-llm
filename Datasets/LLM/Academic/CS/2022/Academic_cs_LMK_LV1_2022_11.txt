Title: Enhancing Semantic Segmentation with Sparse Non-Local CRFs: A Balanced Approach

Abstract:
In the realm of computer vision, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have emerged as a pivotal tool for refining semantic segmentation tasks. While dense CRFs offer comprehensive contextual modeling, their computational complexity hinders efficient optimization. Conversely, sparse CRFs, though computationally efficient, often sacrifice generality by relying on local neighborhood structures. To bridge this dichotomy, we propose a novel Sparse Non-Local CRF model, adeptly balancing the trade-off between contextual comprehensiveness and optimization tractability. By integrating non-local pairwise potentials with a sparse graph representation, our model achieves a more nuanced capture of long-range dependencies without sacrificing computational efficiency. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming both sparse and dense CRF baselines in terms of segmentation accuracy and inference speed. This work contributes to the ongoing discourse on CRF-based segmentation methodologies, offering a versatile and efficient solution for 2022 and beyond.
