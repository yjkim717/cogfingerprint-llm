Title: Revisiting Convolutional Networks for Image Classification: A Patch-based Perspective

Abstract:
Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in image classification tasks. However, the self-attention mechanism employed in ViTs is computationally expensive and may not be necessary for achieving state-of-the-art results. In this work, we revisit the ConvMixer model, which operates directly on patches using standard convolutions, and demonstrate its efficacy in image classification. By leveraging patch embeddings and convolutional networks, ConvMixer achieves competitive performance with ViTs while avoiding the need for self-attention. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show that ConvMixer outperforms both ViT and ResNet models, highlighting the potential of convolutional networks for image classification. We provide insights into the design choices and architectural decisions that contribute to ConvMixer's success, offering a promising alternative to transformer-based models. Our results underscore the importance of exploring convolutional architectures for computer vision tasks, particularly in scenarios where efficiency is crucial. (2022)
