**Abstract**

Automated cell segmentation remains a critical yet challenging task in biological image analysis. This paper presents Cellpose 2.0, a novel framework designed to facilitate the rapid deployment of high-performance, specialist segmentation models. Leveraging pretrained convolutional neural networks, Cellpose 2.0 dramatically reduces the computational burden associated with traditional model training. Our approach incorporates a “human-in-the-loop” strategy, allowing users to subtly guide model refinement through targeted feedback without requiring extensive retraining.  Specifically, we demonstrate that minimal user intervention, coupled with the inherent generalization capabilities of the pretrained architecture, yields significant improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to models trained solely on generic datasets.  The system’s modular design supports the creation of customized segmentation models tailored to specific cell types or imaging modalities.  Preliminary results indicate a substantial reduction in development time and resource expenditure, effectively democratizing access to advanced cell segmentation technology. Future work will focus on incorporating active learning techniques to further optimize the human-in-the-loop process.
