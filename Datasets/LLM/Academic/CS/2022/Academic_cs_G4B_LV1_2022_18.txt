**Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Booster Vaccination on Humoral Response in Multiple Myeloma Patients: An Analysis Considering Anti-BCMA Therapy**

**Abstract:**  The ongoing challenge of SARS-CoV-2 infection necessitates robust humoral immunity, particularly in immunocompromised populations. This study investigates the efficacy of a second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in enhancing SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses within a cohort of multiple myeloma (MM) patients.  Preliminary findings indicate a statistically significant improvement in neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination, relative to baseline, across the majority of the MM patient population. However, this benefit was notably attenuated in patients concurrently receiving anti-BCMA therapy, suggesting a potential immunosuppressive interaction.  Further mechanistic investigation is warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying this differential response.  Specifically, we hypothesize that anti-BCMA treatment may disrupt critical pathways involved in vaccine-induced B cell activation and antibody production.  These observations underscore the need for personalized vaccination strategies in MM patients, carefully considering concurrent immunomodulatory therapies to optimize vaccine effectiveness and mitigate potential adverse effects.
