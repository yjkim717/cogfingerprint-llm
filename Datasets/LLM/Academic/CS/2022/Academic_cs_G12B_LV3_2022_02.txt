**Abstract**

This work investigates the fundamental limits of computationally efficient learning in the presence of Massart noise, a prevalent model for adversarial data corruption. Specifically, we examine the problem of PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning of halfspaces under this noise model. Our primary result demonstrates a lower bound on the achievable error for any polynomial-time algorithm: any such algorithm is shown to require an error of at least Ω(η), where η represents the noise parameter. This inseparability result is rigorously established under the assumption of the cryptographic hardness of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, a widely recognized and practically relevant hardness assumption.  The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the inherent difficulty of robust learning in adversarial settings and highlight the reliance on cryptographic assumptions for achieving strong guarantees. This provides further theoretical grounding for the design and analysis of specialized learning algorithms that exploit structure to circumvent these limitations, aligning with ongoing research trends in 2022 exploring the interplay between learning theory and cryptographic hardness.
