**Abstract**

The ascendancy of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has established self-attention as a dominant paradigm for visual recognition. However, the architectural necessity of ViTs for patch embedding and self-attention layers introduces significant computational complexity and data requirements. This paper revisits the inductive biases inherent in convolutional networks, positing that their efficiency stems from spatial aggregation rather than exhaustive global comparison. We introduce a minimalist, isotropic architecture, the ConvMixer, which operates directly on patch embeddings using exclusively depthwise and pointwise convolutions arranged in a repeated macro structure. This design eschews self-attention and downsampling, maintaining a constant spatial resolution and hidden dimension throughout the network. Empirical evaluation on ImageNet classification demonstrates that the ConvMixer, despite its conceptual simplicity, surpasses both ViTs and equivalently-sized ResNet baselines in accuracy. Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative by demonstrating that optimized spatial convolution is not only sufficient but can be superior for visual representation, offering a highly efficient and performant alternative to attention-based models. This work underscores the untapped potential of pure convolutional architectures in the modern deep learning landscape.
