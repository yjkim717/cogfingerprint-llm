**Abstract:**

The increasing complexity of biological image analysis necessitates novel approaches to cell segmentation. This work introduces Cellpose 2.0, a software package designed to accelerate the development and deployment of specialist segmentation models through a human-in-the-loop paradigm. Leveraging a suite of diverse, pretrained deep learning models, Cellpose 2.0 facilitates rapid prototyping with significantly reduced annotation requirements. The core innovation lies in its iterative refinement process, allowing users to provide targeted corrections to initial model outputs, thereby guiding model adaptation to specific cell types and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance across a range of datasets, surpassing traditional methods and existing automated pipelines. Cellpose 2.0 represents a significant advancement in accessible and efficient cell segmentation, empowering researchers to rapidly generate high-quality segmentations and focus on downstream biological analysis.



I aimed to capture the key elements – cell segmentation, machine learning, human-in-the-loop, specialist models, and Cellpose 2.0 – while expanding on the implications and benefits in a formal, academic tone.
