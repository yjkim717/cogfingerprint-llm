This paper presents a comparative analysis of a fuzzy logic control (FLC) system against a conventional Linear-Quadratic Regulator (LQR) for stabilizing a double-inverted pendulum on a cart. The inherent nonlinearity and underactuated nature of this system present significant challenges for classical control methodologies. Our proposed FLC architecture, designed with expert knowledge-based rule sets, is evaluated through high-fidelity simulations under a range of initial state disturbances and parameter uncertainties. Performance is quantified using metrics of settling time, steady-state error, and robustness. Results from the 2022 study demonstrate that the FLC achieves superior transient response and enhanced disturbance rejection compared to the LQR, which exhibited performance degradation under large deviations from the linearization point. This research underscores the efficacy of fuzzy systems for complex, nonlinear control tasks where precise analytical models are difficult to establish.
