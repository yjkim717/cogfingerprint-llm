**Abstract**

This research examines the influence of systemic risk, competitive market dynamics, and corporate ownership structures on the operational efficiency of banking systems, specifically focusing on commercial banks operating within Bangladesh. Utilizing Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators, the study reveals non-linear relationships between these key determinants and banking performance, a finding pertinent to algorithmic risk assessment and system stability modeling. We hypothesize that heightened market competition exacerbates the impact of risk exposure, while varying degrees of ownership – particularly concentrated versus dispersed – modulate the resultant efficiency gains or losses. 

The analysis incorporates a panel dataset of Bangladeshi banks from 2018-2022, accounting for bank-specific heterogeneity and macroeconomic influences.  Results suggest that traditional linear models inadequately capture the nuanced interplay between these variables; instead, a non-linear framework, potentially incorporating threshold effects, offers a more robust explanation of observed efficiency variations.  These insights have implications for the design of adaptive regulatory frameworks and the development of intelligent monitoring systems within the financial sector.
