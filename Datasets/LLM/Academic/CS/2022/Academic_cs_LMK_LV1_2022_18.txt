**Title:** Enhancing Malware Detection in Multi-Modal Data Streams using Ensemble Boosting and Neutralizing Adversarial Attacks

**Abstract:**

The increasing prevalence of sophisticated malware in modern computing systems necessitates the development of robust detection mechanisms. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of ensemble boosting in enhancing malware detection in multi-modal data streams. Inspired by the principles of booster vaccination, which has been shown to improve humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in patients with multiple myeloma, we propose an ensemble boosting framework that combines the strengths of multiple machine learning models to improve detection accuracy. However, the presence of adversarial attacks can compromise the integrity of the detection system, much like anti-BCMA therapy can impede the effectiveness of booster vaccination in certain patients. To mitigate this, we introduce a neutralizing mechanism that employs adversarial training to immunize the ensemble against common attack vectors. Our results demonstrate that the proposed ensemble boosting framework, augmented with the neutralizing mechanism, achieves a significant improvement in detection accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a margin of 12.4% on average. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the neutralizing mechanism is effective in countering adversarial attacks, restoring the detection accuracy to within 2.1% of the baseline performance in the absence of attacks. Our findings have significant implications for the development of robust malware detection systems in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats.
