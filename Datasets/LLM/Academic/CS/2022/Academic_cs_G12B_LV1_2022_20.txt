**Abstract: Interactive Refinement of Cell Segmentations via Cellpose 2.0 and Human-Guided Model Adaptation**

Accurate cell segmentation remains a critical bottleneck in biological image analysis, particularly when dealing with diverse cellular morphologies and imaging modalities. Deep learning approaches have shown promise, but often require substantial labeled datasets for effective training. This work presents an investigation into the efficacy of Cellpose 2.0, a novel open-source package leveraging pretrained, generalizable convolutional neural networks, combined with a human-in-the-loop refinement pipeline. Cellpose 2.0’s architecture, incorporating vector field estimation, facilitates robust segmentation even in challenging scenarios.  We hypothesize that targeted human intervention, guiding the model's refinement on specific regions-of-interest (ROIs), can dramatically reduce the need for extensive training data while maintaining or improving segmentation accuracy.

Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of an interactive segmentation workflow where users iteratively correct Cellpose 2.0’s initial predictions within predefined ROIs. These corrections are then used to adapt the model through a lightweight fine-tuning process.  Results on datasets comprising diverse cell types and imaging techniques (immunofluorescence, phase contrast) indicate that this approach achieves segmentation performance comparable to models trained on significantly larger datasets. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of human interaction, demonstrating a strong correlation between the amount of user correction and the resultant segmentation quality. This work highlights the potential of Cellpose 2.0 as a foundation for efficient, human-assisted cell segmentation, offering a practical solution for researchers with limited annotation resources and complex imaging data.

**Key choices & Considerations in crafting this:**

*   **Formal Tone:** Use of phrases like "This work presents," "We hypothesize," "demonstrate feasibility," etc.
*   **Precise Terminology:**  "Convolutional Neural Networks," "Vector Field Estimation," "Regions-of-Interest (ROIs)," "fine-tuning."
*   **Structured Reasoning:**  Clear statement of the problem, hypothesis, methodology (briefly), results, and conclusion.
*   **Year Context (2022):** The phrasing is consistent with the language and focus of research likely to be published around that time.  It acknowledges the existing landscape of deep learning and highlights a practical approach to address its limitations.
*   **Focus on CS Aspect:** The abstract emphasizes the *algorithmic* and *computational* aspects of the work (the model architecture, the fine-tuning process, the efficiency gains).
