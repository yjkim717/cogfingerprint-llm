**Abstract**

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are widely utilized for structured prediction tasks, particularly in image segmentation. While dense CRFs offer expressive power through pairwise and higher-order potentials, their computational complexity limits applicability to high-resolution data. Conversely, sparse CRFs, leveraging efficient inference techniques, often struggle to capture long-range dependencies crucial for accurate segmentation. This paper presents a novel Sparse Non-Local Conditional Random Field (SNL-CRF) model designed to address this trade-off. Our approach integrates the computational efficiency of sparse CRFs with the capacity of dense CRFs to model non-local relationships. Specifically, we introduce a sparse graph structure augmented with strategically placed non-local connections, enabling the capture of contextual information across extended image regions without incurring the full computational burden of a dense CRF. Experiments on benchmark segmentation datasets demonstrate that the SNL-CRF achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing sparse and dense CRF models in both segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. This work provides a compelling alternative for segmentation tasks requiring both high precision and scalability, contributing to advancements in efficient structured prediction.
