In the context of escalating global water scarcity, the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks with data-driven methodologies presents a transformative opportunity for sustainable agriculture. This 2022 computational study investigates the efficacy of various machine learning algorithms for classifying soil moisture levels within a smart irrigation framework. The primary objective is to identify the most robust model for enabling precision water management, thereby minimizing resource waste while maintaining crop health. A comparative analysis was conducted, evaluating models including Support Vector Machines and Decision Trees against a Random Forest classifier. The evaluation was based on a dataset comprising real-time, multi-parameter IoT sensor readings from an operational agricultural testbed. Performance was rigorously assessed using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score. Our empirical results demonstrate that the ensemble-based Random Forest algorithm significantly outperforms its counterparts, achieving superior predictive accuracy in classifying soil moisture states. The model's inherent capability to handle high-dimensional data and mitigate overfitting proved critical for this application. We conclude that the deployment of Random Forest models within IoT-driven irrigation systems offers a viable and highly effective pathway for autonomous, data-informed water conservation, establishing a new benchmark for intelligent agricultural cyber-physical systems.
