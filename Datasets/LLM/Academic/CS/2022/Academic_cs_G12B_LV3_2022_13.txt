**Abstract**

Systematic generalization, the ability of neural networks to extrapolate learned patterns to novel combinations, remains a critical challenge in grounded language learning. This study (2022) explores the efficacy of modular neural architectures and extensive data augmentation strategies in facilitating this crucial capability. While data augmentation techniques demonstrably improve performance on existing benchmarks, our findings reveal a persistent limitation in achieving robust systematic generalization, even with substantial data scaling. We argue that the inherent representational capacity of monolithic networks may constrain their ability to effectively encode compositional structure. Consequently, we investigate modularity as a potential solution, demonstrating that architectures incorporating discrete, specialized modules exhibit enhanced generalization performance on systematic tasks. These results underscore the importance of architectural design alongside data-centric approaches for advancing grounded language learning systems.
