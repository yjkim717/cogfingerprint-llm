**Abstract**

The efficient allocation of multi-item resources necessitates mechanisms capable of accommodating heterogeneous demands and strategic buyer behavior. This paper addresses the challenge of designing mechanisms for scenarios involving multiple buyers, each possessing unit demand, and constrained by a “buy-many” restriction – the ability to purchase multiple units of an item. We introduce a novel sequential pricing mechanism designed to overcome the limitations of existing single-buyer approaches.  Our methodology leverages a multi-item mechanism design framework, specifically targeting scenarios with unit-demand buyers. 

The core contribution lies in achieving an $O(\log m)$ approximation ratio for revenue, where *m* represents the number of buyers, providing a significant improvement over previously established benchmarks.  This approximation is derived through a carefully constructed iterative pricing strategy that dynamically adapts to evolving buyer valuations.  We establish a revenue benchmark, crucial for evaluating the mechanism's performance and comparing it against alternative allocation strategies.  Furthermore, we analyze the mechanism’s properties with respect to incentive compatibility and individual rationality.  The findings presented herein offer a valuable contribution to the field of mechanism design, particularly concerning resource allocation in environments with complex buyer interactions and constrained purchase quantities.
