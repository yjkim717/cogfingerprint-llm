**Abstract**

Recent advances in computer vision increasingly demand efficient and accurate segmentation techniques, particularly within resource-constrained environments. This work presents a novel Sparse Non-Local Conditional Random Field (S-NL-CRF) model designed to address these challenges. Traditional non-local CRFs, while effective at capturing long-range dependencies, often suffer from computational complexity and memory overhead. Our approach introduces sparsity constraints to the non-local connections, drastically reducing the number of parameters while preserving segmentation performance. 

Specifically, we leverage a sparse factorization technique within the CRF framework, combined with localized edge weights to encode fine-grained spatial information. This hybrid architecture effectively balances global contextual understanding with local detail, resulting in improved robustness and reduced model size. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the S-NL-CRF model achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy with a significant reduction in computational cost compared to standard non-local CRFs.  We conclude that this method offers a compelling alternative for real-time and embedded computer vision applications.
