Title: Revisiting Convolutional Networks for Image Representation: A ConvMixer Perspective

Abstract:
Recent advancements in computer vision have witnessed a paradigm shift with the advent of Vision Transformers (ViT) and their variants. However, the efficacy of standard convolutional networks on patch embeddings remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate the ConvMixer architecture, which leverages patch-based input representations and eschews self-attention mechanisms in favor of convolutional operations. By directly applying standard convolutions to patches, ConvMixer achieves competitive performance on image classification benchmarks, outperforming both ViT and ResNet models. Our analysis reveals that the ConvMixer's simplicity and isotropic design enable it to effectively capture spatial hierarchies, thereby challenging the conventional wisdom that self-attention is essential for achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our findings, validated on various datasets as of 2022, underscore the potential of convolutional networks as a viable alternative to transformer-based architectures for image representation.
