**A Dynamic Analysis of Computational Efficiency in Cloud Platforms: The Role of Market Competition and Operational Risk**

**Year:** 2022

**Abstract:** The proliferation of cloud computing has intensified market competition, compelling providers to optimize computational efficiency. However, the relationship between competition and efficiency is moderated by significant operational risks, such as security vulnerabilities and resource contention. This study investigates how these factors interact across different cloud service modelsâ€”Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). We posit that the "ownership" of the underlying stack architecture fundamentally alters a provider's risk exposure and efficiency drivers. To address the dynamic nature of panel data and potential endogeneity, we employ a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator. Our model analyzes longitudinal performance metrics from a global dataset of cloud providers from 2018-2022. Results indicate that while heightened competition generally spurs efficiency gains in IaaS models, it can paradoxically increase risk-induced inefficiencies in SaaS environments due to the complexity of multi-tenancy. The GMM analysis confirms that unobserved heterogeneity significantly biases static models. These findings underscore the critical need for risk-aware resource allocation algorithms and provide a framework for strategically aligning service model architecture with competitive market pressures.
