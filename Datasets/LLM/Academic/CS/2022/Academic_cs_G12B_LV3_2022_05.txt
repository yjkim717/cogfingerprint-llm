**Abstract**

This paper presents a novel theoretical exploration of dynamic benchmarking techniques within the context of machine learning model training. In 2022, as model complexity and dataset scale continue to increase, the potential benefits of adaptive benchmarking strategies warrant rigorous investigation. We analyze two distinct dynamic benchmarking models, demonstrating that while iterative refinement can yield performance gains, these advantages are contingent upon data quality and model architecture. Specifically, our analysis reveals that label noise introduces significant instability, potentially leading to stagnation or even degradation of model accuracy. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of hierarchical dependencies within the data structure; while theoretically guaranteeing monotonic progress, incorporating such hierarchies substantially increases computational complexity and algorithmic design challenges. These findings highlight the critical need for robust noise mitigation strategies and efficient algorithmic approaches when deploying dynamic benchmarking in real-world applications.
