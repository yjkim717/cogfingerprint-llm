Title: Computational Hardness of PAC Learning Halfspaces with Massart Noise

Abstract:
We investigate the computational complexity of PAC learning halfspaces in the presence of Massart noise, a widely studied noise model that generalizes the malicious noise and random classification noise models. Specifically, we establish that it is computationally hard to PAC learn halfspaces with Massart noise rate η ∈ [0, 1/2] to error better than Ω(η). Our hardness result is based on a reduction from the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, a well-known computationally intractable problem in cryptography. We show that if there exists an efficient algorithm for PAC learning halfspaces with Massart noise to error better than Ω(η), then there exists an efficient algorithm for solving LWE, which is a contradiction. Our result highlights the inherent difficulty in designing robust and efficient algorithms for learning halfspaces in the presence of adversarial noise, and underscores the importance of developing novel techniques for addressing this challenging problem.
