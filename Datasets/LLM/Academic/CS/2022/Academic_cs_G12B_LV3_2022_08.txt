**Abstract**

This paper introduces A1 SLAM, an open-source robotics software package developed within the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, specifically designed for the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot. Addressing the challenges of real-time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on resource-constrained platforms, A1 SLAM leverages the robotâ€™s onboard LiDAR sensor suite to achieve high-performance localization. The system implements a factor graph optimization approach, incorporating a sliding window of fully connected LiDAR odometry factors to efficiently manage computational complexity. Experimental results, conducted in 2022, demonstrate that A1 SLAM achieves significantly improved accuracy and robustness compared to established SLAM solutions like Cartographer, particularly in dynamic and unstructured environments. This work contributes a readily deployable and highly efficient SLAM solution for quadruped robotics research and applications.
