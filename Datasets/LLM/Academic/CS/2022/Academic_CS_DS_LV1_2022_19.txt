**Abstract**

High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging is critical for robust visual perception systems operating under non-uniform illumination. However, conventional single-frame methods often produce artifacts like ghosting and halos, while multi-frame approaches are computationally intensive and susceptible to motion. This paper introduces a novel, lightweight two-stage framework that synergizes frequency-domain priors with adversarial learning to achieve high-fidelity HDR reconstruction from a single Low Dynamic Range (LDR) input. In the first stage, a compact, purpose-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) performs an initial enhancement in the Fourier domain, effectively disentangling and amplifying attenuated high-frequency components crucial for detail recovery. The second stage employs a Fourier-based adversarial network, where the generator refines the initial output and the discriminator evaluates both spatial and frequency-domain fidelity, ensuring the synthesized HDR image is photorealistic and spectrally consistent. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, our method demonstrates a 15% improvement in PSNR over state-of-the-art lightweight models and achieves inference speeds suitable for real-time applications on mobile platforms. This work establishes that explicit frequency-domain optimization, guided by adversarial training, provides a powerful and efficient paradigm for computational photography and autonomous system perception.
