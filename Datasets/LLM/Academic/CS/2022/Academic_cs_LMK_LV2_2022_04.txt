Title: Incentivizing Multi-Dimensional Effort via Scoring Rules: A Mechanism Design Approach

Abstract:
We present a novel framework for designing scoring rules that effectively incentivize strategic agents to exert multi-dimensional effort, a prevalent challenge in various domains. By integrating principles from algorithmic mechanism design, we formulate a scoring rule that optimizes the principal's objective, while accounting for agents' self-interested behavior. Our approach leverages a knapsack problem formulation to capture the intricacies of multi-dimensional effort, enabling the derivation of scoring rules that accurately reflect the principal's preferences. We establish the existence of optimal scoring rules under specific conditions and provide a characterization of the resulting mechanisms. The proposed framework offers a rigorous methodology for designing scoring rules that induce desirable outcomes in settings where agents have multiple avenues to exert effort. Our results contribute to the growing literature on mechanism design and have implications for various applications, including procurement, crowdsourcing, and education.
