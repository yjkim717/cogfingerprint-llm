This paper presents KreolMorisienMT, a novel parallel corpus for machine translation between Kreol Morisien (Mauritian Creole), English, and French. We address the resource scarcity for low-resource creole languages by constructing a high-quality dataset through expert translation and validation. We benchmark multiple neural machine translation architectures, including fine-tuned multilingual pretrained models, evaluating translation quality via automated metrics and human assessment. Our experiments demonstrate that transfer learning from related high-resource languages significantly improves performance, with BLEU score gains of up to 8.2 points over baseline systems. This work provides both a valuable resource and methodological framework for machine translation of under-represented languages, contributing to digital language preservation efforts.
