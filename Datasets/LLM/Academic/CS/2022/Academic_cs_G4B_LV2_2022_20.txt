**Abstract: Towards Efficient Cellular Segmentation via Human-in-the-Loop Specialist Model Training with Cellpose 2.0**

Cellular segmentation remains a critical bottleneck in biomedical image analysis, frequently necessitating substantial manual annotation. This study presents Cellpose 2.0, a novel system designed to mitigate this challenge through a human-in-the-loop approach to training specialist segmentation models. Leveraging pretrained Cellpose models, our methodology drastically reduces the reliance on extensive, bespoke datasets. We demonstrate the efficacy of this strategy by training specialist models targeting previously unseen image categories, achieving state-of-the-art performance metrics across a diverse set of validation datasets. 

The core innovation lies in employing a targeted ‘correction’ mechanism, utilizing minimal human annotation – primarily focused on outlier refinement – to iteratively improve model accuracy. This process effectively guides the model’s learning trajectory, capitalizing on the foundational knowledge embedded within the pretrained architecture.  Preliminary results indicate a significant reduction in annotation effort while maintaining, and in some cases surpassing, the performance of models trained solely on large, general datasets. Future work will explore automated outlier detection and adaptive annotation strategies to further enhance the efficiency of this human-in-the-loop paradigm.
