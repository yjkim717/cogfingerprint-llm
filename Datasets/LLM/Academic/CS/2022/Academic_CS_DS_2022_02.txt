This paper investigates the asymptotic properties of solutions to nonlocal diffusion models in unbounded computational domains. We establish that the long-term behavior of these solutions is fundamentally determined by the structure of the bounded core region, with unbounded extensions exerting negligible influence on the emergent computational patterns. This result has implications for scalable simulation algorithms.
