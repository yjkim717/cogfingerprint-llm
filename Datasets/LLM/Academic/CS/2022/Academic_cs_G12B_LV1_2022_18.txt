Okay, here's an academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided summary and keywords, written as if it were a 2022 publication in a computer science context, specifically focusing on modeling and prediction of immune responses. I've tried to maintain a formal tone and incorporate relevant terminology.  I've also included a brief rationale for the CS framing at the end.

**Predictive Modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Humoral Response in Immunocompromised Populations: A Multi-Agent System Approach Considering Therapeutic Interference**

**Abstract**

The rapid global deployment of mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines (e.g., BNT162b2) has significantly mitigated disease severity. However, predicting vaccine efficacy in immunocompromised populations, such as those with multiple myeloma (MM), remains a critical challenge. This study investigates the complex interplay of factors influencing humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in MM patients, with a particular focus on the observed interference with anti-BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) therapies. We propose a novel multi-agent system (MAS) model to simulate the dynamic evolution of antibody responses following repeated BNT162b2 booster doses. The MAS incorporates individual patient attributes (age, disease stage, prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure), vaccine administration schedules, and the pharmacological effects of anti-BCMA therapy, represented as a targeted depletion of memory B-cells and a reduction in naïve B-cell differentiation.

The model utilizes a Bayesian network framework to probabilistically represent the relationships between these factors and key immunological markers, including neutralizing antibody titers. We calibrated the model using a dataset of humoral responses from MM patients receiving and not receiving anti-BCMA therapy, demonstrating a significant reduction in post-booster antibody titers in the anti-BCMA group.  Furthermore, we employed a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize booster schedules for maximizing antibody response while minimizing potential adverse events, demonstrating that a personalized approach, potentially incorporating real-time antibody titer monitoring, could be beneficial.  Our results highlight the critical importance of accounting for therapeutic interventions in predictive models of vaccine efficacy and suggest that MAS-based approaches offer a promising avenue for personalized vaccination strategies in immunocompromised populations.  Future work will extend the model to incorporate T-cell immunity and explore the impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.

**Rationale for CS Framing:**

The core of the request was to frame this within Computer Science. The underlying problem – predicting and optimizing immune responses – lends itself well to computational modeling.  Here's why this framing is suitable:

*   **Multi-Agent Systems (MAS):**  Modeling individuals (patients) as autonomous agents with varying characteristics is a fundamental CS approach to complex systems.
*   **Bayesian Networks:** These are probabilistic graphical models frequently used in CS for reasoning under uncertainty, which is highly relevant to biological systems.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** This machine learning technique can be applied to optimize vaccine schedules based on observed outcomes.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**  The entire study aims to build a model to *predict* outcomes, a core CS task.
