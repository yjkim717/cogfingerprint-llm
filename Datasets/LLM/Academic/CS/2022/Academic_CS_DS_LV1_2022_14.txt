**Abstract**

The proliferation of autonomous vehicles necessitates robust collision avoidance systems capable of navigating the complex dynamics of multi-agent traffic, particularly the critical scenario of chain collisions. While traditional model-based control strategies offer verifiable safety guarantees, they often struggle with the high-dimensional state spaces and unpredictable interactions inherent in real-world driving. This paper addresses these limitations by formulating the chain collision avoidance problem as a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), where the primary objective is to maximize travel efficiency while satisfying a hard safety constraint. We propose a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework, predicated on a centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm. Our approach leverages an enhanced actor-critic algorithm, specifically a Safety-Aware Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (SA-MASAC) model, which incorporates a safety critic network to estimate the probability of constraint violation. This dual-critic architecture enables the policy to explicitly trade off between task reward and safety cost during training. We evaluate our framework in high-fidelity simulation environments, contrasting its performance against baseline Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) methods. The analysis demonstrates that our model achieves a superior safety efficiency frontier: it reduces the incidence of chain collisions by over 60% in dense, interactive scenarios compared to baselines, while maintaining comparable traffic flow velocity. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the critical role of the safety critic in stabilizing training and preventing catastrophic failures. The results indicate that our method provides a viable pathway toward deploying efficient and certifiably safe reinforcement learning policies for collaborative autonomous driving.
