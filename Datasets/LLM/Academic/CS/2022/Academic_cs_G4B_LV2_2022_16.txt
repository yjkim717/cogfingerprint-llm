**Abstract**

The increasing demand for multilingual machine translation necessitates robust evaluation datasets for under-resourced languages. This paper presents KreolMorisienMT, a novel parallel corpus specifically designed for assessing the performance of machine translation systems targeting Mauritian Creole (MC). Recognizing the limitations of existing resources, KreolMorisienMT combines parallel sentence pairs with a substantial monolingual MC corpus, facilitating a comprehensive evaluation framework. We detail the dataset’s construction, encompassing approximately [Insert approximate size – e.g., 10,000] sentence pairs and [Insert approximate size – e.g., 50,000] monolingual tokens.  This resource directly addresses the scarcity of training data for MC, enabling research into multilingual transfer learning techniques.  Specifically, KreolMorisienMT supports investigations into the efficacy of leveraging data from related languages to improve MC translation quality.  Future work will explore incorporating linguistic annotations and evaluating various neural machine translation architectures, contributing to the advancement of reliable and accurate translation services for this critical creole language.
