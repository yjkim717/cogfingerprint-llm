## A Logarithmic Approximation to Revenue Maximization in Multi-Item Settings with Unit-Demand Buyers

**Abstract:** This paper addresses the challenging problem of revenue maximization in multi-item auction settings, specifically focusing on scenarios where buyers exhibit unit-demand preferences and face a “buy-many” constraint – a restriction limiting the total quantity of items a single buyer can acquire. Designing mechanisms that achieve strong revenue guarantees in such environments remains a significant hurdle in mechanism design. Existing revenue benchmarks often fall short when the number of items and buyers increases, particularly under the buy-many constraint. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel revenue benchmark tailored for these complex scenarios, which accounts for the interplay between item substitutability and the imposed quantity restriction. We then propose a mechanism achieving a logarithmic approximation to this benchmark. Our mechanism leverages a carefully designed allocation and payment scheme, demonstrating theoretical guarantees for expected revenue.  We rigorously prove that our mechanism achieves a logarithmic approximation ratio, demonstrating its effectiveness as the number of items and buyers grows. This result provides a significant improvement over prior work, especially in scenarios where the buy-many constraint substantially impacts buyer behavior.  The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of revenue optimization in combinatorial auctions and offer practical implications for the design of efficient and revenue-generating allocation systems.  This work represents a step towards more robust and scalable auction mechanisms capable of handling complex buyer constraints.
