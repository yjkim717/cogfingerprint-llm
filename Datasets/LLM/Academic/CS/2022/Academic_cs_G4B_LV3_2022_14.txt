**Abstract**

The increasing deployment of autonomous vehicles necessitates robust strategies for mitigating complex, emergent safety risks, particularly chain collisions. This research investigates a reinforcement learning (RL)-based approach to proactively prevent such collisions, framed within a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Our methodology leverages an agent-based simulation environment to train autonomous vehicle controllers optimized for safety efficiency – defined as minimizing collision probability while maximizing operational progress.  We evaluate the proposed RL algorithm across both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, systematically analyzing its performance in diverse traffic conditions. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of this technique to improve collision avoidance compared to traditional reactive control systems.  Further investigation will focus on refining the MDP formulation and incorporating methods for enhanced generalization to unseen environmental dynamics.  The findings contribute to the growing body of research exploring the application of RL for ensuring the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems, specifically addressing the critical challenge of anticipating and preventing cascading failures.
