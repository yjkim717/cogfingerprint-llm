This 2022 study investigates how technology leadership and professional development initiatives in Palestinian public schools foster digital age learning cultures. Through structural equation modeling, we demonstrate that strategic technology leadership directly enhances teacher technology integration competencies. Our findings reveal that targeted professional development programs serve as critical mediators, bridging leadership frameworks with classroom implementation. These results underscore the necessity of systemic approaches to educational technology reform, offering evidence-based strategies for cultivating sustainable digital learning ecosystems in developing educational contexts.
