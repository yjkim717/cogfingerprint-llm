**Abstract**

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) represent a foundational approach to sequential data modeling, particularly within computer vision segmentation. However, traditional dense and sparse CRF formulations often exhibit computational limitations and inflexible feature integration. This work introduces a novel Sparse Non-Local Conditional Random Field (S-NLCRF) model designed to address these challenges. The S-NLCRF architecture strategically combines local contextual dependencies, mirroring sparse CRF efficiency, with non-local feature aggregation, enabling the model to capture long-range relationships.  Experimental results, evaluated on benchmark segmentation datasets in 2022, demonstrate that the S-NLCRF consistently outperforms established sparse and dense CRF variants, achieving improved segmentation accuracy while maintaining reduced computational complexity.  The model’s adaptability and efficiency position it as a promising direction for future research in robust and scalable visual understanding.
