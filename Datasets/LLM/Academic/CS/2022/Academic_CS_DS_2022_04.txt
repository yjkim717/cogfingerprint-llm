This paper investigates revenue maximization in multi-item mechanism design under a generalized buy-many constraint framework. We extend the buy-many paradigm to competitive environments with multiple strategic buyers, establishing novel revenue benchmarks that capture the complex interplay between buyer valuations and supply limitations. Our primary contribution demonstrates that carefully constructed sequential item pricing mechanisms achieve a tight O(log m) approximation ratio relative to this benchmark for unit-demand buyers, where m denotes the number of distinct items. This result significantly expands the theoretical understanding of simple mechanisms' performance in complex multi-buyer settings. Through a comprehensive analysis of buyer behavior under sequential pricing decisions, we characterize the equilibrium properties that enable this approximation guarantee. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds showing this logarithmic factor is asymptotically optimal for a broad class of sequential pricing schemes. Our work bridges the gap between single-buyer buy-many results and practical multi-agent market design, offering insights for platform economists and mechanism designers operating in digital marketplaces with limited-supply goods.
