**A Scalable Approximation Mechanism for Multi-Buyer, Buy-Many Auctions**

Traditional auction mechanisms often struggle to efficiently handle scenarios involving multiple buyers with ‘buy-many’ constraints – the ability to purchase multiple units of a single item. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel sequential pricing mechanism designed for environments with unit-demand buyers and heterogeneous demand curves. We formulate the problem as a multi-item mechanism design, aiming to approximate revenue while accounting for the complexities introduced by simultaneous purchases. Our core contribution is an approximation algorithm achieving an O(log *m*) approximation to the optimal revenue, where *m* represents the number of buyers.  The algorithm leverages a dynamic pricing strategy, adjusting bids iteratively based on observed demand signals and competitive pressures.  We rigorously analyze the performance of this approach, demonstrating its scalability and offering a practical solution for scenarios where traditional single-item auction designs are inadequate.  Future work will explore incorporating strategic bidder behavior and investigating variations of the approximation guarantee.
