**Abstract: Enhancing Systematic Generalization via Modular Architectures and Targeted Data Augmentation in Grounded Language Learning**

Systematic generalization, the ability of a model to extrapolate from observed patterns to novel combinations within a defined structure, remains a critical challenge in neural network development, particularly within grounded language learning scenarios. This work explores the synergistic impact of modular network architectures and targeted data augmentation strategies on fostering robust systematic generalization capabilities. We hypothesize that decomposing a network into functionally specialized modules, coupled with augmentation techniques designed to explicitly expose compositional structure, will yield superior performance compared to monolithic baselines.

To investigate this, we introduce a novel framework, *Modular Compositional Augmentation for Grounded Learning* (MCAGL), which integrates a modular recurrent neural network architecture with a dynamically-generated data augmentation pipeline. MCAGL leverages a grammar-inspired approach to define compositional structures, and then generates augmented training examples that emphasize transitions and permutations within these structures.  Experiments conducted on established benchmarks for compositional generalization, including variants of the SCAN and CLEVR datasets, demonstrate that MCAGL consistently outperforms standard sequence-to-sequence models and recent data augmentation methods.  Furthermore, ablation studies reveal the crucial role of both modularity and augmentation in achieving these gains, suggesting that the two components operate through complementary mechanisms. Our findings provide empirical evidence supporting the efficacy of modular architectures and grammar-guided data augmentation for improving systematic generalization in grounded language learning, offering a promising avenue for developing more robust and adaptable AI systems.

**Notes on Design Choices & Justification:**

*   **Formal Tone & Terminology:**  I used phrases like "critical challenge," "synergistic impact," "robust capabilities," "empirical evidence," and specific terms like "monolithic baselines," "sequence-to-sequence models," "compositional generalization," and "recurrent neural network" to align with the expected style of a CS conference abstract.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a clear structure:
    *   **Introduction/Context:** Establishes the problem (systematic generalization) and its importance.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Explicitly states the researchers' expectation.
    *   **Methodology:** Briefly describes the "MCAGL" framework and its key components (modular architecture, grammar-inspired augmentation).  I used a made-up name (*Modular Compositional Augmentation for Grounded Learning*) to sound more like a specific research contribution.
    *   **Results:** Summarizes the experimental findings (outperformance on benchmarks).
    *   **Discussion/Conclusion:** Highlights the complementary roles of modularity and augmentation, and suggests future directions.
*   **2022 Context:**  The abstract doesn't explicitly reference a specific year, but the use of established benchmarks like SCAN and CLEVR and the general focus on grounded language learning are consistent with research trends prevalent in 2022. The mention of "recent data augmentation methods" also implies awareness of the state-of-the-art as of that time.
