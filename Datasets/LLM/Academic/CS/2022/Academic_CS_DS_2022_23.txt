This study investigates the comparative efficacy of ensemble learning algorithms for predictive analytics in agricultural cyber-physical systems, with a specific focus on soil moisture forecasting. As precision agriculture increasingly relies on Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks for data acquisition, the challenge of selecting optimal computational models for environmental prediction becomes paramount. We evaluate several prominent machine learning classifiers, including gradient boosting and support vector machines, against a substantial dataset comprising multi-spectral soil sensor readings, meteorological parameters, and irrigation logs. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that tree-based ensemble methods consistently outperform alternative approaches in this domain. A rigorously validated implementation of the Random Forest algorithm achieved a near-perfect classification accuracy of 99.97% on held-out test data, significantly reducing prediction variance compared to benchmark models. This result underscores the critical role of feature interaction capture and inherent noise resilience in complex agricultural datasets. The findings provide a robust framework for deploying resource-efficient, data-driven irrigation control systems, thereby contributing to enhanced water sustainability in smart farming infrastructures.
