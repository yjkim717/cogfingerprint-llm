**Abstract**

Recent successes of Transformer architectures in natural language processing have spurred investigation into their applicability to computer vision. While Vision Transformers (ViT) demonstrate promising results, the underlying mechanisms driving this performance remain debated. A prevailing hypothesis suggests that architectural innovations, specifically the Transformer’s self-attention mechanism, are paramount, rather than the reliance on learned patch embeddings. This study challenges this assumption, presenting ConvMixer, a novel convolutional mixture network.  Through extensive experimentation on the ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that ConvMixer achieves superior performance compared to ViT variants, while employing a fundamentally convolutional design.  Our analysis reveals that ConvMixer’s effectiveness stems from a synergistic combination of localized feature extraction through convolution and a mixing strategy analogous to Transformer self-attention.  These findings suggest that architectural choices, particularly the integration of convolutional operations, are crucial determinants of vision Transformer efficacy and offer a viable alternative to patch-based approaches.
