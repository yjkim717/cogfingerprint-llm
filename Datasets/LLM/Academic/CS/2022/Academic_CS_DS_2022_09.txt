This paper introduces a novel geometric data augmentation framework for deep learning based on conformal transformations. While conventional augmentation techniques such as rotations and flips introduce discontinuities and information loss, our method leverages the angle-preserving properties of MÃ¶bius and related transformations to generate perceptually realistic image variations. We demonstrate that this approach enriches training datasets with smooth, bijective deformations that more accurately reflect real-world object appearance changes. Empirical evaluations on benchmark image classification tasks using convolutional neural networks show that our conformal augmentation strategy yields a statistically significant improvement in model generalization and robustness compared to standard data augmentation pipelines. The results suggest that incorporating geometric invariance through complex-analytic mappings provides a principled and effective pathway for enhancing data diversity in computer vision applications.
