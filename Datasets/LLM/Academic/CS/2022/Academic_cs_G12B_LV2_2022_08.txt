## Real-Time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for Quadruped Robots via Factor Graph Optimization

This paper presents A1 SLAM, an open-source ROS package designed for real-time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on the Unitree A1 quadruped robot. Leveraging the robot’s onboard sensors—primarily LiDAR—A1 SLAM implements a sliding window approach to achieve robust and efficient pose estimation within a dynamic and challenging environment. The core of the system utilizes a factor graph optimization framework, enabling probabilistic inference of robot poses and map features. This approach explicitly models sensor measurements (LiDAR odometry) as factors within the graph, allowing for the incorporation of constraints and the mitigation of noise.  The resulting system demonstrates the feasibility of achieving accurate and timely localization and mapping capabilities directly from the A1's existing hardware, bypassing the need for extensive sensor modifications or computationally expensive deep learning methods.  Performance evaluations, conducted in diverse indoor environments throughout 2022, highlight the system’s suitability for real-time control and navigation applications, contributing to the growing body of research on quadruped robot autonomy. The package is publicly available to facilitate further research and development in the field.
