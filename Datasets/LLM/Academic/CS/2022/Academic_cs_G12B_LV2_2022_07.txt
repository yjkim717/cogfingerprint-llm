**Abstract**

This work investigates the fundamental relationship between private and online learning capabilities for concept classes. Specifically, we establish a novel equivalence demonstrating that a concept class is privately PAC learnable under differential privacy if and only if it admits a finite Littlestone dimension. This result connects the classical online learning notion of Littlestone dimension, which bounds the complexity of a concept class in terms of its generalization ability in an online setting, with the contemporary requirements of differential privacy in PAC learning. Our proof leverages techniques from both PAC and online learning theory, providing a unified framework for understanding the trade-offs inherent in learning from data while preserving privacy. This finding has implications for designing differentially private algorithms applicable to a wider range of binary-labeled concept classes, particularly those exhibiting bounded complexity as measured by their Littlestone dimension.
