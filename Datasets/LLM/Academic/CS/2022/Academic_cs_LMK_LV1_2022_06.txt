Title: Assessing the Interplay between Risk Exposure, Competitive Dynamics, and Operational Efficiency in Commercial Banking: An Empirical Analysis using GMM Estimators

Abstract:

This study undertakes an in-depth examination of the intricate relationships between risk exposure, market competition, and operational efficiency within the Bangladeshi commercial banking sector, with a particular emphasis on the moderating role of ownership structures. Leveraging a robust dataset encompassing a comprehensive array of commercial banks operating in Bangladesh, we employ a dynamic panel data approach utilizing Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators to scrutinize the hypothesized relationships. Our analytical framework integrates the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to estimate bank-level efficiency scores, which subsequently serve as the dependent variable in our regression models. The empirical findings indicate a significant inverse relationship between risk exposure and operational efficiency, suggesting that heightened risk exposure detrimentally affects the ability of commercial banks to optimize their operational efficiency. Conversely, our results reveal a positive nexus between market competition and efficiency, underscoring the role of competitive dynamics in driving banks towards more efficient operational paradigms. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the pivotal role of ownership structures in moderating these relationships, with banks under foreign ownership exhibiting superior efficiency outcomes compared to their domestically owned counterparts. The study's insights contribute to the extant literature by illuminating the nuanced interplay between risk, competition, and efficiency within the context of emerging economies, thereby informing policy interventions aimed at enhancing the resilience and performance of commercial banking systems.
