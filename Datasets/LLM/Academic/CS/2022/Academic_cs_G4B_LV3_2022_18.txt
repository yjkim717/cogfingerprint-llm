**Abstract**

Immunocompromised populations, such as those with multiple myeloma, frequently exhibit diminished humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. This study investigates the impact of a second booster dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on neutralizing antibody titers in this cohort. Results indicate a substantial augmentation of neutralizing antibody activity following the booster, demonstrating a potential mechanism for enhancing vaccine efficacy in individuals with compromised immune systems. However, a notable exception was observed in patients concurrently receiving anti-BCMA therapy, suggesting a potential immunosuppressive effect of this treatment regimen. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the interplay between BCMA-targeted therapies and vaccine-induced immunity. These findings underscore the importance of personalized vaccination strategies and monitoring antibody responses in patients with multiple myeloma, particularly those undergoing active cancer treatment, to optimize protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants.
