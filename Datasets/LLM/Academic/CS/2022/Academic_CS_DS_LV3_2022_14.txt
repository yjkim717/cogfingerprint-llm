**Abstract**

The proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) introduces complex safety challenges, particularly the mitigation of high-velocity chain collisions on intelligent transportation networks. Traditional rule-based and optimal control methods often struggle with the high-dimensional state spaces and the non-linear, dynamic interactions inherent in multi-agent traffic scenarios. This paper addresses this critical gap by formulating the chain collision avoidance problem as a **Markov Decision Process** (MDP) and proposing a novel **deep reinforcement learning** (DRL) framework to derive robust driving policies. Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art **actor-critic** algorithm, specifically a proximal policy optimization (PPO) variant, which facilitates stable learning in both continuous action and observation spaces. The actor network is tasked with generating real-time vehicular control commands—comprising longitudinal acceleration and lateral steering—while the critic network provides a refined value function estimate, enabling more efficient policy updates by reducing variance.

We conduct a comprehensive **safety efficiency analysis** through extensive simulations in two distinct environments: a single-agent scenario, where an ego-vehicle must preemptively avoid a cascade of collisions initiated by a lead vehicle, and a more complex multi-agent setting, where numerous AVs and human-driven vehicles interact. The simulation framework, built upon a high-fidelity vehicle dynamics model, incorporates stochastic driver behaviors and sensor noise to enhance realism. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed DRL agent significantly outperforms baseline model-predictive control and deep Q-network (DQN) strategies. Key performance metrics, including Time-to-Collision (TTC) and the Delta-V impact severity index, show marked improvements. In the multi-agent context, the policy exhibits emergent cooperative behaviors, such as the formation of "safety buffers" and coordinated braking, which effectively dampen shockwave propagation. This research substantiates the viability of actor-critic-based DRL as a foundational methodology for developing safety-critical control systems in autonomous driving, paving the way for more resilient and scalable collision avoidance mechanisms in mixed-autonomy traffic ecosystems.
