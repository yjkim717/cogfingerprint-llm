**Abstract**

The efficacy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is heavily dependent on the quantity and diversity of training data. While traditional data augmentation techniques, such as affine transformations, are widely used, they often introduce distortions that degrade high-frequency information. This paper introduces a novel augmentation framework based on conformal mappings, specifically MÃ¶bius transformations, which preserve local angles and shapes. By constructing a diverse set of such mappings, we generate augmented images that maintain semantic integrity while presenting novel geometric perspectives to the network. We empirically validate our method on benchmark image classification datasets, including ImageNet and CIFAR-100. Results from 2022 demonstrate that our conformal augmentation strategy yields a statistically significant improvement in model generalization and prediction accuracy over conventional methods, without increasing the risk of overfitting. This establishes conformal mapping as a principled geometric approach for enhancing dataset richness.
