In the domain of algorithmic mechanism design, the buy-many constraint has emerged as a pivotal model for multi-item mechanisms, reflecting realistic consumer behavior where buyers can purchase multiple bundles. This paper establishes a novel revenue benchmark tailored for multi-buyer settings under this constraint, addressing the gap in prior work focused predominantly on single-buyer scenarios. We demonstrate that sequential item pricing, augmented with buyer-specific pricing strategies, achieves an O(log m)-approximation to this benchmark for buyers with unit-demand or additive preferences. This result matches the known optimal bound for single-buyer mechanisms, thereby generalizing and strengthening the theoretical foundations of revenue maximization. Our analysis leverages intricate combinatorial arguments and duality techniques to bound the performance gap, illustrating the robustness of simple pricing schemes in complex market environments. These findings, situated within 2022's advancements in computational economics, underscore the tractability of near-optimal revenue extraction without resorting to complex, randomized mechanisms, offering practical insights for electronic markets and platform design.
