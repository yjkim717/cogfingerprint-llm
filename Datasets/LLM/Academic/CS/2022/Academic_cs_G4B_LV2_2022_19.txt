**Abstract**

High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging presents significant challenges in practical applications due to the inherent complexities of capturing and processing raw sensor data from dynamic illumination environments. Traditional image enhancement techniques often struggle to effectively mitigate both noise and varying light levels simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel, lightweight algorithm leveraging Fourier Adversarial Networks (FANs) to substantially improve HDR image quality. Our approach focuses on directly addressing these limitations by training a FAN architecture specifically on raw sensor data, circumventing the need for extensive pre-processing. 

The core innovation lies in utilizing a Fourier domain representation within the adversarial training process, enabling the network to learn robust features invariant to illumination fluctuations.  Experimental results, conducted on datasets simulating dynamic scenes, demonstrate a marked improvement in image quality metrics – including contrast ratio and perceived sharpness – compared to conventional enhancement methods.  Specifically, we observed a [Insert specific quantitative metric improvement, e.g., 15%] increase in the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and a [Insert specific metric improvement, e.g., 10%] enhancement in the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM).  Further analysis reveals the algorithm’s efficiency and suitability for deployment in resource-constrained environments, highlighting its potential for real-time HDR processing within camera systems.
