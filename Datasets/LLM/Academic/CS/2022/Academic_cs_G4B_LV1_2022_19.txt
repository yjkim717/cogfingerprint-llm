**Abstract**

Effective image enhancement remains a critical challenge across diverse perceptual tasks, particularly when confronted with non-uniform illumination. This paper presents a novel, computationally efficient algorithm leveraging Fourier-domain adversarial networks (FDANs) for robust image improvement.  We hypothesize that operating within the frequency domain facilitates targeted manipulation of illumination artifacts, mitigating their impact on downstream perception. Our approach employs a lightweight FDAN architecture trained to predict enhanced image representations, directly addressing variations in scene lighting.  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms conventional enhancement techniques across a range of synthetic and real-world datasets.  Specifically, we observed statistically significant improvements in performance metrics related to visual quality and human perception scores – measured via a standardized psychovisual assessment.  Future work will investigate the integration of FDANs with domain adaptation strategies to broaden applicability and enhance generalization to unseen illumination conditions.
