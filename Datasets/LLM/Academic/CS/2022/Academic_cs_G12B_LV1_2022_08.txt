**Real-Time Visual-Inertial Odometry and Mapping for Quadruped Robots via Factor Graph Optimization**

The increasing prevalence of quadruped robots in dynamic and unstructured environments necessitates robust and efficient Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) capabilities. This work introduces A1-SLAM, an open-source ROS package designed to provide real-time SLAM functionality specifically for the Unitree A1 quadruped platform. Leveraging the robot’s onboard sensors – primarily a 2D LiDAR and IMU – A1-SLAM implements a sliding window approach to maintain a compact map representation while enabling accurate pose estimation. The core of the system utilizes a factor graph optimization framework to fuse sensor data, minimizing both pose and landmark uncertainties.  This approach allows for effective handling of the non-holonomic constraints inherent in quadruped locomotion.  We present a detailed description of the factor graph formulation, incorporating LiDAR odometry measurements and IMU pre-integration techniques for improved accuracy and computational efficiency.  Preliminary results demonstrate A1-SLAM's ability to achieve real-time performance (≥10 Hz) with consistent pose estimation accuracy (relative error < 3% over 10m trajectories) in simulated and real-world environments.  The package is publicly available, aiming to facilitate research and development in quadruped robotics and autonomous navigation, particularly within resource-constrained scenarios.
