**Abstract:**

This work introduces a novel algorithmic mechanism design framework for the strategic elicitation of multi-dimensional effort, addressing limitations in traditional reward systems.  We formalize the problem as a generalization of the knapsack problem, recognizing that agents’ actions often involve trade-offs across diverse, interdependent dimensions of exertion.  The core contribution lies in the development of scoring rules – dynamically adjusted mechanisms – designed to incentivize optimal effort allocation given agent heterogeneity and strategic behavior.  These rules are grounded in principles of incentive compatibility and representational fairness, mitigating potential manipulation.  Our approach leverages a computational model to evaluate the performance of proposed scoring rules, demonstrating improved effort alignment compared to fixed reward schemes.  Preliminary simulations suggest applicability within classroom environments, providing a foundation for future research into adaptive learning systems and performance evaluation.  Further investigation will explore the scalability of this framework for complex, real-world scenarios.
