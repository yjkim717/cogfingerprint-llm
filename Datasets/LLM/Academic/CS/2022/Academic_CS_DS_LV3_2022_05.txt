Abstract: This 2022 computational study establishes a formal theoretical framework for dynamic benchmarking in machine learning systems, addressing critical gaps in sequential model evaluation under real-world constraints. We demonstrate that conventional static benchmarks fail to capture performance degradation arising from hierarchical dependencies in data streams and evolving label noise patterns. Through rigorous mathematical modeling, we prove fundamental limitations in model fitting accuracy when temporal dependencies introduce cascading errors across sequential decision points. Our theoretical contributions are validated via large-scale dataset simulations replicating industrial data collection environments, revealing that even state-of-the-art models exhibit performance decay exceeding 23% under dynamic evaluation regimes. The proposed framework introduces novel metrics for quantifying robustness against distributional shift while providing theoretical guarantees for minimum performance thresholds. These findings necessitate paradigm shifts in evaluation methodology and provide foundational principles for developing adaptive learning systems capable of maintaining stability in non-stationary environments.
