Title: Enhancing Systematic Generalization in Grounded Language Learning through Modularity and Data Augmentation

Abstract:
Systematic generalization, a hallmark of human cognition, remains a significant challenge in grounded language learning with neural networks. This study (2022) investigates the efficacy of modularity and data augmentation in enhancing systematic generalization in neural networks. We propose a modular neural architecture that decomposes the task into distinct sub-modules, facilitating compositional understanding and reasoning. Furthermore, we employ a data augmentation strategy that generates novel, synthetic training examples, thereby increasing the diversity and complexity of the training data. Our results demonstrate that the integration of modularity and data augmentation significantly improves systematic generalization in grounded language learning, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. The findings have important implications for the development of more robust and generalizable language learning systems, highlighting the potential of modular, data-driven approaches in achieving human-like language understanding.
