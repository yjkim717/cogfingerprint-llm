**Abstract**

This work investigates the computational limits of learning with errors (LWE) in the presence of Massart noise, a prevalent model for characterizing real-world data corruption. We present a novel hardness result demonstrating that polynomial-time algorithms cannot achieve significantly improved error rates – beyond Ω(η) – when learning halfspaces under this noisy setting. Leveraging the established cryptographic hardness of the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, we establish a tight bound on the achievable accuracy.  Specifically, our analysis demonstrates that the inherent noise introduced by Massart obscures the signal, fundamentally limiting the efficiency of learning algorithms.  This result has implications for robust machine learning, particularly in scenarios where data is inherently unreliable. Further research will explore the trade-offs between noise level, algorithm complexity, and the attainable learning performance, contributing to the development of more resilient and practical learning systems.
