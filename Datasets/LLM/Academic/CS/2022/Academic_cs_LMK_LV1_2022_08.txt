This paper presents A1 SLAM, a novel, open-source ROS package tailored for real-time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) on the Unitree A1 quadruped robot utilizing onboard sensors. Leveraging the factor graph paradigm, A1 SLAM integrates LiDAR odometry with other sensor modalities to achieve robust and accurate state estimation. By harnessing the Unitree A1's onboard sensors, including LiDAR, IMU, and joint encoders, our system constructs a comprehensive and efficient SLAM framework. The proposed system is designed to operate in real-time, making it suitable for applications requiring agile and autonomous quadruped locomotion. We demonstrate the efficacy of A1 SLAM through experiments in various environments, showcasing its ability to accurately map and localize within complex surroundings. As an open-source ROS package, A1 SLAM provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field, facilitating advancements in quadruped SLAM and related applications. Our implementation is compatible with the 2022 ROS ecosystem, ensuring seamless integration with existing robotic frameworks.
