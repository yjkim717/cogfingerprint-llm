Title: Modeling the Humoral Response to SARS-CoV-2 Booster Vaccination in Multiple Myeloma Patients using Computational Immunology Approaches


Abstract:

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for effective vaccination strategies, particularly for immunocompromised individuals, such as those with multiple myeloma (MM). Recent studies have shown that booster vaccination with BNT162b2 enhances the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 in MM patients, except those undergoing anti-BCMA therapy. To better understand the underlying immunological mechanisms, we employed a computational immunology approach, integrating machine learning algorithms with mechanistic modeling. Our in silico framework simulated the dynamics of B cell activation, antibody production, and neutralizing antibody titers in response to BNT162b2 booster vaccination. We calibrated our model using clinical data from MM patients and validated its predictive performance against independent datasets. Our results demonstrate that the model accurately captures the observed humoral response patterns, including the reduced response in patients under anti-BCMA therapy. Furthermore, our simulations predicted that optimizing vaccination schedules and tailoring immunotherapies to individual patient profiles could improve treatment outcomes. Our study highlights the potential of computational immunology to inform personalized vaccination strategies for immunocompromised populations, thereby mitigating the risk of severe COVID-19. The proposed framework can be extended to other vaccines and immunotherapies, contributing to the development of more effective treatments against infectious diseases.
