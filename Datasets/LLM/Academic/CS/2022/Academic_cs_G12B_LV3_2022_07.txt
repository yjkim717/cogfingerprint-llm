**Abstract:** This work investigates the fundamental relationship between online learning and differentially private learning in the context of binary-labeled concept classes. We present a novel theoretical result demonstrating a direct equivalence: a concept class is privately PAC learnable under differential privacy if and only if it admits a finite Littlestone dimension. This finding bridges the gap between sequential, adaptive learning paradigms and the rigorous privacy guarantees afforded by differential privacy. The implication is that the inherent complexity, as captured by the Littlestone dimension, fundamentally limits the feasibility of private learning, providing a crucial theoretical constraint for algorithm design and analysis in the field.
