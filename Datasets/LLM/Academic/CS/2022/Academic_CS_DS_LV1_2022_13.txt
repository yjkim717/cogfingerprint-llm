**Abstract**

A central challenge in neural grounded language learning is the problem of systematic generalization: the ability of models to comprehend and produce novel combinations of known concepts. While end-to-end neural architectures excel at interpolation, they often fail to extrapolate systematically, lacking the compositional robustness inherent to human cognition. This paper posits that a synergistic approach combining *inductive biases of modularity* with *targeted data augmentation* can significantly bridge this performance gap. We introduce a modular neural framework that explicitly segregates perceptual processing from compositional linguistic reasoning. This structure is trained using an automated data augmentation pipeline that generates a curriculum of examples requiring compositional inference. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the gSCAN benchmark and a novel household instruction dataset, demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art systematic generalization, outperforming monolithic baselines by a substantial margin. Crucially, we perform a detailed failure analysis, revealing that while our approach mitigates many systematic errors, certain types of pragmatic and contextual reasoning remain elusive. We conclude that architectural modularity and strategic data augmentation are powerful mechanisms for improving systematicity, yet they do not fully encapsulate the sample efficiency and flexibility of human language learning, outlining a clear path for future research.
