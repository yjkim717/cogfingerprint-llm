Title: Enhancing Systematic Generalization in Grounded Language Learning through Modularity and Data Augmentation

Abstract:
Systematic generalization, the ability of neural networks to understand and generate novel compositions of known elements, remains a significant challenge in grounded language learning. This study examines the impact of modularity and data augmentation on systematic generalization in neural networks. We investigate how modular architectures, which decompose the learning task into specialized sub-modules, and data augmentation techniques, which artificially expand the training dataset, influence the capacity of neural networks to generalize systematically. Our results demonstrate that modularity significantly enhances systematic generalization by allowing the model to capture compositional structures more effectively. Data augmentation is also found to improve generalization, particularly when combined with modular architectures. The findings suggest that integrating modularity and data augmentation can substantially improve the systematic generalization capabilities of neural networks in grounded language learning tasks, offering a promising direction for future research in this area.
