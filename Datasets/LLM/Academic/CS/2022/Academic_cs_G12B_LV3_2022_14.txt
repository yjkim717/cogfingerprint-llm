**Abstract**

The increasing deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust strategies for mitigating complex traffic safety risks, particularly chain collisions. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for developing proactive driving strategies specifically designed to prevent such cascading events. Our approach leverages actor-critic methods to train agents capable of navigating dynamic traffic environments, optimizing for both collision avoidance and traffic flow efficiency. We evaluate the efficacy of our DRL-based strategy through extensive simulations across both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, under a range of realistic traffic densities and behavioral models. Results demonstrate a significant reduction in chain collision frequency compared to conventional rule-based control systems. Furthermore, we analyze the learned driving policies, revealing adaptive behaviors that prioritize inter-vehicle spacing and anticipatory maneuvers. The findings highlight the potential of DRL to enhance the safety and operational efficiency of AV fleets, contributing to safer and more reliable autonomous transportation systems. This research addresses a critical challenge in autonomous driving and provides a foundation for future work exploring decentralized control and robust safety guarantees in complex, multi-agent environments.
