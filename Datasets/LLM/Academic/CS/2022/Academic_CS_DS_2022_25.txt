**Abstract**

The sustained release kinetics of antibiotic-loaded calcium sulfate beads represent a promising strategy for localized infection management, yet systemic exposure and renal safety remain critical considerations. This investigation evaluated the pharmacokinetic profile and nephrotoxic potential of two tobramycin dosages (240 mg vs. 400 mg) eluted from calcium sulfate beads in a clinical cohort. Serum tobramycin concentrations and serial serum creatinine measurements were monitored to determine systemic drug exposure and assess renal function. Analysis demonstrated that the 240 mg formulation consistently maintained serum concentrations within the predefined therapeutic window throughout the observation period. Crucially, this regimen was not associated with any significant elevation in serum creatinine, indicating a favorable renal safety profile. In contrast, administration of the 400 mg bead dosage resulted in initial peak serum tobramycin levels that transiently surpassed the upper therapeutic threshold. While no sustained acute kidney injury was documented in this cohort, the observed supra-therapeutic peaks necessitate caution. These findings, from a 2022 dataset, suggest that while lower-dose tobramycin beads provide a safe and effective delivery system, higher dosages require careful patient selection and vigilant therapeutic drug monitoring to mitigate potential nephrotoxicity.
