**Abstract**

The imperative for sustainable water management in agriculture has catalyzed the adoption of IoT-enabled smart irrigation systems. While these systems generate high-frequency, multivariate data on soil and environmental conditions, the challenge remains in developing robust computational models to accurately interpret this data for precise irrigation control. This paper presents a comparative analysis of supervised machine learning algorithms for the classification of soil moisture states—categorized as 'Adequate', 'Stressed', or 'Saturated'—using a dataset acquired from a distributed wireless sensor network. We evaluate the performance of several classifiers, including Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Trees, against a Random Forest ensemble. Our methodology involves rigorous preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning via grid search with cross-validation. The results demonstrate that the Random Forest classifier significantly outperforms its counterparts, achieving a peak accuracy of 99.98%, a precision of 99.97%, and a recall of 99.99% on held-out test data. This performance is attributed to the model's inherent ability to manage non-linear relationships and high-dimensional feature spaces without overfitting. We conclude that the Random Forest algorithm provides a highly effective, data-driven framework for real-time soil moisture condition assessment, forming a reliable decision-support core for autonomous irrigation systems.
