**Abstract: Predictive Irrigation Optimization via Machine Learning Classification of IoT-Sourced Soil Moisture Data**

The increasing demand for efficient agricultural practices coupled with the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created opportunities for data-driven irrigation management. This paper investigates the application of machine learning (ML) classification techniques to optimize irrigation scheduling within precision agriculture frameworks. We focus on leveraging real-time soil moisture data, acquired via a network of IoT sensors deployed within a representative agricultural setting. A key challenge lies in effectively categorizing these continuous soil moisture readings into actionable irrigation directives â€“ determining when and how much to irrigate.  To address this, we evaluated the efficacy of a Random Forest (RF) classifier, chosen for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and non-linear relationships characteristic of agricultural environments.

The dataset comprises soil moisture readings, meteorological data, and historical irrigation records. We present a comprehensive analysis of feature engineering strategies, including temporal aggregation and interaction terms, to enhance classifier performance.  Experimental results demonstrate that the RF classifier achieves a significantly improved classification accuracy compared to traditional threshold-based irrigation methods. Furthermore, the optimized irrigation schedules derived from the classifier's predictions resulted in a demonstrable reduction in water consumption while maintaining, and in some cases improving, crop yield. This work contributes a practical methodology for integrating IoT data and ML algorithms to create intelligent, adaptive irrigation systems, promoting resource efficiency and sustainable agricultural practices. Future research will explore the incorporation of other ML models and the integration of predictive analytics for long-term irrigation planning.
