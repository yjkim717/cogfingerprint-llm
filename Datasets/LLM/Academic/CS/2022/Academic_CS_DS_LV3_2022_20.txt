ABSTRACT: The persistent challenge of generalizability in cellular segmentation has driven the development of Cellpose 2.0, a framework that strategically leverages an ensemble of pretrained models to address morphological heterogeneity across biological specimens. This approach circumvents the limitations of single-model architectures by integrating a human-in-the-loop pipeline, wherein minimal expert annotations are refined through an intuitive annotation GUI. This interactive process facilitates the rapid generation of task-specific training data, enabling the efficient fine-tuning of specialist models tailored to distinct imaging modalities and cell types. By combining the broad feature recognition of foundational models with targeted, user-guided corrections, the system achieves a significant reduction in annotation burden while maintaining high precision. Evaluated across diverse datasets in 2022, Cellpose 2.0 demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in accuracy and adaptability on both standard and novel image types. This work establishes a new paradigm for bioimage analysis, where the synergistic combination of ensemble modeling and interactive annotation delivers robust, scalable solutions for the rapidly evolving demands of computational microscopy.
