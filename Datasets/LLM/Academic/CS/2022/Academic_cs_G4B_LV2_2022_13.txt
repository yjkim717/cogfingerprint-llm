**Abstract**

Recent advancements in neural network architectures have increasingly emphasized modularity as a means to enhance generalization performance. This research investigates the interplay between modular neural network design, data augmentation strategies, and systematic generalization within the context of grounded language learning. We hypothesize that incorporating modularity – specifically, the separation of specialized processing units – positively influences a network’s capacity for systematic generalization, enabling it to extrapolate learned relationships to unseen data distributions. Through controlled experiments utilizing a novel modular network architecture and diverse data augmentation techniques, we demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in generalization accuracy compared to conventional, monolithic network models. 

Our findings reveal that data augmentation, when combined with modularity, further strengthens this effect, suggesting a synergistic relationship between architectural design and training data manipulation. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the cognitive processes underpinning neural network generalization, aligning with theories of modularity in human cognition.  The results have implications for designing more robust and adaptable neural networks for complex, real-world applications, particularly in domains requiring systematic extrapolation.
