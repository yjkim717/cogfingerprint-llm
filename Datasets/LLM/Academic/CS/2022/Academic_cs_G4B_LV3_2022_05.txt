**Abstract**

Current benchmark methodologies in machine learning frequently exhibit limitations when evaluating model performance across diverse and evolving datasets. This work presents a novel theoretical framework for *dynamic benchmarking*, designed to mitigate these shortcomings. We investigate two contrasting model architectures – one employing sequential data collection and iterative model fitting, and a second utilizing a hierarchical dependency structure – to systematically identify performance bottlenecks.  Crucially, our analysis incorporates a rigorous examination of *label noise* propagation and its impact on model accuracy throughout the learning process.  Through *theoretical analysis*, we demonstrate how variations in data collection strategies and architectural dependencies exacerbate the effects of noisy labels.  The results suggest that static benchmarks inadequately capture the complexities of real-world model deployment, necessitating a shift towards adaptive evaluation techniques.  Future work will explore practical implementations and extensions to encompass a broader range of model types and data modalities, contributing to more robust and reliable model assessment in 2022 and beyond.
