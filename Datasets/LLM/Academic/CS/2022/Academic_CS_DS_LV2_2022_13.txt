**Abstract**

A central challenge in grounded language learning is the issue of systematic generalization: the ability for agents to comprehend and produce novel combinations of known concepts. Prevailing monolithic neural architectures often fail at this task, exhibiting poor extrapolation beyond their training data distribution. In this work, we posit that a synergistic approach combining **modular neural networks** with targeted **data augmentation** can significantly enhance systematic generalization. We evaluate this hypothesis within a synthetic visual reasoning benchmark, where an agent must interpret compositional instructions to navigate an environment. Our modular architecture decomposes the task into specialized functional components, promoting more structured representations. This structure is further regularized through a curriculum of data augmentation designed to expose the model to a broader range of compositional structures. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed method substantially outperforms robust, non-modular baselines, achieving superior performance on systematic generalization splits. These findings underscore the critical role of architectural inductive biases and strategic data curation in building models that exhibit more human-like, combinatorial generalization.
