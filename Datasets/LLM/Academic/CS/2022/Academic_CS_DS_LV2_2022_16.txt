This paper introduces KreolMorisienMT, a novel parallel corpus for machine translation (MT) involving Mauritian Creole (Kreol Morisien), English, and French. Despite being a major language of Mauritius, Mauritian Creole remains a low-resource language in NLP, lacking standardized benchmarks for translation quality. Our dataset addresses this gap by providing a high-quality, manually verified trilingual corpus. We benchmark several modern MT approaches, including transfer learning from related high-resource languages, to establish baseline performance. Results demonstrate that multilingual transfer learning significantly improves translation quality for this under-resourced language pair. This work provides a crucial resource for advancing MT research for Creole languages and establishes a foundation for future work in low-resource, multilingual NLP.
