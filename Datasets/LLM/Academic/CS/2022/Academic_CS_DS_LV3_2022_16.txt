This paper presents KreolMorisienMT, a novel parallel corpus for machine translation (MT) between Mauritian Creole, English, and French, addressing a significant resource gap for low-resource languages. We investigate multilingual transfer learning techniques, leveraging related high-resource languages to bootstrap translation models, which substantially improves performance over baseline approaches. A rigorous human evaluation confirms that our best-performing model achieves high translation quality, with fluency and adequacy scores comparable to those for established language pairs. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of cross-lingual transfer for under-resourced languages and provide a critical benchmark for future MT research and development in the Mauritian context, contributing to greater digital equity for Creole-speaking communities.
