This paper investigates the architectural trade-offs between convolutional networks and vision transformers for image recognition tasks. We propose a novel hybrid architecture that integrates patch-based processing with depthwise separable convolutions, demonstrating that spatial mixing operations can achieve competitive performance without relying on computationally intensive self-attention mechanisms. Our approach maintains the translation equivariance properties of convolutional networks while leveraging the patch embedding strategy popularized by vision transformers. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet classification, we show that our model achieves 78.9% top-1 accuracy with only 21M parameters, outperforming both standard Vision Transformers and ResNet variants of comparable scale. The results suggest that carefully designed convolutional architectures remain highly competitive in the transformer-dominated landscape of modern computer vision. Our work provides new insights into the essential components required for effective visual representation learning, challenging the prevailing assumption that self-attention layers are necessary for state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks.
