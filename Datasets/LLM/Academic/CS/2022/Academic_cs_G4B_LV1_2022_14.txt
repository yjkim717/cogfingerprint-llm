**Robust Collision Avoidance via Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Vehicle Navigation**

The increasing deployment of autonomous vehicles necessitates robust and verifiable collision avoidance strategies. This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to mitigate the risk of chain collisions – a critical safety concern in complex traffic scenarios. Our approach leverages an actor-critic architecture, employing a deep neural network to represent the agent’s policy and value function, trained within the context of a Markov Decision Process (MDP).  Specifically, we explore the efficacy of this method in simulating realistic vehicular interactions, focusing on scenarios prone to sequential collisions. 

We investigate the impact of diverse network structures, representing road layouts and traffic densities, on the learned policy’s safety efficiency.  Simulation experiments, utilizing a high-fidelity vehicle dynamics model, demonstrate the algorithm’s ability to learn optimal trajectories that minimize collision probability.  Quantitative analysis reveals a significant improvement in collision avoidance performance compared to traditional rule-based systems.  Furthermore, we analyze the stability and convergence properties of the actor-critic method, addressing potential challenges associated with exploration and reward shaping.  Future work will focus on integrating this framework with sensor fusion techniques and incorporating formal verification methods to guarantee safety properties.
