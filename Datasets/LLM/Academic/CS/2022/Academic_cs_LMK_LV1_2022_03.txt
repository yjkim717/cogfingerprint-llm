Title: Enhanced Revenue Benchmarks for Multi-Item Mechanisms with Unit-Demand Buyers

Abstract:
We introduce a novel revenue benchmark for buy-many mechanisms in multi-item settings with unit-demand buyers, leveraging online contention resolution schemes. Our benchmark generalizes the existing revenue benchmarks for single-item and multi-item auctions, providing a more nuanced measure of revenue optimality. We demonstrate that a simple sequential item pricing mechanism achieves an $O(\log m)$ approximation to this benchmark, where $m$ is the number of items. This result improves upon existing approximation guarantees for multi-item mechanisms with unit-demand buyers. Our analysis relies on a novel application of online contention resolution schemes, which enables us to derive a tighter bound on the revenue loss incurred by the sequential pricing mechanism. Our results contribute to the growing literature on buy-many mechanisms and provide new insights into the design of revenue-optimal multi-item auctions in 2022.
