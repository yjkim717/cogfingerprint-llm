**Abstract: Enhancing Semantic Segmentation via Sparse Non-Local Conditional Random Fields**  

In recent years, conditional random fields (CRFs) have been instrumental in advancing semantic segmentation within computer vision. However, traditional dense CRFs, while offering rich representational capacity, suffer from prohibitive computational complexity, limiting their scalability. Conversely, sparse CRFs improve efficiency but often sacrifice modeling power by omitting crucial long-range dependencies. To address this dichotomy, we propose a novel sparse non-local CRF framework that strategically integrates selective non-local connections into sparse graphical models. This hybrid approach preserves the computational advantages of sparsity while capturing contextual information across distant pixels, thereby approximating the representational strength of dense models.  

Our method employs an attention-driven mechanism to identify and incorporate salient non-local interactions, enabling precise and efficient inference. Crucially, we demonstrate that this formulation permits exact optimization via dynamic programming, circumventing the approximations required in prior work. Evaluated on benchmark datasets including Pascal VOC and Cityscapes, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in segmentation accuracy while reducing inference time by up to 40% compared to dense CRF baselines. These results underscore the potential of sparse non-local CRFs to bridge the gap between efficiency and expressiveness, paving the way for real-time applications in autonomous systems and medical imaging.
