**Abstract**

This research investigates the impact of leadership qualities on the effective implementation of technology within educational settings. Utilizing data from a 2022 study focusing on Palestinian schools, we observed a statistically significant positive correlation between demonstrable technology leadership and the subsequent integration of technology by teachers.  Specifically, the findings suggest that proactive leadership frameworks, potentially facilitated by tools like SPSS for data analysis and systems such as ‘Smart PLS’ for modeling, contribute to enhanced pedagogical practices.  Further investigation is warranted to explore the nuanced mechanisms driving this relationship and its implications for scalable technology adoption in diverse educational contexts.
