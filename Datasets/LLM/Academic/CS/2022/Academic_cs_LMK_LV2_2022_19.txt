Title: Robust Image Enhancement for Dynamic Illumination Conditions via Fourier Adversarial Networks and Lightweight CNNs

Abstract:
In 2022, the proliferation of High Dynamic Range (HDR) cameras has necessitated the development of sophisticated Image Signal Processing (ISP) algorithms to effectively balance illumination correction and noise removal. This paper proposes a novel two-stage image enhancement algorithm, leveraging Fourier Adversarial Networks and lightweight Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The first stage employs a Fourier Adversarial Network to adaptively adjust illumination conditions, effectively normalizing dynamic illumination variations. The second stage utilizes a lightweight CNN to remove noise and refine image details, ensuring robustness to diverse illumination scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in achieving superior image enhancement performance, compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach has significant implications for robust perception in various computer vision applications, including autonomous driving and surveillance systems, where dynamic illumination conditions are prevalent.
