**Abstract**

The efficacy of sequential model fine-tuning, a cornerstone of modern machine learning pipelines, is critically dependent on the integrity of the underlying data representation layer. This paper investigates a significant performance degradation observed when fine-tuning large pre-trained language models (LMs) on specialized, data-scarce domains, analogous to the concept of immunological response in clinical settings. We hypothesize that certain aggressive, high-impact pre-training regimens, particularly those involving intensive reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), can induce a form of "representational rigidity." This state functionally corrupts or occludes critical, generalizable feature embeddings, rendering the model refractory to subsequent adaptation via standard gradient-based fine-tuning. To test this, we designed a controlled experiment using the BERT and GPT-2 architectures, fine-tuning them sequentially on a series of tasks from the GLUE benchmark. Our results demonstrate that a second fine-tuning cycle (a "booster" adaptation) consistently improves task-specific performance metrics across most model configurations. However, models initially subjected to RLHF-driven alignment pre-training exhibited a statistically significant failure to adapt, with minimal change in loss and accuracy, mirroring a null response. We conclude that the representational damage from certain pre-training methodologies is a critical, often overlooked factor in transfer learning. This finding necessitates a paradigm shift in model design, urging the development of novel, less invasive alignment techniques that preserve model plasticity for lifelong learning.
