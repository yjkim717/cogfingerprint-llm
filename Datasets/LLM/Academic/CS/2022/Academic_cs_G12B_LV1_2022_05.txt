**Dynamic Benchmarking Under Noise and Hierarchical Structure: A Theoretical Analysis of Adaptive Model Fitting**

The increasing prevalence of rapidly evolving datasets necessitates the development of dynamic benchmarking methodologies capable of accurately reflecting real-world performance. This paper presents a theoretical investigation into dynamic benchmarking, addressing the challenges posed by evolving data distributions and the presence of label noise. We focus on the problem of adapting model fitting strategies to maintain benchmark validity over time. We analyze two distinct model fitting approaches – a fixed-window retrospective approach and an adaptive, online learning strategy – within a framework incorporating both temporal data drift and probabilistic label noise. Our analysis considers the impact of these factors on benchmark stability and predictive power. Specifically, we derive bounds on the expected error of each approach as a function of the rate of data distribution change, the level of label noise, and the model complexity. Furthermore, we explore the implications of hierarchical dependencies within the data, demonstrating how incorporating structural information can mitigate the negative effects of noise, particularly in scenarios with high drift. Results indicate that while the fixed-window approach offers computational simplicity, its performance degrades significantly under substantial drift. The adaptive strategy, while computationally more demanding, exhibits superior robustness. Finally, we highlight limitations related to the assumption of known noise characteristics and propose avenues for future research involving noise-aware learning algorithms integrated within dynamic benchmarking frameworks.
