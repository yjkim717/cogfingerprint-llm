**Abstract**

Addressing the limitations of conventional data augmentation techniques in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), this work proposes a novel approach leveraging conformal mappings for enhanced training data generation.  Traditional data augmentation methods often introduce artificial distortions, potentially impacting model generalization. We demonstrate that applying Möbius transformations, a specific class of conformal mappings, effectively preserves geometric and topological properties during augmentation.  This process generates synthetic training samples that retain crucial information inherent in the original dataset.  Experimental results, detailed in the accompanying paper, indicate a statistically significant improvement in prediction accuracy across a benchmark image classification task.  The method’s efficacy stems from its ability to provide augmentations devoid of information loss, fostering more robust and reliable CNN models.  Future research will explore extending this technique to higher-dimensional data.
