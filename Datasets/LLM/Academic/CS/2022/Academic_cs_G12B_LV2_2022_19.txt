**Abstract:**

The challenge of effectively enhancing images captured under dynamic illumination conditions remains a significant hurdle in computational imaging. Traditional High Dynamic Range (HDR) techniques often struggle with computational complexity and artifacts, particularly when dealing with rapidly changing lighting scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, two-stage image enhancement algorithm leveraging Fourier Adversarial Networks (FANs) to address these limitations. Our approach prioritizes computational efficiency while maintaining robust performance in the presence of complex and temporally varying illumination.

The proposed algorithm first employs a preliminary image signal processing (ISP) stage to mitigate initial noise and perform basic tone mapping. Subsequently, a lightweight FAN architecture is utilized for refinement and adaptive contrast enhancement. The core innovation lies in the application of the Fourier domain within the adversarial training framework.  By operating in the frequency domain, the FAN is able to learn and enforce perceptual image quality metrics more effectively, particularly concerning fine details and reduced halo artifacts common in HDR processing. We hypothesize that this frequency-based training promotes the learning of more generalizable features, leading to improved robustness across diverse dynamic illumination conditions.

Experimental results, conducted on a benchmark dataset of images exhibiting varying dynamic range and illumination profiles, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art HDR image enhancement techniques, while significantly reducing computational cost.  Quantitative metrics, including Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), alongside subjective visual assessments, confirm the efficacy of the FAN-based enhancement stage.  This work contributes a practical and efficient solution for image enhancement in challenging lighting environments, with potential applications in computational photography, autonomous navigation, and surveillance systems.
