**Abstract**

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are a cornerstone of probabilistic graphical models for structured prediction in computer vision, particularly in semantic segmentation. While dense CRFs model rich, long-range pairwise potentials using Gaussian kernels, their computational cost is often prohibitive for high-resolution imagery. Conversely, sparse CRFs offer efficiency but are typically limited to local neighborhoods, sacrificing modeling capacity. This paper introduces a Sparse Non-Local CRF (SNL-CRF), a novel formulation that reconciles this trade-off. Our model strategically sparsifies the dense graph by retaining only the most salient long-range connections, identified through a feature affinity measure, while employing high-dimensional Gaussian filters on this sparse edge set. This architecture preserves the expressive power for capturing global context and fine-grained boundaries akin to a dense CRF, but with the computational complexity of a sparse model. We derive an efficient mean-field inference algorithm tailored to this sparse non-local structure. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes) demonstrate that the proposed SNL-CRF achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy while being significantly more efficient than contemporary dense CRF approaches, establishing a new Pareto frontier for performance and speed in probabilistic segmentation models.
