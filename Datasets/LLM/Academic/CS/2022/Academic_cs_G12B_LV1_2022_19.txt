Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a CS publication (circa 2022). I've aimed for precision and structured reasoning, and a word count around 260 words.  Following the abstract, I've included a few notes on the choices made and potential areas for expansion if you needed to build upon this.

**Abstract: Fourier Adversarial Networks for Lightweight High Dynamic Range Image Enhancement under Dynamic Illumination**

The proliferation of High Dynamic Range (HDR) cameras has spurred significant research into image signal processing (ISP) pipelines capable of effectively handling challenging illumination scenarios. Traditional HDR image enhancement techniques often suffer from computational complexity, limiting their real-time applicability, particularly in embedded systems. This work introduces a novel and computationally efficient image enhancement algorithm leveraging Fourier Adversarial Networks (FANs) for improved visual quality and perceptual performance under dynamic lighting conditions.

Our approach utilizes a generator network trained adversarially against a discriminator network within the FAN framework. Crucially, we operate within the Fourier domain, enabling efficient frequency-based feature extraction and manipulation. This allows for targeted enhancement of specific frequency components crucial for perceptual quality, such as those associated with detail and contrast. The discriminator network is designed to differentiate between enhanced images and real-world high-quality references, fostering the generation of realistic and perceptually pleasing results.

We propose a lightweight architecture for both the generator and discriminator, minimizing computational overhead while maintaining performance. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our FAN-based enhancement algorithm achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods, as measured by both quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and subjective evaluations. Furthermore, our method exhibits significantly reduced computational complexity, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. The results highlight the potential of FANs within the Fourier domain as a powerful tool for lightweight and effective HDR image enhancement in dynamic illumination environments.

**Notes and Potential Expansions:**

*   **Specific Architectures:** The abstract intentionally remains relatively general about the exact architecture of the generator and discriminator.  In a full paper, you would detail these.
*   **Loss Function:**  The loss function used to train the GAN would be a key element to describe.
*   **Dataset Details:** Mentioning specific datasets used for evaluation (e.g., HDR120, a custom dataset) would strengthen the abstract.
*   **Quantitative Results:** Including one or two key quantitative results (e.g., "achieving a PSNR improvement of X dB compared to Method Y") would be impactful.
*   **Dynamic Illumination Details:** Specifying *how* the dynamic illumination is modeled or handled (e.g., through a specific input representation) could be useful.
*   **Perceptual Metrics:** Mentioning specific perceptual metrics used (e.g., NIQE, BRISQUE) would add rigor.
