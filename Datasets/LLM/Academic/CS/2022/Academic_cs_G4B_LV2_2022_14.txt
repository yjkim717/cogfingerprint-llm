**Abstract: Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Safety via Reinforcement Learning and Markov Decision Process Modeling of Chain Collisions**

The increasing deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust safety mechanisms, particularly concerning complex collision avoidance scenarios. This research investigates a novel reinforcement learning (RL) strategy designed to mitigate chain collisions – a critical hazard arising from multiple vehicle interactions – within the operational domain of AVs. We leverage actor-critic algorithms to train an agent capable of dynamically adjusting its trajectory to preemptively avoid collisions with leading and following vehicles. 

Our approach formalizes the collision avoidance problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), enabling a systematic application of RL techniques. Simulation environments, parameterized to represent realistic traffic conditions and vehicle dynamics, were utilized for training and evaluation. Specifically, we employed a modified Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, incorporating a collision potential function to provide a dense reward signal indicative of collision risk. 

Preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed RL strategy significantly reduces the frequency of chain collisions compared to baseline reactive control methods.  Quantitative analysis, measured in terms of collision rates and average time-to-collision, showcases the enhanced safety efficiency of the learned policy.  Future work will focus on extending this methodology to more complex multi-agent scenarios, incorporating consideration of vehicle intent and adaptive learning strategies to improve robustness in dynamic and unpredictable environments.  This research contributes to the growing body of work exploring the application of RL for enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems.
