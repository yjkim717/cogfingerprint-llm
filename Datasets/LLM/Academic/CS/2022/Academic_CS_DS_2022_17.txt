This paper presents a novel framework for dynamic manipulation of neural radiance fields through hierarchical deformation primitives. We introduce a procedural deformation system that enables real-time scene articulation while preserving photorealistic rendering quality. Our approach establishes a deformation graph structure that propagates transformations through spatial hierarchies, maintaining coherence across multi-view consistent representations. The methodology supports both coarse-level scene manipulation and fine-grained surface deformations through a unified optimization framework. We demonstrate significant improvements in deformation accuracy and rendering fidelity compared to previous neural scene representation methods. Experimental validation across diverse scenes shows our system achieves state-of-the-art performance in interactive scene editing applications, enabling new possibilities for digital content creation and virtual environment manipulation. The proposed technique bridges the gap between traditional geometric deformation and modern neural rendering paradigms.
