This paper presents a novel real-time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) solution for the Unitree A1 quadruped robot, leveraging its onboard sensors and factor graph optimization. The proposed A1 SLAM package integrates lidar odometry with factor graph-based optimization to achieve robust and accurate pose estimation. By utilizing the robot's onboard lidar sensor and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), the system constructs a factor graph that optimizes the robot's trajectory and generates a precise 3D map of the environment. The implementation is built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS) framework, ensuring seamless integration with existing robotic ecosystems. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the A1 SLAM package in various challenging environments, showcasing its potential for real-world applications such as search and rescue, inspection, and exploration. The proposed system operates in real-time, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. (2022)
