**Abstract**

The ongoing challenge of SARS-CoV-2 variant emergence necessitates robust humoral immunity, particularly in immunocompromised populations. This study investigates the efficacy of a second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA booster vaccine in mitigating viral susceptibility within patients with multiple myeloma (MM).  Our analysis, conducted in 2022, reveals a statistically significant enhancement of neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 following a second booster vaccination compared to baseline measurements. However, this benefit was notably attenuated – and in some cases, entirely absent – in patients concurrently receiving anti-BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) therapy. 

These findings suggest a potential mechanism whereby current MM treatment regimens, specifically those targeting B-cell activity, may interfere with the immunogenic response to mRNA vaccines. The observed reduction in antibody titers strongly implies a disruption of the adaptive immune system’s capacity to generate effective neutralizing antibodies. Further investigation is warranted to delineate the specific immunological pathways impacted by anti-BCMA agents and to explore strategies, such as vaccine modifications or adjunctive immunotherapies, that could bolster vaccine efficacy in this vulnerable patient cohort.  Future research should also consider longitudinal monitoring of antibody levels to fully characterize the durability of the observed response.
