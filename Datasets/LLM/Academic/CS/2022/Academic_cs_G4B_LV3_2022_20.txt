**Abstract**

Recent advances in deep learning have spurred significant progress in cellular segmentation, a critical task in biomedical image analysis. This work introduces Cellpose 2.0, a novel system designed to accelerate the development of specialized segmentation models. Leveraging an ensemble architecture incorporating pretrained models, Cellpose 2.0 employs a human-in-the-loop refinement pipeline to achieve state-of-the-art performance with substantially reduced annotation requirements.  The system’s efficacy stems from its ability to rapidly adapt to diverse cellular morphologies through transfer learning.  Specifically, the human feedback component guides the model towards optimal segmentation boundaries, mitigating the limitations of purely automated approaches.  Preliminary results demonstrate a marked improvement in segmentation accuracy compared to existing methods, suggesting a promising pathway for efficient and accurate cellular analysis workflows in 2022 and beyond.
