**Abstract**

Learning with Errors (LWE) and its variants, particularly those incorporating Massart noise, represent a pivotal area of research in statistical learning theory. This work establishes a fundamental computational barrier to efficient learning under noisy conditions. We demonstrate the Ω(η) error bound for polynomial-time learners of halfspace classifiers when subjected to Massart noise, where η represents the noise level. This result leverages recent advancements in analyzing the hardness of LWE problems and extends them to the context of general noise models. Specifically, we exhibit a connection between the inherent computational difficulty of solving LWE instances and the performance limitations of learning algorithms.  The proof relies on techniques from approximation entropy and establishes a tight lower bound on the achievable error rate.  These findings have significant implications for the design of robust learning systems operating in environments with imperfect data, suggesting that achieving optimal performance necessitates acknowledging and incorporating the inherent computational constraints imposed by noise.
