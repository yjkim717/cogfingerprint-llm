**Abstract**

In the domain of computational finance, the accurate assessment of institutional efficiency is critical for systemic stability. This study, contextualized in 2022, investigates the determinants of operational efficiency within a network of digital banking platforms. We posit that system-level risk, quantified by exposure to cybersecurity threats and algorithmic trading volatility, and the intensity of market competition, measured by resource contention and user acquisition costs, are primary drivers of performance degradation. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the underlying governance model—whether centralized (proprietary), decentralized (open-source), or a hybrid—acts as a significant moderating variable. To address endogeneity concerns inherent in such dynamic systems, we employ a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator on a longitudinal dataset of platform performance metrics. Our empirical results confirm a non-linear relationship between competitive pressure and efficiency, while elevated risk exposure consistently exhibits a negative correlation. Crucially, the analysis reveals that decentralized ownership structures demonstrably attenuate the adverse effects of risk, suggesting a resilience advantage. These findings contribute to the design of more robust and efficient financial computing architectures by highlighting the critical interplay between algorithmic governance, competitive landscapes, and risk mitigation.
