In the domain of biomedical image analysis, achieving robust cellular segmentation remains a persistent challenge due to the vast heterogeneity of cell morphologies and imaging modalities. This paper presents Cellpose 2.0, a significant methodological evolution designed to address this generalization bottleneck. We posit that a singular, universal model is suboptimal for specialized tasks. Consequently, our core contribution is a dual-pronged framework. First, we introduce a suite of specialist models, each pretrained on distinct, high-quality datasets to excel in specific biological contexts, thereby enhancing accuracy over a monolithic generalist approach. Second, we integrate these models within a novel human-in-the-loop pipeline. This interactive system refines initial automated predictions through minimal user annotations, effectively closing the performance gap with fully supervised methods at a fraction of the annotation cost. Empirical evaluations on diverse, held-out datasets demonstrate that our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, balancing automation with expert guidance to deliver precise and adaptable segmentation crucial for quantitative biological discovery.
