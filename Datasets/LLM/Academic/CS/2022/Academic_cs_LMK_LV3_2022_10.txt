In 2022, the burgeoning field of computer vision witnessed a paradigm shift with the introduction of a novel image augmentation technique leveraging conformal mappings, specifically MÃ¶bius transformations. This innovative approach, designed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has been shown to substantially reduce prediction errors. By augmenting existing datasets with conformally transformed images, the proposed method enhances the robustness and generalizability of CNNs. Empirical evaluations demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in error rates, underscoring the efficacy of conformal mappings in data augmentation. This advancement holds considerable promise for improving the accuracy of deep learning models in image classification tasks.
