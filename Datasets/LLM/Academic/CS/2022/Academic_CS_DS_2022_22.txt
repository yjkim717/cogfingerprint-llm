This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into neural machine translation for under-resourced creole languages, with specific focus on Kreol Morisien. We introduce a novel parallel corpus spanning English and French, constructed through rigorous linguistic validation. Our methodology employs multilingual transfer learning techniques to overcome data scarcity limitations. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with BLEU scores exceeding 35.0 across all translation directions. The study contributes both a valuable linguistic resource and an effective framework for low-resource language pairs, highlighting the potential of transfer learning in preserving linguistic diversity through computational methods.
