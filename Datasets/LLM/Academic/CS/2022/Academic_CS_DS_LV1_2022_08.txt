This paper presents A1 SLAM, an open-source ROS framework for real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) tailored for the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot. The system leverages onboard sensing, primarily a 3D LiDAR, to construct a robust factor graph-based odometry solution. By integrating keyframe-based scan matching and inertial measurement data, the proposed method achieves precise pose estimation in complex, dynamic environments. A central contribution is the optimization backend, which performs incremental smoothing to correct for drift and maintain global consistency of the generated map. Evaluations in indoor and outdoor scenarios demonstrate that the system provides reliable, real-time performance, enabling autonomous navigation without external infrastructure. The release of this system as an open-source package aims to accelerate research in legged robot autonomy and serve as a benchmark for the community.
