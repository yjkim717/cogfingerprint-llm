**Abstract:**

This work establishes a novel connection between private PAC learnability and online learnability, formalized under the constraint of a finite Littlestone dimension. We demonstrate that achieving private PAC learnability within a concept class implies the existence of an equivalent online learnable algorithm. This equivalence hinges on the restricted dimensionality of the underlying data, suggesting a fundamental limitation on the expressiveness of private learning mechanisms.  Further investigation into this relationship promises to refine our understanding of online learning guarantees and privacy-preserving algorithms in 2022.
