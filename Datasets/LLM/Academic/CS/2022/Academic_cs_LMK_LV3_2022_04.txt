"Incentivizing Multi-Dimensional Effort via Scoring Rules: An Approximation Framework. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic mechanism design framework that leverages scoring rules to elicit multi-dimensional effort from agents. By deriving simple, yet effective scoring rules, we demonstrate that constant-factor approximations to the optimal scoring rule can be achieved. Our results establish that these rules are robust to variations in agent behavior, ensuring approximate optimality in diverse settings. This work contributes to the growing literature on incentivization mechanisms, offering a tractable approach to optimizing multi-dimensional effort in 2022."
