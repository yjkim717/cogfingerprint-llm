This study investigates the mediating role of professional development in the relationship between principal technology leadership and classroom technology integration within K-12 educational computing. Employing a structural equation modeling approach on survey data from 2022, we quantitatively assess how visionary leadership constructs—encompassing digital infrastructure and citizenship frameworks—directly and indirectly influence pedagogical adoption. Results confirm that targeted professional development serves as a critical mechanism, significantly amplifying leadership's effect on the depth and fidelity of technology integration, thereby offering a validated model for systemic educational technology reform.
