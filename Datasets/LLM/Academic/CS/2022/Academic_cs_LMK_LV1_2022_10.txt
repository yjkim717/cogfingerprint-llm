Title: Enhancing Convolutional Neural Networks with Conformal Mapping-based Image Augmentation

Abstract:
Data augmentation is a crucial technique for improving the performance and robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Traditional methods often rely on simple transformations, such as rotation and flipping, which may not effectively capture the underlying geometry of the data. In this paper, we propose a novel image augmentation method leveraging conformal mappings, specifically MÃ¶bius transformations, to generate diverse and realistic training samples. By preserving angles and shapes locally, conformal mappings minimize information loss and maintain the semantic integrity of the original images. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances CNN prediction accuracy across various image classification tasks. The results show that conformal mapping-based augmentation outperforms traditional methods, achieving a notable improvement in accuracy on benchmark datasets. This work highlights the potential of integrating geometric transformations into data augmentation strategies for deep learning models.
