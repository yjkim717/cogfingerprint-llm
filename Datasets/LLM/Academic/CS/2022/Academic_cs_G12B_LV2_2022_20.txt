## Efficient Training of Specialist Cell Segmentation Models via Human-in-the-Loop Refinement of Cellpose 2.0

**Abstract:** Accurate and efficient cell segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative image analysis in biological research. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated significant advances, achieving robust segmentation across diverse image modalities and cell types remains a challenge. Existing pre-trained models often require extensive fine-tuning or fail to generalize effectively to specific experimental conditions. This paper details the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop (HITL) pipeline within the Cellpose 2.0 framework, enabling the rapid and iterative development of specialist segmentation models tailored to user-defined region-of-interest (ROI) data. We leverage Cellpose 2.0's established robust initial segmentation capabilities as a foundation, allowing users to efficiently correct segmentation errors through an intuitive graphical user interface. These corrections are then utilized to generate a refined model, iteratively improving performance on the target dataset. This HITL approach significantly reduces the annotation burden compared to traditional training methodologies, while maintaining or exceeding segmentation accuracy. Results demonstrate that specialist models, trained with as few as 20-30 manually corrected cells within a defined ROI, can achieve competitive performance against models trained with significantly larger, fully annotated datasets. We further analyze the impact of different HITL strategies on model convergence and demonstrate the frameworkâ€™s applicability across various cell types and imaging techniques. This work represents a significant advancement in facilitating the creation of high-quality, task-specific segmentation models, empowering researchers to derive more meaningful insights from their biological image data.
