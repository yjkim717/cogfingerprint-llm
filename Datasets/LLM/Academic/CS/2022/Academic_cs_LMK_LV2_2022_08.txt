This paper presents a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system tailored for the Unitree A1 quadruped robot, leveraging its onboard sensors and factor graph optimization framework. The proposed A1 SLAM package integrates lidar odometry with a sliding window-based factor graph optimization approach, enabling real-time state estimation and mapping. By utilizing the robot's default sensor suite, our system eliminates the need for additional hardware, ensuring a compact and efficient solution. The factor graph formulation allows for flexible incorporation of various sensor modalities and constraints, while the sliding window approach maintains computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the system's capability to provide accurate and robust SLAM performance in various environments. Our results show that the A1 SLAM package achieves reliable state estimation and mapping, making it suitable for autonomous navigation tasks on the Unitree A1 quadruped robot. (2022)
