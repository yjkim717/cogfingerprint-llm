**Abstract: Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Chain Collision Avoidance in Autonomous Driving Systems**

The increasing deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust strategies to mitigate emergent safety risks, particularly those stemming from chain collisions â€“ sequential impacts triggered by an initial event. Traditional reactive collision avoidance systems often prove inadequate in complex, dynamic traffic scenarios where predicting and preventing these cascading events is crucial. This paper investigates a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach, leveraging an actor-critic architecture, to proactively avoid chain collisions in both single-agent and multi-agent autonomous driving environments. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the state space encompasses vehicle positions, velocities, accelerations, and relative distances to surrounding agents. The action space is discretized to represent feasible steering and acceleration commands.

Our proposed actor-critic algorithm, termed "SafeChain-RL," incorporates a novel reward function designed to incentivize safe trajectories and penalize proximity to potential collision triggers, explicitly addressing the chain reaction dynamic. Specifically, the reward function includes terms for inter-vehicle distance, time-to-collision (TTC), and a collision penalty, weighted to prioritize the prevention of chain initiation.  We further introduce a safety buffer within the state representation to enhance robustness against noisy sensor data and imperfect perception.

Extensive simulations were conducted using a high-fidelity traffic simulator incorporating realistic vehicle dynamics and diverse traffic patterns.  Performance was evaluated across a range of scenarios, including varying traffic densities, aggressive driver behaviors, and adverse weather conditions. Results demonstrate that SafeChain-RL significantly outperforms conventional rule-based and reactive trajectory planning methods in terms of chain collision avoidance rate and overall safety efficiency, quantified by a newly defined metric combining collision frequency and average vehicle speed.  Furthermore, we analyze the scalability of the approach in multi-agent settings, showing promising results in coordinating actions to prevent chain collisions across a fleet of AVs.  Future work will focus on incorporating uncertainty modeling and exploring transfer learning techniques to improve generalization across different driving environments.
