Title: Enhancing Image Segmentation with Sparse Non-Local Conditional Random Fields

Abstract:
We present a novel sparse non-local Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for image segmentation tasks, leveraging the strengths of both sparse and dense CRFs. By integrating non-local connections into a sparse CRF framework, our model effectively captures long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed sparse non-local CRF model mitigates the limitations of traditional dense CRFs, which often suffer from high computational complexity, and sparse CRFs, which may neglect significant contextual information. Our approach achieves a balance between accuracy and efficiency, enabling robust image segmentation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art CRF-based methods. The proposed sparse non-local CRF model offers a promising solution for image segmentation tasks, with potential applications in computer vision and related fields. (2022)
