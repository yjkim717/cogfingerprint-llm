In this work, we address the challenge of incentivizing strategic agents to exert multi-dimensional effort in algorithmic mechanism design. Traditional scoring rules often fail to coordinate effort efficiently across tasks, leading to suboptimal outcomes. We introduce a novel framework that characterizes optimal scoring rules under general cost structures and propose two analytically tractable families of rulesâ€”linear threshold and separable exponential mechanisms. Through a rigorous theoretical analysis, we prove these mechanisms achieve constant-factor approximations to the optimal welfare, independent of the problem dimension. Our results demonstrate robustness against strategic manipulation while maintaining computational tractability, bridging gaps between approximation algorithms and incentive compatibility. This research advances the design of performant mechanisms for complex, multi-task environments prevalent in crowdsourcing and decentralized systems.
