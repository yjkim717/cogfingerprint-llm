**Abstract**

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for dynamic quadrupedal platforms. This paper details the development and implementation of A1 SLAM, an open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) package designed for real-time SLAM on the Unitree A1 quadruped robot. Leveraging onboard LiDAR data, A1 SLAM employs a factor graph optimization framework to achieve robust pose estimation and map construction. The system’s core innovation lies in its efficient integration of LiDAR odometry with the factor graph, mitigating the drift inherent in traditional visual SLAM approaches when relying solely on onboard sensors.  The package facilitates autonomous navigation and mapping capabilities for the A1, addressing a key limitation of existing quadrupedal SLAM solutions.  Preliminary results demonstrate the package’s efficacy in achieving accurate and consistent localization and mapping in complex, dynamic environments. Further research will focus on enhancing robustness and incorporating sensor fusion strategies.
