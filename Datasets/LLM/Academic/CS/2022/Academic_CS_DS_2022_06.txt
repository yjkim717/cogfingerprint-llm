This study investigates the dynamic interplay between operational risk, market competition, and technical efficiency in the commercial banking sector of an emerging South Asian economy, with particular emphasis on the moderating role of ownership structure. Using a panel dataset spanning 2018â€“2022, we employ a two-stage analytical framework. First, we estimate bank-level efficiency scores using Data Envelopment Analysis. Second, we utilize a system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator to analyze the determinants of efficiency, controlling for endogeneity. Our findings reveal that heightened market competition exerts a significant, yet non-linear, influence on efficiency. Furthermore, the impact of operational risk on performance is found to be conditional on a bank's ownership type. State-owned banks exhibit a distinct risk-efficiency profile compared to their private and foreign counterparts. The results underscore that ownership structure is a critical moderator, shaping how competitive pressures and risk exposures translate into operational efficiency. This research contributes to the ongoing policy discourse on banking sector reform and governance by highlighting the need for ownership-specific regulatory and strategic approaches to foster stability and performance.
