Title: Evaluating Machine Learning Techniques for IoT-Enabled Smart Irrigation Systems: A Soil Moisture Classification Approach

Abstract:
The increasing adoption of IoT devices in agricultural settings has led to the development of smart irrigation systems that optimize water usage. In this context, machine learning techniques can be leveraged to analyze data from IoT sensors and improve irrigation decision-making. This study evaluates the efficacy of various machine learning algorithms in classifying soil moisture levels using data from IoT-enabled smart irrigation systems. We employed a dataset comprising soil moisture readings, weather data, and irrigation schedules collected from a network of IoT devices. Our results show that the Random Forest classifier outperformed other algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 92.5% in classifying soil moisture levels. The proposed approach demonstrates the potential of machine learning in enhancing the efficiency of smart irrigation systems. The findings of this research can inform the development of more accurate and reliable smart irrigation systems, contributing to water conservation and improved crop yields.
