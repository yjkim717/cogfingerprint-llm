**Abstract**

Systematic generalization – the ability of a model to extrapolate learned knowledge to novel combinations of observed features – remains a critical challenge in neural network research, particularly within the paradigm of grounded language learning. While data augmentation techniques are frequently employed to enhance model robustness and generalization, their efficacy in promoting systematic generalization capabilities remains an open question. This work investigates the interplay between modular network architectures and data augmentation strategies in fostering systematic generalization in a controlled experimental setting. We hypothesize that modularity, by explicitly encouraging compositional representations, can mitigate the limitations of data augmentation alone.  Our experiments, conducted using neural networks trained on symbolic relational data, demonstrate that despite employing substantial data augmentation—including variations in object positions, attributes, and relational operators—achieving robust systematic generalization proves surprisingly difficult. While modular architectures show a marginal improvement over monolithic networks, the degree of generalization remains significantly constrained by the underlying dataset and training regime. These findings suggest that solely relying on data augmentation to induce systematic generalization is insufficient, and further research is needed to explore architectures and training methodologies that explicitly incentivize compositional reasoning and disentangled feature representations.  We conclude by discussing potential avenues for future investigation, including incorporating explicit inductive biases and exploring alternative grounding frameworks.
