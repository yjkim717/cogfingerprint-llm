**Abstract**

The increasing reliance on machine learning models necessitates robust evaluation methodologies, particularly as model complexity grows. This work presents a theoretical framework for analyzing dynamic benchmarks – datasets designed to evolve and challenge model performance over time – addressing critical limitations currently encountered in traditional evaluation paradigms. We investigate the interplay between benchmark dynamism, model fitting strategies, and the inherent challenges posed by label noise. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate how adaptive model training can initially improve performance on evolving benchmarks, yet subsequently reveal vulnerabilities stemming from overfitting to transient shifts.  A key theoretical contribution lies in quantifying the trade-off between benchmark diversity and model generalization.  Furthermore, we explore the impact of varying levels of label noise on the stability of performance metrics, suggesting a non-linear relationship.  Future research will focus on developing automated data collection protocols to generate truly representative dynamic benchmarks and refine theoretical bounds on their effectiveness.
