**Abstract**

Contemporary machine learning systems increasingly rely on benchmark-driven evaluation to track progress. However, the static nature of most benchmarks presents a fundamental limitation, as rapid model saturation can create a false ceiling on performance and obscure genuine algorithmic advances. This paper investigates the paradigm of dynamic benchmarking, wherein evaluation suites evolve in response to model improvements. We formalize a theoretical framework that models this co-evolution as a coupled system, analyzing the conditions under which performance plateaus emerge. A key finding is that simple iterative updates are susceptible to rapidly diminishing returns, often exacerbated by propagating label noise from earlier data collection cycles. To address this, we propose a hierarchically structured benchmark design that introduces controlled, compositional complexity. While this approach increases the computational cost of evaluation, our analysis demonstrates that it provides a more reliable and scalable pathway for measuring true capability growth, preventing premature stagnation and fostering more meaningful progress in the field. This work underscores the necessity of adaptive evaluation methodologies to keep pace with the systems they are designed to measure.
