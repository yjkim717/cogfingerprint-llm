**Abstract:**

This work establishes a key equivalence between online learnability and private PAC learnability for binary classification tasks, subject to a bounded Littlestone dimension. Leveraging recent advances in differential privacy, we demonstrate that achieving online convergence—a hallmark of efficient learning algorithms—is fundamentally linked to the preservation of private information.  Our analysis provides a theoretical framework for understanding the trade-offs between data utility and privacy guarantees, offering novel insights into the design of robust and adaptable learning systems within constrained environments.
