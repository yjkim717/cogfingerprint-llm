Title: Fourier Adversarial Networks for Enhanced Image Signal Processing under Dynamic Illumination

Abstract:
In 2022, the proliferation of camera-enabled devices has underscored the need for robust image signal processing (ISP) techniques capable of handling diverse illumination conditions. This paper presents a novel, lightweight HDR camera ISP leveraging Fourier adversarial networks to enhance image quality under dynamic illumination. By integrating the principles of convolutional neural networks and Fourier transform, our proposed framework effectively mitigates the limitations of traditional ISP methods. The Fourier adversarial networks facilitate the generation of high-quality images by learning the frequency-domain representations of images under varying illumination conditions. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in image enhancement, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The proposed ISP framework is poised to enhance the performance of camera systems in real-world applications, where dynamic illumination is a pervasive challenge.
