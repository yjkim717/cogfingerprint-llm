**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of deep learning increasingly relies on benchmark datasets to evaluate model generalization and facilitate progress. However, existing benchmarks often exhibit static characteristics, failing to adequately capture the complexities of real-world deployment. This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for analyzing *dynamic benchmarks*, characterized by evolving data distributions and inherent label noise. We investigate the challenges posed by these benchmarks, specifically focusing on the phenomenon of sequential model fitting – where models adapt to the observed data sequence, potentially leading to spurious correlations and diminished performance on unseen data. 

Our analysis leverages theoretical considerations of Bayesian model fitting and information-theoretic principles to quantify the impact of label noise on benchmark utility. We demonstrate that traditional evaluation metrics may be insufficient for assessing models’ robustness within dynamic benchmark settings. Furthermore, we propose preliminary considerations for data collection strategies aimed at mitigating these issues, emphasizing the need for temporally informed evaluation methodologies.  Future work will explore practical implementations and extensions of this framework to diverse application domains, ultimately contributing to more reliable and representative model assessment in 2022 and beyond.
