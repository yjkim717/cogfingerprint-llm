**Abstract**

The proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust and scalable collision avoidance systems capable of handling complex, multi-agent scenarios. While traditional model-based control strategies offer proven stability, they often struggle with the high-dimensional state spaces and unpredictable interactions inherent in dense traffic flows. This paper addresses this critical challenge by proposing a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework specifically designed for chain collision avoidance in autonomous vehicle platoons. Our approach leverages a sophisticated actor-critic architecture, which enables the learning of optimal evasive policies directly from sensory input and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication data, without relying on pre-defined kinematic models. The policy network (actor) is trained to map states to continuous control actions, while the value network (critic) assesses the long-term reward of those actions, facilitating stable and efficient learning. We conduct a comprehensive safety efficiency analysis to quantitatively evaluate the proposed strategy. The evaluation is performed across two distinct environments: a single-agent setting, which establishes a performance baseline for fundamental obstacle avoidance, and a more complex multi-agent simulation that models a platoon of AVs reacting to a critical event. Metrics including collision rate, minimum time-to-collision (TTC), and overall traffic flow disruption are rigorously analyzed. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed DRL agent significantly outperforms baseline reactive controllers, achieving a higher success rate in preventing primary and secondary collisions while maintaining smoother deceleration profiles. This work substantiates the potential of actor-critic-based DRL as a foundational technology for enhancing the safety and resilience of next-generation autonomous transportation systems.
