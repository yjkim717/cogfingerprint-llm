**Abstract**

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a critical challenge for autonomous mobile robotics, particularly in dynamically unstable environments. This paper presents A1 SLAM, a novel, open-source Robot Operating System (ROS) package designed for real-time pose estimation and mapping on the Unitree A1 quadruped robot.  A1 SLAM utilizes a factor graph optimization framework to integrate data from onboard inertial measurement units (IMUs) and visual odometry, addressing the limitations of relying solely on wheel encoders.  The system implements a robust pose slam algorithm, employing extended Kalman filtering for state estimation and iteratively refining the map through factor graph refinement.  Specifically, the implementation focuses on mitigating the inherent challenges of quadruped locomotion, including step disturbances and uneven terrain. Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of A1 SLAM for achieving accurate and consistent localization within a controlled environment, paving the way for future research into robust navigation and adaptive control for quadrupedal robots.
