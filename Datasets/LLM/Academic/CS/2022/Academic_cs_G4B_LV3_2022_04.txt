**Abstract**

This research investigates the design of algorithmic mechanism design strategies for incentivizing agent behavior exhibiting multi-dimensional effort.  We introduce a novel framework leveraging scoring rules to achieve optimal motivation, drawing parallels to the classical knapsack problem to model resource allocation complexities. Specifically, we propose and evaluate two scoring rules – truncated separate and threshold scoring – demonstrating their efficacy in eliciting desired effort profiles.  These rules are designed to overcome limitations inherent in traditional reward structures, particularly when agents engage in heterogeneous and interwoven exertion.  Preliminary analysis suggests significant improvements in agent performance compared to baseline approaches.  The resultant methodology offers a pragmatic and adaptable solution for deployment within classroom settings, facilitating enhanced learning outcomes through targeted incentive design and representing a valuable contribution to the field of educational technology in 2022.
