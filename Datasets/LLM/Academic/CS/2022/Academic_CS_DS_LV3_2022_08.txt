This paper presents A1 SLAM, an open-source ROS-based framework for real-time, high-performance simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) on the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot. Leveraging onboard sensing, our approach centers on a sliding-window LiDAR odometry module integrated within a factor graph optimization backend. This architecture enables robust state estimation by efficiently marginalizing out past poses while incorporating new LiDAR scans and inertial data. In 2022 evaluations, A1 SLAM demonstrated superior accuracy and computational efficiency in dynamic environments compared to established benchmarks, including Google's Cartographer. The system's modular design and public availability facilitate further research in legged robot navigation, providing a critical tool for deploying quadrupeds in complex, GPS-denied scenarios where precise, real-time environmental understanding is paramount.
