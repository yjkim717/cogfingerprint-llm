This paper presents A1 SLAM, an open-source ROS-based framework for real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) tailored for the Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot. The system leverages onboard sensing, primarily lidar odometry, to construct a consistent environmental model while estimating the robot's trajectory. A central contribution is the formulation of the SLAM problem within a factor graph optimization framework, which efficiently integrates multiple sensor constraints and loop closures for robust pose estimation. By explicitly modeling these probabilistic constraints, the method mitigates drift and enhances localization accuracy in complex, unstructured environments. The 2022 release of this system provides a valuable, fully integrated tool for the robotics community, facilitating further research in legged locomotion and autonomous navigation. Experimental validation demonstrates its efficacy in providing reliable, real-time state estimation for dynamic quadrupedal platforms.
