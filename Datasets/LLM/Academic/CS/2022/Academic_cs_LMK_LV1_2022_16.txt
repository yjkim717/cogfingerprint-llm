This paper presents KreolMorisienMT, a novel dataset for Mauritian Creole machine translation, addressing the language's underrepresentation in NLP. Leveraging pre-trained models and multilingual transfer learning, we benchmark various translation models on KreolMorisienMT. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of fine-tuning multilingual models, such as mBART and M2M-100, on this dataset, yielding significant improvements in translation quality. The KreolMorisienMT dataset and benchmarking framework establish a foundation for future research in Mauritian Creole NLP, promoting linguistic diversity and inclusivity in machine translation systems, as of 2022.
