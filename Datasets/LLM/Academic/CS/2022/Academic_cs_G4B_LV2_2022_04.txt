**Abstract**

This research introduces a novel framework for designing scoring rules within algorithmic mechanism design, addressing the challenge of incentivizing multi-dimensional effort expenditure by strategic agents.  Traditional mechanisms often fail to account for the complex, heterogeneous nature of effort, necessitating a generalized approach. We formalize this problem as an extension of the knapsack problem, recognizing that agents possess varying capacities and preferences across multiple dimensions of activity.  The core contribution lies in the development of scoring rules—mechanisms that optimally align agent incentives with desired outcomes—constructed through a rigorous application of mechanism design principles. 

Our methodology leverages constraints imposed by strategic behavior, accounting for agents’ awareness of the scoring rule’s structure and their potential to optimize effort allocation.  We demonstrate the applicability of this framework through theoretical analysis, highlighting its potential to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of resource allocation systems.  Future work will explore the implementation of these rules in simulated environments and investigate their robustness across diverse agent populations and effort dimensions.
