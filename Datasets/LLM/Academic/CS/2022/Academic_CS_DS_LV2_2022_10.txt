This paper introduces a novel data augmentation framework for image classification that leverages conformal mappings, specifically MÃ¶bius transformations, to generate geometrically consistent training samples. Unlike conventional augmentation techniques such as rotation or scaling, which can distort local pixel relationships, our method preserves intrinsic image structures and angular relationships through its conformal property. We hypothesize that this preservation of geometric information provides a more principled expansion of the training manifold. A series of experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained with our conformal augmentation protocol achieve a statistically significant improvement in prediction accuracy over models trained with standard augmentation methods. These findings, established in 2022, suggest that incorporating geometric invariance directly into the augmentation process is a powerful paradigm for enhancing model generalization and data efficiency in visual recognition tasks.
