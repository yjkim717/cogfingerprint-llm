**Abstract**

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a critical challenge for mobile robotics, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper details the implementation of the A1 SLAM package, an open-source Software Robotics Operating System (ROS) solution, specifically tailored for the Unitree A1 quadruped robot. Utilizing the A1’s integrated inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual sensor data, the system achieves real-time SLAM performance.  A key architectural element is the deployment of a factor graph optimization framework, enabling robust pose estimation and map maintenance.  The factor graph facilitates efficient bundle adjustment, mitigating drift and improving map accuracy.  Preliminary results demonstrate the A1 SLAM package’s efficacy in navigating complex terrains, showcasing its potential for applications requiring autonomous mobility and environmental perception. Further research will focus on incorporating loop closure detection and adaptive obstacle avoidance.
