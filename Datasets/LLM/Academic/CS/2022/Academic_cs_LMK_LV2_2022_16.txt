This paper presents KreolMorisienMT, a novel dataset for Mauritian Creole machine translation. Leveraging pre-trained models and multilingual transfer learning, we benchmark various translation models to establish a robust baseline for Kreol Morisien, a low-resource language. Our approach exploits the efficacy of transfer learning to adapt to the linguistic nuances of Mauritian Creole. The results demonstrate significant improvements in translation accuracy, underscoring the potential of multilingual transfer learning for natural language processing tasks in low-resource settings. This work contributes to the advancement of machine translation for Mauritian Creole, paving the way for future research in this domain (2022).
