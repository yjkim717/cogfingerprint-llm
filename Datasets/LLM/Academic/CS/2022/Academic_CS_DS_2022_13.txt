**Abstract**  
The proliferation of deep learning in side-channel analysis has introduced powerful methodologies for profiling attacks, yet the role of feature selection in mitigating the effects of masking countermeasures remains underexplored. This study addresses the challenge of optimizing feature subsets to enhance the efficiency and success rates of deep neural network (DNN)-based attacks on masked AES-128 implementations. We propose a hybrid framework that integrates mutual information-based feature ranking with recursive elimination techniques to identify and retain the most informative segments of power traces, thereby reducing dimensionality and computational overhead without sacrificing discriminative capacity.  

Our experiments evaluate the framework on publicly available datasets featuring first- and second-order masking schemes, under varying signal-to-noise conditions. Results demonstrate that targeted feature selection not only accelerates model convergence by up to 40% but also improves key recovery accuracy by isolating leakage points resilient to masking. Furthermore, we analyze the interaction between selected features and DNN architectures, revealing that simpler models, when coupled with optimized inputs, can outperform complex networks trained on raw traces.  

These findings underscore the critical importance of preprocessing in deep learning-driven side-channel analysis and offer a scalable approach for deploying such attacks in constrained environments. The proposed methodology achieves an average key rank reduction of 85% across tested scenarios, affirming its practical utility in evaluating cryptographic implementations against profiling threats. This work contributes to the broader discourse on balancing model complexity and data efficiency in applied cybersecurity.
