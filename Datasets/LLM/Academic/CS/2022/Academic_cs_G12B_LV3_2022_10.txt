**Abstract**

This paper presents a novel image augmentation strategy designed to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Addressing limitations of traditional augmentation techniques, our approach leverages conformal mappings, specifically MÃ¶bius transformations, to systematically distort and restore square image inputs. Images are first mapped onto a circular disk, allowing for arbitrary rotations, and subsequently remapped to the original square domain. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that this conformal augmentation method preserves crucial image information while demonstrably improving CNN prediction accuracy across diverse datasets. Results indicate a significant performance gain compared to standard augmentation protocols, suggesting a promising avenue for improving deep learning model reliability in image recognition tasks.
