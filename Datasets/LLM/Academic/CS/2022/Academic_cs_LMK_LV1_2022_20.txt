Title: Enhancing Cellular Segmentation with Human-Centered Specialist Models: A Cellpose 2.0 Paradigm

Abstract:
Cellular segmentation is a critical task in biomedical image analysis, requiring precise delineation of cell boundaries. While deep learning-based methods have shown promise, their performance is often limited by the availability of annotated training data. To address this challenge, we present a human-in-the-loop framework, leveraging the capabilities of Cellpose 2.0, a state-of-the-art cellular segmentation algorithm. Our approach enables rapid prototyping of specialist models, tailored to specific imaging modalities and cell types, using minimal user-annotated data. By integrating human expertise with iterative model refinement, we demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness. The proposed pipeline facilitates efficient model adaptation, reducing the need for extensive retraining and annotation efforts. Our results highlight the potential of human-centered specialist models for advancing cellular segmentation, with implications for a wide range of biomedical applications, from cancer research to neuroscience. By bridging the gap between human expertise and AI-driven analysis, we pave the way for more accurate and efficient image segmentation in 2022 and beyond.
