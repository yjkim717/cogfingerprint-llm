**Abstract**

Precision agriculture increasingly relies on Internet of Things (IoT) sensor networks to monitor environmental conditions, presenting significant opportunities for optimized resource management. This research investigates the application of machine learning algorithms to enhance the predictive capabilities of IoT-enabled irrigation systems. Specifically, we propose a classification framework utilizing data streams from soil moisture sensors integrated within an IoT infrastructure. The system’s core functionality centres on leveraging supervised learning techniques – including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests – to classify soil moisture levels based on historical data and real-time sensor readings.  A key objective is to move beyond simple threshold-based irrigation control towards proactive water management.  The classification model’s accuracy is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score against a ground truth dataset. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential for improved irrigation scheduling and reduced water consumption, suggesting a viable pathway for intelligent, data-driven agricultural practices in 2022 and beyond. Further research will explore incorporating temporal dependencies and adaptive learning strategies.
