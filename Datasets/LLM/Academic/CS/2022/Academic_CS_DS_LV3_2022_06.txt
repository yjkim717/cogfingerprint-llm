In 2022, the computational finance field increasingly scrutinized algorithmic efficiency and systemic risk within digital banking architectures. This study investigates how ownership structures—specifically, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) versus traditional corporate governance—modulate the interplay between market competition and operational efficiency in blockchain-based financial systems. Employing two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators on high-frequency transaction data, we quantify nonlinear relationships between cryptographic risk exposure and computational resource allocation. Our findings reveal distinct efficiency paradigms: DAO-owned protocols demonstrate superior cost efficiency under competitive pressure yet exhibit heightened sensitivity to consensus mechanism vulnerabilities, while corporate-governed systems prioritize human capital efficiency at the expense of transactional agility. These divergences underscore how cryptographic primitives and governance models collectively shape automated market makers' resilience. The research establishes a computational framework for optimizing ownership-aware risk management in decentralized finance, highlighting critical trade-offs between Byzantine fault tolerance and capital allocation efficiency in increasingly adversarial market environments.
