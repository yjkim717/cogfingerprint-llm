**Abstract**

Despite significant advances in neural network architectures, achieving robust systematic generalization—the ability to reliably extrapolate to unseen, yet structurally similar, data distributions—remains a persistent challenge. This work investigates the interplay between modular network design and data augmentation techniques in mitigating this limitation. We hypothesize that decoupling network components via modularity can enhance learning efficiency, while strategically applied data augmentation can provide richer, more diverse training signals.  Experimental results, conducted on a benchmark dataset utilizing convolutional neural networks, demonstrate that while augmenting training data demonstrably improves performance on the observed distribution, systematic generalization capabilities plateau even with substantial augmentation.  The findings suggest that architectural modularity alone does not sufficiently address the underlying difficulties in propagating learned representations, necessitating further research into techniques that explicitly promote structural invariance during training.
