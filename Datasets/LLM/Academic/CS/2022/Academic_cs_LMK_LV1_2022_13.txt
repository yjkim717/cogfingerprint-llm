Title: Enhancing Systematic Generalization in Grounded Language Learning through Modularity and Data Augmentation

Abstract:
Systematic generalization, the ability of neural networks to understand and generate novel compositions of known elements, remains a significant challenge in grounded language learning. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of modularity and data augmentation in improving neural network performance. This paper investigates the impact of these two factors on systematic generalization in neural networks for grounded language learning. We propose a modular neural network architecture that decomposes the task into separate modules for object recognition, action understanding, and language processing. We also employ a data augmentation technique that generates novel compositions of known objects and actions. Our results show that both modularity and data augmentation significantly improve systematic generalization, with the combined approach achieving state-of-the-art performance on a benchmark dataset. Our findings have implications for the development of more robust and generalizable language learning systems, and highlight the potential of modular and data-augmented approaches for improving systematic generalization in grounded language learning tasks.
