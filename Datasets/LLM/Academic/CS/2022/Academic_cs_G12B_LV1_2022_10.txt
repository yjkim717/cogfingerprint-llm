**Abstract**

The performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remains critically dependent on the quantity and diversity of training data. While standard data augmentation techniques address this limitation, they often introduce artifacts or distortions that can inadvertently degrade model generalization. This paper proposes a novel data augmentation strategy leveraging conformal mappings, specifically Möbius transformations, to generate synthetic training examples. Unlike traditional methods relying on geometric or color space manipulations, our approach preserves fundamental image characteristics – area, angles, and relative distances – thereby preventing information loss and mitigating the risk of introducing spurious correlations. We demonstrate the efficacy of Conformal Image Augmentation (CIA) through extensive experimentation on benchmark image classification datasets. Results indicate a statistically significant reduction in classification error across various CNN architectures compared to baseline augmentation techniques (e.g., random rotations, translations, and scaling). Furthermore, an ablation study confirms the contribution of Möbius transformations to the observed performance gains.  Our findings suggest that CIA offers a promising avenue for enhancing CNN robustness and accuracy while maintaining data fidelity, representing a potentially valuable tool for resource-constrained training scenarios.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **CS Field Focus:** The language and terminology are geared toward a computer science audience, specifically those working with machine learning and computer vision.
*   **Formal Tone:** I used formal language (e.g., "demonstrate the efficacy," "statistical significance," "mitigating the risk") and avoided colloquialisms.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical progression:
    *   **Problem Statement:** The reliance on data and limitations of existing augmentation.
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Introduction of CIA and conformal mappings (Möbius transformations).
    *   **Key Feature:** Preservation of image characteristics and prevention of information loss.
    *   **Experimental Results:** Statistically significant error reduction and ablation study.
    *   **Conclusion/Implications:** Potential for robustness, accuracy, and resource-constrained settings.
*   **Year Context (2022):**  The language reflects current trends in the field – focusing on generalization, robustness, and the challenges of limited data.  The mention of "benchmark datasets" is standard.
*   **"CIA" Acronym:** I introduced an acronym (Conformal Image Augmentation) to make the text more concise and readable.
*   **Word Count:**  I aimed for the ~188 word target.
*   **Precise Terminology:**  I used terms like "Möbius transformations," "statistical significance," "ablation study," and "spurious correlations" to demonstrate technical rigor.
