**Abstract**

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are a cornerstone of probabilistic graphical models for structured prediction in computer vision, particularly in semantic segmentation. While dense CRFs model rich, long-range pairwise potentials for high-quality results, their computational cost is often prohibitive for practical applications. Conversely, sparse CRFs offer efficiency but are typically limited to local neighborhoods, sacrificing modeling generality. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce a novel Sparse Non-Local CRF model. Our approach strategically retains the computational efficiency of sparse graph structures by selectively incorporating a subset of high-value, long-range connections inspired by the non-local means principle. This synthesis enables the capture of complex, global contextual dependencies—characteristic of dense models—while maintaining the tractable inference of sparse frameworks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model on standard segmentation benchmarks, where it achieves a superior balance between accuracy and computational expense. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for efficient and powerful structured prediction, effectively unifying the strengths of two previously disparate CRF classes.
