**KreolMorisienMT: A Resource for Machine Translation of Mauritian Creole via Transfer Learning**

The limited availability of linguistic resources for low-resource languages presents a significant challenge to the advancement of machine translation (MT). This paper introduces KreolMorisienMT, a novel dataset specifically designed to facilitate and benchmark MT research for Mauritian Creole. The dataset comprises a newly constructed parallel corpus, aligning Mauritian Creole with English, alongside a substantial monolingual corpus of Creole text. We investigate the efficacy of transfer learning approaches, leveraging pre-trained multilingual models to initialize translation systems. Our initial experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on KreolMorisienMT yields promising translation performance, exceeding baseline results. This work underscores the potential of transfer learning techniques for bridging the resource gap in MT for under-represented languages like Mauritian Creole and provides a valuable benchmark dataset for future research in this area. Further investigation into model architectures and training strategies is warranted to fully exploit the capabilities of KreolMorisienMT.
