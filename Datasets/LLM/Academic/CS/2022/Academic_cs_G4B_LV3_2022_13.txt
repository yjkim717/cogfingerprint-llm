**Abstract**

Recent advancements in neural network architectures have highlighted persistent challenges in systematic generalization – the network’s ability to perform reliably on unseen combinations of learned concepts. This study addresses this limitation by exploring the synergistic effects of modularity and data augmentation techniques. We hypothesize that while data augmentation can temporarily boost performance on training data, it alone fails to foster robust generalization. Our experimental results, conducted across a diverse suite of synthetic datasets, demonstrate that modular network designs, characterized by distinct, specialized modules, are fundamentally necessary. Specifically, we observed that augmenting training data within a modular framework consistently yields superior performance compared to augmentation applied to monolithic networks. These findings suggest a critical shift in neural network design, advocating for architectures that promote explicit modularity to facilitate genuine systematic generalization capabilities – a key requirement for deploying reliable AI systems in complex, dynamic environments.
