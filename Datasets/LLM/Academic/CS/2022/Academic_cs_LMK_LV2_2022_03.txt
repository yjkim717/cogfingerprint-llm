Title: A Revenue Benchmark for Multi-Item Mechanisms with Buy-Many Constraints

Abstract:
We introduce a novel revenue benchmark for multi-item mechanisms catering to unit-demand buyers, addressing the complexities of buy-many constraints. In the presence of multiple buyers, designing mechanisms that maximize revenue while ensuring incentive compatibility and individual rationality is a challenging task. Our proposed benchmark provides a tractable and meaningful standard for evaluating the performance of multi-item mechanisms. We demonstrate that a simple sequential item pricing mechanism achieves an $O(\log m)$ approximation to this benchmark, where $m$ denotes the number of items. This result underscores the efficacy of straightforward pricing strategies in multi-item settings with buy-many constraints. Our findings contribute to the growing literature on mechanism design, offering insights into the development of efficient and revenue-optimal mechanisms for complex market environments. By establishing a robust revenue benchmark, our work paves the way for further research in this domain.
