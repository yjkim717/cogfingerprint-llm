Title: Enhancing SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization in Multiple Myeloma Patients through Booster Vaccination: A Quantitative Analysis

Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the vulnerability of immunocompromised populations, particularly patients with multiple myeloma (MM). As of 2022, research has focused on optimizing vaccination strategies for this cohort. This study investigates the immunogenicity of a second booster dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in 201 MM patients. Our results demonstrate a significant enhancement in humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 following the booster dose, as measured by SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers. Notably, patients undergoing anti-BCMA therapy exhibited a diminished response, highlighting the need for tailored vaccination approaches in this subgroup. The findings support the use of booster vaccination as an effective strategy to bolster immunity in MM patients, with implications for informing clinical practice and immunization policies. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying vaccine responsiveness in this population.
