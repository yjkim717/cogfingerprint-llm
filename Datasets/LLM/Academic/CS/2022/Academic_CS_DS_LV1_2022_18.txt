**Title:** A Computational Framework for Modeling Adaptive Boosting in Dynamic, Resource-Constrained Systems

**Abstract:**

In distributed computing environments, the performance of individual nodes can be critically degraded by adversarial conditions, such as intensive background workloads or targeted resource exhaustion attacks. This degradation compromises the overall system's integrity and its ability to fulfill service-level agreements. Analogous to the concept of immunological boosting in biological systems, we propose a novel computational framework for *adaptive system boosting*. This framework intelligently deploys supplemental computational resources to compromised nodes to restore their operational baseline. We model the system as a graph where nodes possess a *resilience signature*, a multi-dimensional feature vector encoding their current workload, security posture, and historical performance. Our core contribution is a reinforcement learning-based scheduler that determines the optimal allocation of booster resources. We evaluated our model on a simulated edge computing cluster under a sustained adversarial load. Results demonstrate that a single, strategically timed booster intervention successfully restored performance metrics in 92% of affected nodes. However, a critical subset of nodes (8%), those subjected to a simulated "anti-BCMA-analogous" attack that persistently targets and corrupts their core scheduling logic, exhibited minimal response to the booster. This bifurcated outcome highlights a fundamental limitation: external resource augmentation is ineffective when the node's core decision-making apparatus is fundamentally compromised. This research provides a formal model for proactive system resilience and delineates the boundary conditions for remediation via external resource allocation, with significant implications for fault tolerance and security in autonomous distributed systems.
