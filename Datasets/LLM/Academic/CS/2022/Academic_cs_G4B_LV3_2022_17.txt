**Abstract**

The increasing demand for sustainable agricultural practices necessitates intelligent water management solutions. This research explores the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) data and advanced machine learning algorithms to optimize irrigation strategies. Utilizing data streams from smart irrigation systems – encompassing soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant health metrics – we investigated the efficacy of various classification models. Specifically, logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, and convolutional neural networks were evaluated for their predictive capabilities in forecasting soil moisture content. The study’s findings demonstrate the potential of these techniques to enhance agricultural water efficiency. Preliminary results indicate that random forest models exhibited superior performance in accurately classifying soil moisture conditions, suggesting a viable pathway for automated irrigation control. Further research will focus on incorporating temporal dependencies and expanding the dataset to improve model robustness and scalability for real-world deployment.
