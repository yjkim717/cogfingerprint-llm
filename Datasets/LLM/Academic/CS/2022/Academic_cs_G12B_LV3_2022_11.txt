**Abstract**

Recent advances in structured prediction have explored various Conditional Random Field (CRF) formulations to enhance modeling capabilities. While sparse CRFs offer computational efficiency, they often struggle to capture long-range dependencies inherent in complex data. Conversely, dense CRFs, though capable of modeling non-local interactions, suffer from scalability limitations. This paper presents a novel Sparse Non-Local CRF (SNLC-CRF) architecture designed to bridge this gap. Our model integrates sparse parameterization techniques with a non-local interaction layer, effectively balancing computational tractability and representational power. We demonstrate that SNLC-CRFs leverage both local context and wider, non-local dependencies to improve segmentation performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant gains over existing sparse and dense CRF approaches, highlighting the efficacy of our hybrid architecture for tasks requiring both efficiency and nuanced contextual understanding.
