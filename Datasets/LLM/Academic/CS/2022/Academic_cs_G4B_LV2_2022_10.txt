**Abstract**

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently benefit from increased training data; however, traditional data augmentation techniques can introduce artificial distortions. This research presents a novel image augmentation methodology leveraging conformal mappings, specifically Möbius transformations, to mitigate these issues.  We hypothesize that conformal transformations preserve geometric relationships within images, thereby minimizing information loss during augmentation.  Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating these transformations—a form of sophisticated data augmentation—significantly improves CNN performance on [mention specific dataset/task if available from the original text – e.g., object recognition tasks].  Further investigation explores the optimal parameters for Möbius transformations and their integration within a standard CNN training pipeline, contributing to more robust and generalized model architectures.
