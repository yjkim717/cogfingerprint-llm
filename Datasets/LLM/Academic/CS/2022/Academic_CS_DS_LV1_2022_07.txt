This paper establishes a fundamental equivalence between differentially private PAC learnability and online learnability in 2022. We prove that a concept class admits private PAC learning precisely when its Littlestone dimension is finite, thereby unifying these learning frameworks. Our characterization demonstrates that private learnability imposes no computational requirements beyond those of online learning, resolving a longstanding open problem.
