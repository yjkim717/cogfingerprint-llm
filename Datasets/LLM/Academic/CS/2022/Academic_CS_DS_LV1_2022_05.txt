**Abstract**

The proliferation of sequential model fitting on dynamically updated benchmarks presents a critical, yet understudied, challenge: performance stagnation due to escalating label noise and cumulative overfitting. Conventional static evaluation fails to capture the temporal degradation inherent in these environments. This paper introduces a formal framework for dynamic benchmarking, analyzing performance trajectories under iterative data collection regimes. We theoretically demonstrate that while sequential learning on monolithic benchmarks leads to rapidly diminishing returns, a structured, hierarchical dependency between model updates and benchmark revisions can counteract this trend. Our analysis shows that hierarchical designs, which enforce a dependency of new data on the failure modes of previous models, induce a more robust learning signal. This structure effectively mitigates the propagation of label noise and promotes generalization, even as system complexity increases. Empirical validation on large-scale vision and language tasks confirms that our hierarchical approach sustains performance growth over multiple iterations, significantly outperforming sequential baselines and providing a principled path for continuous model development.
