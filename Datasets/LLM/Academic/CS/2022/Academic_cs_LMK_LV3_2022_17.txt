Title: Enhancing Agricultural Productivity through IoT-Enabled Smart Irrigation and Machine Learning

Abstract:

The increasing adoption of IoT-enabled smart irrigation systems has generated vast amounts of agricultural data, necessitating the development of effective data analysis techniques. This study investigates the application of machine learning techniques to classify soil moisture levels using data collected from IoT-enabled smart irrigation systems. We evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including random forest, decision trees, and support vector machines, in accurately classifying soil moisture levels. Our results show that random forest achieves the highest classification accuracy, outperforming other algorithms. The findings of this research have significant implications for precision agriculture, enabling farmers to optimize irrigation management and reduce water waste. By leveraging IoT-enabled smart irrigation and machine learning techniques, agricultural productivity can be enhanced while minimizing environmental impact. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating IoT and machine learning in agriculture, paving the way for future research in this area. (2022)
