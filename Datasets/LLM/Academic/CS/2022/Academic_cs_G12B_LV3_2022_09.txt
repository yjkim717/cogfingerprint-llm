This 2022 study investigates the interplay of technology leadership, professional development, and teacher technology integration within the context of Palestinian public schools in the West Bank. Employing quantitative analysis, including structural equation modeling with SmartPLS, we assessed the relationships between these constructs. Results demonstrate a statistically significant and positive correlation between technology leadership facets and both professional development initiatives and the degree of teacher technology integration. The findings suggest that robust technology leadership and targeted professional development are crucial for fostering effective technology adoption in educational settings.
