**Abstract**

Recent advances in computer vision have been dominated by the paradigm shift towards Vision Transformers (ViTs), which leverage self-attention mechanisms over patch embeddings to model long-range dependencies in image data. However, the architectural complexity and substantial computational demands of ViTs have prompted a re-evaluation of simpler, more efficient inductive biases. This paper investigates the performance of the ConvMixer architecture, a model constructed exclusively from standard convolutional operations and patch-based input representations. Through rigorous empirical evaluation on standardized image classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that ConvMixer achieves superior accuracy compared to both canonical ViT models and well-established deep Residual Networks (ResNets), despite its conceptual and computational simplicity. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that the performance gains of ViTs are primarily attributable to their self-attention modules. Instead, we posit that the critical factor is the patch representation strategy, which enables more effective spatial feature extraction at the initial processing stage. This work underscores the enduring efficacy of convolutional networks when combined with modern design principles and suggests that the patch embedding layer is a significant, yet under-explored, contributor to state-of-the-art performance. The results advocate for a renewed focus on hybrid architectures that integrate the strengths of both convolutional and patch-based processing for efficient and scalable visual recognition.
