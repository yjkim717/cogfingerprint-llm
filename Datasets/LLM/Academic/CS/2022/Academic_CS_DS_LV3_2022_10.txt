In 2022, Rainio’s research introduced a novel image augmentation framework grounded in conformal mapping theory to address data loss prevention in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Conventional augmentation techniques often distort critical spatial relationships, leading to irreversible information degradation. By leveraging Möbius transformations and disk rotations, the proposed method applies complex plane mappings that preserve angles and local structures, thereby maintaining the integrity of essential image features. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this approach substantially reduces prediction errors in CNNs compared to traditional affine or noise-based augmentations. The findings underscore the potential of geometric invariance in enhancing model robustness, particularly in data-scarce domains. This work bridges complex analysis and machine learning, offering a mathematically rigorous pathway to improve generalization while preventing irreversible data loss during preprocessing.
