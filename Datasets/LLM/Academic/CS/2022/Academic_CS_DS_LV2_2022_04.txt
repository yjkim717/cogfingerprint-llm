This paper addresses the challenge of designing optimal scoring rules for strategic agents exerting multi-dimensional effort. We develop a mechanism design framework where a principal seeks to incentivize effort across multiple tasks, accounting for the agent's private cost structure. Our main contribution is the identification of two simple, efficiently computable families of scoring rules that guarantee constant-factor approximations to the first-best outcome. Through a novel analysis of the agent's best-response behavior, we establish approximation bounds that hold under general convex cost functions. We further demonstrate that these rules are robust to uncertainty in the agent's type distribution and can be implemented with minimal informational requirements. Our results provide practical, theoretically-grounded solutions for multi-task incentive problems in computational systems and algorithmic management.
