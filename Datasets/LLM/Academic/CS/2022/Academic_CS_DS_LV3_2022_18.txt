**Abstract**

The year 2022 witnessed the maturation of computational immunology as a critical discipline for optimizing public health interventions. This study investigates the application of machine learning (ML) and mechanistic modeling to predict and analyze the heterogeneous humoral immune response to mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, such as BNT162b2, within clinically vulnerable cohorts. We posit that patient-specific factors, particularly underlying hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma, create a complex immunological landscape that standard vaccination protocols fail to address uniformly. Our computational framework integrates high-dimensional clinical data, including treatment histories with targeted therapies analogous to anti-BCMA regimens, with longitudinal serological data to model the dynamics of neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers. We demonstrate that a second booster dose serves as a critical algorithmic intervention, significantly recalibrating the immune response trajectory and restoring protective nAb levels in a majority of patients. However, our models identify a persistent, high-dimensional barrier to seroconversion associated with specific immunomodulatory therapies. These therapies, which induce profound B-cell depletion, are computationally characterized as a near-insurmountable bottleneck in the humoral response pathway, limiting the efficacy of further booster vaccinations. Our findings underscore the necessity of personalized, computationally-driven vaccination strategies. We conclude that integrating such predictive models into clinical decision-support systems is paramount for mitigating pandemic risk in immunocompromised populations, moving beyond one-size-fits-all public health policies toward precision digital health.
