**Abstract**

This study, conducted in 2022, examines the complex interplay between risk exposure, market competition, and operational efficiency within the Bangladeshi commercial banking sector. Utilizing Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimators to address potential endogeneity issues, we investigate the impact of these factors on bank performance, accounting for heterogeneity in ownership structures (public, private, and foreign). Our findings reveal that the relationship between market competition and efficiency is not uniformly positive; instead, a non-linear effect is observed, potentially reflecting strategic responses to competitive pressures and regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that risk, as operationalized through measures of asset quality and capital adequacy, exerts a differential influence on efficiency depending on the bank's ownership type. Specifically, privately-owned banks appear more sensitive to risk fluctuations compared to their public and foreign counterparts. These results highlight the importance of nuanced policy interventions aimed at fostering both competitive intensity and risk management capabilities within the Bangladeshi banking landscape. The implications extend to the broader literature on banking efficiency and regulation, suggesting a need for ownership-specific regulatory considerations.
