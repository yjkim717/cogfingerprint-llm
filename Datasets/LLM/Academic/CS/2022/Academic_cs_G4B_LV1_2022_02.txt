**Abstract**

We present a foundational theoretical result concerning the learning of halfspace classifiers under the influence of Massart noise.  Our investigation establishes a computational barrier to achieving optimal error rates, demonstrating that learning halfspaces with this type of noise is fundamentally limited. Specifically, we prove a lower bound of Ω(ε) on the sample complexity of any polynomial-time learning algorithm, where ε represents the Massart noise parameter. This result crucially leverages techniques from learning with errors (LWE) and analyzes the inherent complexity of distinguishing between truthful and noisy labels. 

The core argument hinges on demonstrating that the decision boundary induced by a halfspace, when corrupted by Massart noise, effectively obscures the underlying signal, necessitating a disproportionate amount of data to reliably discern.  This establishes a firm connection between noise robustness and algorithmic tractability.  Further research will explore the implications of this complexity bound for practical applications and investigate potential refinements within specific learning settings.  This work contributes significantly to our understanding of the limits of generalization in noisy learning scenarios.
