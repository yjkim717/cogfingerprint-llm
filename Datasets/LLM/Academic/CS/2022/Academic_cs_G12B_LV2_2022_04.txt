## Incentive-Compatible Scoring Rules for Multi-Dimensional Effort Allocation

**Abstract:** The design of incentive-compatible mechanisms to elicit optimal effort across multiple dimensions remains a significant challenge in algorithmic mechanism design. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a novel framework for constructing scoring rules that provide strong incentives for truthful reporting of effort levels in a multi-dimensional setting. We depart from existing approaches that often rely on complex and computationally expensive mechanisms, focusing instead on the practicality and tractability of scoring rules. Specifically, we analyze the inherent difficulty in achieving full incentive compatibility across all dimensions and propose two distinct scoring rule constructions that offer constant approximation guarantees to the social optimum. Our analysis leverages connections to the knapsack problem, demonstrating that the inherent trade-offs in maximizing social welfare within budget constraints directly influence the design of effective scoring rules. The proposed rules are characterized by their simplicity, computational efficiency, and provable approximation bounds, making them suitable for real-world applications where eliciting multi-dimensional effort is crucial. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating the approximation ratios achieved by each rule, and discuss the implications of our findings for the broader landscape of mechanism design, particularly in scenarios involving resource allocation and task assignment. This work contributes a practical and theoretically grounded approach to incentivizing complex effort decisions.
