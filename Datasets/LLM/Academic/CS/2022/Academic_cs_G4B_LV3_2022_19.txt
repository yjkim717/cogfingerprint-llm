**Abstract:**

Contemporary image enhancement algorithms frequently struggle to accurately reproduce perceived visual fidelity under varying dynamic illumination conditions. This research introduces a novel, lightweight image enhancement method predicated on a Fourier spectrum-based adversarial network (FAN).  Integrating this technique directly within an Image Signal Processor (ISP) offers a significant advantage over traditional post-processing approaches.  The proposed FAN leverages adversarial training to optimize spectral representations, effectively mitigating artifacts and improving perceptual quality across diverse scenes.  Evaluations are conducted within the context of perception tasks, demonstrating enhanced performance in scenarios demanding robust illumination invariance.  Specifically, we assess improvements in object recognition accuracy and scene detail preservation.  Preliminary results indicate a promising trajectory for deploying this ISP-integrated enhancement, contributing to more reliable and nuanced image understanding in real-time systems.
