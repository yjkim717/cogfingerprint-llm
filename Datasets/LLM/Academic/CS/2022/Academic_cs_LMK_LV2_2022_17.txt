Title: Enhancing Smart Irrigation with Machine Learning: An IoT-Driven Approach

Abstract:
The increasing adoption of IoT devices in agriculture has led to the generation of vast amounts of data, which can be leveraged to optimize irrigation practices. This study investigates the application of machine learning techniques to classify IoT-enabled smart irrigation data, with a focus on assessing agricultural farm conditions. We collected soil moisture data from IoT sensors deployed across multiple farms and employed a random forest classifier to predict soil moisture levels. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, achieving an accuracy of 92% in classifying soil moisture levels. The findings of this research have significant implications for the development of precision agriculture, enabling farmers to make data-driven decisions and optimize irrigation practices. By integrating machine learning with IoT technologies, this study contributes to the advancement of smart irrigation systems, promoting water conservation and improved crop yields in 2022.
