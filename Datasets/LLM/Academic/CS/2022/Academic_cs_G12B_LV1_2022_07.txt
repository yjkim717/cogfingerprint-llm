Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a CS publication, and reflecting a 2022 context.  I've aimed for precision and a structured argument.

**Abstract**

This work investigates the relationship between online learning and differential privacy within the framework of binary-labeled concept classes. Specifically, we establish a novel qualitative equivalence between online learnability and private PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learnability, contingent on the finiteness of the Littlestone dimension. Our findings demonstrate that for concept classes possessing a bounded Littlestone dimension, an online learning algorithm achieving a desired learnability threshold can be transformed into a differentially private PAC learning algorithm with comparable performance guarantees. This equivalence offers valuable insights into the inherent trade-offs between efficiency and privacy in learning scenarios. We provide a formal proof of this equivalence, highlighting the crucial role of the Littlestone dimension in bounding the privacy loss. These results contribute to a deeper understanding of privacy-preserving machine learning and suggest potential avenues for designing more efficient private learning algorithms.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Extensions:**

*   **Emphasis on Equivalence:** The abstract highlights the key finding – the equivalence – prominently.
*   **Formal Language:** I've used terms like "qualitative equivalence," "performance guarantees," "privacy loss," and "bounded Littlestone dimension" to maintain a formal tone.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: problem statement, finding, justification (Littlestone dimension), implications, and contribution.
*   **Year Context:** The phrasing is consistent with research trends in 2022, which saw continued interest in efficient and practical differentially private learning.
*   **Potential Extensions (for a full paper):** A full paper would expand on the proof, discuss the limitations of the Littlestone dimension assumption, and potentially explore connections to other private learning frameworks.  It would also provide concrete examples of concept classes and algorithms that satisfy the conditions.
