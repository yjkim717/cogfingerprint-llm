**Abstract**

Data augmentation techniques are crucial for enhancing the generalization capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly when training data is limited. This paper presents a novel data augmentation strategy leveraging conformal mapping to generate synthetic training examples. Our approach utilizes Möbius transformations to warp image data, ensuring that the fundamental geometric relationships within the images are preserved, thereby mitigating the risk of introducing spurious correlations that can degrade model performance. Unlike traditional augmentation methods, conformal mappings maintain angles locally, a property demonstrably beneficial for feature learning. Empirical evaluation on [mention specific datasets if known, e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet subsets] demonstrates that the proposed conformal image augmentation consistently improves prediction accuracy compared to standard augmentation techniques such as random rotations and translations.  We provide theoretical justification for the preservation of image information under Möbius transformations and quantify the performance gains achieved through this geometrically-aware augmentation strategy.
