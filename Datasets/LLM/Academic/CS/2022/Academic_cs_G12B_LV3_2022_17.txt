**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in precision agriculture necessitates advanced data analytics for efficient resource management. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) classification algorithms to optimize irrigation strategies within smart irrigation systems. We investigate the efficacy of logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines (SVM), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in classifying irrigation conditions based on a dataset incorporating soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and temporal factors. Experimental results, obtained in 2022, demonstrate that the random forest algorithm consistently achieves superior classification accuracy compared to the other evaluated methods. The findings highlight the potential of random forest for real-time, data-driven irrigation control, enabling optimized water usage and improved crop yield. Furthermore, this research contributes to the broader understanding of ML-driven decision support systems within agricultural IoT deployments, paving the way for future developments in sustainable farming practices and reduced environmental impact.
