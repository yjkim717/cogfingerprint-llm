This paper introduces a novel trajectory retiming algorithm that optimizes quadratic objectives while maintaining linear time complexity through factor graph variable elimination. Our approach addresses the computational bottleneck in kino-dynamic motion planning by reformulating the retiming problem as a sparse factor graph where nodes represent trajectory waypoints and factors encode dynamic constraints. The key innovation lies in our elimination ordering strategy that preserves sparsity while accommodating minimum-time objectives and acceleration constraints. We demonstrate that our method achieves O(n) complexity for n waypoints, contrasting with conventional approaches that scale cubically. Theoretical analysis proves our elimination sequence maintains constraint feasibility throughout the optimization process. Experimental validation on robotic manipulation tasks shows 3.2Ã— speedup over state-of-the-art solvers while achieving comparable solution quality. The algorithm's efficiency enables real-time trajectory adaptation in dynamic environments, making it particularly suitable for applications requiring frequent replanning under strict computational budgets. This work establishes a new performance benchmark for real-time trajectory optimization in complex robotic systems.
