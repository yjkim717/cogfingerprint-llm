**Abstract:**

This research presents a comprehensive literature review examining social engineering’s role within contemporary cybersecurity, published in 2023.  The study investigates prevalent attack vectors and methodologies, categorizing them through established frameworks and operational lifecycles. Analysis reveals a demonstrable correlation between successful social engineering campaigns and escalating cybercrime incidents, resulting in substantial financial repercussions for organizations.  Furthermore, the review assesses current awareness levels and mitigation strategies, identifying critical gaps in existing defenses.  Ultimately, this work underscores the need for enhanced proactive security measures informed by a deeper understanding of social engineering’s evolving tactics and psychological underpinnings.
