This study investigates evolving social engineering threats within contemporary cybersecurity ecosystems. Through a systematic analysis of 2023 literature, it delineates sophisticated attack vectors that exploit human vulnerabilities, circumventing technical safeguards. The research critically evaluates defensive frameworks and their alignment with attacker methodologies across the cybercrime lifecycle. Findings reveal significant gaps in organizational preparedness, contributing to escalating financial damages. The paper proposes an integrated mitigation strategy emphasizing adaptive awareness training and socio-technical countermeasures to enhance resilience against these pervasive threats in increasingly complex digital environments.
