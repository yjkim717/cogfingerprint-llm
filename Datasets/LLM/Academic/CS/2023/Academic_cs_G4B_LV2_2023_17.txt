**Abstract**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates robust and efficient methods for device identification and source localization. This paper introduces a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach designed to achieve highly accurate classification and source attribution within IoT networks.  Our methodology leverages a CNN architecture trained on a dataset incorporating both raw sensor data and augmented with additive features – specifically, device metadata and network topology information – to enhance discriminatory power.  Experimental results demonstrate a classification accuracy of 99.67%, signifying a significant improvement over existing techniques.  The incorporation of these additive features allows the CNN to effectively distinguish between diverse IoT device types and pinpoint their originating locations with enhanced reliability.  This work contributes to the growing field of IoT security and network management by providing a scalable and precise solution for device identification, facilitating proactive threat detection and optimized resource allocation. Future research will explore the application of this framework to dynamic IoT environments.
