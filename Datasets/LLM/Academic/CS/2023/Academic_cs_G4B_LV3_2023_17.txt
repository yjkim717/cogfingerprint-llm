**Abstract:**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices presents escalating challenges concerning device accountability and forensic investigation. This research introduces a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based system designed for robust source identification within IoT networks. Utilizing a novel architecture, the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 99.67% on a curated dataset of IoT device communication patterns, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing techniques.  Specifically, the CNN analyzes extracted features from network traffic, enabling precise differentiation between devices and mitigating the risks of spoofing or malicious activity.  The implications extend beyond simple device identification, offering a foundational element for enhancing IoT forensics and establishing clear accountability for data provenance.  Further investigation will explore the systemâ€™s adaptability to diverse IoT protocols and its integration with existing security frameworks, solidifying its potential for proactive threat detection in 2023 and beyond.
