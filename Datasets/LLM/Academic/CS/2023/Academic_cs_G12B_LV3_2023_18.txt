**Abstract**

Addressing the escalating costs and protracted timelines associated with clinical trial execution, this research investigates the application of variational autoencoders (VAEs) for data augmentation as a means to enhance statistical power. We propose a novel methodology leveraging VAEs to generate synthetic patient data, effectively expanding the training dataset without requiring additional patient recruitment. This approach is particularly relevant in clinical domains characterized by inherent data variability and limited sample sizes. Through rigorous simulations, we demonstrate that VAE-augmented datasets can achieve comparable, and in certain scenarios, improved statistical power compared to trials relying solely on original data. The implications extend to a potential reduction in both the required sample size and overall trial duration, thereby offering a cost-effective strategy for accelerating drug development and facilitating more robust clinical research. This work contributes to the growing body of literature exploring generative models for biomedical applications and highlights their promise in overcoming practical limitations in clinical trial design.
