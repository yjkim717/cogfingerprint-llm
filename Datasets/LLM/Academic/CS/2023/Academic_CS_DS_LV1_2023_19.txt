**Abstract**

The neurodevelopmental trajectory of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents a significant challenge for the development of robust, generalizable diagnostic tools. While deep learning models applied to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data have shown promise, their performance is often confounded by the pronounced heterogeneity of functional connectivity patterns across different developmental stages. This work posits that age-specific modeling is critical for enhancing diagnostic accuracy. We introduce a structured deep-learning framework that leverages resting-state fMRI data to construct discrete, age-stratified classifiers for ASD. Our methodology involves a comprehensive comparative analysis of several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, including ResNet, VGG, and DenseNet variants, to identify the optimal feature extractor for high-dimensional connectivity matrices. Experimental results on the multi-site ABIDE I and II datasets demonstrate that our age-partitioned approach significantly outperforms a unitary, age-agnostic model. Notably, the DenseNet201 architecture, with its characteristic dense connectivity pattern facilitating feature reuse, achieved superior performance, yielding a mean classification accuracy of 88.7% and an F1-score of 0.89 specifically within the 6-11 year age cohort. This performance is attributed to the model's efficacy in capturing the complex, non-linear interdependencies within the connectome that are most discriminative for this critical developmental window. We conclude that the explicit incorporation of age as a stratification variable, coupled with architecturally efficient CNNs like DenseNet201, is a pivotal strategy for advancing the clinical applicability of automated neuroimaging-based ASD diagnosis.
