**Abstract**

This paper introduces a novel trajectory retiming algorithm that achieves globally optimal solutions for quadratic objectives under kino-dynamic constraints while maintaining linear time complexity. While trajectory optimization is fundamental in robotics, existing methods often sacrifice either computational efficiency or solution quality. Our approach leverages factor graph representations and exploits the underlying problem sparsity through specialized variable elimination techniques. This formulation enables direct minimization of a minimum-time objective regularized by quadratic smoothness terms, ensuring dynamic feasibility without local minima. Crucially, the computational complexity scales linearly with trajectory length, making it suitable for high-DoF systems and long-horizon planning. We provide a complete complexity analysis and validate performance in simulated manipulation and locomotion tasks. Results demonstrate superior convergence and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art iterative solvers, establishing a new performance benchmark for real-time trajectory optimization in 2023.
