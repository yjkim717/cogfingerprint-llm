**Abstract: Enhancing Cardiac Perfusion Analysis Through CARIMAS-Based Image Data Processing**

This research investigates the application of CARIMAS (Cardiac Analysis and Reconstruction using Iterative Methods and Segmentation) as a robust framework for advanced medical imaging analysis, specifically within the context of cardiac perfusion studies.  Traditional tomography imaging techniques increasingly generate complex 3D/4D datasets, necessitating sophisticated image data processing methodologies. CARIMAS, a modular software suite, offers a flexible solution for handling diverse modalities, including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). 

Our analysis focuses on CARIMAS’s capacity to facilitate accurate quantification of cardiac perfusion parameters.  The iterative reconstruction algorithms inherent within CARIMAS minimize artifacts and enhance image quality, crucial for reliable segmentation and volumetric assessment of blood flow.  This study highlights CARIMAS’s potential to streamline clinical workflows and contribute to improved diagnostic precision in cardiovascular disease management. Future work will explore the integration of CARIMAS with machine learning techniques to further automate and refine perfusion analysis.
