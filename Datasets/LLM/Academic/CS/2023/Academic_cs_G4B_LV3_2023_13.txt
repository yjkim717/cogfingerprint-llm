**Abstract**

Recent advancements in meta-learning have yielded promising results in replicating human cognitive abilities, particularly in systematic generalization. This research investigates a novel meta-learning framework designed to cultivate compositional skills within neural networks, directly addressing limitations previously identified by Fodor and Pylyshyn regarding the representational capacities of artificial systems. Our approach demonstrates that by systematically optimizing a meta-learner, we can achieve performance exceeding both traditional, rigid symbolic AI models and conventional, unstructured deep neural networks.  Specifically, the resultant networks exhibit a marked capacity for adapting to novel compositional tasks with minimal task-specific training.  Preliminary results suggest a pathway toward constructing artificial systems exhibiting more human-like cognitive architecture, representing a significant step towards robust and generalizable AI. Future work will focus on quantifying the degree of compositional understanding and exploring broader application domains.
