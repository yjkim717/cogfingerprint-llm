**Abstract**

This research introduces a novel computational imaging framework designed to address the persistent challenge of spectral feature degradation in uncontrolled illumination environments. Conventional hyperspectral imaging systems frequently exhibit compromised classification performance when operating under suboptimal lighting conditions, particularly in low-light scenarios where signal-to-noise ratios deteriorate and spectral signatures become distorted. Our approach integrates an adaptive active illumination subsystem with a computational spectral reconstruction pipeline to mitigate these limitations. The system employs a programmable array of narrowband LED sources spanning the visible and near-infrared spectrum (400-1000nm), whose emission parameters are dynamically optimized in concert with sensor acquisition. This co-design of illumination and capture enables precise control over spectral radiance at the scene level, effectively augmenting discriminative features in the spectral domain while suppressing ambient noise. We validate our methodology through extensive experimental evaluation across diverse material surfaces under progressively constrained lighting conditions. Results demonstrate statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy (p<0.01) compared to passive imaging baselines, with particularly notable gains observed for spectrally ambiguous materials. The proposed system maintains robust performance at illumination levels up to 95% reduced from standard laboratory conditions, while the integrated computational model effectively disentangles intrinsic reflectance properties from illumination artifacts. This work establishes an important foundation for reliable hyperspectral analysis in real-world applications ranging from industrial quality control to environmental monitoring, where lighting conditions cannot be standardized.
