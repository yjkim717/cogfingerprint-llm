**Abstract:** Recent advances in neural networks have struggled to consistently exhibit systematic generalization capabilities observed in human cognition, particularly within compositional tasks. This paper introduces Meta-Learning for Compositionality (MLC), a novel meta-learning framework designed to address this limitation. MLC enables neural networks to acquire compositional representations that facilitate robust generalization to unseen combinations of known elements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MLC surpasses the performance of traditional symbolic systems and flexible neural architectures, achieving human-like systematicity while maintaining adaptability. These findings offer a promising avenue for developing more cognitively plausible and generalizable AI systems.
