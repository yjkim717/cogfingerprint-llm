**Abstract**

This paper addresses the challenging problem of the Time-Windows Traveling Salesperson Problem (TW-TSP) in an online setting, incorporating predictive information to enhance routing efficiency. Existing approaches often struggle to achieve competitive performance against offline solvers when dealing with dynamic environments and time-window constraints. We introduce a novel online algorithm designed to leverage predictions regarding future job locations, aiming to minimize total travel distance while adhering to temporal restrictions. Our theoretical analysis establishes a competitive ratio logarithmic in the network diameter, demonstrating performance comparable to state-of-the-art offline techniques. Crucially, we quantify the algorithmâ€™s degradation as a function of prediction quality, providing a rigorous understanding of the trade-off between predictive accuracy and routing optimality. This work contributes to the growing body of research on online vehicle routing and offers practical implications for logistics and delivery services operating under uncertainty.
