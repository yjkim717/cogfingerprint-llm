## Collision Cross-Entropy: A Novel Loss Function for Enhanced Deep Clustering via Soft Label Alignment

Deep clustering methods have demonstrated significant advancements in unsupervised learning, yet remain susceptible to performance degradation due to challenges in accurately representing data distributions and handling ambiguous cluster assignments. Traditional approaches often rely on hard assignments or simplistic soft label formulations, limiting their ability to effectively leverage nuanced probabilistic information. This paper introduces Collision Cross-Entropy (CCE), a novel loss function specifically designed to address these limitations within the context of deep clustering. CCE operates on soft labels, enabling a more granular representation of cluster membership probabilities, and is formulated to directly maximize the alignment between predicted and ground truth class distributions. 

Unlike existing cross-entropy variants, CCE incorporates a collision penalty term that explicitly discourages overlapping probability mass between predictions and true classes, promoting sharper and more distinct cluster assignments. This encourages the model to move away from ambiguous, diffuse probability distributions and towards more confident and localized representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of CCE through extensive experimentation on benchmark datasets for both classification and deep clustering tasks. Results indicate that CCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art self-labeled and pseudo-label clustering techniques, achieving improved clustering accuracy and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noisy data. The findings suggest that CCE offers a promising avenue for advancing deep clustering algorithms by fostering a more precise and interpretable probabilistic representation of data.
