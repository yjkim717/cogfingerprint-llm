**Abstract**

The escalating volume and dimensionality of modern datasets necessitate robust statistical methodologies capable of mitigating the influence of anomalous observations. This work surveys recent developments in algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics, specifically addressing challenges posed by adversarial outliers within machine learning contexts. We present a critical evaluation of computationally efficient estimators designed to maintain statistical validity and predictive performance under contamination. The focus lies on techniques enabling scalable robust inference, moving beyond traditional approaches often intractable in high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, we articulate streamlined theoretical proofs, accessible to graduate students and researchers, demonstrating convergence rates and robustness guarantees for selected estimators. This review highlights the synergy between robust statistics and machine learning theory, emphasizing the development of practical tools for reliable model training and inference in the presence of potentially malicious or unintentional data perturbationsâ€”a critical concern in contemporary data-driven applications.
