This paper introduces MV-Tracker, a novel framework for robust 3D multi-object tracking in autonomous driving scenarios. The proposed method addresses persistent challenges of target occlusion and scale ambiguity by integrating a temporal memory module with learned geometric priors. Our architecture employs an attention-based memory network to maintain and propagate target representations across frames, enabling consistent identification despite intermittent observations. Simultaneously, we formulate object localization as a Hough voting process where sparse point clouds generate probabilistic hypotheses about target extent and orientation. This dual approach decouples appearance modeling from geometric reasoning, allowing the system to leverage both historical context and spatial constraints. Extensive evaluation on nuScenes and KITTI datasets demonstrates that MV-Tracker achieves significant improvements in tracking accuracy and identity preservation compared to existing methods, particularly in complex urban environments with frequent occlusions. Our work establishes that explicit memory mechanisms coupled with structured spatial reasoning are essential for reliable 3D tracking in safety-critical applications.
