**Abstract**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices presents significant challenges for network forensics and accountability. Identifying the source of network traffic originating from diverse IoT deployments is often hampered by device heterogeneity and obfuscation techniques. This paper presents a novel approach to IoT device classification and source identification leveraging an additive feature extraction methodology coupled with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Our method constructs a comprehensive feature vector by combining multiple network characteristics, enhancing discriminatory power for accurate classification. Experimental results demonstrate a classification accuracy of 99.67%, significantly exceeding existing techniques. This research contributes a practical and highly effective solution for network forensics, enabling improved incident response and bolstering accountability within increasingly complex IoT ecosystems â€“ a critical development given the escalating cybersecurity threats targeting these devices in 2023.
