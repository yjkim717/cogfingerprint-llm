**Abstract**

The rapid adoption of Transformer architectures across diverse domains has spurred research into efficient training methodologies. While Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance, their computational demands remain a significant barrier, particularly in vision applications. This work investigates *mimetic initialization* as an approach to mitigate this challenge. We hypothesize that leveraging knowledge encoded within pre-trained Transformer models can significantly accelerate convergence and enhance accuracy in downstream vision tasks. Specifically, we explore the transfer of initial weights from large-scale language models to vision-based Transformers. Empirical evaluation on standard image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrates that mimetic initialization substantially reduces training time and improves classification accuracy compared to standard initialization schemes. These findings suggest that transferring pre-existing representations, even across modalities, provides a powerful strategy for optimizing Transformer training in computer vision, further solidifying their role within the field. Future work will explore the theoretical underpinnings of mimetic initialization and its applicability to broader vision architectures.
