**Title:** Age-Specific Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks on Brain Functional Connectivity Patterns

**Abstract:**

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication. Recent studies have highlighted the significance of analyzing brain functional connectivity patterns for ASD diagnosis. However, existing methods often neglect the age-specific variability in brain connectivity, potentially leading to suboptimal diagnostic performance. To address this limitation, we propose a deep learning-based framework that leverages age-specific brain functional connectivity patterns for ASD diagnosis. Our approach utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically extract relevant features from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) data. We train and evaluate our model on a large-scale dataset comprising rs-fMRI scans from individuals across various age groups. By incorporating age as a covariate in the model, we demonstrate improved diagnostic accuracy and robustness. Specifically, our CNN model achieves an average accuracy of 92.5% and 90.2% in diagnosing ASD in children and adults, respectively. Furthermore, our analysis reveals distinct age-specific brain connectivity patterns that contribute to the diagnostic decisions, providing valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underlying ASD. The proposed framework has the potential to enhance the accuracy and reliability of ASD diagnosis, enabling early intervention and personalized treatment strategies. Our findings underscore the importance of considering age-specific variability in brain functional connectivity patterns for developing robust ASD diagnostic models.
