**Rastermap: A Global Optimization Approach to Neural Response Visualization for Large-Scale Neurophysiological Data**

The analysis of neural population recordings presents a significant challenge in computational neuroscience, particularly concerning the efficient identification of patterns within vast datasets. Traditional raster plots, while widely used, often obscure underlying structure due to temporal jitter and the complexity of multi-neuronal activity. This paper introduces Rastermap, a novel visualization framework designed to address these limitations. Rastermap leverages a global optimization algorithm to re-sort and spatially arrange neural responses in time, minimizing a defined cost function that penalizes temporal disorganization and maximizes the visibility of correlated activity. This approach contrasts with local sorting methods common in existing techniques, potentially revealing broader patterns missed by incremental adjustments. We demonstrate Rastermap’s efficacy using simulated and empirical neurophysiological data, showing improved clarity in representing neuronal ensembles and facilitating the identification of coordinated firing patterns.  Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis against established visualization methods, highlighting Rastermap’s advantages in discerning temporal relationships and revealing emergent behavior within neural populations. The implementation, available as an open-source Python package, aims to accelerate the exploration and interpretation of data generated by increasingly sophisticated high-throughput neurophysiological recording technologies. Future work will focus on extending the cost function to incorporate feature-based information and adapting the algorithm for real-time visualization.
