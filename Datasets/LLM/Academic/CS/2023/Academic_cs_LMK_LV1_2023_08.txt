We present a novel algorithm for trajectory retiming with quadratic objectives, leveraging the structural properties of factor graphs to achieve global optimality in linear time complexity. By formulating the trajectory optimization problem as a factor graph, we exploit the inherent sparsity of the problem to derive an efficient variable elimination scheme. This enables the computation of the globally optimal trajectory retiming solution with respect to quadratic objectives, such as minimizing acceleration or jerk. Our algorithm achieves a significant reduction in computational complexity compared to existing methods, making it suitable for real-time applications. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments, showcasing its ability to efficiently retime trajectories while maintaining optimality. The proposed algorithm has far-reaching implications for various robotics and computer vision applications, where trajectory optimization is a crucial component. Our work contributes to the advancement of efficient and optimal trajectory planning methods.
