**Abstract**

The increasing volume and complexity of medical imaging data necessitate robust and adaptable computational tools for analysis and interpretation. This paper examines Carimas, a software platform initially developed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) image processing, and its recent expansion to support Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities. Carimas provides a comprehensive environment for visualization, quantitative analysis, and mathematical modeling of three-dimensional medical image data.  Its modular architecture facilitates the implementation of custom data processing pipelines, including advanced techniques for cardiac perfusion analysis. We highlight Carimas' ability to integrate diverse data types and its potential for facilitating research in areas such as disease progression modeling and personalized medicine. The ongoing development of Carimas addresses the critical need for a flexible and extensible platform capable of handling the evolving landscape of medical imaging technologies and associated computational challenges within the field of medical image informatics.

**Notes on Reasoning and Choices:**

*   **CS Focus:** The abstract frames the topic within a computational perspective ("computational tools," "data processing pipelines," "modular architecture," "extensible platform"). This aligns with a CS audience.
*   **Formal Tone:** I used precise language (e.g., "necessitate," "comprehensive environment," "facilitating research") and avoided colloquialisms.
*   **Structured Argument:** The abstract follows a logical flow: (1) Problem/Context (increasing data volume), (2) Solution/Tool (Carimas), (3) Key Features (visualization, analysis, modeling, modularity), (4) Applications (cardiac perfusion, disease modeling, personalized medicine), (5) Significance/Future (addressing evolving challenges).
*   **Year Context (2023):** The phrasing reflects the current state of the field – acknowledging the "evolving landscape" and "evolving challenges" – suggesting ongoing development and relevance.
*   **Keywords Integration:** The keywords from your prompt are implicitly woven into the text.
*   **Word Count:** The abstract is approximately 158 words, aligning with your target.
*   **"Medical Image Informatics":** I included this term to explicitly place the work within a recognized subfield of CS.
