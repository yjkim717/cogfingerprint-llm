This systematic review critically examines social engineering attack frameworks within cybersecurity, analyzing their escalating role in precipitating substantial financial losses. Drawing upon 2023 literature, we synthesize prevalent attack vectors and human-factor exploitation techniques. The analysis reveals that despite technological countermeasures, social engineering persists as a primary threat vector due to inherent psychological vulnerabilities. We propose an integrated defense model combining technical controls with organizational awareness training, arguing this multidimensional approach is essential for mitigating economic impacts in an evolving threat landscape.
