**Abstract**

The analysis of high-dimensional neural population recordings remains a central challenge in computational neuroscience and machine learning. While existing dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and UMAP reveal global structure, they often lack an interpretable, linear ordering that facilitates the discovery of sequential activity patterns. To address this, we introduce Rastermap, a novel visualization framework that explicitly embeds neural dynamics onto a one-dimensional manifold. Our method employs a graph-based sorting algorithm to order neurons or time points by their functional similarity, effectively transforming complex population trajectories into a linear sequence. This one-dimensional embedding allows for the direct visualization of smooth neural trajectories, traveling waves, and recurring state transitions in large-scale datasets. We validate Rastermap on both simulated data and multi-region electrophysiology recordings from awake, behaving mice, demonstrating its superiority in revealing interpretable temporal structures compared to established nonlinear methods. By providing a computationally efficient and intuitive ordering of neural states, Rastermap offers a powerful tool for hypothesis generation and the systematic exploration of neural coding principles in high-dimensional spaces.
