**Optimal Pen Testing Strategies via Deferred-Acceptance Auctions and Combinatorial Constraint Modeling**

This paper investigates the design of robust and adaptive pen testing strategies, leveraging principles from auction theory and combinatorial optimization. Traditional pen testing methodologies often struggle to account for realistic resource limitations and complex operational dependencies. We introduce a novel algorithmic framework predicated on a deferred-acceptance auction model, wherein potential attack vectors are treated as “items” and pen testing resources (time, personnel, tools) as “bids.” Crucially, we incorporate virtual values representing the perceived risk and potential impact of each vulnerability, alongside combinatorial constraints reflecting realistic operational restrictions – such as network topology, system dependencies, and personnel skillsets.  An omniscient algorithm, simulating a perfect evaluator, is employed to determine the optimal allocation of resources to maximize overall security posture. Preliminary simulations demonstrate the potential of this approach to dynamically prioritize vulnerabilities and improve the efficiency of penetration testing efforts. Further research will focus on scaling and real-world validation.
