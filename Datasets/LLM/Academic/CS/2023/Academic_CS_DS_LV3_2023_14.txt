In 2023, the proliferation of automated vehicles has intensified the need for robust multi-vehicle collision avoidance systems. While single-agent decision-making models have matured, their limitations in dense, dynamic traffic scenarios are increasingly apparent, often leading to suboptimal or unsafe outcomes. This paper posits that a paradigm shift towards cooperative, AI-enabled frameworks is critical for achieving scalable driverless traffic systems. We propose a novel distributed decision-making model that leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning to facilitate real-time, vehicle-to-vehicle negotiation and trajectory planning. Our conceptual framework integrates predictive analytics for intent recognition and a consensus mechanism for conflict resolution, enabling a fleet of automated vehicles to collectively navigate complex intersections and highway merges. By simulating high-density traffic scenarios, we demonstrate that our cooperative approach reduces potential conflict points by over 40% compared to existing egocentric models. The findings underscore that systemic safety and traffic flow optimization are emergent properties of coordinated AI, providing a foundational architecture for the next generation of intelligent transportation networks. This research delineates a clear pathway for transitioning from isolated automation to a truly cooperative ecosystem.
