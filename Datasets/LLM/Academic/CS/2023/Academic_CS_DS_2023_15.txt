This paper presents a novel post-training quantization methodology that achieves unprecedented 3-bit compression of large-scale transformer architectures while maintaining competitive performance metrics. Our approach addresses the fundamental memory bandwidth constraints that limit inference throughput in modern language models through two key innovations: a gradient-informed sensitivity analysis that enables non-uniform quantization thresholds optimized for different architectural components, and a computational decomposition strategy that separates dense and sparse activation patterns during forward propagation. Experimental evaluation across multiple benchmark tasks demonstrates that our compressed models achieve 2.1-2.5Ã— faster inference latency compared to 8-bit baselines while preserving 98.7% of original model accuracy. The proposed framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for ultra-low precision quantization, enabling efficient deployment of billion-parameter models on memory-constrained edge devices without requiring retraining or architectural modifications. Our work provides both theoretical insights into activation value distributions in transformer networks and practical implementations for production environments.
