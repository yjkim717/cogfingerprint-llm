Title: Enhancing Deep Clustering with Collision Cross-Entropy: A Robust Alternative to Shannon's Cross-Entropy

Abstract:
Deep clustering techniques have garnered significant attention in recent years due to their ability to learn compact and informative representations. However, the conventional reliance on Shannon's cross-entropy for classification with soft class labels often results in suboptimal performance. In this study, we propose the utilization of collision cross-entropy as a robust alternative for deep clustering with soft labels. By minimizing the collision cross-entropy loss, our self-labeled clustering approach effectively captures the underlying structure of the data. We demonstrate that collision cross-entropy is more resilient to label noise and outliers compared to Shannon's cross-entropy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed method, showcasing improved clustering performance and robustness. Our findings suggest that collision cross-entropy is a viable and effective loss function for deep clustering tasks, offering a promising direction for future research in this domain. (2023)
