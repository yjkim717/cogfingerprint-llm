This paper introduces a novel online algorithm for the dynamic vehicle routing problem with time windows, leveraging machine-learned predictions to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. Our approach incorporates predicted client request patterns into a receding horizon framework, balancing immediate routing costs against future opportunity losses. We derive a data-dependent competitive ratio that interpolates gracefully between best-case and worst-case guarantees as a function of prediction error. Specifically, we establish an O(log n + η) competitive ratio, where η captures the cumulative deviation between predicted and actual request sequences. When predictions are perfect (η=0), we match known offline lower bounds; as η grows, performance degrades smoothly to the pessimistic online baseline. Empirical validation on real-world logistics datasets demonstrates significant practical improvements over purely reactive strategies, highlighting the potential of prediction-augmented algorithms for modern supply chain applications.
