## An Online Algorithm for Time-Windowed TSP with Predictive Information and Logarithmic Competitive Ratio

This paper addresses the challenge of solving the Time-Windowed Traveling Salesperson Problem (TW-TSP) in an online setting, where customer requests and their associated time windows arrive sequentially. Existing approaches often struggle to maintain efficiency when faced with this dynamic environment and limited foresight. We introduce a novel online algorithm leveraging predictive information – anticipated future customer arrivals – to proactively construct feasible tours. Our algorithm dynamically adjusts routing decisions based on incoming requests and forecasts, aiming to minimize accumulated travel cost. We rigorously analyze the competitive ratio of our approach, demonstrating a logarithmic bound with respect to the diameter of the underlying graph. This performance guarantees, while not optimal for the static TW-TSP, represent a significant improvement over existing online heuristics and provide a practical solution for real-world logistics applications where precise problem instances are unavailable a priori.  Experimental results, conducted on simulated datasets with varying prediction accuracy, showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in mitigating the impact of online decision-making under uncertainty, highlighting its potential for adoption in dynamic vehicle routing systems.
