**Abstract**

This 2023 study investigates the interplay between system scale, market competition, and the emergent properties of risk and performance within large-scale, distributed computational systems, such as cloud banking platforms. We posit that the architectural complexity and resource allocation strategies of these systems are not merely technical concerns but are critically shaped by their operational ecosystem. To empirically test this, we model a network of interacting computational agents, where "risk" is quantified as the propensity for cascading failure under load, and "performance" is measured as transactional throughput and resource utilization efficiency. Utilizing a Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator on a longitudinal dataset of system performance logs (2010-2017), we control for endogeneity between architectural decisions and outcomes. Our findings indicate that while increased system scale correlates with higher fault tolerance, it also introduces systemic fragility. Furthermore, intense competition in the computational service market is found to incentivize risk-optimized configurations that paradoxically enhance both stability and profitability, challenging conventional models of risk-return trade-offs in distributed system design.
