**Abstract**

We consider the online Time-Windows Traveling Salesperson Problem (TW-TSP), a fundamental vehicle routing challenge where customer requests with strict time windows arrive sequentially. Traditional online algorithms, which operate without future knowledge, are hampered by high competitive ratios. In this work, we introduce a novel learning-augmented framework that integrates potentially erroneous predictions—such as the total number of requests or the spatial distribution of future demand—into the online decision-making process. Our primary contribution is a prediction-based algorithm whose competitive ratio gracefully degrades as a function of prediction error. Specifically, we prove that our algorithm achieves a constant competitive ratio under perfect predictions and smoothly transitions to the best-known worst-case guarantee of classical online algorithms as prediction error increases. This smooth degradation, or robustness, is a key property. We further validate our theoretical results with numerical simulations on synthetic and real-world delivery datasets, demonstrating significant performance improvements even with moderately accurate predictions. This work establishes a new paradigm for enhancing online routing algorithms with machine-learned forecasts, bridging the gap between robust online optimization and predictive analytics.
