Title: Age-Specific Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis using Deep Learning Analysis of Brain Functional Connectivity

Abstract:

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication. The diagnosis of ASD remains challenging due to its heterogeneous nature and the lack of objective biomarkers. Recent studies have explored the potential of brain functional connectivity (FC) as a diagnostic biomarker. However, the age-dependent variability in brain FC patterns poses a significant challenge to developing robust ASD diagnostic models. This study addresses this challenge by leveraging deep learning techniques to analyze age-specific brain FC patterns for ASD diagnosis. We propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework that integrates age-specific FC features extracted from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. Our model is trained and evaluated on a large-scale dataset comprising rs-fMRI scans from individuals with ASD and typically developing controls, stratified across distinct age groups. The proposed CNN model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across different age groups, achieving an average accuracy of 92.5% and 91.2% for children and adults, respectively. Furthermore, our analysis reveals distinct age-specific FC patterns that are associated with ASD, providing insights into the neurodevelopmental changes underlying the disorder. The proposed age-specific ASD diagnostic framework has the potential to improve clinical diagnosis and facilitate early intervention. Our findings underscore the efficacy of deep learning in analyzing complex brain FC patterns and highlight the importance of considering age-specific variability in ASD diagnosis.
