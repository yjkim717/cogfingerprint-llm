**Abstract**

We introduce a novel algorithmic framework for stochastic probing under combinatorial constraints, drawing conceptual parallels between optimal mechanism design and sequential decision-making with resource consumption. Motivated by applications in cloud resource allocation and strategic network testing, we formulate the *pen testing problem with deferred-acceptance auctions*. In this model, selecting a high-value element (or "pen") for final inclusion expends a portion of its inherent capacity, mirroring the payment extraction in auctions. Our primary contribution is a reduction that maps combinatorial pen testing to the design of virtual-value-based deferred-acceptance algorithms. By integrating Myersonian auction theory with adversarial combinatorial optimization, we derive mechanisms that achieve a tight approximation factor relative to the offline optimum. We instantiate this framework for matroid, matching, and knapsack constraints, demonstrating robust, near-optimal performance. This work, situated in 2023, thus establishes a principled connection between dynamic selection under consumption and truthful mechanism design, providing a unified approach to a class of previously disparate online optimization problems.
