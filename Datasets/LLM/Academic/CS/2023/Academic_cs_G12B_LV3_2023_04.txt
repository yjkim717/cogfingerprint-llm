**Abstract:**

This paper presents a novel algorithmic approach to pen testing, addressing the inherent complexities of combinatorial resource allocation and online operational constraints. We introduce a framework integrating deferred-acceptance auctions with the concept of virtual values to achieve provably efficient solutions. Our methodology transforms the pen testing problem into a series of strategic bidding interactions, allowing for optimal resource assignment while satisfying diverse operational requirements. We demonstrate that this approach yields approximation guarantees with an overhead of at most $(1+o(1)) \ln n$, where *n* represents the number of testing resources.  Furthermore, the frameworkâ€™s adaptability supports both offline and dynamic online environments.  Experimental results and theoretical analysis validate the efficacy of our approach, offering a significant advancement in the design of scalable and practically relevant pen testing strategies for modern cybersecurity infrastructure.
