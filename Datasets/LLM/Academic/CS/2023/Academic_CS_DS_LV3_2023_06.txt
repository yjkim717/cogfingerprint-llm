In 2023, this computational study investigates the interplay between algorithmic risk-taking and profitability in distributed financial systems, with a focus on the role of system scale and competitive dynamics. Leveraging advanced simulation techniques and econometric models, including Two-Step System GMM estimators, we analyze how the size of a computational ecosystem and the intensity of market competition among autonomous agents shape emergent behaviors. Our findings reveal nonlinear relationships: while moderate scaling enhances profitability through network effects, excessive growth correlates with heightened systemic risk and diminishing returns. Furthermore, intensified competition among algorithmic traders amplifies risk-propagation channels, yet selectively boosts short-term profitability under constrained environments. These results underscore critical trade-offs between stability and performance in decentralized finance (DeFi), offering insights for designing resilient, scalable architectures and adaptive regulatory frameworks in increasingly automated financial markets.
