**Meta-Learning for Compositionality: Enabling Systematic Generalization in Neural Networks via Instruction Learning**

The inherent limitations of current neural network architectures in exhibiting robust compositional generalization remain a significant challenge for achieving human-level artificial intelligence. While deep learning models excel in pattern recognition, they often struggle with systematicity – the ability to combine learned elements in novel ways to understand and generate unseen structures. This paper introduces Meta-Learning for Compositionality (MLC), a novel framework designed to imbue neural networks with this crucial capability. MLC leverages instruction learning, framing compositional tasks as sequences of instructions that guide the model’s operations. Through meta-training on a diverse set of compositional problems, the model learns to rapidly adapt to new, unseen combinations of learned components.  We demonstrate, through rigorous experimental evaluation across various synthetic and natural language tasks, that MLC significantly improves systematic generalization compared to standard training paradigms and existing few-shot learning approaches. Critically, our results highlight a strong correlation between the model's ability to follow instructions and its performance on compositional tasks, suggesting that instruction learning acts as a powerful inductive bias for achieving compositional understanding. We argue that MLC represents a promising avenue for building more flexible and generalizable neural network systems, moving towards architectures that more closely mimic the cognitive abilities of humans in processing structured information. Further, we discuss limitations and future research directions focusing on scaling MLC to more complex, real-world scenarios and investigating its theoretical underpinnings.
