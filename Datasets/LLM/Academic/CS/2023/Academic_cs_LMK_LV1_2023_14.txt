Title: An AI-Enabled Framework for Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Automated Vehicle Convoys

Abstract:
The advent of automated driving systems (ADS) has revolutionized the automotive industry, with multiple vehicle cooperation emerging as a crucial aspect of enhanced road safety. In this context, we present a comprehensive survey of existing techniques for collision avoidance in automated vehicles, with a focus on cooperative strategies. Building upon this analysis, we propose an AI-enabled conceptual framework that leverages multi-agent systems and deep reinforcement learning to facilitate real-time cooperation among automated vehicles. Our framework integrates sensor fusion, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, and predictive modeling to enable proactive collision avoidance maneuvers. By enabling the coordination of multiple vehicles, our framework can significantly reduce the risk of accidents in complex driving scenarios. We outline the architectural components and operational workflow of the proposed framework, highlighting its potential to enhance the safety and efficiency of automated vehicle convoys in 2023 and beyond.
