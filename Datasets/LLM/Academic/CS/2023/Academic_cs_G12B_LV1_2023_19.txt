**Abstract: Age-Specific Deep Learning Analysis of Brain Functional Connectivity for Enhanced Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis**

The early and accurate diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remains a significant clinical challenge. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on behavioral assessments, which can be subjective and may not capture the underlying neurological differences associated with ASD. Recent advancements in neuroimaging techniques, particularly resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), provide rich datasets of brain activity patterns. However, the complexity of these datasets necessitates sophisticated analytical approaches. This work investigates the application of deep learning, specifically a DenseNet201 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, to automatically extract and classify age-specific patterns of brain functional connectivity (BFC) for improved ASD diagnostic accuracy.

We hypothesize that ASD-related BFC alterations manifest differently across developmental stages. To explore this, we trained and evaluated our DenseNet201 model on a dataset of rs-fMRI data from age-stratified cohorts of individuals with and without ASD.  The CNN was configured to process pre-processed BFC matrices, learning hierarchical representations of connectivity patterns.  Preliminary results demonstrate that the modelâ€™s performance, assessed via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), is significantly enhanced when training is performed separately for distinct age groups (e.g., childhood, adolescence, adulthood) compared to a single, unified model. This suggests that age-specific modeling captures nuanced BFC differences better. Furthermore, we employed attention mechanisms within the network to identify regions exhibiting the most significant connectivity alterations predictive of ASD diagnosis. Future work will focus on incorporating longitudinal data to model developmental trajectories and exploring the transferability of learned representations across age groups, ultimately aiming to develop a robust and personalized diagnostic tool for ASD.
