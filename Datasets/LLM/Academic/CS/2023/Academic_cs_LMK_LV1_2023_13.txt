Title: Compositional Meta-Learning for Systematic Generalization in Neural Networks

Abstract:
Achieving human-like systematic generalization remains a significant challenge in the field of artificial intelligence. Recent advances in meta-learning have shown promise in enabling neural networks to learn compositional skills, a crucial aspect of human cognition. In this work, we propose a novel meta-learning framework that optimizes neural networks for compositionality, thereby enhancing their capacity for systematic generalization. By leveraging episodic training and task-agnostic architectures, our model learns to decompose complex tasks into simpler, reusable components, facilitating the generation of novel combinations. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, exhibiting human-like generalization capabilities. Our findings suggest that compositional meta-learning is a key driver of systematic generalization, providing a promising avenue for future research in this area. The proposed framework has significant implications for the development of more robust and generalizable AI systems. (2023)
