This paper investigates synergistic advancements in UAV operational capabilities through integrated power systems and vision-based autonomy. We analyze emerging high-density energy storage solutions and hybrid power architectures that extend flight endurance while maintaining payload capacity. Concurrently, we examine transformer-based vision models and lightweight neural network implementations for real-time scene understanding and obstacle avoidance. Our framework demonstrates how optimized power allocation between computational and propulsion systems enables sophisticated onboard processing previously limited by energy constraints. Experimental validation shows that coordinated power management and efficient deep learning inference significantly enhance mission duration and autonomous navigation in complex environments. These findings establish a foundation for next-generation UAVs capable of sustained intelligent operations across surveillance, delivery, and environmental monitoring applications, while highlighting remaining challenges in thermal management and edge computing efficiency.
