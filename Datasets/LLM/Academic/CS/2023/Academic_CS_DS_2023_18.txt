In the rapidly evolving domain of intelligent transportation systems, the synergistic coordination of automated vehicles (AVs) presents a critical pathway toward enhancing traffic throughput and safety. This paper investigates the integration of multi-agent cooperation with real-time collision avoidance, addressing a significant research gap where these capabilities are often developed in isolation. We introduce a novel, scalable AI-enabled framework that leverages a hybrid decision-making model, combining deep reinforcement learning for strategic inter-vehicle negotiation with probabilistic risk assessment for dynamic obstacle evasion. The proposed architecture is designed to function in complex, mixed-traffic urban scenarios, facilitating distributed consensus among connected AVs while guaranteeing operational safety under uncertainty. A simulation-based evaluation demonstrates the framework's efficacy in reducing traffic conflicts by over 40% compared to conventional autonomous driving stacks, without compromising travel efficiency. This work underscores the necessity of a unified approach to cooperative autonomy, providing a foundational model for next-generation collision-resilient vehicular networks.
