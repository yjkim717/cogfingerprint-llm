## An Online Algorithm for the Time-Window TSP with Predictive Information and Logarithmic Competitive Ratio

This paper addresses the challenging problem of the Time-Window Traveling Salesperson Problem (TW-TSP) in an online setting, augmented with predictive information regarding future customer locations. The TW-TSP, a well-studied NP-hard problem, requires efficient route planning subject to time-window constraints, while the online variant necessitates decisions without complete knowledge of the problem instance. We introduce a novel online algorithm leveraging predictive data to proactively adapt routing strategies. Our algorithm iteratively constructs a tour, incorporating predicted customer locations to minimize anticipated travel time and respect time-window limitations.  Crucially, we provide a rigorous competitive analysis, demonstrating a logarithmic competitive ratio with respect to an optimal offline solution. The competitive ratio, logarithmic in the network diameter, signifies a strong performance guarantee even under adverse prediction scenarios. This represents a significant advancement in online vehicle routing, offering a practical solution for applications involving dynamic environments and limited foresight, such as delivery services and ride-sharing platforms.  Future work will explore the algorithmâ€™s sensitivity to prediction accuracy and its extension to multi-vehicle scenarios.
