**Abstract**

Trajectory retiming, a critical component of motion planning for robotics, often relies on minimizing travel time. However, this approach frequently neglects operational constraints and resultant suboptimal performance in complex, real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel algorithmic framework utilizing factor graph variable elimination to address trajectory retiming with explicitly defined quadratic objectives. Our methodology facilitates the incorporation of multiple, potentially conflicting, performance criteria, moving beyond the traditional minimum-time objective. We demonstrate that this approach yields demonstrably improved robot trajectories, particularly in scenarios involving kinematic limitations and dynamic constraints. The core innovation lies in the efficient propagation of constraints via the factor graph representation, enabling robust optimization under complex objectives. Preliminary results, presented herein, suggest a significant advancement in the feasibility and effectiveness of trajectory retiming for practical robotic applications, warranting further investigation into its broader applicability within the field of motion control in 2023.
