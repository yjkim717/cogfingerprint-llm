**Abstract**

Deep clustering methods have demonstrated promise in unsupervised representation learning, yet often rely on pre-defined class labels or struggle with nuanced cluster structures. This work introduces Collision Cross-Entropy (CCE), a novel loss function specifically designed to enhance the performance of deep clustering algorithms. CCE leverages the incorporation of *soft labels*, generated through techniques such as self-labeling, to guide the clustering process.  The core innovation lies in a collision-based strategy that minimizes the discrepancy between cluster assignments and the underlying data distribution, promoting tighter and more coherent cluster formations. 

Experimental results indicate that CCE significantly improves cluster quality compared to standard contrastive loss functions when coupled with self-labeling. Furthermore, the loss function’s sensitivity to *uncertainty* – implicitly represented through soft labels – allows for robust handling of noisy data and ambiguous assignments.  We argue that CCE provides a valuable tool for advancing deep clustering research, particularly in scenarios where explicit ground truth labels are scarce or unreliable, ultimately leading to more effective and adaptable unsupervised learning systems.
