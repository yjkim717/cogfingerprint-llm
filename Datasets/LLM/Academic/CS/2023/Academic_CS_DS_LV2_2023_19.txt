**Abstract**

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition whose neurobiological markers are known to vary significantly across the lifespan, presenting a substantial challenge for the development of robust, generalizable diagnostic tools. While deep learning applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown promise for automated ASD classification, existing models often fail to account for this age-related heterogeneity, potentially limiting their clinical applicability. This study addresses this critical gap by proposing a novel, age-specific diagnostic framework that leverages deep learning to analyze whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) patterns. We trained and evaluated a series of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures on a large, multi-site fMRI dataset, segmenting the cohort into distinct age groups (e.g., 6-11, 12-18, and 19+ years) to construct dedicated classifiers for each developmental stage. Our methodology involved constructing FC matrices from preprocessed fMRI time-series, which served as the input features for the CNN models. The results demonstrate a significant performance improvement for age-specific models compared to a single, pooled-age classifier. Notably, the model tailored for the 6-11 year age cohort achieved the highest classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, suggesting that mid-childhood may represent a period of heightened neurofunctional distinctiveness in ASD. These findings underscore the necessity of incorporating age as a core stratification variable in computational psychiatry. The proposed framework not only enhances diagnostic precision but also provides a more nuanced, developmentally informed approach to identifying ASD biomarkers, paving the way for more effective and personalized clinical decision-support systems.
