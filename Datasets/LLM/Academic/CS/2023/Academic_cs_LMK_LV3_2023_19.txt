Title: Age-Specific Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis using Functional Connectivity and Deep Learning

Abstract:

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by heterogeneous behavioral and cognitive phenotypes. Accurate diagnosis is crucial for timely interventions, yet remains challenging due to the disorder's inherent variability. Recent advances in deep learning and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown promise in developing objective diagnostic tools. This study proposes a novel age-specific diagnostic framework for ASD using functional connectivity features extracted from resting-state fMRI data. We leverage convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn discriminative patterns in brain connectivity that distinguish between ASD and typically developing controls across different age groups. Our approach involves training age-stratified CNN models on functional connectivity matrices derived from a large, multi-site dataset. Results demonstrate that our age-specific models achieve superior diagnostic accuracy compared to age-agnostic models, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) scores ranging from 0.85 to 0.92 across different age strata. Notably, our analysis reveals distinct age-dependent patterns in functional connectivity that underlie ASD, highlighting the importance of considering developmental stage in diagnostic modeling. This work contributes to the development of precise, data-driven diagnostic tools for ASD, with implications for early intervention and personalized treatment strategies.
