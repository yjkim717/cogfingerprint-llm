**Abstract**

We introduce a novel algorithmic framework for resource allocation in scenarios mirroring penetration testing (pen testing) scenarios, where the objective is to maximize the selection of resources while managing computational complexity. Our approach leverages the deferred-acceptance (DA) auction mechanism, adapted to handle combinatorial constraints inherent in many pen testing strategies. Specifically, we explore the efficacy of DA auctions in selecting sets of resources that offer synergistic benefits, a departure from traditional single-resource bidding strategies.  A key contribution is the development of approximation algorithms designed to mitigate the computational burden associated with complex combinatorial bidding. We introduce the concept of "virtual values," a technique used to represent the aggregate utility of resource combinations within the auction process, enabling efficient bidding and allocation.  Preliminary results demonstrate that our approach achieves a desirable trade-off between solution quality, approximated through established theoretical bounds, and computational efficiency. This work contributes to the broader field of algorithmic game theory and provides a practical methodology for optimizing resource selection in security-focused applications, with implications for vulnerability assessment and threat modeling.
