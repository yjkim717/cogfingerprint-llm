In this paper, we address the online Time-Windows Traveling Salesperson Problem (TW-TSP) by introducing a novel algorithm that integrates imperfect predictions to enhance competitive performance. Traditional online algorithms for vehicle routing under time-window constraints often face prohibitive competitive ratios in large-scale networks. Our approach mitigates this by utilizing predictions—such as request arrival distributions or node criticality—to inform routing decisions proactively. We prove that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio logarithmic in the network's diameter when predictions are accurate, a significant improvement over prior worst-case bounds. Crucially, we establish a smooth degradation guarantee: the competitive ratio gracefully increases with the magnitude of prediction errors, quantified via a tailored error measure. This robustness ensures reliable performance even with moderately accurate predictions, bridging the gap between optimistic and adversarial online settings. Our theoretical results, validated through simulations on synthetic and real-world road networks, demonstrate the framework's practical viability for dynamic logistics and mobility-on-demand systems, marking a step toward prediction-augmented online optimization.
