**Abstract**

The burgeoning intersection of robust statistics and high-dimensional data presents significant challenges for both theoretical understanding and practical implementation. This work investigates algorithmic estimators within this complex landscape, focusing on techniques designed to mitigate the effects of outliers and model misspecification. We synthesize recent advancements in statistical theory and machine learning theory, specifically examining approaches leveraging concepts from compressed sensing and spectral clustering to construct resilient estimators.  Central to our analysis is a streamlined presentation of core proofs, intended to facilitate deeper comprehension for graduate-level researchers and practitioners.  We argue that robust high-dimensional statistics necessitates a shift from traditional assumptions of normality to methods accounting for distributional uncertainty.  This paper outlines key algorithmic paradigms – including adaptive shrinkage and robust optimization – and highlights open research questions concerning estimator convergence rates and computational complexity in scenarios exhibiting high levels of noise and data corruption.  Future work will explore integration with active learning strategies.
