## Efficient Trajectory Retiming with Quadratic Cost Functions via Factor Graph Optimization

**Abstract:** Trajectory optimization plays a crucial role in robotic motion planning, enabling robots to execute tasks efficiently and adaptively. Traditional trajectory retiming techniques, however, often struggle with quadratic cost functions that are increasingly prevalent in applications requiring precise control and energy efficiency. This paper introduces a novel algorithm for trajectory retiming specifically designed to handle quadratic objective functions while preserving linear time complexity, a significant improvement over existing approaches. Our method leverages a factor graph representation of the trajectory optimization problem, allowing for a structured decomposition and efficient inference. We demonstrate that the quadratic cost structure can be effectively exploited within the factor graph framework through a modified variable elimination procedure.  Specifically, we introduce a tailored elimination ordering that minimizes computational overhead and prevents the introduction of unnecessary variables. This approach avoids the exponential complexity typically associated with variable elimination on graphs with quadratic interactions.  Experimental results, conducted on a range of simulated robotic scenarios incorporating kino-dynamic constraints, demonstrate the algorithm's ability to generate significantly improved trajectories compared to standard retiming methods, while maintaining the desired linear time complexity with respect to the number of time steps. This work contributes a practical and scalable solution for incorporating quadratic costs into trajectory retiming, broadening its applicability to increasingly complex robotic control tasks.
