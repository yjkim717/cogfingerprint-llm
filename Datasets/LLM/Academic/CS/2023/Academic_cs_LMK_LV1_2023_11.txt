Title: Enhancing Deep Clustering with Collision Cross-Entropy for Soft Class Labels

Abstract:
Deep clustering has emerged as a pivotal technique in unsupervised learning, leveraging the representational capabilities of deep neural networks to identify intrinsic patterns in unlabelled data. Traditional deep clustering methods often rely on Shannon's cross-entropy as the loss function, which can be suboptimal when dealing with soft class labels. In this paper, we propose the adoption of collision cross-entropy as a more robust alternative for handling soft class labels in deep clustering. Collision cross-entropy, derived from the RÃ©nyi entropy framework, offers enhanced sensitivity to label uncertainty and is less susceptible to label noise. We integrate collision cross-entropy into a self-labeled clustering framework, demonstrating its efficacy in improving cluster purity and normalized mutual information on benchmark datasets. Our results indicate that collision cross-entropy outperforms Shannon's cross-entropy in deep clustering tasks involving soft class labels, providing a promising direction for future research in this domain.
