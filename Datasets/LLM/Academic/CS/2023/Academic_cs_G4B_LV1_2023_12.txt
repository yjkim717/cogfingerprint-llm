**Mimetic Initialization for Accelerated Transformer Training**

Transformer architectures have demonstrated remarkable efficacy across a diverse range of vision tasks, yet their training remains computationally demanding. This work introduces Mimetic Initialization (MI), a novel technique designed to expedite the training process of Transformer models. MI leverages the structural information inherent in pre-trained models to generate initial weight configurations. Specifically, the method employs self-attention mechanisms to analyze the weight distributions of established, high-performing pre-trained models and then constructs an analogous initialization for the target task.  We hypothesize that this “mimicry” – effectively transferring learned representations – reduces the reliance on extensive gradient descent, thereby accelerating convergence. Preliminary experiments on image classification datasets indicate a significant reduction in training epochs while maintaining competitive performance, suggesting a promising avenue for optimizing Transformer deployment. Further investigation is warranted to explore the generalizability of MI across various Transformer variants and task domains.
