The proliferation of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices introduces significant challenges for network security and digital forensics, particularly in device classification and source attribution. Existing methods often rely on conventional traffic features, which struggle with the dynamic and obfuscated nature of modern IoT communications. To address this, we propose a forensic framework leveraging a novel set of additive traffic features that capture subtle, device-specific communication patterns. These features are processed by a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture designed for robust feature extraction from sequential traffic data. Our empirical evaluation on a diverse IoT testbed demonstrates that the system achieves 99.67% classification accuracy, substantially outperforming baseline methods. This work establishes a new benchmark for IoT device accountability, providing a reliable technical foundation for incident response and provenance analysis in complex networked environments.
