**Abstract**

The proliferation of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices presents significant challenges for network security management and digital forensics, particularly in the reliable attribution of network traffic to specific device types. While deep learning approaches, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown promise for IoT device classification, many existing models rely on standard traffic features, limiting their discriminative power. This paper introduces a novel framework that augments raw network traffic data with a set of engineered, additive IoT-specific features. These features are designed to capture unique behavioral fingerprints related to device communication patterns, protocol-specific nuances, and timing signatures. The enriched feature set is then processed by a tailored CNN architecture to perform automated, end-to-end device classification and source identification. Evaluated on a large-scale, real-world IoT traffic dataset, our proposed system demonstrates a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 99.67%, significantly outperforming baseline models. The results substantiate that the integration of domain-specific feature engineering with deep learning is a potent methodology for enhancing IoT forensic capabilities and strengthening network access control mechanisms.
