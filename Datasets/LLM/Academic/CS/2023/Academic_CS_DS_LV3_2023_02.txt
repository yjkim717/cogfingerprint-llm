This 2023 monograph presents a systematic framework for computationally efficient robust estimation in high-dimensional statistical models. We address the critical challenge of maintaining statistical reliability under simultaneous model misspecification and adversarial contamination. Our theoretical contributions establish unified finite-sample guarantees for a class of polynomial-time algorithmic estimators that achieve optimal convergence rates while preserving computational tractability. Through rigorous analysis of projection-based methods and gradient-descent variants, we demonstrate how carefully designed regularization techniques can mitigate the curse of dimensionality without sacrificing robustness. The proposed methodology bridges theoretical statistics with practical implementation concerns, offering streamlined proofs and explicit computational bounds. These advances significantly expand the applicability of robust statistical methods to contemporary large-scale datasets where both dimensionality and data integrity present fundamental challenges to conventional estimation paradigms.
