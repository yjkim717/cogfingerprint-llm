**Abstract: A Distributed, AI-Enabled Framework for Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Autonomous Vehicle Traffic Systems**

The increasing deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust and scalable solutions for collision avoidance, particularly in complex, multi-agent traffic scenarios. While individual vehicle autonomy has seen significant advancements, achieving optimal safety and efficiency demands effective cooperation among vehicles. This paper presents a novel, distributed AI-enabled framework designed to enhance cooperative collision avoidance within dynamic traffic systems. Our framework leverages a hybrid approach, combining rule-based safety protocols with reinforcement learning (RL) agents operating at each vehicle to facilitate decentralized decision-making. 

Specifically, we propose a multi-agent RL architecture where each AV learns optimal trajectory adjustments based on local observations and communicated intentions from neighboring vehicles. A novel communication protocol, incorporating probabilistic message filtering and conflict resolution strategies, is introduced to mitigate the effects of communication latency and uncertainty. The rule-based layer enforces fundamental safety constraints, ensuring adherence to traffic laws and preventing catastrophic failures.  We utilize a decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) formulation to model the interaction between vehicles, addressing the challenges of imperfect information.

Simulation results, conducted using a realistic microscopic traffic simulator, demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces collision rates and improves traffic flow compared to traditional reactive collision avoidance techniques and existing cooperative approaches relying on centralized control. The framework exhibits resilience to communication disruptions and demonstrates adaptive behavior in response to varying traffic densities. Future work will focus on extending the framework to incorporate heterogeneous vehicle types and exploring the integration of edge computing resources for enhanced real-time performance and scalability.

**Notes on Design Choices and Potential Expansions:**

*   **Emphasis on Distribution:** The abstract highlights the *distributed* nature of the framework, a crucial aspect for scalability and resilience in real-world deployments. Centralized systems are often bottlenecks.
*   **Hybrid Approach:** Combining rule-based and RL components is a common and effective strategy in safety-critical systems.  The rule-based layer provides a safety net, while RL allows for more nuanced and adaptive behavior.
*   **POMDP Formulation:** Explicitly mentioning the POMDP formulation demonstrates a theoretical understanding of the problem's complexity.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Acknowledging communication challenges (latency, uncertainty) and proposing a solution is important.
*   **Simulation Results:**  The abstract includes a claim of improved performance compared to existing approaches. *Crucially*, this would need to be strongly supported in the full paper.
*   **Future Work:**  The abstract outlines potential directions for future research, demonstrating the ongoing nature of the work.
*   **Keywords Integration:** The abstract naturally incorporates the keywords from the original summary.
*   **Year Context:** The technologies (RL, edge computing) described are very relevant to research in 2023.
*   **CS Focus:** The terminology (POMDP, Reinforcement Learning, Microscopic Traffic Simulator) firmly places this in a Computer Science context.
