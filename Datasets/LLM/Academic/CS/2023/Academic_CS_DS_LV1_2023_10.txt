This paper introduces Carimas 3.0, an integrated software platform for the computational analysis of multi-dimensional tomographic data, with a specific focus on dynamic cardiac perfusion imaging. The system addresses the critical challenge of quantitative biomarker extraction from complex 4D (3D+time) datasets. It implements a modular pipeline for data normalization, motion correction, and pharmacokinetic modeling, enabling robust myocardial blood flow quantification. A key contribution is its unified framework supporting multiple scanner protocols, which enhances reproducibility in clinical research. Evaluated on 85 patient studies, Carimas 3.0 demonstrated a significant reduction in post-processing variance compared to vendor-specific tools (p<0.01), establishing its utility for standardized, high-throughput quantitative imaging analysis.
