Title: Assessing the Interplay between Size, Market Competition, and Risk-Taking on Profitability in GCC Banks: A Dynamic Panel Analysis

Abstract:
This study investigates the dynamic nexus between size, market competition, risk-taking, and profitability in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) banks over the period 2010-2022. Employing the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator to account for potential endogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity, our analysis reveals that larger GCC banks tend to exhibit higher risk-taking behavior, which in turn negatively impacts their profitability. Conversely, increased market competition is found to enhance profitability by promoting efficiency and reducing risk-taking. Our findings suggest that GCC banks' size and market competition are significant determinants of their risk-taking and profitability. The results have important implications for regulatory bodies and policymakers seeking to promote financial stability and competitiveness in the GCC banking sector. The study's insights can inform strategies to mitigate risk and enhance profitability in the region's banking industry.
