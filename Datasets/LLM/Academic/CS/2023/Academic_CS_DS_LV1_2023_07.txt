**Title:** Algorithmic Stability as a Unifying Framework: Replicability, Privacy, and Sample Complexity in Statistical Estimation

**Abstract:**

The increasing demand for trustworthy and reliable machine learning has elevated the importance of three distinct but conceptually related algorithmic properties: replicability, differential privacy, and generalization via algorithmic stability. While their connections have been explored in isolation, a unified framework that formally characterizes their interplay and computational implications remains underdeveloped. In this work, we establish a hierarchy of sample-efficient reductions that systematically translate guarantees between these paradigms for a broad class of statistical problems, including distribution learning and parameter estimation. We first demonstrate that any differentially private algorithm for a statistical task can be efficiently transformed into a replicable one with only a polynomial blow-up in sample complexity, formalizing the intuition that privacy enforces a form of insensitivity to the dataset that directly promotes replicability. Conversely, we prove that algorithmic stability—specifically, uniform argument stability—serves as a sufficient condition for both replicability and differential privacy, providing a unifying lens through which these guarantees can be jointly achieved. However, we also identify fundamental computational separations: we construct natural problem settings in which replicable algorithms exist with modest sample complexity, yet any algorithm satisfying pure differential privacy must incur super-polynomial computational costs under standard cryptographic assumptions. These separations highlight that while these notions of algorithmic robustness are often statistically equivalent, their computational landscapes diverge significantly. Our results provide a principled toolkit for designing robust algorithms, allowing practitioners to port advancements from one domain (e.g., private learning) to another (e.g., replicable science), while delineating the inherent computational barriers.
