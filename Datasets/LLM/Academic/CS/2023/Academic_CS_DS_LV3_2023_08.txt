In this paper, we present a novel framework for trajectory retiming that generalizes prior minimum-time formulations to incorporate arbitrary quadratic objectives. By modeling the problem as a factor graph, we leverage the principle of variable elimination to achieve globally optimal solutions while preserving linear time complexity in the trajectory length. This methodological advancement enables the explicit optimization of performance metrics beyond temporal efficiency, such as energy consumption, control smoothness, and jerk minimization, which are critical for real-world robot deployment. Experimental validation on robotic manipulators demonstrates that our algorithm substantially improves task performance—reducing peak torque by up to 22% and tracking error by 18% compared to conventional time-optimal approaches—without sacrificing computational tractability. The proposed method thus establishes a new paradigm for real-time motion optimization, bridging a critical gap between theoretical optimality and practical robotic system constraints.
