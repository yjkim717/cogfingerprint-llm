**Abstract**

The Time-Windows Travelling Salesperson Problem (TWTSP) is a foundational vehicle routing challenge where requests with strict time constraints arrive sequentially. While classical online algorithms for this problem are constrained by high lower bounds on competitive ratios, the integration of machine-learned predictions offers a pathway to transcend these limitations. This work introduces a novel online algorithm for the TWTSP that leverages such predictions to inform routing decisions. We demonstrate that our algorithm achieves an *O(log n)* competitive ratio under perfect predictions, a significant improvement over prediction-agnostic approaches. Crucially, the performance guarantee degrades gracefully with the magnitude of prediction error, quantified by a natural measure of inaccuracy. This smooth degradation provides a rigorous robustness guarantee, ensuring that the algorithm's performance remains bounded even with highly erroneous predictions. Our analysis formalizes the trade-off between consistency and robustness, a central tenet in learning-augmented algorithms. The results establish that predictions can substantially enhance online routing, bridging the gap between worst-case robustness and average-case efficiency in practical logistics and delivery systems.
