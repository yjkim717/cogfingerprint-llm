Title: Unveiling Complex Neural Dynamics: A Rastermap Framework for Large-Scale Neurophysiology Recordings

Abstract:
The analysis of large-scale neural population recordings poses significant challenges in neurophysiology, necessitating innovative visualization and discovery tools. In response, we introduce Rastermap, a novel framework designed to unravel the complexities of high-dimensional neural data. By leveraging advanced dimensionality reduction techniques and intuitive visualization, Rastermap enables researchers to identify previously obscured patterns and dynamics within neural populations. Our framework facilitates the discovery of correlated activity patterns and temporal structures, offering insights into the intricate workings of neural circuits. Evaluated on diverse neural datasets, Rastermap demonstrates its efficacy in elucidating complex neural dynamics, thereby advancing our understanding of brain function. As large-scale recordings become increasingly prevalent in 2023, Rastermap is poised to become an indispensable tool in the field of neurophysiology, empowering researchers to uncover the intricate intricacies of neural processing.
