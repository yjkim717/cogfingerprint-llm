**Abstract**

This research investigates the application of auction theory to design efficient pen testing strategies within dynamic, online environments. Traditional pen testing methodologies often struggle to optimize resource utilization, particularly concerning consumable supplies such as ink.  We formulate the problem as a deferred-acceptance auction, leveraging combinatorial constraints inherent in pen testing workflows – specifically, the sequential selection of testing vectors and the limited availability of ink levels.  The proposed algorithm dynamically allocates testing resources by simulating auction bids, prioritizing vectors that maximize ink consumption while adhering to pre-defined constraint sets. 

The core innovation lies in adapting auction mechanisms to account for the discrete and interdependent nature of pen testing actions.  Theoretical analysis demonstrates the algorithm’s convergence towards an optimal strategy, balancing exploration of potential vulnerabilities with the practical limitation of ink reserves.  Preliminary simulations suggest significant improvements in ink efficiency compared to heuristic approaches.  Future work will explore the scalability of this framework and its applicability to more complex pen testing scenarios, contributing a novel perspective to both auction theory and cybersecurity resource management within 2023.
