Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided summary and keywords, written in the style of a CS researcher and targeted for a 2023 context. I've aimed for precision and a structured argument, roughly around 178 words.

**Abstract:**

The analysis of high-dimensional neural population recordings presents a significant challenge in neurophysiological data interpretation. Traditional visualization techniques often struggle to effectively represent complex temporal patterns within these datasets. This paper introduces Rastermap, a novel data visualization framework designed to address this limitation. Rastermap leverages a global optimization algorithm to project multi-dimensional neural response sequences onto a one-dimensional manifold, thereby facilitating the identification of recurring patterns and coherent activity within neural ensembles. Our approach differs from existing raster plot methodologies by employing a non-linear dimensionality reduction strategy guided by an optimization function that prioritizes temporal proximity and shared activity profiles. Preliminary evaluations across diverse neurophysiological datasets demonstrate Rastermap's efficacy in revealing previously obscured relationships between individual neuron firing patterns. We anticipate that Rastermap will provide neuroscientists with a valuable tool for exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation, supporting more efficient and insightful interpretations of complex neural recordings. Future work will focus on extending the framework to incorporate spiking statistics and explore its application to closed-loop neuroprosthetic control.
