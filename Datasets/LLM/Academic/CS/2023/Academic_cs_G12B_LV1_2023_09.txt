## A Systematic Review of Social Engineering Attack Frameworks and Lifecycle Models in the Contemporary Cyber Threat Landscape

**Abstract:** Social engineering (SE) remains a pervasive and increasingly sophisticated vector for cybercrime within cyberspace. This paper presents a systematic review of current literature concerning SE attacks, moving beyond simple definitions to analyze the evolving conceptual understanding and formalized models utilized to describe their execution. We synthesize findings across existing research to delineate common SE attack lifecycles, identifying recurring phases from reconnaissance and pretext development to exploitation and post-exploitation activities. Furthermore, we critically evaluate established and emerging frameworks designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate SE risks. The analysis highlights a critical gap in the integration of behavioral science principles within technical security solutions and proposes avenues for future research focused on developing adaptive, human-centric defenses. This review aims to provide a consolidated understanding of SE threats and inform the development of more robust cybersecurity strategies in 2023 and beyond.
