This paper investigates the long-term dynamics of positive solutions in logistic-type reaction-diffusion systems with nonlocal dispersal operators. We analyze how heterogeneous growth rates and nonlinear saturation mechanisms determine asymptotic solution profiles. Through rigorous analysis of both classical and fractional diffusion frameworks, we establish convergence criteria and characterize the spatial structures of equilibrium states in bounded domains under various boundary conditions. Our results reveal how dispersal modalities impact population persistence thresholds.
