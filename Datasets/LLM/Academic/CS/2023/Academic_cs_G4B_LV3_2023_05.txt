**Abstract**

Hate speech detection, a prominent challenge in natural language processing, frequently relies on subjective human annotation, resulting in substantial inter-annotator disagreement. This study investigates methods for mitigating this issue, particularly within the context of model uncertainty quantification. We propose a framework that simultaneously models individual annotator biases and the distribution of opinions across targeted demographic groups. Utilizing a Bayesian neural network architecture, our approach estimates both prediction probabilities and a measure of epistemic uncertainty reflective of annotator variance. Preliminary results, evaluated on a curated dataset of online text, demonstrate a significant reduction in annotator disagreement and improved predictive performance compared to baseline models. Furthermore, the generated uncertainty estimates facilitate a more nuanced assessment of model reliability, highlighting instances requiring further human verificationâ€”a critical step for responsible deployment in sensitive applications.  This work, presented in 2023, contributes to more robust and trustworthy hate speech detection systems.
