"Enhancing Safety in Driverless Traffic Systems: An AI-Enabled Cooperative Framework for Automated Vehicles"

As automated vehicles increasingly populate modern transportation networks, ensuring their safe and efficient operation remains a paramount concern. This paper presents a comprehensive review of multiple vehicle cooperation and collision avoidance strategies in the context of automated vehicles. We propose an AI-enabled conceptual framework that leverages real-time data exchange and predictive analytics to enhance the safety and efficiency of driverless traffic systems. By facilitating cooperation among multiple vehicles, our framework mitigates the risk of collisions and reduces the complexity of navigation in dynamic environments. Through a critical analysis of existing literature and simulation-based evaluations, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving the overall safety and performance of automated vehicles. Our findings have significant implications for the development of next-generation driverless traffic systems, highlighting the potential of AI-enabled cooperation to revolutionize transportation safety in 2023 and beyond.
