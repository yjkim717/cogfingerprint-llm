Title: Globally Optimal Trajectory Retiming with Quadratic Objectives via Factor Graph Optimization

Abstract:
We present a novel algorithm for trajectory retiming that optimizes quadratic objectives while satisfying kino-dynamic constraints. By leveraging the factor graph formulation, our approach recasts the retiming problem as a nonlinear optimization problem, enabling the computation of globally optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm achieves superior performance in real-world robotic applications by minimizing a quadratic cost function that captures the trade-off between execution time and smoothness. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through extensive experiments on diverse robotic platforms, showcasing improved trajectory tracking accuracy and reduced execution time. Our results underscore the benefits of incorporating kino-dynamic constraints within the retiming framework, ensuring dynamically feasible trajectories that satisfy physical system limitations. The proposed algorithm offers a promising solution for real-time motion planning and control applications in robotics, with potential impact on various domains, including manufacturing and autonomous systems.
