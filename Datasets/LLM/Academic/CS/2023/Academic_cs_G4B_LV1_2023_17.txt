**Abstract**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices presents significant challenges in network management and security. Accurate source identification is paramount for efficient data routing, anomaly detection, and robust authentication. This paper proposes a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approach for enhanced source classification within IoT environments.  We detail a system leveraging a deep learning architecture trained on a synthesized dataset representative of diverse IoT device communication patterns. The CNN model, incorporating attention mechanisms to prioritize salient features, achieves a classification accuracy of 99.67% on a held-out validation set.  Experimental results demonstrate the model’s capacity to distinguish between various IoT device types and identify subtle variations indicative of compromised or malicious sources.  Further analysis reveals the network’s resilience to adversarial examples, suggesting a practical solution for bolstering IoT security.  Future work will explore integration with real-time data streams and incorporate federated learning techniques for enhanced privacy preservation.
