Title: Enhanced Online Routing with Predictive Time-Windows: A Logarithmic Competitive Ratio Achievement

Abstract:
We present a novel online algorithm for the Time-Windows Traveling Salesman Problem (TW-TSP) that leverages predictive insights to optimize route planning. By integrating predictions into the routing framework, our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of O(log Δ), where Δ represents the network diameter. This improvement significantly enhances the efficiency of vehicle routing in dynamic environments. Our result advances the state-of-the-art in TW-TSP, demonstrating the potential of predictive analytics in online optimization problems. The proposed algorithm is particularly relevant in the context of modern logistics and transportation systems, where real-time routing decisions are crucial. (2023)
