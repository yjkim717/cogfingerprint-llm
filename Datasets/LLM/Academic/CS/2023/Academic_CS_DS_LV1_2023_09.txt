This study presents a systematic literature review of social engineering (SE) attack methodologies and corresponding cybersecurity frameworks. As of 2023, the escalating sophistication of SE tactics, which exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, necessitates a consolidated analysis of defensive paradigms. We synthesize findings from 85 peer-reviewed publications to map prevalent attack vectors—including phishing, pretexting, and baiting—against established cybercrime lifecycles. Our analysis reveals a critical gap in existing frameworks: a predominant focus on technological countermeasures often overlooks the nuanced behavioral aspects of digital security risks. The paper concludes by proposing an integrated defense-in-depth model that embeds continuous user awareness training within technical controls, thereby aiming to mitigate the significant financial and operational losses attributed to these human-centric attacks.
