This survey presents a comprehensive analysis of cooperative driving frameworks for automated vehicles, addressing critical challenges in multi-vehicle collision avoidance through artificial intelligence. While individual vehicle automation has achieved significant maturity, coordinated decision-making among multiple agents remains constrained by computational complexity and real-time communication limitations. We systematically review existing cooperation paradigms—including consensus-based coordination and game-theoretic approaches—identifying persistent gaps in scalability and robustness under dynamic traffic conditions. To bridge these limitations, we propose a novel AI-enabled conceptual framework integrating deep reinforcement learning with distributed optimization techniques. Our architecture enables vehicles to collectively negotiate trajectories while maintaining safety constraints through hierarchical decision-making: local perception modules feed into a cooperative planning layer that resolves conflicts via predictive modeling. Validation through simulated urban scenarios demonstrates enhanced collision avoidance capabilities with 23% fewer emergency maneuvers compared to baseline methods. This work establishes a foundation for next-generation transportation systems where AI-driven cooperation fundamentally transforms vehicular interaction paradigms.
