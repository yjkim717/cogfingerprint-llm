**Abstract:**

The increasing prevalence of automated vehicles necessitates robust strategies for collision avoidance and optimized traffic flow. Current approaches often rely on localized sensing and reactive control, limiting scalability and overall system efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing techniques focusing on multiple vehicle cooperation and collision mitigation, analyzing strengths and weaknesses within the context of evolving AI frameworks. We synthesize research on distributed decision-making, cooperative perception, and predictive modeling employed in automated driving systems.  Specifically, we investigate the application of reinforcement learning and game theory to facilitate coordinated maneuvers.  A novel AI-enabled framework is proposed, leveraging a hierarchical architecture to integrate these techniques. This framework emphasizes proactive risk assessment and dynamic adjustment of vehicle trajectories based on collective situational awareness.  Experimental simulations demonstrate the potential of this approach to significantly enhance collision avoidance rates and improve traffic system throughput, contributing to safer and more efficient autonomous transportation networks by 2025.
