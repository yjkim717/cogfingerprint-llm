In computational linguistics, annotator disagreement presents significant challenges for subjective classification tasks such as hate speech detection. Conventional aggregation methods like majority voting often obscure valuable individual perspectives embedded in demographic and opinion-based variations. This 2023 study introduces a probabilistic modeling framework that explicitly incorporates annotator demographics and subjective judgments to predict individual rating behaviors. By utilizing non-invasive survey instruments that prioritize privacy preservation, our method constructs nuanced annotator profiles without compromising ethical standards. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this demographic-aware model achieves a 14.7% improvement in F1-score over traditional majority vote baselines across three benchmark datasets. The architecture employs differential privacy mechanisms to ensure demographic data utilization remains compliant with evolving regulatory frameworks. These findings highlight the necessity of moving beyond monolithic annotation aggregation toward personalized modeling approaches that capture the spectrum of human judgment. This paradigm shift not only enhances model performance but also fosters more equitable and transparent machine learning systems in socially-sensitive domains.
