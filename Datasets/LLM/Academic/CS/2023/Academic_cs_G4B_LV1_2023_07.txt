**Abstract**

The increasing reliance on machine learning models in sensitive applications necessitates a rigorous examination of their operational characteristics beyond simple accuracy. This work investigates the intricate relationships between replicability, algorithmic stability, and differential privacy, arguing that these concepts are not independent but rather mutually constraining. We introduce novel statistical reductions demonstrating a fundamental limit to the simultaneous attainment of high generalization performance and robust privacy guarantees. Specifically, we analyze how differential privacy, when aggressively enforced, can detrimentally impact replicability – the ability to consistently reproduce model outputs across independent datasets – via destabilizing algorithmic behavior.

Our analysis leverages recent advances in statistical reductions to quantify the trade-offs involved. We demonstrate that certain equivalencies previously assumed to hold (e.g., between privacy loss and generalization error) are, under particular conditions, demonstrably false. This challenges the prevailing assumption of linear relationships and proposes a more nuanced understanding of how privacy mechanisms fundamentally affect the stability of deployed algorithms.  Further, we explore the implications of these limitations for the design of practical, trustworthy machine learning systems, emphasizing the need for adaptive strategies that prioritize both data utility and algorithmic robustness.  Future research will focus on developing techniques for mitigating these trade-offs.
