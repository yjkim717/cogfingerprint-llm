Title: Exploring the Interplay between Replicability, Differential Privacy, and Generalization in Statistical and PAC Learning Settings

Abstract:
The notions of replicability, algorithmic stability, and differential privacy have garnered significant attention in the machine learning and statistical communities. This paper delves into the intricate relationships between these concepts, providing a nuanced understanding of their connections and divergences. We establish that replicability, a desideratum that mandates algorithms to produce consistent results across multiple runs on the same dataset, is intimately linked with differential privacy, a paradigm that ensures the protection of individual data points. Our primary contribution lies in demonstrating reductions between replicability and differential privacy in the contexts of statistical problems and Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning. Specifically, we show that replicable algorithms can be constructed from differentially private ones, and vice versa, under certain conditions. Furthermore, we provide separations between these notions, highlighting scenarios where replicability does not imply differential privacy and vice versa. Our analysis leverages the lens of algorithmic stability, revealing that stable algorithms are a crucial intermediary in establishing these connections. The implications of our findings are twofold: they contribute to a deeper understanding of the theoretical foundations of replicability and differential privacy and have practical ramifications for the design of algorithms that balance the need for consistent, generalizable, and private outputs. Our results underscore the rich interplay between these fundamental concepts, offering a roadmap for future research at the intersection of replicability, privacy, and generalization in machine learning and statistical inference.
