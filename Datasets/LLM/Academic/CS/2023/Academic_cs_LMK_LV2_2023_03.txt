Title: An Efficient Online Algorithm for Time-Windows TSP with Predictions

Abstract:
We present a novel online algorithm for the Time-Windows Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with predictions, achieving a competitive ratio of $O(\log D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of the underlying network. Our algorithm effectively leverages predicted information to improve its performance in real-time routing scenarios. By integrating predictions into the decision-making process, our approach minimizes the need for costly re-routing and reduces the overall travel time. We provide a rigorous analysis of our algorithm's performance, demonstrating its superiority over existing online methods. Our results contribute to the growing body of research on online vehicle routing with predictions, offering a practical solution for applications in logistics and transportation. The proposed algorithm's logarithmic competitive ratio marks a significant improvement over previous works, advancing the state-of-the-art in Time-Windows TSP with predictions.
