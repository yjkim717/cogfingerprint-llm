**Abstract**

This research investigates the dynamics of financial stability and performance within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) banking sector, employing a dynamic panel data analysis utilizing the GMM estimator.  Specifically, we model the interplay between bank asset size, market competitive intensity, and resultant financial outcomes. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between bank size and enhanced stability, suggesting larger institutions exhibit greater resilience.  Furthermore, increased market competition demonstrably incentivizes both risk-taking behavior and profitability amongst GCC banks.  However, the relationship between bank size and risk is non-linear, indicating a potential threshold effect – beyond a certain scale, increased size does not necessarily translate to reduced risk exposure.  These insights offer valuable considerations for algorithmic risk assessment models and regulatory frameworks governing digital financial institutions operating within the GCC region, particularly as of 2023.
