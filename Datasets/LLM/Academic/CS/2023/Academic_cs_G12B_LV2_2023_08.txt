**Abstract**

Trajectory optimization in robotics frequently encounters challenges in achieving optimal control policies while satisfying complex kinematic and dynamic constraints. This paper presents a novel algorithm for trajectory retiming designed to address these challenges specifically within the context of quadratic objective functions. Traditional trajectory optimization methods often struggle with global optimality and computational cost, particularly when dealing with non-linear constraints. Our approach leverages a factor graph representation of the optimization problem, facilitating efficient variable elimination and enabling the identification of globally optimal solutions through trajectory retiming.  The core innovation lies in a tailored variable elimination strategy that exploits the structure inherent in kino-dynamic constraints, minimizing computational complexity while guaranteeing optimality.  Experimental results, conducted on benchmark robotic manipulation tasks in 2023, demonstrate significant improvements in robot performance metrics, including reduced task completion time and energy consumption, compared to state-of-the-art trajectory optimization techniques. We further analyze the scalability of the proposed algorithm, showing its potential for application to high-dimensional robotic systems and complex planning scenarios. The findings contribute to advancing the field of optimal motion planning by providing a computationally efficient and globally optimal trajectory retiming framework.
