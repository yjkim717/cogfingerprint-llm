**Abstract**

The pervasive heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) presents a fundamental challenge to the development of robust diagnostic tools, particularly as neurobiological markers exhibit significant variation across the lifespan. This 2023 computational psychiatry study by Sengar addresses this critical limitation by proposing a novel, age-specific deep learning framework for ASD classification using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The core methodological innovation lies in the application of DenseNet201, a convolutional neural network architecture renowned for its feature reuse and parameter efficiency, to model whole-brain functional connectivity patterns. Crucially, the research departs from a one-size-fits-all approach by stratifying the dataset into distinct developmental cohorts—early childhood, adolescence, and adulthood—and training dedicated models for each. This stratification allows the models to learn age-dependent, discriminative connectivity features that are often obscured in heterogeneous, cross-sectional analyses. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy for the age-specific DenseNet201 models compared to a generic, non-stratified benchmark. Performance metrics, including precision, recall, and F1-score, were superior across all cohorts, indicating enhanced generalizability within specific developmental windows. The findings substantiate the thesis that accounting for neurodevelopmental trajectories is paramount for precision psychiatry. This work establishes that leveraging advanced architectures like DenseNet201 for fine-grained, age-cohort-specific functional connectivity analysis provides a more computationally rigorous and clinically translatable pathway for dissecting ASD heterogeneity and moving toward biologically grounded diagnostic stratification.
