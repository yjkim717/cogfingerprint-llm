Title: Globally Optimal Trajectory Retiming via Factor Graph Variable Elimination

Abstract:
Trajectory retiming is a critical component in robotics, enabling the optimization of motion plans for enhanced performance and efficiency. This paper presents a novel algorithm for retiming trajectories by optimizing quadratic objective functions, leveraging the factor graph variable elimination technique to achieve global optimality. By formulating the retiming problem as a nonlinear optimization problem on a factor graph, our approach exploits the sparsity of the problem to efficiently compute the optimal solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive experiments on various robotic platforms, showcasing significant improvements in real-world performance compared to existing methods. The proposed algorithm's global optimality and computational efficiency make it an attractive solution for trajectory optimization in robotics. Our results highlight the potential of factor graph-based methods in advancing the field of robotics and motion planning in 2023.
