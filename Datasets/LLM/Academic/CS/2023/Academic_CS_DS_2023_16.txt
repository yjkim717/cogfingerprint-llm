This paper introduces a heterogeneous graph-based deep reinforcement learning framework for dynamic flexible job-shop scheduling problems. We formulate the scheduling environment as a heterogeneous graph that captures complex interrelationships between operations, machines, and jobs. A novel graph neural network architecture processes this representation to extract structural features, which inform the learning of adaptive priority dispatching rules through policy gradient methods. Our approach eliminates the need for manual rule design by discovering optimized scheduling policies directly from the graph representation. Experimental results across multiple benchmark instances demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms conventional dispatching rules in minimizing makespan while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed framework provides a scalable solution for complex manufacturing environments where traditional scheduling methods struggle with dynamic constraints and resource heterogeneity.
