Here's a formal abstract:

"In 2023, the increasing reliance on medical imaging for cardiac perfusion assessment necessitates advanced data processing tools. Carimas, a sophisticated software, has emerged as a vital research instrument for analyzing tomography imaging data. By leveraging its capabilities for visualization, analysis, and modeling, researchers can derive meaningful insights from complex medical images. This paper examines the efficacy of Carimas in processing cardiac perfusion data, highlighting its potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy and inform clinical decision-making. The integration of Carimas into medical imaging workflows is poised to significantly impact the field of cardiovascular research."
