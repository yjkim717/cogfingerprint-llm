**Abstract**

Social engineering represents a persistent and increasingly sophisticated threat within the contemporary cybersecurity landscape. This paper provides a critical review of existing literature concerning social engineering attacks, addressing definitional ambiguities and synthesizing prevalent attack frameworks. The analysis examines the lifecycle of social engineering attacks, from initial reconnaissance and pretext development to exploitation and post-exploitation activities, highlighting common vulnerabilities exploited by malicious actors. We categorize and compare established frameworks like the Kevin Mitnick's Social Engineering Playbook and the Social Engineering Attack Lifecycle (SEAL) model, identifying areas of convergence and divergence. Furthermore, the review assesses emerging trends in social engineering, including the weaponization of artificial intelligence and the exploitation of remote work vulnerabilities. Ultimately, this work aims to consolidate current understanding, providing a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to enhance defenses against these pervasive and adaptable cybercrimes. Keywords: social engineering, cybersecurity, cybercrimes, attack frameworks, lifecycles.
