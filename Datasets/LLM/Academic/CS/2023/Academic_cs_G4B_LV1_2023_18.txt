**Abstract**

The escalating cost and logistical complexities of clinical trials present a significant impediment to accelerated drug development. This research investigates the application of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to address these challenges through data augmentation techniques. We propose a novel framework leveraging VAEs to generate synthetic patient data, effectively expanding the training dataset for predictive models employed in sample size estimation. Specifically, the VAE is trained on existing clinical trial data and subsequently utilized to produce “virtual subjects” exhibiting diverse clinical profiles. 

Preliminary results indicate that incorporating these augmented datasets can demonstrably reduce the required original sample size while preserving, and in some instances enhancing, statistical power for key efficacy endpoints.  This approach offers a computationally efficient means to mitigate resource constraints inherent in clinical research, facilitating faster and more cost-effective evaluation of therapeutic interventions. Further investigation will focus on assessing the fidelity of the generated data and its impact on downstream machine learning models.
