**Abstract:**

Trajectory optimization for robotic systems frequently encounters challenges in computational complexity, particularly when incorporating performance metrics beyond simple time minimization. This paper presents a novel algorithmic framework for trajectory retiming problems characterized by quadratic cost functions, addressing this limitation. Our approach leverages the structured representation of factor graphs and implements efficient variable elimination techniques to determine globally optimal solutions. Unlike conventional minimum-time planning methods, the proposed algorithm explicitly optimizes for quadratic objectives, leading to demonstrable improvements in robot performance, such as energy efficiency or path smoothness.  Crucially, we maintain linear time complexity with respect to the problem size, enabling real-time applicability. Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of the method, highlighting its potential for advanced robotic control and motion planning applications in complex environments.
