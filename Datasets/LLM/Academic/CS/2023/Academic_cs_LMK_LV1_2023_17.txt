Title: Enhancing IoT Device Source Identification using Convolutional Neural Networks with Additive Features

Abstract:
The proliferation of IoT devices has introduced significant challenges in identifying and classifying their sources, compromising network security and management. To address this issue, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based method that leverages additive IoT features to enhance source identification accuracy. Our approach involves extracting distinctive features from IoT device-generated traffic patterns and augmenting them with additional characteristics, such as device-specific protocol attributes and behavioral patterns. The resulting feature set is then fed into a CNN architecture, enabling the model to learn complex patterns and relationships. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 99.67% in classifying and identifying IoT devices, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed framework demonstrates the efficacy of integrating additive features with CNNs for IoT device source identification, offering a robust solution for securing and managing IoT ecosystems in 2023 and beyond.
