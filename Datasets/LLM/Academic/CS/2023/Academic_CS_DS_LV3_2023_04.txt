This paper presents a novel algorithmic framework for optimal pen testing that bridges mechanism design and combinatorial optimization. Building on deferred-acceptance auction theory, we develop approximation algorithms that achieve near-optimal performance while respecting complex combinatorial constraints. Our approach transforms pen testing instances into virtual value maximization problems, enabling efficient exploration of structured hypothesis spaces. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate that our algorithms maintain competitive ratios within logarithmic factors of information-theoretic bounds across both offline and online settings. The proposed methods significantly reduce computational overhead while preserving testing integrity, addressing critical scalability challenges in modern security evaluation. Experimental validation against benchmark datasets confirms practical efficiency gains of 15-30% over existing methods. This work establishes new theoretical connections between mechanism design and security testing while providing implementable solutions for real-world deployment.
