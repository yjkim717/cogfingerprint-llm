In clinical trial research, the persistent challenge of achieving adequate statistical power while minimizing sample sizes presents both ethical and practical constraints. This paper introduces a novel data augmentation framework leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs) to synthesize high-fidelity virtual patient data. By learning the underlying probability distribution of real-world clinical datasets, VAEs generate synthetic subjects that preserve critical statistical properties and clinical variance of the original cohort. Our methodology demonstrates that augmented datasets maintain—and in some cases enhance—predictive performance across multiple trial simulations. Empirical validation shows a 30-40% reduction in required participant enrollment without compromising statistical significance, directly addressing power calculations in underpowered studies. Furthermore, the approach mitigates ethical concerns associated with patient recruitment in vulnerable populations. These findings establish VAEs as a transformative tool for optimizing trial design, potentially accelerating medical research while upholding rigorous methodological standards.
