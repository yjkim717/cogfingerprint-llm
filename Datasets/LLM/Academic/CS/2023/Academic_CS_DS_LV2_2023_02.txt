**Abstract**

The proliferation of high-dimensional data has intensified the challenge of reliable statistical estimation in the presence of adversarial outliers. While classical robust statistics provides a foundational framework, its methods often become computationally intractable in high dimensions. This monograph synthesizes and elucidates the recent, rapid algorithmic advances that bridge this gap. We present a cohesive exposition of computationally efficient estimators for fundamental tasks such as mean and covariance estimation, which remain consistent even when a constant fraction of data is arbitrarily corrupted. By unifying disparate proof techniques and streamlining complex analyses, this text distills the core algorithmic principles—such as convex programming and spectral methods—that underpin modern robust high-dimensional estimation. The result is an accessible graduate-level resource that demystifies the theoretical guarantees and computational tractability of robust methods, equipping researchers with the tools to develop and analyze new algorithms for contaminated, large-scale datasets.
