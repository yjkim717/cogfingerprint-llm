**Abstract**

Recent advancements in machine learning have highlighted the critical importance of ensuring both robust generalization and privacy preservation. This work investigates the intricate relationships between replicability, algorithmic stability, and differential privacy, aiming to clarify their theoretical underpinnings and practical implications. Specifically, we establish a formal connection demonstrating that replicability, a measure of solution consistency under minor perturbations to the training data, serves as a prerequisite for achieving strong generalization guarantees in differentially private settings. Our analysis provides sample-efficient reductions linking perfect generalization – the ability to achieve zero training error and perfect test performance – with approximate differential privacy and replicability.  Crucially, we demonstrate a fundamental separation, proving that a computational equivalence between these properties would necessitate the existence of one-way functions, thereby placing inherent limitations on their mutual attainability. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs between privacy and generalization and inform the design of more efficient and reliable privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these statistical reductions for adaptive generalization strategies, offering insights into how to optimize learning processes under privacy constraints.
