## Rastermap: A Global Optimization Approach to Pattern Discovery in Neural Population Recordings

Recent advances in neurophysiological recording techniques have yielded unprecedented datasets of neural population activity, presenting significant challenges for pattern identification and subsequent cognitive interpretation. Traditional visualization methods, such as raster plots, often struggle to effectively represent and extract meaningful structure from these high-dimensional datasets, particularly when subtle, temporally distributed patterns are present. We introduce Rastermap, a novel visualization framework leveraging a global optimization algorithm to identify and highlight recurring patterns within neural population recordings. Rastermap transforms raw spike trains into a discrete, parameterized representation, defining "raster motifs" characterized by temporal relationships between neuronal firing events. A modified version of a global optimization technique, specifically tailored for this representation, then iteratively refines these motifs to maximize a user-defined objective function – reflecting the desired characteristics of the identified patterns (e.g., synchrony, sequentiality, or specific firing order). This approach circumvents the limitations of local search algorithms often employed in motif discovery, enabling the identification of globally optimal patterns that may be missed by more constrained methods. Preliminary results demonstrate Rastermap’s ability to uncover previously obscured patterns in simulated and experimental data, offering a powerful tool for neurophysiologists seeking to extract deeper insights from complex neural dynamics. Future work will focus on extending Rastermap to accommodate multi-scale temporal analysis and incorporating biologically plausible constraints within the optimization process.
