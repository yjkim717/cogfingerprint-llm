In the expanding ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, robust device identification is a cornerstone for network security and digital forensics. This paper introduces a deep learning framework for the precise classification and provenance attribution of IoT devices from network traffic patterns. Our methodology centers on the extraction of a novel, discriminative feature set derived from packet-level metadata and communication dynamics, which effectively captures unique device behavioral signatures. These features serve as input to a multi-layered convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, optimized for high-dimensional sequence classification. Evaluated on a 2023 dataset comprising traffic from 35 distinct commercial IoT devices, the proposed system demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a mean classification accuracy of 99.2% across multiple operational scenarios. The results substantiate the framework's efficacy as a reliable tool for automated network auditing, intrusion detection, and source identification, thereby addressing critical challenges in modern cybersecurity infrastructures.
