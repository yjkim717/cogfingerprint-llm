**Abstract**

The inherent subjectivity in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly those involving hate speech detection, presents a significant challenge to model training and deployment. Traditional approaches often rely on aggregated annotations, overlooking the valuable information contained within individual annotator judgments and the nuanced perspectives related to targeted groups. This work introduces a novel probabilistic framework for modeling annotator disagreement in subjective NLP tasks, focusing on hate speech identification. Our model predicts individual annotator ratings, explicitly incorporating representations of target group sentiment as contextual features. By moving beyond simple aggregation, we capture inter-annotator variability and the potential for bias stemming from differing interpretations of offensive language.  We demonstrate that this approach leads to improved detection performance, achieving [mention specific improvement, e.g., a 2% F1-score gain] compared to baseline models trained on aggregated labels. Furthermore, modeling individual ratings allows for a quantification of model uncertainty, enabling more responsible deployment by highlighting instances where annotation consensus is low. This contributes to enhanced privacy by reducing reliance on potentially sensitive aggregated data and facilitating the identification of problematic examples requiring human review.  Experiments on [mention dataset(s) used] validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing its potential for building more robust and ethical hate speech detection systems in 2023.
