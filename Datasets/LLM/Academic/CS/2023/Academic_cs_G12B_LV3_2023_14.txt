**Abstract**

The increasing deployment of automated vehicles necessitates robust strategies for ensuring safety and optimizing traffic flow. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing multiple vehicle cooperation and collision avoidance (MVCCA) techniques within the context of evolving autonomous driving systems. We analyze current approaches, categorized by their reliance on centralized planning, decentralized consensus, and hybrid methodologies, highlighting their strengths and limitations in complex, dynamic traffic scenarios.  A critical evaluation reveals challenges related to scalability, communication latency, adversarial conditions, and the integration of heterogeneous vehicle platforms. Addressing these shortcomings, we propose an AI-enabled conceptual framework leveraging reinforcement learning and predictive analytics to facilitate proactive collision avoidance and enhance cooperative maneuver planning.  This framework aims to improve the resilience and efficiency of future driverless traffic systems by dynamically adapting to environmental uncertainties and optimizing vehicle interactions, ultimately contributing to safer and more fluid autonomous transportation networks. Further research directions explore the incorporation of formal verification methods to guarantee safety properties within this AI-driven architecture.
