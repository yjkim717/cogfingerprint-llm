This monograph presents a comprehensive framework for computationally tractable robust estimation in high-dimensional statistical models under simultaneous challenges of adversarial contamination and model misspecification. We develop a unified algorithmic perspective that bridges recent advances in robust statistics with practical computational constraints, establishing finite-sample guarantees for estimators that remain efficient in polynomial time. Our theoretical contributions include dimension-independent error bounds for sparse mean estimation and regression tasks while accommodating heavy-tailed distributions and Byzantine failures. Through rigorous analysis of projection-based methods and iterative filtering techniques, we demonstrate how carefully designed optimization procedures can achieve near-optimal statistical performance without sacrificing computational efficiency. The presented framework provides practitioners with theoretically grounded tools for reliable inference in contemporary large-scale data environments where classical assumptions frequently break down.
