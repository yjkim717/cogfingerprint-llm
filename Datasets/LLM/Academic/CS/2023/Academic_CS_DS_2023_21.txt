**Abstract**

This paper addresses the challenge of providing rigorous statistical guarantees for sequential decision-making systems operating under distribution shift. While conformal prediction has emerged as a powerful framework for uncertainty quantification under exchangeability, its applicability to real-world, temporally evolving data streams remains limited. We introduce a novel methodology that extends risk-controlling prediction sets to environments with unknown, non-stationary dynamics. Our approach leverages an adaptive, time-decaying weighting scheme applied to historical data, which down-weights obsolete observations in proportion to their estimated divergence from the current data-generating process. Theoretically, we prove that this procedure maintains non-asymptotic, probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees on the expected risk for a broad class of monotone loss functions, even in the presence of adversarial or stochastic distribution drift. Empirical evaluations on several benchmark datasets afflicted by concept drift demonstrate that our method dynamically adjusts to changing environments, ensuring robust risk control where standard conformal methods fail. This work bridges a critical gap between the theoretical assurances of conformal inference and the practical demands of modern, non-exchangeable machine learning systems.
