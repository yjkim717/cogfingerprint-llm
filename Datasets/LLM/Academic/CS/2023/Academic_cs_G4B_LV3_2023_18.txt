**Abstract**

This research investigates the application of variational autoencoders (VAEs) for innovative data augmentation strategies within the context of clinical trial design.  Traditional clinical trials often necessitate substantial sample sizes, presenting logistical and ethical challenges. We demonstrate that VAEs can effectively generate synthetic patient data, mitigating these limitations while simultaneously enhancing statistical power.  Specifically, our methodology leverages VAEs to create realistic, diverse datasets, reducing the reliance on extensive primary recruitment.  Furthermore, we explore how this data augmentation technique addresses ethical concerns surrounding participant diversity and potential bias.  Preliminary results indicate a significant reduction in required sample sizes – up to 30% – without compromising data fidelity.  Future work will focus on integrating these augmented datasets into Bayesian sample size estimation frameworks, optimizing trial design and accelerating the development of novel therapeutics.
