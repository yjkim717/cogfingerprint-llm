Title: Algorithmic Advances in High-Dimensional Robust Statistics

Abstract:
In 2023, the proliferation of high-dimensional data has underscored the need for robust statistical estimators resilient to model misspecification and outliers. Recent breakthroughs in algorithmic robust statistics have yielded novel estimators that integrate machine learning theory and robust estimation principles. This paper synthesizes key developments in designing robust algorithms for high-dimensional data analysis, highlighting their theoretical underpinnings and empirical efficacy. By bridging theoretical foundations and practical applications, we illuminate the path towards more reliable and accurate statistical inference in the face of data contamination and uncertainty.
