This study investigates the nexus between bank size, market competition, and risk-taking behavior in GCC banks from 2010 to 2017, with a focus on their impact on profitability. Employing the Two-Step System Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, our analysis reveals a significant relationship between bank size and risk-taking, moderated by market competition. The findings indicate that larger banks exhibit higher risk-taking behavior, while increased market competition enhances profitability. The results have implications for regulatory policies aimed at mitigating risk and promoting financial stability in the GCC banking sector, informing strategies for sustainable growth and risk management in 2023.
