Title: Achieving Human-Like Systematic Generalization through Meta-Learning with Compositional Skills

Abstract:
Systematic generalization, a hallmark of human cognition, enables the recombination of learned components to tackle unseen tasks. Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant progress in this domain. This study demonstrates that a meta-learning neural network, optimized to acquire compositional skills, achieves human-like systematic generalization. By leveraging meta-learning, the network learns to decompose complex tasks into simpler, reusable representations, facilitating the synthesis of novel solutions. Our results show that the proposed model outperforms existing neural network architectures in systematic generalization benchmarks, exhibiting a marked improvement in recombining learned components in unseen contexts. The findings suggest that meta-learning with compositional skills is a key factor in achieving human-like generalization, offering insights into the development of more robust and adaptable neural networks. This work contributes to the ongoing exploration of the intersection between meta-learning and compositionality in achieving human-like intelligence.
