**Abstract**

Recent advancements in Transformer architectures have demonstrated remarkable efficacy across a diverse range of vision tasks. However, the computationally intensive nature of training these models remains a significant bottleneck. This study introduces mimetic initialization, a novel, learning-free technique designed to accelerate Transformer training and bolster performance. Specifically, the method leverages pre-trained weight distributions to initialize the self-attention layers within the Transformer architecture.  Through empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that mimetic initialization substantially reduces training epochs while concurrently achieving improved accuracy compared to standard initialization schemes.  The underlying mechanism capitalizes on the inherent structural similarities between pre-trained and untrained attention mechanisms.  These findings suggest a viable pathway to democratize access to high-performing pre-trained models, facilitating broader adoption and further research into self-attention’s potential within computer vision. Future work will explore scaling and adaptation across diverse Transformer variants.
