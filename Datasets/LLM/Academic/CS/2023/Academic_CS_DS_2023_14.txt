This paper introduces Attentional Template Alignment (ATA), a novel parameter initialization strategy for vision transformers that accelerates convergence and enhances representation learning. Current transformer architectures for computer vision often require extensive pre-training or careful hyperparameter tuning to achieve competitive performance. Our approach systematically initializes self-attention layers to emulate the statistical properties of mature, pre-trained attention heads, effectively providing a structured inductive bias at network inception. Through comprehensive experiments on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection, we demonstrate that ATA reduces training epochs by 32% while improving top-1 accuracy by 1.7% compared to standard initialization methods. The method proves particularly effective in low-data regimes, suggesting its utility for resource-constrained vision applications. These findings highlight the underexplored potential of initialization schemes as an alternative to costly pre-training paradigms in visual transformer optimization.
