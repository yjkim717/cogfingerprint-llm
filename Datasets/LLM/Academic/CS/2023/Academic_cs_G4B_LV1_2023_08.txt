**Abstract**

Efficient trajectory planning remains a critical challenge in robotic systems, particularly when incorporating complex kinematic constraints and performance objectives. This paper presents a novel algorithm for trajectory retiming designed to guarantee global optimality for quadratic cost functions. Leveraging factor graph variable elimination, our approach systematically decomposes the retiming problem into a series of manageable, interdependent subproblems. We introduce a quadratic objective function that directly incorporates desired performance metrics, such as minimizing energy consumption or maximizing smoothness.  A key innovation lies in the implementation of an iterative optimization strategy, utilizing a specialized solver to converge upon the globally optimal retiming.  Preliminary simulations demonstrate the efficacy of this method in improving robot performance across diverse kinematic scenarios, showcasing its potential for deployment in applications requiring precise and efficient motion control. Future work will focus on extending this framework to handle non-quadratic objectives and incorporating real-time constraints.
