**Abstract**

Recent advances in machine learning have necessitated a critical examination of statistical estimation methods, particularly within the context of high-dimensional data. ‘Algorithmic High-Dimensional Robust Statistics’ addresses this growing need, synthesizing current research on robust estimators designed to mitigate the effects of outliers and model misspecification. This work highlights the increasing computational complexity associated with robust techniques as dimensionality escalates, demanding algorithmic innovations for efficient implementation. We explore methods leveraging sparsity and dimensionality reduction to improve estimation accuracy and stability.  Specifically, the paper investigates adaptive estimators and resampling strategies tailored to high-dimensional scenarios, emphasizing their utility in scenarios where data exhibits substantial heteroscedasticity.  Furthermore, we discuss the theoretical underpinnings of these approaches, focusing on asymptotic properties and convergence guarantees.  The presented analysis provides a foundational understanding for graduate students and researchers engaged in developing robust algorithms for machine learning applications in 2023 and beyond.
