**Abstract**

The increasing deployment of automated vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust strategies for collision avoidance and enhanced traffic safety. This research investigates current methodologies for multiple vehicle cooperation, recognizing its critical role in mitigating risks within complex traffic scenarios. Existing approaches often demonstrate limitations in scalability and adaptability to dynamic environments. We propose an AI-enabled conceptual framework, leveraging a hybrid architecture integrating reinforcement learning and predictive modeling, to facilitate proactive collision avoidance. This framework prioritizes distributed decision-making, enabling coordinated maneuvers amongst multiple AVs.  Specifically, the proposed AI framework addresses challenges related to sensor fusion, trajectory prediction, and emergent traffic behavior.  Preliminary simulations indicate a potential for significant improvements in traffic flow efficiency and reduced collision rates.  Future research will focus on validating this architecture through real-world testing and exploring integration with existing intelligent transportation systems, ultimately contributing to a safer and more optimized operational environment for autonomous mobility in 2023 and beyond.
