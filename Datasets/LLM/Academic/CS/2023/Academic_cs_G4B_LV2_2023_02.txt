**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in algorithmic statistics have increasingly converged with the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, necessitating robust statistical methods. This work presents a concise survey of algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics, targeting graduate-level researchers and practitioners. We examine core developments in estimator design, emphasizing techniques that mitigate the detrimental effects of model misspecification and outliers. Specifically, we explore the interplay between statistical theory, machine learning theory, and robust estimation, highlighting recent streamlined proofs that improve analytical tractability. The paper focuses on methodologies leveraging algorithmic approaches – including adaptive estimators and sparsity-inducing regularization – to construct estimators exhibiting enhanced stability and performance under non-ideal conditions.  Furthermore, we discuss current limitations and promising directions for future research within this rapidly evolving field, contributing to a more cohesive understanding of robust statistical inference in high-dimensional settings by 2023.
