**Abstract:**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices presents escalating challenges in network security and management, particularly concerning the accurate identification of device sources generating network traffic. This paper introduces a novel approach to IoT device source identification leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and a system of additive network features. Existing methods often struggle with the heterogeneity of IoT device behavior and the dynamic nature of network environments. Our proposed system addresses these limitations by constructing a feature set comprising both statistically derived and domain-specific attributes of network packets, designed to be inherently additive and robust to minor variations in device operation. A CNN is then employed to classify these additive features, enabling accurate device source identification. Experimental results, evaluated on a representative dataset of IoT traffic, demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 99.67%. This performance signifies a significant advancement in IoT device identification techniques and offers a scalable solution for real-time network monitoring and security applications. Future work will explore adaptive feature selection and integration of temporal dependencies within the CNN architecture.
