**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of machine learning increasingly confronts datasets characterized by high dimensionality and potential vulnerability to adversarial outliers. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent progress in algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics, offering a unified perspective on methodologies designed to mitigate the deleterious effects of data contamination. We examine a spectrum of techniques, including robust estimators based on trimming, masking, and M-estimation, and their adaptations to the high-dimensional setting.  A core focus is on the theoretical underpinnings of these algorithms, drawing on machine learning theory to analyze their statistical consistency, convergence rates, and robustness guarantees under various outlier models, including distributional and adversarial attacks.  The discussion highlights the interplay between algorithmic design and theoretical validation, emphasizing novel approaches that leverage sparsity, regularization, and geometric properties to achieve reliable estimation.  This work aims to provide graduate students and researchers with a consolidated resource for navigating the challenges and opportunities presented by robust statistical learning in high-dimensional spaces, identifying open problems and promising avenues for future research within this critical area.
