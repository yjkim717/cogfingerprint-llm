Title: Optimal Pen Testing via Deferred-Acceptance Auctions in Online Environments

Abstract:
In the realm of combinatorial optimization, the problem of pen testing has garnered significant attention due to its applications in resource allocation and capacity measurement. This paper presents a novel approach to pen testing by leveraging deferred-acceptance auctions, a framework rooted in auction theory. We formulate the pen testing problem as a combinatorial optimization challenge, where the objective is to select high-capacity resources while accurately measuring their capacities. By designing approximation algorithms that operate in online environments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our auction-theoretic framework in achieving optimal solutions. Our algorithms exhibit provable performance guarantees, ensuring that the selected resources are of high capacity and accurately measured. The proposed framework not only advances the state-of-the-art in pen testing but also contributes to the broader field of combinatorial optimization, with implications for various applications in computer science and operations research.
