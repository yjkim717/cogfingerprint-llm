**Abstract**

Effective exploration of high-dimensional neural data remains a significant challenge in computational neuroscience. This work introduces Rastermap, a novel visualization framework designed to enhance pattern discovery through dimensionality reduction and representational sorting. Rastermap leverages a global optimization algorithm to project neural population recordings onto a constrained one-dimensional manifold, effectively capturing salient response dynamics. The resulting data is then presented as a raster plot, facilitating rapid visual identification of recurring patterns and potentially revealing previously obscured relationships.  Preliminary investigations demonstrate Rastermap’s efficacy in identifying metastable states and differentiating neuronal populations based on their collective activity. Future research will explore integration with advanced analytical tools and expand the framework’s applicability to diverse neural recording modalities, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of neural computation.
