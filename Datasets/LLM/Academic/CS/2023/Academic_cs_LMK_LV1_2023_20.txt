Title: Enhancing Neural Population Recordings with Rastermap: A Global Optimization Approach

Abstract:
The analysis of neural population recordings is a crucial aspect of understanding complex brain dynamics. In this study, we present an enhanced visualization framework, Rastermap, which leverages a global optimization algorithm to effectively sort neural responses along a one-dimensional manifold. By applying this methodology to large-scale neural data, we demonstrate that Rastermap significantly improves the interpretability of neural activity patterns. Our approach utilizes a dimensionality reduction technique to identify the underlying structure of high-dimensional neural data, thereby facilitating the discovery of coherent neural assemblies. We evaluate the performance of Rastermap on various neural population recordings, showcasing its ability to reveal nuanced patterns in neural activity. The results indicate that Rastermap outperforms existing visualization methods, providing a robust tool for neurophysiologists to investigate the intricate dynamics of neural populations. By integrating Rastermap into the neurophysiological workflow, researchers can gain deeper insights into the organizational principles governing neural circuits.
