This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of zero-shot learning capabilities in state-of-the-art conversational AI systems across diverse natural language understanding benchmarks. We systematically assess model performance on 24 standardized datasets spanning 8 distinct task categories including textual entailment, sentiment analysis, and information extraction. Our empirical investigation reveals that while contemporary transformer-based architectures demonstrate remarkable proficiency in complex reasoning and inference tasks, they exhibit significant performance degradation in structured prediction and fine-grained linguistic annotation tasks. The analysis further examines the relationship between pre-training objectives and downstream zero-shot generalization, identifying specific architectural limitations that contribute to performance disparities across task categories. These findings highlight critical gaps in current large language models' ability to generalize without task-specific fine-tuning, providing important insights for future development of more robust and versatile NLP systems. The research establishes methodological frameworks for standardized zero-shot evaluation while proposing directions for improving model architecture and training paradigms.
