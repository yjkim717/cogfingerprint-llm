**Abstract**

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT necessitates a critical examination of their role in computer-supported personalized learning. This conceptual paper investigates the dualistic potential of generative AI to function as an adaptive tool for formative assessment and a disruptive agent within established educational praxis. We posit that these models can generate dynamic, context-aware feedback and scaffold self-directed learning pathways, thereby offering a mechanism to address heterogeneous learner needs. However, this capability is counterbalanced by significant limitations, including the potential for generating pedagogically unsound or factually inaccurate content and the risk of fostering over-reliance, which may impede the development of critical metacognitive skills. Consequently, this analysis argues against the unregulated adoption of such technologies. Instead, we propose a synergistic framework wherein educators and AI systems collaborate, with human oversight guiding the pedagogical application of machine-generated outputs. This human-in-the-loop model is presented as a prerequisite for harnessing the benefits of generative AI while mitigating its risks, ensuring its integration supports, rather than subverts, core educational objectives.
