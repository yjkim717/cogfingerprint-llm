Title: Advances in Algorithmic High-Dimensional Robust Statistics: A Survey of Recent Developments

Abstract:
The increasing prevalence of high-dimensional data in machine learning applications has underscored the need for robust statistical methods that can mitigate the effects of outliers and noise. Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in the development of algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics, which have far-reaching implications for reliable estimation and inference. This survey provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in high-dimensional robust statistics, focusing on algorithmic developments that facilitate robust estimation in high-dimensional regimes. We examine the theoretical underpinnings of these advances, highlighting key insights into the interplay between statistical robustness and computational efficiency. Our discussion encompasses a range of topics, including robust mean estimation, regression, and principal component analysis, with an emphasis on the algorithmic techniques that underlie these methods. By synthesizing recent research, this survey aims to provide graduate students and researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field's current landscape.
