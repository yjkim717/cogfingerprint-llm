Title: Rastermap: A Global Optimization-Based Framework for Visualizing Large-Scale Neural Population Recordings

Abstract:
The analysis of neural population recordings is crucial for understanding the intricate dynamics of brain function. However, the increasing scale of such recordings poses significant visualization challenges. To address this issue, we present Rastermap, a novel visualization framework that leverages a global optimization algorithm to embed high-dimensional neural responses onto a one-dimensional manifold. By sorting neurons along this manifold, Rastermap facilitates the identification of patterns and structures within large-scale neural datasets. Our framework is designed to handle the complexities of modern neural recordings, providing a robust and scalable solution for researchers. Through its application, we demonstrate the efficacy of Rastermap in uncovering hidden relationships within neural population activity. By enhancing the visualization of neural data, Rastermap contributes to a deeper understanding of neural processes, fostering advancements in neuroscience and related fields. (2023)
