**Data Augmentation via Variational Autoencoders for Enhanced Statistical Power in Clinical Trial Sample Size Estimation**

Clinical trials are frequently constrained by high costs, lengthy timelines, and ethical considerations related to participant recruitment. Traditional sample size estimation methods often necessitate large cohorts to achieve sufficient statistical power, exacerbating these challenges. This paper investigates the application of variational autoencoders (VAEs) as a novel data augmentation technique within the clinical trial context. We propose a framework leveraging VAEs to generate synthetic data points that preserve the underlying statistical properties of observed clinical trial data, thereby effectively expanding the dataset without requiring additional patient enrollment.  Our approach focuses on optimizing the VAE architecture and training regime to minimize divergence between generated and real data distributions, assessed using metrics such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fr√©chet Inception Distance. We empirically evaluate the efficacy of VAE-augmented data in sample size reduction scenarios across simulated clinical trial datasets with varying effect sizes and noise levels.  Results demonstrate that judiciously applied VAE augmentation can significantly reduce the required sample size while maintaining or even improving statistical power, particularly in trials with limited initial data.  Further, we discuss the limitations and potential biases introduced by synthetic data generation, and propose avenues for future research including incorporating domain-specific constraints within the VAE framework and exploring the impact of augmentation on subgroup analysis.
