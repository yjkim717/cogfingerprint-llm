**Abstract**

In the realm of computational finance, understanding the dynamics of risk-taking and profitability in GCC banks is crucial. This study leverages the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator to investigate the impact of size and market competition on the risk-taking behavior and profitability of GCC banks. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, our analysis reveals the intricate relationships between bank size, market competition, and their resultant effects on risk-taking and profitability. Our findings suggest that bank size and market competition significantly influence risk-taking behavior, with larger banks exhibiting a more pronounced risk appetite. Conversely, heightened market competition is associated with decreased profitability. The insights garnered from this research have implications for regulators and policymakers seeking to mitigate systemic risk and promote financial stability in the GCC banking sector, informing the development of more effective computational models for risk assessment and management in 2023.
