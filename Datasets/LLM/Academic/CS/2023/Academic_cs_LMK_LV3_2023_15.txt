Here's a formal academic-style abstract inspired by the given summary and keywords:

"Recent advancements in large language models have given rise to Code-LLMs, capable of generating high-quality code. This paper explores the novel application of Code-LLMs to few-shot information extraction tasks by reformulating structured output as code. By leveraging the strengths of Code-LLMs in code generation, we demonstrate a paradigm shift in addressing NLP tasks that require precise information extraction. Our approach involves casting information extraction tasks into code generation problems, enabling the model to learn from a few examples. Experimental results show that Code-LLMs achieve competitive performance on various information extraction benchmarks, highlighting their potential for rapid adaptation to new tasks. This work underscores the versatility of Code-LLMs and paves the way for future research into the intersection of code generation and NLP. As of 2023, our findings suggest a promising new direction for few-shot learning in NLP."
