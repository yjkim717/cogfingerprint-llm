**Abstract**

The prohibitive costs and logistical constraints of clinical trials necessitate methodological innovations in sample size optimization. This work investigates the application of variational autoencoders (VAEs) for synthetic data augmentation to address this challenge. We posit that the latent manifold learned by a VAE from an initial, limited patient cohort captures the essential statistical properties of the broader population. By sampling from this learned distribution, the model can generate high-fidelity synthetic patient profiles, or "virtual subjects." We evaluate the efficacy of this approach by augmenting real-world clinical trial datasets with VAE-generated synthetic data. Our results demonstrate that classifiers and estimators trained on these augmented datasets achieve performance parity with models trained on significantly larger, exclusively real-data cohorts, while rigorously maintaining the original data's statistical fidelity. This paradigm suggests that VAEs can effectively reduce the required number of human participants in early-phase trials, thereby accelerating research timelines and substantially lowering associated financial burdens. The integration of deep generative models thus presents a promising, data-driven pathway for enhancing the efficiency of clinical research.
