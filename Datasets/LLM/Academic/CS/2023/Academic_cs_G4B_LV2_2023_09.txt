**Abstract**

Social engineering remains a persistent and evolving threat within cyberspace, necessitating a robust understanding of its operational dynamics. This research synthesizes current academic literature to examine the multifaceted nature of social engineering attacks, focusing on their conceptual underpinnings, established frameworks, and associated attack lifecycles.  We analyze prevalent methodologies employed by cybercriminals, categorized by techniques such as pretexting, phishing, and baiting.  Crucially, the study highlights the critical role of user awareness in mitigating these risks, exploring the efficacy of various training programs and educational interventions.  Furthermore, we assess the limitations of existing frameworks – notably, the MITRE ATT&CK framework – in fully capturing the nuances of social engineering campaigns.  Ultimately, this work contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of this domain, informing the development of more effective defensive strategies and bolstering cybersecurity resilience in 2023 and beyond.
