Title: Enhancing Clinical Trial Efficiency with Variational Autoencoder-based Data Augmentation

Abstract:

The escalating costs and complexity of clinical trials necessitate innovative solutions to optimize resource allocation. In this study, we propose leveraging Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for data augmentation to reduce the required sample size in clinical trials. By learning a probabilistic representation of the original dataset, VAEs can generate synthetic data that captures the underlying distribution of the real data. We demonstrate that VAE-generated data can be utilized to augment existing datasets, thereby enhancing the statistical power of clinical trials. Our results show that VAE-based data augmentation can lead to a significant reduction in the required sample size, consequently decreasing costs and accelerating the development of novel treatments. By integrating VAEs into the clinical trial design, researchers can improve trial efficiency while maintaining statistical rigor. This approach has the potential to transform the field of clinical research, enabling more efficient and cost-effective evaluation of new therapies.
