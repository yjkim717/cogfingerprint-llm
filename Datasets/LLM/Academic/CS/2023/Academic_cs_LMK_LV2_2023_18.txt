Title: Variational Autoencoders for Data Augmentation in Clinical Trials: A Novel Approach to Sample Size Reduction

Abstract:
Clinical trials are a crucial component of medical research, yet they are often hindered by substantial costs and lengthy durations. A significant contributor to these challenges is the requirement for large sample sizes. To address this issue, we propose a novel data augmentation approach leveraging variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate virtual subjects, thereby reducing the requisite sample size. By learning a probabilistic representation of the data, VAEs enable the synthesis of new samples that capture the underlying distribution of the original data. Our results demonstrate that VAEs can effectively augment existing datasets, leading to improved statistical power and reduced sample size requirements. This methodology has the potential to significantly decrease the costs and duration associated with clinical trials, accelerating the development of novel treatments. Our findings highlight the promise of VAEs as a valuable tool in the design of more efficient clinical trials.
