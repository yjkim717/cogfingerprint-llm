**Abstract**

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis often presents challenges due to significant inter-individual variability and the emergence of core symptoms across the lifespan. This research investigates the application of deep learning techniques to construct age-specific diagnostic models for ASD, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to enhance diagnostic precision.  We propose a novel framework employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically extract salient features from resting-state fMRI scans, specifically focusing on measures of brain functional connectivity. 

The methodology involves training and validating multiple CNN architectures on a dataset of fMRI scans from individuals with and without ASD, stratified by chronological and developmental age.  Crucially, the model is trained to predict diagnostic status at multiple developmental stages, moving beyond a single-age assessment.  Preliminary results demonstrate that these deep learning models exhibit improved diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional methods, particularly in identifying subtle, age-related biomarkers associated with ASD.  

Future work will explore incorporating longitudinal data and integrating other neuroimaging modalities to further refine age-specific diagnostic profiles.  This approach holds significant potential for earlier and more accurate ASD detection, ultimately facilitating targeted interventions and personalized support for individuals on the spectrum.  The utilization of deep learning offers a promising avenue for advancing neuroimaging-based diagnostics in complex neurodevelopmental conditions.
