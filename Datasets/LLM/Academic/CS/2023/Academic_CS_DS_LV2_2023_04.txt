**Abstract**

This paper introduces a novel algorithmic framework for the pen testing problem, drawing a formal connection to mechanisms from auction theory. We model the problem of selecting high-value items under combinatorial constraints as a deferred-acceptance auction in an online environment. Our primary contribution is the design and analysis of pen testing algorithms that achieve strong, near-optimal approximation guarantees for a range of complex constraint structures, including matroids and knapsacks. By leveraging the robust incentive properties of the deferred-acceptance paradigm, our algorithms effectively manage the exploration-exploitation trade-off inherent in online decision-making with uncertain values. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrating that our approach significantly advances the state-of-the-art by unifying the design of optimal testing strategies with foundational principles from algorithmic mechanism design. This work establishes a new, principled methodology for resource allocation and selection under uncertainty, with direct applications in online advertising and procurement.
