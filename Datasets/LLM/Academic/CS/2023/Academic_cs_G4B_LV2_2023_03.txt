**Abstract**

This research addresses the challenges inherent in online Traveling Salesperson Problems (TSP) incorporating predictive information, specifically within the context of time-windowed constraints. We present an algorithm designed for an online TW-TSP, rigorously analyzing its performance relative to a benchmark optimal solution. Our core contribution lies in establishing a logarithmic competitive ratio for the proposed approach, contingent upon the quality of provided predictions.  The algorithm dynamically adapts its routing decisions based on anticipated customer arrival times, mitigating the inherent difficulties of static TSP formulations. 

Crucially, we investigate the algorithmâ€™s sensitivity to prediction error, quantifying the impact of varying prediction accuracy on the achieved competitive ratio.  Empirical evaluations, conducted using simulated scenarios, demonstrate a discernible relationship between prediction fidelity and solution optimality.  These findings highlight the potential of predictive modeling to significantly improve the efficiency of real-time vehicle routing systems.  Future work will explore adaptive prediction strategies and integration with more sophisticated constraint handling techniques.
