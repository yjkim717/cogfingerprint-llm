**Abstract**

The proliferation of high-dimensional data has exacerbated the challenges of adversarial outliers and model misspecification, rendering classical statistical methods inconsistent. This paper addresses the critical need for computationally tractable robust estimators that remain effective under such pervasive corruptions. We introduce a unified meta-algorithm for high-dimensional mean and covariance estimation that achieves optimal statistical rates while maintaining polynomial-time complexity. Our framework generalizes several recent advancements by leveraging a novel gradient-descent-based approach on a non-convex objective, which we prove possesses benign geometric properties conducive to global convergence. A key contribution is a streamlined and modular analysis, which decouples the algorithmic and statistical components, thereby simplifying existing proofs and illuminating the core mechanisms of robustness. We demonstrate the empirical efficacy of our estimators on synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming their superiority over non-robust baselines in the presence of adversarial contamination.
