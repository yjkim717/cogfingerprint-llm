**Abstract**

The increasing complexity of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis necessitates advanced analytical techniques capable of capturing nuanced, age-dependent neurobiological patterns. This paper explores the application of deep learning methodologies, specifically the DenseNet201 convolutional neural network architecture, to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data for improved ASD classification. We hypothesize that leveraging deep learning’s capacity for automated feature extraction from complex brain connectivity matrices will enhance diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional statistical approaches. Our analysis, conducted on a dataset of age-stratified fMRI scans, demonstrates that DenseNet201 effectively identifies subtle, age-specific alterations in functional brain networks characteristic of ASD. Results indicate a statistically significant improvement in diagnostic performance, suggesting that deep learning models can effectively mitigate the challenges posed by ASD’s inherent heterogeneity. This work contributes to the growing body of research employing machine learning for neurodevelopmental disorders, offering a promising avenue for personalized diagnostic interventions and a deeper understanding of ASD’s neural underpinnings. Future research will focus on incorporating longitudinal data and exploring transfer learning strategies to further refine model generalizability.
