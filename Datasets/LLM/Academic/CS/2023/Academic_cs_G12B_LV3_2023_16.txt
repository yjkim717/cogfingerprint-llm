**Abstract:** The burgeoning demand for real-time speech interaction necessitates advancements in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems capable of delivering low-latency transcription and translation services. This paper presents Whisper-Streaming, a novel optimization of OpenAI's Whisper model specifically engineered for streaming transcription applications. Addressing the inherent challenges of maintaining high accuracy while minimizing latency in live scenarios, Whisper-Streaming introduces a modified decoding strategy that leverages incremental processing and dynamic beam search management. Experimental results, conducted on diverse benchmark datasets, demonstrate a significant reduction in end-to-end latency compared to traditional Whisper implementations, while preserving competitive transcription accuracy. Furthermore, we evaluate the system's performance across various acoustic conditions and language pairs, showcasing its robustness and adaptability.  The findings suggest that Whisper-Streaming represents a substantial step toward enabling practical, real-time speech-to-text and translation services suitable for a wide range of applications, including live captioning, meeting transcription, and interactive voice assistants. Future research will focus on further reducing latency and exploring hardware acceleration techniques to optimize performance for resource-constrained environments.



I aimed for a formal tone, precise language (e.g., "end-to-end latency," "incremental processing"), and a structured argument outlining the problem, solution, results, and future directions, fitting the style of a CS research abstract.
