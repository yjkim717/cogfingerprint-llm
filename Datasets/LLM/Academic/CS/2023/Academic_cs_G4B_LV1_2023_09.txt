**Abstract**

Social engineering remains a persistent and evolving threat within the cybersecurity landscape, representing a significant vector for cybercrime. This study synthesizes current literature to examine the multifaceted nature of social engineering attacks, focusing on established frameworks and lifecycle models employed by malicious actors. We analyze prevalent techniques, including phishing, pretexting, and baiting, alongside emerging methodologies leveraging psychological manipulation.  Furthermore, the research investigates the integration of social engineering awareness training within established cybersecurity lifecycles – from initial risk assessment to incident response – highlighting critical gaps in current defenses.  The implications of this analysis underscore the need for a more holistic approach, combining technical controls with robust human-centric security strategies to mitigate the substantial risks posed by social engineering vulnerabilities in 2023 and beyond.
