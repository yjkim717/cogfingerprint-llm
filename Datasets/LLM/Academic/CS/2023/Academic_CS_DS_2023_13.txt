In the rapidly evolving domain of side-channel analysis (SCA), the application of deep learning has demonstrated considerable potential for enhancing key recovery attacks. However, the selection of optimal loss functions remains a critical yet underexplored aspect of model performance. This research investigates the comparative efficacy of various loss formulations, including categorical cross-entropy and mean squared error, against a novel SCA-oriented loss function designed to directly minimize key rank. Through extensive empirical evaluation on multiple public datasets encompassing both software and hardware implementations, we demonstrate that conventional loss functions, while effective in general classification, often misalign with the end goal of SCA, which is the rapid convergence to the correct secret key. Our findings indicate that the proposed specialized loss function significantly accelerates the training process and consistently achieves lower final key ranks across diverse neural network architectures and leakage models. This work underscores the necessity of tailoring fundamental deep learning components, such as the loss function, to the specific statistical objectives of side-channel evaluation, thereby establishing a more efficient and targeted pathway for hyperparameter optimization in SCA.
