Title: Exploring the Interplay between Replicability, Differential Privacy, and Algorithmic Stability in Statistical Learning

Abstract:
Replicability, a cornerstone of scientific inquiry, has garnered significant attention in the realm of statistical learning. Recent works have established a nexus between replicability, differential privacy, and algorithmic stability. In this paper, we further elucidate these connections, providing novel reductions and separations for statistical problems. We demonstrate that replicability implies algorithmic stability, which, in turn, yields differentially private solutions. Conversely, we show that differentially private algorithms can be leveraged to construct replicable learners. Furthermore, we establish that the replicability of PAC learning is intimately tied to the stability of the underlying learning algorithm. Our results shed new light on the intricate relationships between these fundamental concepts, offering a more nuanced understanding of the theoretical foundations of statistical learning. As a byproduct, we obtain new insights into the design of replicable and private learning algorithms, with far-reaching implications for trustworthy AI systems. (2023)
