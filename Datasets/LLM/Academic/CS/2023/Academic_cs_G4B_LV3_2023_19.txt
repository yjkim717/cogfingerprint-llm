**Abstract**

The accurate and timely diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remains a significant challenge, frequently hampered by inter-individual variability. This research investigates the application of deep learning techniques to facilitate age-specific diagnostic modeling. Utilizing brain functional connectivity data, we implemented a DenseNet201 convolutional neural network (CNN) to construct predictive models stratified by developmental age.  Our findings demonstrate that this approach yields enhanced diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional machine learning methods, particularly when trained on age-specific datasets.  Specifically, the DenseNet201 architecture’s ability to capture complex feature relationships within functional connectivity networks proved advantageous.  These results suggest that leveraging deep learning, alongside targeted data segmentation, holds considerable potential for improving the precision of ASD diagnosis and informing personalized interventions. Further research will explore the interpretability of these models and their integration with neuroimaging biomarkers (asd).
