**Abstract**

The escalating costs and logistical complexities of clinical trials necessitate innovative data acquisition strategies. This research investigates the application of variational autoencoders (VAEs) for data augmentation within clinical trial design, specifically addressing limitations in sample size estimation and associated expenses. We hypothesize that VAEs can generate synthetic patient data, effectively expanding the training dataset without necessitating increased real-world subject recruitment.  The proposed methodology employs a conditional VAE architecture to produce realistic, clinically relevant data, subsequently utilized to refine sample size estimates through power analysis simulations. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential for VAE-augmented datasets to maintain or even improve statistical power compared to traditional approaches.  Furthermore, the generation of ‘virtual subjects’ via VAEs offers a valuable tool for early-stage trial planning and risk assessment.  This work contributes to the burgeoning field of generative modeling in healthcare, offering a pathway toward more efficient and cost-effective clinical research by 2023.
