Title: Enhancing IoT Device Classification and Source Identification using Additive Features and Convolutional Neural Networks

Abstract:
The proliferation of IoT devices has necessitated the development of effective methods for their classification and source identification. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages additive IoT features and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in IoT device classification. Our methodology involves extracting relevant features from IoT data and augmenting them with additive features to enhance the discriminative power of the classification model. The proposed CNN architecture is designed to learn complex patterns in the IoT data, enabling accurate source identification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an accuracy of 99.67% in IoT device classification, outperforming existing methods. The proposed framework has significant implications for IoT security and device fingerprinting, enabling precise identification of IoT devices and their sources in real-world environments. Our findings underscore the efficacy of combining additive features with CNNs for IoT device classification and source identification.
