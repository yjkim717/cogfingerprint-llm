This paper introduces a novel streaming speech recognition framework that achieves real-time transcription with a latency of 3.3 seconds. The system integrates a large-scale pre-trained speech model with a streaming inference strategy. A key innovation is the local agreement policy, which dynamically determines segment boundaries for low-latency emission. Furthermore, a self-adaptive latency mechanism balances responsiveness and accuracy in real-time. Evaluations on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms conventional streaming methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art for efficient, high-quality live transcription and translation as of 2023.
