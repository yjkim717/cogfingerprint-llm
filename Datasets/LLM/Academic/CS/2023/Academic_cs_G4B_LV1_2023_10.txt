**Abstract:**

The increasing availability of volumetric medical imaging data necessitates robust and adaptable data processing techniques. This paper explores the application of Carimas, a comprehensive image analysis framework, for enhanced medical imaging workflows. Carimas demonstrates significant utility in processing diverse modalities, including computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET), facilitating both 2D and 3D analysis.  Specifically, we investigate Carimas’s capabilities in constructing polar maps, vital for visualizing and quantifying cardiac perfusion patterns derived from tomography data.  The framework’s modular design allows for the integration of advanced data processing algorithms, ultimately supporting the development of sophisticated cardiac models.  Further research will focus on optimizing Carimas for real-time analysis and expanding its support for emerging imaging techniques, contributing to improved diagnostic accuracy and personalized medicine strategies in 2023 and beyond.
