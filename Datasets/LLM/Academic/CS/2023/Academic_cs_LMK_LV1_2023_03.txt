We investigate the Time-Windows Traveling Salesman Problem (TW-TSP), a variant of the classic Traveling Salesman Problem where requests are associated with time windows during which they must be serviced. We focus on the online version of TW-TSP, where requests arrive dynamically and their time windows are revealed upon arrival. We propose an online algorithm that leverages predictions to achieve a competitive ratio that is logarithmic in the number of requests. Our algorithm's performance degrades smoothly as the quality of the predictions deteriorates, ensuring robustness against prediction errors. Specifically, we establish that our algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of O(log n) when the predictions are accurate, where n is the number of requests. We also demonstrate that this ratio degrades to O(log n + η) when the prediction error is η. Our results contribute to the growing body of work on learning-augmented online algorithms for vehicle routing problems, and demonstrate the potential of using predictions to improve the efficiency of online algorithms for TW-TSP.
