In computational neuroscience, the analysis of large-scale neural population recordings presents significant challenges for identifying interpretable patterns in high-dimensional spaces. This paper introduces Rastermap, a novel visualization framework that employs a global optimization algorithm to systematically organize neural responses along a one-dimensional manifold. By leveraging manifold learning principles, our method effectively reduces dimensionality while preserving the intrinsic structure of neural dynamics across diverse experimental contexts. We validate Rastermap through comprehensive benchmarking against existing techniques, demonstrating superior performance in revealing latent neural trajectories during complex behavioral tasks. The framework's computational efficiency enables real-time analysis of terabyte-scale datasets, addressing critical scalability limitations in contemporary neuroscience research. Our open-source implementation facilitates widespread adoption, with applications spanning motor control, decision-making, and sensory processing studies. This work establishes a foundational advancement for exploratory neural data analysis, bridging theoretical neuroscience with practical experimental applications through mathematically rigorous visualization principles.
