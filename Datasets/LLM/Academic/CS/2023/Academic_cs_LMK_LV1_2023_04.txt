Title: Optimizing Combinatorial Auctions with Deferred Acceptance and Virtual Values: A Pen Testing Paradigm

Abstract:
We investigate the problem of pen testing under combinatorial constraints, where the objective is to maximize the total ink extracted from a selected subset of pens. Building on the framework of deferred-acceptance auctions, we develop novel algorithms that leverage virtual values to achieve improved approximation factors. Specifically, we introduce a deferred-acceptance algorithm that iteratively updates virtual values to guide the selection of pens, ensuring that the combinatorial constraints are satisfied. We analyze the performance of our algorithm and establish a tight approximation factor, demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. Our results have implications for a broader class of combinatorial optimization problems, where the judicious use of virtual values and deferred acceptance can lead to significant improvements in approximation guarantees. Experimental evaluations on synthetic datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm in 2023.
