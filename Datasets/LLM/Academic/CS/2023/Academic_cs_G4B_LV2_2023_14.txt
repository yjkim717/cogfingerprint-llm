**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of automated vehicles necessitates robust strategies for coordinated operation and enhanced safety within dynamic traffic environments. This paper presents a survey and proposes an AI-driven framework designed to facilitate multiple vehicle cooperation and mitigate collision risks. Current limitations in automated vehicle performance frequently stem from localized decision-making, demanding a shift towards collaborative planning at the platoon or vehicle network level. We investigate existing approaches to collision avoidance, emphasizing the integration of predictive modeling and decentralized control algorithms. 

Our proposed AI framework leverages a hierarchical architecture, combining a centralized prediction module – utilizing advanced machine learning techniques – with distributed execution layers for localized maneuver planning. Critically, the framework incorporates a novel communication protocol designed to optimize information exchange between vehicles, acknowledging the constraints of real-time bandwidth and potential communication latency.  We analyze the challenges associated with deploying such a system within existing traffic management infrastructure, including data privacy, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and the need for standardized operational design domains (ODDs).  Future research will focus on validating the framework’s efficacy through simulations and preliminary field trials, contributing to the development of safer and more efficient traffic systems reliant on coordinated automated vehicle behavior.
