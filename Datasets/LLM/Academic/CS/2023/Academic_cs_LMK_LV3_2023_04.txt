"Optimal Penetration Testing via Deferred-Acceptance Auctions. 
This paper introduces a novel framework for designing optimal and near-optimal penetration testing algorithms, leveraging deferred-acceptance auctions and virtual value-based allocation mechanisms. By applying combinatorial optimization techniques, our approach accommodates diverse constraints, yielding efficient approximation algorithms. We establish theoretical guarantees on the optimality and computational complexity of our methods. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our framework in tackling complex penetration testing scenarios, paving the way for enhanced cybersecurity protocols in 2023."
