In this work, we establish a formal computational separation between replicable algorithms and differentially private mechanisms for a broad class of high-dimensional statistical problems, resolving a fundamental tension between replicability and privacy. While both frameworks—differential privacy and replicability—provide rigorous notions of algorithmic stability, our results demonstrate that their computational requirements can be inherently distinct. We develop statistically optimal reductions showing that any replicable algorithm for sparse mean estimation and covariance testing can be transformed into a differentially private counterpart with minimal accuracy loss. However, we prove under cryptographic assumptions that certain problems admit efficient differentially private algorithms while requiring exponential time for any replicable implementation, thus revealing a fundamental computational barrier.

Our investigation reveals that perfect generalization, while conceptually aligned with replicability, exhibits an intermediate computational profile. We characterize this hierarchy through a series of reductions and separations, showing that perfect generalization strictly implies replicability but remains computationally separated from differential privacy for specific problem classes. These results provide a unified framework for understanding the trade-offs between stability guarantees in statistical inference. The separations hold for problems including hypothesis testing and parameter estimation, suggesting our findings represent a general phenomenon in algorithmic stability. This work thus establishes a systematic landscape of computational separations that delineates the boundaries of what can be achieved by replicable, perfectly generalizing, and differentially private algorithms across modern statistical tasks.
