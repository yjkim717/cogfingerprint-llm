In 2023, the proliferation of heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) devices has intensified challenges in digital forensics, particularly concerning reliable device classification and source identification. This research addresses the critical gap in IoT forensics by proposing a novel framework that integrates additive IoT traffic features with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The methodology involves extracting and augmenting distinctive device-specific signatures from network traffic data, which are subsequently processed by a customized CNN model for high-fidelity pattern recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 99.67%, significantly outperforming existing methods. This performance underscores the efficacy of data-driven approaches in attributing network activities to specific IoT devices, thereby establishing a robust foundation for forensic accountability. The study concludes that the integration of additive feature engineering with deep learning not only enhances device identification but also provides a scalable, automated solution for security and investigative applications in complex IoT ecosystems.
