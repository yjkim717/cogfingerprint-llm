**Abstract**

This paper investigates the formal relationships between three foundational paradigms in modern machine learning: algorithmic replicability, local differential privacy, and uniform stability. We demonstrate that these seemingly distinct notions of algorithmic robustness are deeply interconnected through a novel framework of sample-efficient reductions. Specifically, we establish that replicable algorithms, which produce statistically indistinguishable outputs across independent runs, can be systematically transformed to satisfy local differential privacy guarantees without substantial loss in statistical efficiency. Conversely, we identify conditions under which locally private mechanisms induce replicable behavior. Our analysis further reveals that uniform stability serves as a pivotal bridging property, often enabling these transformations. To delineate the boundaries of these connections, we provide computational separations showing that for certain high-dimensional estimation tasks, replicability imposes constraints not present in the purely private or stable settings. We instantiate our general framework with concrete applications in hypothesis testing and distribution learning, deriving new replicable algorithms for these problems via private and stable counterparts. These results contribute a unified perspective on reliable and trustworthy algorithm design, suggesting that the synergistic combination of these properties can lead to more sample-efficient and computationally tractable methods for sensitive data analysis. Our work provides a scaffold for translating advances in any one of these domains into progress across all three, with implications for both theoretical computer science and applied statistics.
