Title: Advances in Algorithmic High-Dimensional Robust Statistics: A Machine Learning Perspective

Abstract:
The proliferation of high-dimensional data in modern applications has underscored the need for robust statistical methods that can mitigate the effects of outliers and adversarial noise. Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of algorithmic high-dimensional robust statistics, with a particular emphasis on integrating insights from machine learning theory. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the latest advancements in this burgeoning field, focusing on robust estimation techniques for high-dimensional data. We examine the theoretical underpinnings of robust statistical methods, including concentration inequalities and robust optimization frameworks. Furthermore, we discuss the algorithmic implications of these techniques, highlighting efficient methods for robust mean estimation, covariance estimation, and regression analysis. By bridging the gap between robust statistics and machine learning, this survey aims to provide graduate students and researchers with a thorough understanding of the current state-of-the-art in high-dimensional robust statistics as of 2023.
