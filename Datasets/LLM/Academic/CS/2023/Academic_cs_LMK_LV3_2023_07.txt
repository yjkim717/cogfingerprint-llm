Title: Interplay between Replicability, Differential Privacy, and Generalization in PAC Learning

Abstract:
This paper explores the intricate relationships between replicability, differential privacy, and adaptive generalization in the context of Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning. We establish that replicability, a notion characterizing the consistency of learning outcomes across multiple runs of a randomized algorithm, is intimately connected with differential privacy, a framework ensuring the protection of individual data. By demonstrating sample-efficient reductions between perfect generalization, approximate differential privacy, and replicability, we provide a unified understanding of these concepts. Our results show that an algorithm satisfying replicability can be transformed into one satisfying approximate differential privacy, thereby implying robust generalization properties. Conversely, we prove that differentially private algorithms can be adapted to achieve replicability. These findings have significant implications for the design of learning algorithms that balance privacy, stability, and generalization, and contribute to the ongoing discourse on responsible AI development in 2023.
