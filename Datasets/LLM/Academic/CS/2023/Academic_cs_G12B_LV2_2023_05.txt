**Modeling Annotator Disagreement and Target Group Perspectives for Enhanced Hate Speech Detection**

The inherent subjectivity in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly hate speech detection, presents a significant challenge due to persistent annotator disagreement. This paper introduces a novel approach to explicitly model this disagreement, moving beyond traditional aggregation methods and directly predicting individual annotator ratings alongside inferred opinions of vulnerable target groups. Our framework leverages demographic information about annotators and contextual features of the text to estimate rating distributions, thereby capturing nuanced perspectives often lost in majority-vote labeling schemes.  We hypothesize that accounting for annotator uncertainty and target group sentiment improves both the accuracy and fairness of hate speech detection models.  Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model achieves statistically significant performance gains compared to standard supervised learning approaches, while also providing insights into potential biases reflected in annotator judgments. Furthermore, the ability to estimate model uncertainty associated with individual predictions enables more responsible deployment and facilitates human-in-the-loop moderation strategies. This work contributes a principled method for addressing annotator disagreement, enhancing the robustness and interpretability of hate speech detection systems in the context of increasingly complex online discourse.
