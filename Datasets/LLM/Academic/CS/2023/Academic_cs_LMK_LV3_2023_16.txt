This paper introduces Whisper-Streaming, a novel real-time speech transcription and translation framework leveraging the Whisper model. By integrating self-adaptive latency, Whisper-Streaming achieves high-fidelity multilingual translation with a latency of 3.3 seconds. Our system enhances speech recognition accuracy through optimized whisper-streaming algorithms, demonstrating significant potential for real-time applications in diverse linguistic contexts, as validated through comprehensive evaluations in 2023.
