**Abstract**

The burgeoning volume of neural data necessitates efficient methods for extracting meaningful structure. This work introduces Rastermap, a novel visualization and exploratory framework predicated on the identification of low-dimensional manifolds within neural recordings. Utilizing rastermap, we propose a global optimization technique to dynamically sort neural population responses along a constrained, one-dimensional manifold. This process leverages inherent correlations within the data to reveal latent relationships, effectively reducing the dimensionality of complex neural activity.  Preliminary results demonstrate Rastermap’s efficacy in identifying distinct response clusters and revealing previously obscured patterns in datasets derived from neural population recordings. We hypothesize that this approach offers a scalable solution for analyzing high-dimensional neural data, moving beyond traditional dimensionality reduction techniques and facilitating insights into underlying network dynamics. Further research will focus on integrating Rastermap with adaptive manifold learning algorithms.
