**Abstract**

Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities across a diverse range of visual tasks. However, the underlying mechanisms driving this performance remain partially opaque. This work investigates the internal image representation learned by CLIP’s encoder, proposing a novel text-based decomposition strategy to elucidate its constituent properties. We hypothesize that CLIP’s learned representations are not monolithic, but rather modular, with distinct textual cues activating specific image components.  Employing a transformer-based architecture, we quantitatively analyze how targeted text prompts induce activation patterns within the CLIP encoder’s latent space.  Our findings reveal property-specific roles for these components – identifying segments associated with texture, shape, and object category – thereby providing insights into CLIP’s effective image representation.  This decomposition offers a pathway for improved interpretability and potentially enhanced control within CLIP-based visual segmentation systems.
