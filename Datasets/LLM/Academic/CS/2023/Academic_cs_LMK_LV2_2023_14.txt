Title: Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Automated Vehicles: An AI-Enabled Framework for Driverless Traffic Systems

Abstract:
The advent of automated vehicles (AVs) has necessitated the development of sophisticated collision avoidance strategies to ensure safe navigation in complex traffic scenarios. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of multiple vehicle cooperation and collision avoidance techniques in AVs, highlighting their strengths and limitations. Building upon this analysis, we propose an AI-enabled conceptual framework that leverages machine learning algorithms and real-time data analytics to facilitate cooperative decision-making among AVs. The proposed framework integrates vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, sensor fusion, and predictive modeling to enable proactive collision avoidance and optimized traffic flow. Our AI-enabled framework offers a promising solution for driverless traffic systems, enhancing safety, efficiency, and scalability. The proposed framework is poised to play a crucial role in shaping the future of AVs and smart transportation systems in 2023 and beyond.
