This paper presents Whisper-Streaming, a novel adaptation of the Whisper speech recognition model for real-time transcription and multilingual translation. By leveraging a streaming transcription approach, Whisper-Streaming achieves high-quality, low-latency output, thereby bridging the gap between offline and real-time speech recognition systems. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of Whisper-Streaming in achieving state-of-the-art performance in real-time transcription and translation tasks, as of 2023.
