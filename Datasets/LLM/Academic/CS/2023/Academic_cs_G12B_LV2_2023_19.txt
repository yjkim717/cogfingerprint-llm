**Abstract:**

Early and accurate diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) remains a significant challenge, particularly due to the heterogeneity of presentation and developmental trajectory across age groups. Traditional diagnostic methods often lack the sensitivity to capture subtle, age-specific neurological differences. This research investigates the application of deep learning techniques to brain functional connectivity (BFC) data for improved, age-specific ASD diagnostic modeling. We hypothesize that leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze BFC patterns, stratified by developmental stage, can yield enhanced diagnostic accuracy compared to non-age-specific approaches.

Our methodology involves the acquisition and preprocessing of resting-state fMRI data from a cohort of individuals with and without ASD, segmented into distinct age brackets (e.g., early childhood, school-age, adolescence).  Functional connectivity matrices, representing inter-regional temporal correlations, are then constructed and fed as input to a series of CNN architectures.  We explore various CNN configurations, including variations in filter size, layer depth, and regularization techniques to optimize performance.  A key innovation lies in the incorporation of age as a contextual feature within the CNN, allowing the model to learn age-specific BFC biomarkers of ASD.

Preliminary results demonstrate that age-stratified CNN models achieve significantly higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) scores compared to a single, pooled-age model (p < 0.05). Furthermore, feature importance analysis reveals age-dependent patterns of BFC alterations associated with ASD, providing potential insights into the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying the disorder. This work contributes to the growing body of research utilizing machine learning for neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis and highlights the potential of deep learning to facilitate more precise and timely ASD identification. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, incorporating multi-modal data (e.g., behavioral assessments), and exploring explainable AI (XAI) techniques to further elucidate the modelâ€™s decision-making process.
