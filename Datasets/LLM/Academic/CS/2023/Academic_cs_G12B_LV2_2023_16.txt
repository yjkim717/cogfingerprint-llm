## Real-Time Speech Transcription and Translation via Whisper-Streaming

**Abstract:** The increasing demand for efficient and accurate real-time speech processing has spurred considerable research into low-latency transcription and translation systems. This paper presents Whisper-Streaming, a novel architecture designed to leverage the capabilities of OpenAI's Whisper model for real-time applications. Whisper-Streaming modifies the standard Whisper pipeline to enable continuous, streaming transcription and translation with significantly reduced latency. We detail the algorithmic optimizations implemented to facilitate chunk-wise processing while maintaining high transcription accuracy and translation fidelity.  Experimental results, conducted on diverse speech datasets, demonstrate that Whisper-Streaming achieves competitive performance compared to existing real-time transcription approaches, exhibiting a substantial reduction in end-to-end latency â€“ a critical factor for interactive applications such as live captioning, meeting transcription, and real-time language translation.  Furthermore, we analyze the trade-offs between latency and accuracy, providing insights into the system's behavior under varying computational constraints.  This work contributes a practical and effective solution for real-time speech processing based on a powerful pre-trained language model, pushing the boundaries of accessibility and usability in spoken language interaction.
