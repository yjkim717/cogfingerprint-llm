**Abstract**

This research addresses the challenges inherent in the Online Time-Windows Traveling Salesperson Problem (OTW-TSP), a notoriously difficult variant demanding real-time decision-making under uncertainty. We propose a novel algorithmic framework incorporating predictive modeling to mitigate the impact of imperfect information, a core limitation of traditional online TSP approaches. The methodology leverages a dynamically updated time-window prediction component, estimating future customer arrival times within configurable time-windows.  Crucially, we analyze the competitive ratio of this system, demonstrating its performance relative to offline optimal solutions.  Our analysis incorporates a ‘slack’ parameter, allowing for adaptive adjustments to predicted arrival times and providing robustness against prediction error.  Preliminary simulations indicate a significant improvement in solution quality compared to purely reactive online heuristics, suggesting a viable strategy for practical deployment in dynamic logistical environments. Further investigation will focus on scaling and incorporating ensemble prediction techniques.
