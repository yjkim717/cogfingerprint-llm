**Abstract: Trade-offs Between Algorithmic Replicability, Differential Privacy, and Generalization in Modern Machine Learning**

The increasing reliance on machine learning (ML) models across critical domains necessitates rigorous scrutiny of their robustness and trustworthiness. This work investigates the complex interplay between algorithmic replicability, differential privacy (DP), and generalization error, identifying fundamental trade-offs and inherent limitations within contemporary ML paradigms. We formally establish connections between these concepts, demonstrating that achieving strong generalization guarantees while simultaneously ensuring replicability and stringent DP often presents a significant computational challenge.

Specifically, we present reductions illustrating how replicability, defined as the ability to consistently reproduce model outcomes given identical training data and hyperparameters, can be leveraged to bound generalization error. However, we also demonstrate that incorporating DP mechanisms, particularly those providing ε-DP, introduces a fundamental barrier to achieving perfect generalization while maintaining replicability. Our analysis reveals that the privacy budget (ε) directly impacts the potential for model instability, hindering the preservation of previously observed replicable behavior. Further, we explore the implications of sample-efficient reductions – techniques designed to minimize data requirements – in this context, showing that the benefits of such approaches can be severely curtailed when constrained by DP requirements and the need for replicable results.

Our findings highlight a critical tension: enhancing privacy and replicability can compromise generalization performance, and vice versa. We propose avenues for future research, including the exploration of novel DP mechanisms that minimize disruption to algorithmic stability, the development of adaptive privacy budgets tailored to specific application contexts, and the investigation of meta-learning approaches designed to learn robust representations that generalize well under various privacy constraints. Ultimately, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the foundational trade-offs shaping the design and deployment of trustworthy and reliable ML systems.
