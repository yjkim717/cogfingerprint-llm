In clinical trials, prohibitive sample size requirements and ethical constraints surrounding patient recruitment present persistent challenges. This research investigates variational autoencoders (VAEs) as a mechanism for synthetic data augmentation to mitigate these issues. We posit that by learning the underlying probability distribution of real, high-dimensional clinical datasets, VAEs can generate high-fidelity virtual subjects. Our methodology involves training a VAE on a real-world clinical dataset and subsequently sampling from its latent space to produce synthetic cohorts. The generated data is rigorously evaluated by comparing the statistical power of analyses conducted on hybrid (real + synthetic) datasets against those using only the original data. Results from our 2023 experiments demonstrate that VAE-generated data preserves the multivariate statistical properties of the source material. Consequently, the required sample size for achieving a target statistical power is significantly reduced without compromising analytical integrity. This approach offers a principled, data-driven pathway to accelerate clinical research while upholding ethical standards for data usage.
