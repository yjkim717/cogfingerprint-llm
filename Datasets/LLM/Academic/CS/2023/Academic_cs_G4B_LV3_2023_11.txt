**Abstract**

Self-labeled clustering techniques, while offering scalability, often struggle with maintaining accurate class representation due to inherent ambiguities in unlabeled data. This research introduces ‘collision cross-entropy,’ a novel loss function designed to mitigate these challenges. Collision cross-entropy leverages soft class labels and strategically maximizes the divergence between predicted and unobserved true class distributions, thereby fostering more robust clustering.  We demonstrate that this approach surpasses traditional Shannon’s cross-entropy in scenarios demanding high fidelity in self-supervised learning.  Specifically, our experiments utilizing deep clustering methods reveal a marked improvement in cluster quality metrics, notably a reduction in intra-cluster variance and an increase in inter-cluster separation.  Furthermore, the integration of collision cross-entropy with shannon’s cross-entropy provides a refined framework for optimizing deep clustering algorithms, ultimately enhancing predictive performance and promoting more stable and interpretable model outcomes within the evolving landscape of unsupervised representation learning in 2023.
