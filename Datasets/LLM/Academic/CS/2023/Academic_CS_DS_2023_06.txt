This study investigates the interplay between organizational scale, market structure, and performance outcomes in cloud service providers (CSPs) operating in competitive digital ecosystems. Drawing on a panel dataset of major CSPs from 2018 to 2023, we employ system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators to address endogeneity concerns while analyzing how infrastructure scale and market concentration influence both risk exposure and profitability metrics. Our empirical framework reveals a non-linear relationship between CSP size and operational risk, characterized by an inverted U-shaped curve where moderate-scale providers exhibit higher vulnerability than both smaller agile firms and large established platforms. Furthermore, we find that intensified market competition correlates with strategic risk-taking in service diversification, yet this relationship is moderated by the provider's existing market position. The results highlight the complex trade-offs CSPs face when scaling operations in contested markets, suggesting that optimal growth strategies must balance expansion benefits against emerging risk profiles. These findings contribute to the evolving literature on digital infrastructure economics and have implications for strategic planning in cloud computing enterprises.
