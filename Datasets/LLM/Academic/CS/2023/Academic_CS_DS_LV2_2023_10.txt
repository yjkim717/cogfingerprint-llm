This paper presents Carimas, an open-source computational framework for multimodal medical image analysis. The system integrates advanced data processing pipelines specifically optimized for cardiac perfusion studies using PET/CT imaging. We demonstrate its architecture supporting n-dimensional data visualization, quantitative feature extraction, and physiological modeling through modular components. Validation on clinical datasets shows significant improvements in workflow efficiency and reproducibility compared to conventional tools. The 2023 implementation introduces machine learning-enhanced segmentation and cloud-compatible processing modules. This work contributes to computational medicine by providing an extensible platform that bridges clinical imaging data with computational analysis methods, addressing critical needs in quantitative precision medicine.
