Title: Enhancing Model Transparency through Explainable AI Techniques in Deep Learning Frameworks

Abstract:

As deep learning models continue to permeate various domains, the need for transparency and interpretability in their decision-making processes has become increasingly paramount. In 2023, the proliferation of complex AI systems has underscored the importance of Explainable AI (XAI) in fostering trust and accountability. This study investigates the integration of XAI techniques within deep learning frameworks to enhance model interpretability. We propose a novel XAI framework that leverages saliency maps and feature attribution methods to provide insights into the decision-making processes of deep neural networks. Our empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed framework in providing accurate and interpretable explanations. The results indicate a significant improvement in model transparency, thereby facilitating the adoption of deep learning models in high-stakes applications. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse on XAI, highlighting its potential to reshape the landscape of AI research and development. By advancing the field of XAI, we aim to promote responsible AI innovation and enhance the reliability of AI systems.
