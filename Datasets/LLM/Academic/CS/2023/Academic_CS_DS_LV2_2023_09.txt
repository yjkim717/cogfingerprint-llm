This systematic literature review synthesizes current research on social engineering attacks within cybersecurity. Through rigorous analysis of peer-reviewed publications (2018-2023), we identify evolving attack vectors and evaluate existing mitigation frameworks. Our methodology employs structured content analysis to map the attack lifecycle from reconnaissance to exploitation. Findings reveal significant gaps in organizational preparedness and technical countermeasures, particularly regarding AI-enhanced social engineering tactics. The study contributes a refined conceptual framework for understanding attack mechanisms and proposes directions for future research in developing adaptive defense systems capable of addressing increasingly sophisticated human-centric cyber threats.
