**Abstract**

This research investigates the dynamics of risk management and profitability within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) banking sector, utilizing a dynamic panel data approach and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation.  Employing a dataset spanning 2010-2017, we analyze the influence of bank size and market competition on key performance indicators—specifically, risk-taking behavior and overall profitability—among GCC banks.  Our methodology addresses potential endogeneity concerns inherent in examining these relationships, providing a more robust assessment than traditional static panel models. 

The study posits that increased bank size, coupled with heightened market competition, may incentivize greater asset concentration and, consequently, increased risk exposure.  Furthermore, the analysis explores the potential moderating effects of market structure on the relationship between bank size and risk profiles.  Findings contribute to a deeper understanding of operational vulnerabilities within a specific regional financial context.  The results offer valuable insights for regulators and practitioners seeking to promote stability and sustainable growth within the GCC banking system, with implications extending to broader research on financial network dynamics and systemic risk.
