**Abstract**

This research addresses the challenges of online optimization within the Time-Windows Traveling Salesperson Problem (tw-TSP) variant.  We present a novel algorithm leveraging predictive modeling to mitigate the inherent difficulties of dynamic constraints.  The core contribution lies in demonstrating a competitive ratio of O(log n) for the proposed approach, where *n* represents the number of time windows, under reasonable prediction error bounds.  Crucially, we analyze the sensitivity of the algorithm’s performance to the accuracy of its predictions, quantifying the impact of slack variables in managing temporal uncertainties.  Experimental evaluations, conducted on synthetic and real-world tw-TSP instances, reveal a strong correlation between prediction quality and solution optimality.  These findings provide valuable insights into the practical application of online optimization techniques and highlight the potential of predictive analytics for enhancing efficiency in constrained routing problems.
