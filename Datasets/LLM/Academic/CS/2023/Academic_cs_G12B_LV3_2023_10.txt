**Abstract**

The increasing volume and complexity of medical imaging data necessitate advanced data processing techniques. This work examines Carimas, a software platform initially developed for positron emission tomography (PET) image analysis, and its evolving capabilities in handling diverse medical imaging modalities. Our analysis highlights Carimas’ robust architecture for processing three- and four-dimensional datasets, demonstrating its particular efficacy in cardiac perfusion modeling. The platform’s strengths lie in its flexible data handling and sophisticated algorithms for quantitative image analysis, enabling researchers and clinicians to extract detailed physiological information. We discuss recent advancements in Carimas that support integration with emerging imaging technologies and standardized data formats, addressing challenges related to inter-modality data fusion and improved visualization techniques. Furthermore, this abstract explores the computational efficiency of Carimas’ algorithms concerning large datasets, a critical consideration for contemporary clinical workflows, and outlines ongoing research focused on incorporating machine learning techniques to enhance perfusion quantification and diagnostic accuracy in 2023.
