**Abstract**

Trajectory retiming, the process of reordering robot movements to minimize execution time, presents a significant challenge in achieving optimal robot performance. Traditional trajectory optimization frequently relies on minimum-time objectives, which can inadvertently compromise kinematic feasibility or lead to suboptimal solutions. This paper introduces a novel algorithm leveraging factor graph variable elimination to address this limitation, enabling globally optimal trajectory retiming for systems employing quadratic cost functions. Our approach reformulates the retiming problem as a probabilistic inference task, facilitating efficient computation through a factor graph representation. This allows for the systematic elimination of redundant variables, dramatically reducing computational complexity compared to conventional methods. 

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms trajectory optimization based on minimum-time objectives, achieving superior robot performance metrics – specifically, reduced execution time and improved kinematic smoothness – across a range of benchmark scenarios.  We highlight the algorithm’s adaptability to diverse robot kinematics and quadratic cost functions, suggesting its potential for widespread application in real-time robot control and motion planning.  Further research will investigate scaling strategies for complex, high-dimensional trajectory retiming problems.
