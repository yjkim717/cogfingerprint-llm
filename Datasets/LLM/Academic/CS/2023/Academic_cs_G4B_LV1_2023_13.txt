**Abstract**

Recent advances in meta-learning have yielded promising results in adapting to novel tasks, yet achieving robust, human-like generalization remains a significant challenge. This work introduces a novel meta-learning architecture leveraging compositional skill acquisition to address this limitation. Our approach, termed “Cognitive Gradient Networks” (CGNs), trains a neural network to optimize for a hierarchy of increasingly complex, compositional skills – representing fundamental problem-solving strategies. Unlike traditional symbolic models constrained by predefined rules and unstructured neural networks reliant on brute-force learning, CGNs exhibit systematic generalization capabilities. 

Through extensive experimentation on diverse compositional reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that CGNs achieve performance levels comparable to human performance, indicating a fundamental shift towards more interpretable and efficient generalization.  Crucially, we provide empirical evidence suggesting that the learned compositional skills directly correlate with improved performance on unseen, related tasks. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of how neural networks can emulate cognitive processes and represents a step towards more adaptable and generalizable AI systems.
