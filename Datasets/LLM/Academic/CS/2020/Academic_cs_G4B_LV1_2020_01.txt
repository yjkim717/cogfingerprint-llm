**Abstract**

Recent advances in image-to-image translation have largely relied on paired training data, presenting a significant bottleneck for applications requiring extensive, diverse datasets. This work addresses this limitation by proposing a novel contrastive learning framework for unpaired image-to-image translation. Our method, termed “PatchMutual,” leverages a patch-based approach to learn robust feature representations by maximizing mutual information between corresponding image patches from the source and target domains.  Crucially, the contrastive objective operates without explicit paired examples, enabling training on inherently unpaired datasets. We demonstrate that PatchMutual significantly enhances the perceptual quality of translated images, as measured by Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), while concurrently reducing the number of training epochs required to converge. Preliminary results indicate a substantial improvement over existing unpaired translation techniques, suggesting a promising direction for generalizing image translation models to real-world scenarios.
