Abstract: This systematic investigation examines the evolving paradigm of multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT), a cornerstone of cross-lingual communication in an increasingly interconnected digital landscape. While traditional bilingual systems are constrained by the availability of high-quality parallel corpora for specific language pairs, MNMT frameworks leverage transfer learning to enable knowledge sharing across languages. This survey critically analyzes three dominant architectural approaches: one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many translation models, evaluating their efficacy in handling both high-resource and low-resource languages. Our analysis reveals a persistent trade-off: while transfer learning demonstrably enhances translation quality for linguistically similar or low-resource pairs, it often incurs a measurable performance degradation on high-resource languagesâ€”a phenomenon termed "negative interference." Furthermore, we assess the impact of data scaling, model capacity, and sophisticated training techniques like meta-learning on mitigating these limitations. The findings underscore that the strategic construction of multilingual models, informed by linguistic typology, is paramount. We conclude by delineating promising research avenues for 2020, including dynamic architectures and unsupervised adaptation methods, which are critical for developing truly robust and equitable MNMT systems capable of universal language coverage.
