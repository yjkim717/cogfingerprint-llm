**Abstract**

This paper introduces a novel computational framework for modeling delayed feedback dynamics in distributed systems, inspired by pharmacokinetic principles. We formulate the problem of resource allocation under propagation delays as a system of delay differential equations (DDEs), analogous to models of gastric emptying in physiological systems. The core challenge addressed is the accurate characterization and integration of non-instantaneous, state-dependent delays—such as network latency or processing queue times—into a predictive control model. Our methodology employs a population-based analysis to infer delay distributions across a heterogeneous set of network nodes, moving beyond point estimates to capture systemic variability. We validate our model using a simulated task-scheduling scenario, where a "master" node dispatches computational jobs to "worker" nodes. Results demonstrate that our DDE-based controller significantly reduces resource contention and improves throughput predictability by 18% compared to conventional, delay-ignorant schedulers, particularly under high-load, bursty traffic conditions. This work establishes a formal bridge between control theory and distributed systems engineering, providing a robust mathematical toolset for designing latency-aware algorithms in large-scale, asynchronous computing environments.
