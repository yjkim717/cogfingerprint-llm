**Abstract**

The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been critically dependent on the veracity of epidemiological data reported by national authorities. Discrepancies in testing regimes, reporting standards, and potential political influence raise significant concerns regarding data integrity, thereby complicating international coordination and modeling efforts. This paper proposes a novel application of data forensics to assess the reliability of national COVID-19 case reports through the lens of Zipfâ€™s Law, a robust statistical regularity describing power-law distributions prevalent in complex systems. We hypothesize that, in the absence of systematic manipulation, the distribution of new daily cases across a large set of countries should conform to a Zipfian distribution, as the pandemic's spread is influenced by universal factors of population density, connectivity, and stochastic transmission dynamics.

We analyze time-series data of confirmed cases for over 150 countries during the first wave (January-June 2020). Our methodology involves fitting a power-law model to the ranked country-case data and employing maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to determine the scaling parameter. The goodness-of-fit is rigorously evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, and we compute p-values to quantify the statistical significance of observed deviations. Nations whose reported data consistently and significantly deviate from the expected power-law are flagged as statistical outliers, suggesting potential anomalies in their reporting practices. Our preliminary findings identify several such outliers, with the case of China presenting a pronounced deviation, warranting further investigation. This work establishes a computationally efficient, unsupervised framework for data validation, providing a quantitative, evidence-based tool for auditing international health data during a global crisis.
