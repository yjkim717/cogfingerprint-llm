In this work, we establish a comprehensive characterization of static pricing policies within the framework of multi-unit prophet inequalities, addressing a fundamental tension in revenue management. Our analysis reveals that supply efficiency is critically moderated by inventory size: for moderate supply levels, static pricing achieves a constant-factor approximation to the optimal online policy, effectively balancing the trade-off between market penetration and surplus extraction from high-valuation buyers. However, we demonstrate that this performance guarantee deteriorates under both very low and very high supply regimes, where dynamic pricing dominates. These findings, contextualized within 2020's algorithmic pricing literature, provide sharp theoretical boundaries for when simple, interpretable pricing schemes can be deployed without significant revenue loss, offering practical insights for platform and e-commerce operations.
