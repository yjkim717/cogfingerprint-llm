This paper presents a reinforcement learning framework for dynamic threat assessment in autonomous driving systems operating in multi-vehicle scenarios. The proposed methodology addresses the critical challenge of preventing chain collision accidents through real-time risk evaluation and proactive decision-making. Our approach formulates threat assessment as a sequential decision-making problem, where the autonomous agent learns optimal safety policies through interaction with complex traffic environments. The framework integrates vehicle dynamics, environmental constraints, and predictive modeling to quantify collision risks among multiple interacting vehicles. Experimental validation demonstrates that our reinforcement learning-based system significantly outperforms conventional rule-based methods in collision avoidance metrics while maintaining traffic efficiency. This research contributes to the safety assurance of autonomous vehicles by providing an adaptive threat assessment mechanism capable of handling complex multi-vehicle interactions, representing a substantial advancement toward deployable autonomous driving technology.
