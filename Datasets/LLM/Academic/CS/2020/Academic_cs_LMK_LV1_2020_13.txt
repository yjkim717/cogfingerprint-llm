Title: Evaluating the Cognitive Plausibility of NLP Systems: A Comparative Analysis of Human and Machine Word Meaning Representations

Abstract:
The efficacy of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems is often predicated on their ability to accurately represent word meaning. However, the extent to which these representations align with human cognition remains an open question. This study undertakes a comparative analysis of human word similarity judgments and machine-generated representations, leveraging psychological theories of semantic processing to assess the cognitive plausibility of contemporary NLP models. Our results highlight significant discrepancies between human and machine representations, underscoring the limitations of current approaches. We identify promising avenues for grounding NLP systems in cognitively plausible frameworks, including multimodal learning and embodied cognition. By integrating insights from psychology and cognitive science, we demonstrate the potential for more human-like language understanding in NLP systems. This research contributes to the ongoing effort to develop more sophisticated and cognitively informed NLP architectures, with implications for the design of more effective and interpretable language models.
