**Optimal Resource Allocation Under Stochastic Income: A Min-Max Welfare Model**

This research investigates the problem of optimal subsidy allocation within a dynamic welfare model, explicitly accounting for the impact of income shocks. Traditional welfare analysis often relies on static assessments, failing to capture the systemic consequences of fluctuating economic conditions. We propose a novel framework utilizing a min-max objective function, designed to simultaneously minimize the maximum potential welfare loss across a population subject to stochastic income variations.  Our methodology incorporates wealth distribution as a key factor, recognizing that subsidy allocations should not only address immediate income deficits but also mitigate long-term vulnerability. Through simulations utilizing a discrete-time agent-based model, we demonstrate that incorporating income shocks and wealth considerations yields a significantly improved measure of welfare compared to purely income-based subsidy schemes.  The results suggest that adaptive subsidy allocation strategies are crucial for maximizing societal well-being in uncertain economic environments.  Future work will explore the integration of this model with reinforcement learning techniques.

**Notes on Choices & Justification:**

*   **CS Context:** Iâ€™ve framed it as a resource allocation problem, a common theme in operations research and algorithmic design, which lends itself well to a CS audience.
*   **Min-Max Objective:**  I directly referenced the specified objective function.
*   **Stochastic Income & Welfare:**  I used precise terminology (stochastic, welfare) and connected these concepts clearly.
*   **Agent-Based Model:** This suggests a modeling approach frequently used in CS for simulating complex systems.
*   **2020 Context:** The language and phrasing are consistent with academic writing styles common in that period.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: problem definition, proposed method, results, and future directions.
*   **Word Count:** Approximately 158 words.
