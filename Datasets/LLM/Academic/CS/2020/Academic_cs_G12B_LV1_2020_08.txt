**Globally Optimal Rotation Averaging via Manifold-Constrained Semidefinite Programming**

The problem of rotation averaging – synthesizing a single rotation that minimizes the weighted sum of angular errors between a set of observed rotations – arises frequently in computer vision applications such as structure-from-motion and sensor fusion. While efficient iterative algorithms exist, guaranteeing global optimality remains a challenge due to the non-Euclidean nature of the rotation manifold. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation to achieve globally optimal solutions. We formulate the rotation averaging problem as a constrained optimization problem on SO(3), and propose a relaxation that allows for the incorporation of rotation constraints within an SDP framework.  Specifically, we adapt the Shonan Rotation Averaging technique, refining its implementation for enhanced computational efficiency.  Experimental results, conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate that our method consistently converges to the global optimum, outperforming traditional iterative methods in scenarios with ambiguous rotation sets and noisy observations. We further analyze the computational complexity, showing scalability to datasets containing hundreds of rotations, solidifying its utility for large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Focus on SDP Relaxation:** The core of the original summary is SDP. I emphasized it throughout, as it's the key technical contribution.
*   **"Manifold-Constrained":** This accurately reflects the problem's nature and differentiates it from simpler Euclidean optimizations.
*   **SO(3):** Specifying the rotation group (Special Orthogonal group of dimension 3) adds precision.
*   **"Refining its implementation":**  Acknowledges the Shonan method while implying improvements.
*   **Ambiguous/Noisy Data:** Highlights the advantage of global optimality – iterative methods often fail in these cases.
*   **Scalability:**  Mentioning scalability is important for practical applicability in 2020 (and beyond).
*   **Structure-from-Motion (SFM) & Sensor Fusion:**  Grounding the problem in relevant application areas.
*   **Year Context (2020):**  The language and focus reflect the state of the field around that time – a greater emphasis on practical scalability and robustness.
*   **Formal Tone:**  Use of phrases like "This paper introduces...", "We formulate...", "Experimental results demonstrate..." maintains a formal academic tone.
