**Abstract**

The proliferation of visual data has fueled significant advancements in computer vision, with image segmentation emerging as a critical task for scene understanding. This survey examines the substantial progress achieved through deep learning approaches to image segmentation, specifically focusing on semantic and instance segmentation paradigms. We present a comprehensive overview of prevalent architectures, including fully convolutional networks (FCNs), U-Nets, and Mask R-CNN, detailing their strengths and limitations in addressing challenges such as boundary delineation, object occlusion, and class imbalance. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of recent innovations, including attention mechanisms and generative adversarial networks (GANs), on segmentation performance. This review highlights current research trends, including weakly-supervised and unsupervised segmentation, and identifies key areas for future investigation, such as improved robustness to domain shifts and the development of more efficient and interpretable models. Ultimately, this work aims to provide a structured resource for researchers navigating the rapidly evolving landscape of deep learning-based image segmentation, positioning it for continued progress in 2020 and beyond.
