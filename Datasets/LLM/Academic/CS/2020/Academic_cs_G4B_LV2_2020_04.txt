**Abstract**

This research investigates the optimization of scoring rules within the context of probabilistic forecasting, specifically addressing scenarios involving binary effort expenditure.  We formulate the problem as a dynamic optimization challenge, seeking to maximize a forecaster’s expected payoff—a key metric for evaluating predictive performance.  Employing algorithmic techniques, we demonstrate the identification of scoring rules exhibiting near-optimal performance characteristics, even within complex and computationally demanding settings.  Central to our methodology is the incorporation of posterior belief, representing the forecaster’s evolving confidence in their predictions following observation of evidence.  The presented algorithms leverage iterative refinement processes to converge upon solutions exhibiting enhanced predictive accuracy relative to established heuristics.  Preliminary results indicate substantial improvements in forecasting efficacy achievable through targeted scoring rule selection, offering valuable insights for applications requiring robust and adaptive probabilistic reasoning in 2020 and beyond.
