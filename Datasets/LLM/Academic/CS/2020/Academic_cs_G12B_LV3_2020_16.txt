**Abstract**

Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT) has emerged as a pivotal paradigm shift in machine translation, offering the potential for scalable and efficient translation across numerous language pairs. This survey provides a structured analysis of MNMT approaches, focusing on their efficacy and applicability within diverse operational contexts. We categorize existing methodologies based on key distinctions: target use-case (e.g., low-resource translation, pivot-based translation), available resource endowments (varying degrees of parallel and monolingual data), underlying modeling principles (shared encoders, shared decoders, attention mechanisms), and the persistent challenges hindering optimal performance. Specifically, we examine the impact of transfer learning techniques, including zero-shot translation and fine-tuning strategies, on MNMT system robustness and accuracy.  The survey further investigates the impact of architectural innovations, such as multilingual BERT and XLM-R, on cross-lingual representation learning within the MNMT framework.  Finally, we delineate current research frontiers, including strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, improving low-resource language performance, and addressing linguistic diversity within MNMT models, ultimately aiming to guide future research and development in this rapidly evolving area of computational linguistics.



I aimed for a formal, structured tone, incorporating relevant terminology (BERT, XLM-R, catastrophic forgetting) and highlighting key areas of research within MNMT, consistent with the 2020 timeframe.
