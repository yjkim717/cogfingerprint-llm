**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of deep generative models necessitates robust methods for ensuring their reliable and predictable behavior. This paper addresses the critical challenge of stability in deep dynamics models, a concern often overlooked in purely generative frameworks. We present a novel approach to training deep networks that explicitly incorporates stability guarantees through joint learning of a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function. Our method formulates the training process as an optimization problem that minimizes both the reconstruction error of the dynamics and the violation of the Lyapunov function, effectively encouraging stable trajectories. This approach leverages the theoretical framework of dynamical systems to provide a quantifiable measure of stability during training. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with this method exhibit demonstrably improved stability properties compared to standard deep dynamics models, suggesting a pathway toward more dependable and controllable deep generative systems. The proposed technique offers a significant contribution to the field by bridging the gap between deep learning and established stability analysis techniques.
