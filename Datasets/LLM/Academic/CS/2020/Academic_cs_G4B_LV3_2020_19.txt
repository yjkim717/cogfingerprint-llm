**Abstract**

Contemporary biometric authentication systems often rely on single-modality approaches, presenting vulnerabilities to spoofing and exhibiting limitations in robustness. This research investigates a novel multimodal biometric framework, published in 2020, designed to address these deficiencies. The proposed system integrates deep learning techniques for the simultaneous analysis of fingerprint and palmprint data, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and subsequent classification.  The strategic fusion of these complementary biometrics enhances the overall system accuracy and reduces the impact of individual sensor failures.  Specifically, the deep learning models are trained to learn discriminative features, improving the system’s resilience against presentation attacks.  Preliminary results demonstrate a significant improvement in authentication accuracy and a notable reduction in false acceptance rates compared to traditional fingerprint- or palmprint-only systems, suggesting a viable pathway toward more secure and reliable authentication solutions.
