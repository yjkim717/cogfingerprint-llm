**Abstract**

The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been heavily reliant on data-driven policy-making, making the integrity of reported case numbers a critical concern. This paper investigates the application of Zipf's Law, a canonical power-law distribution, as a computational lens for data forensics on international COVID-19 reporting. We posit that in the absence of systemic manipulation, the distribution of case counts across countries for a naturally spreading contagion should adhere to a power-law, a statistical signature observed in many complex systems. Our methodology involves collecting cumulative COVID-19 case data from a globally representative set of nations. We then employ maximum likelihood estimation to fit a power-law model to the empirical data, followed by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test to quantify the divergence between the observed distribution and the theoretical model. The central analytical technique is p-value analysis, where we compute the p-value to assess the statistical significance of the fit. A high p-value indicates that the data is consistent with a power-law, suggesting organic reporting, while a significantly low p-value signals a deviation, potentially indicative of anomalous reporting practices or data fabrication. Our findings reveal distinct clusters of nations; data from many major countries conforms to the expected distribution, whereas several outliers demonstrate statistically significant deviations. This work contributes a novel, computationally efficient framework for the preliminary forensic screening of large-scale epidemiological datasets. It underscores the utility of foundational computer science principles in addressing emergent, high-stakes problems of data verification and trust.
