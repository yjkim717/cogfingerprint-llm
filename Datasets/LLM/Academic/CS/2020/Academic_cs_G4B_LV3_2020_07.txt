**Abstract**

Recent advancements in machine learning have yielded remarkable performance on complex prediction tasks; however, the underlying mechanisms driving this success remain incompletely understood. This work examines the hypothesis that a degree of memorization of training data, even irrelevant instances, is a fundamental lower bound for achieving high accuracy. We present an experimental analysis across diverse prediction algorithms – including recurrent neural networks and decision trees – demonstrating a consistent correlation between training set size and predictive fidelity.  Specifically, we establish empirical evidence suggesting that reducing the informational complexity of the training data, while maintaining task relevance, invariably degrades model performance.  These findings contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of memorization’s role in machine learning, informing subsequent research into efficient learning strategies and the development of algorithms less reliant on exhaustive data storage.
