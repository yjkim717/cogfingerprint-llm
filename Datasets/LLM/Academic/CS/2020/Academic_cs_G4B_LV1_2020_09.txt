**Enhancing Software Documentation Through Readability Metrics**

Effective software documentation is paramount for maintainability and knowledge transfer; however, existing practices often prioritize functionality over clarity. This paper presents the development and evaluation of a novel tool designed to augment software comments based on established readability metrics.  Employing a mixed-methods approach involving programmer and student participants, we investigated the correlation between comment quality and readability scores, specifically utilizing the Flesch Reading Ease, Word-Finding Query, and Fog Index.  Preliminary results demonstrate a statistically significant positive relationship between comments achieving higher readability scores and improved comprehension rates.  The tool, tentatively named “DocAssist,” automatically assesses existing comments and suggests revisions targeting improved clarity.  Future research will focus on incorporating more sophisticated natural language processing techniques to provide targeted feedback and ultimately foster a culture of more accessible and effective software documentation.
