>Okay, here's a formal, academic-style abstract suitable for a computer science publication, based on the provided keywords and summary, and reflecting a 2020 timeframe.  I've aimed for precision and a structured argument, and a length around 234 words.  I've also included a few potential avenues for expansion/further refinement at the end.

**Abstract**

Image segmentation, a fundamental task within computer vision, aims to partition an image into meaningful regions, enabling high-level scene understanding. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in deep learning-based image segmentation techniques, specifically focusing on semantic and instance segmentation paradigms. Since 2015, deep learning methodologies, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have revolutionized the field, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks. We analyze prevalent architectures, including fully convolutional networks (FCNs), U-Nets, and their variants, emphasizing their evolution in addressing challenges such as boundary delineation and contextual information aggregation.

The survey further examines the impact of large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet, COCO, and Cityscapes, on the progress of deep learning segmentation. We categorize and evaluate different loss functions commonly employed for training, including cross-entropy, Dice loss, and their adaptations for imbalanced data scenarios.  Furthermore, we explore emerging trends, such as attention mechanisms, graph convolutional networks, and transformer-based architectures, which are increasingly utilized to enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. Finally, we discuss open challenges and potential future research directions, including the development of weakly-supervised and unsupervised segmentation methods, improving generalization across diverse domains, and addressing the computational cost associated with high-resolution image segmentation. The continued evolution of deep learning promises further breakthroughs in this critical area of computer vision.

**Potential Refinements/Expansion Points (to tailor to a specific journal/conference):**

*   **Specific Architectures:**  If targeting a journal with a strong focus on a particular architecture (e.g., Transformers), expand the discussion of that architecture's role in segmentation.
*   **Dataset Comparison:** Add a more detailed comparative analysis of the datasets, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses for different segmentation tasks.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** Elaborate on techniques for optimizing computational efficiency (e.g., pruning, quantization) in deep learning segmentation.
*   **Real-time Applications:** Briefly mention specific real-world applications benefiting from these advances (e.g., autonomous driving, medical image analysis).
