Title: Deep Learning for Image Segmentation: A Comprehensive Review of Recent Advances

Abstract:

Image segmentation, a fundamental task in computer vision, has witnessed significant advancements with the advent of deep learning techniques. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent deep learning approaches to image segmentation, with a particular focus on semantic segmentation. We examine the evolution of convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including encoder-decoder models, fully convolutional networks, and dilated convolutions, that have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various image segmentation benchmarks. We also discuss prominent datasets, such as PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, used for evaluating image segmentation models. Furthermore, we highlight current research directions, including the integration of attention mechanisms, graph-based models, and weakly-supervised learning. By analyzing the strengths and limitations of existing approaches, this review aims to provide insights into the current landscape of image segmentation research and identify potential avenues for future investigation.
