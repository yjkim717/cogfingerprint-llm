**Abstract**

Robust statistical estimation techniques are increasingly vital for systems operating under noisy or corrupted data conditions. This paper introduces a novel polynomial-time algorithm for the robust estimation of mixture models, specifically Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), addressing a critical limitation in prior approaches.  We demonstrate that our method effectively handles persistent, constant corruption – a prevalent challenge in real-world applications – surpassing the computational constraints of existing techniques.  The core innovation lies in a tensor decomposition framework, enabling efficient and stable estimation even when a significant proportion of data points are compromised.  This contrasts with traditional methods which often require prohibitive computational resources.  Our results provide a significant advancement, offering a scalable solution for estimating complex distributions while maintaining robustness against data anomalies. Further investigation will explore the algorithm’s adaptability to varying corruption levels and non-Gaussian mixture components.
