**Abstract**

Image segmentation, a fundamental task in computer vision, has experienced a paradigm shift with the integration of deep learning techniques. This survey investigates recent advancements in deep learning-based image segmentation, specifically focusing on the evolution of semantic and instance segmentation methodologies. We examine prevalent neural network architectures, including variations of fully convolutional networks (FCNs), U-Nets, and Mask R-CNN, analyzing their strengths and limitations in achieving precise pixel-level classification.  The distinctions between semantic segmentation – assigning a single class label to each pixel – and instance segmentation – identifying and delineating individual object instances – are rigorously delineated.  Furthermore, we assess comparative performance metrics and discuss current challenges, such as handling ambiguous regions and improving robustness across diverse datasets.  This review aims to provide a consolidated overview for researchers seeking to understand the state-of-the-art in deep learning image segmentation techniques.
