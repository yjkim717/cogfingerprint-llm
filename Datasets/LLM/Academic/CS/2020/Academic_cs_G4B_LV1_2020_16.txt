**Abstract**

Multilingual Neural Machine Translation (MNMT) has emerged as a dominant paradigm within machine translation research, driven by the potential for improved generalization and reduced reliance on large, language-specific parallel corpora. This work presents a systematic survey of MNMT approaches, categorized primarily by their transfer learning methodologies. We examine techniques ranging from shared embedding spaces and cross-lingual language models to adapter modules and fine-tuning strategies, assessing their impact on translation quality and computational efficiency.  Specifically, we analyze the trade-offs associated with different transfer learning strategies, considering factors such as data scarcity in low-resource languages and the risk of negative transfer.  Furthermore, the survey highlights critical challenges, including domain adaptation and the effective utilization of available parallel data.  Ultimately, this analysis provides a foundational understanding for researchers navigating the evolving landscape of MNMT and identifies key areas for future investigation.
