This paper addresses the optimization of proper scoring rules to enhance forecaster incentives in belief refinement. We propose a novel objective function that maximizes the forecaster's expected payoff by aligning scoring mechanisms with the effort required to update posterior beliefs. Focusing on the quadratic scoring rule, we derive conditions under which optimization yields efficient belief elicitation and minimizes strategic misreporting. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach improves forecast accuracy and supports robust decision-making under uncertainty. The framework is validated through simulations, highlighting its applicability in machine learning and algorithmic game theory. This work contributes to the design of incentive-compatible mechanisms for information aggregation in multi-agent systems.
