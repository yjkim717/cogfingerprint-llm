"In this paper, we present an accelerated rotation averaging algorithm, leveraging semidefinite relaxation and manifold minimization techniques to achieve global optimality in Structure from Motion (SfM) applications. Building upon the Shonan Rotation Averaging framework (2020), our approach ensures efficient recovery of camera orientations under moderate noise conditions. By formulating the rotation averaging problem as a semidefinite program, we demonstrate that our method converges to a globally optimal solution, outperforming existing methods in terms of computational efficiency while maintaining robustness to noise. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm."
