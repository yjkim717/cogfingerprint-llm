This paper presents Shonan Rotation Averaging, a novel algorithm for globally optimal rotation estimation in structure-from-motion. We formulate the problem on the manifold of rotations and leverage semidefinite relaxation to guarantee global optimality under moderate noise conditions. Our method achieves a significant performance improvement over local minimization techniques by escaping poor local minima. Experimental validation on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrates that our approach attains global solutions with computational efficiency comparable to conventional local methods, enabling more reliable 3D reconstruction.
