**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in Bayesian forecasting necessitate robust scoring rules to effectively evaluate and refine predictive models. This work addresses the optimization of scoring rules, specifically focusing on maximizing a forecaster’s expected payoff derived from belief revision. We introduce novel algorithmic approaches capable of identifying scoring rules that approximate theoretical optima, surpassing the performance of conventional methods like Bayes Factors.  The investigation incorporates consideration of effort – the computational cost of updating beliefs – alongside payoff, demonstrating a trade-off between model accuracy and resource expenditure.  Preliminary results suggest that tailored scoring rules can substantially improve forecasting accuracy, representing a key step toward efficient and reliable probabilistic prediction.
