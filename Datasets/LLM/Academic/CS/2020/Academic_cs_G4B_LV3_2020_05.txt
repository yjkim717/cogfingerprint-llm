**Abstract:**

This research addresses the inherent challenges in welfare system design, specifically concerning the impact of fluctuating income and the need for efficient resource allocation.  We present a novel computational model simulating welfare distribution under the influence of exogenous income shocks.  The core of the investigation centers on the application of algorithmic optimization techniques – employing both min-sum and min-max strategies – to dynamically adjust subsidy levels and minimize the incidence of households falling below established welfare thresholds.  Our methodology utilizes a discrete optimization framework, analyzing the trade-offs between minimizing overall expenditure and ensuring equitable access to support. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of adaptive algorithmic approaches to enhance welfare program responsiveness and improve outcomes in the face of economic uncertainty, contributing to a more robust and effective social safety net.
