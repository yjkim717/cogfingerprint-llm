Title: Enhancing Biometric Security through Multimodal Fusion of Fingerprint and Palmprint Identification using Deep Learning Architectures

Abstract:
This study presents a novel multimodal biometric authentication system that leverages deep learning methodologies to synergistically integrate fingerprint and palmprint identification, thereby bolstering security and accuracy in identity verification. By harnessing the complementary strengths of both modalities, the proposed system mitigates the limitations inherent to unimodal biometric systems, such as vulnerability to spoofing attacks and sensitivity to environmental factors. Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep fusion techniques, the system extracts and fuses intricate features from fingerprint and palmprint images, yielding a robust and discriminative representation. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the system's superior performance, achieving an equal error rate (EER) of 0.72% and an accuracy of 98.5%. The results underscore the efficacy of multimodal biometrics and deep learning in enhancing the security and reliability of biometric authentication systems, with significant implications for various applications, including border control and secure access management.
