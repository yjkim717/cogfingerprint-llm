**CellPose: A Generalist Deep Learning Algorithm for Robust Cellular Segmentation Across Diverse Microscopy Image Modalities**

Accurate cellular segmentation remains a critical bottleneck in biological image analysis. Traditional methods often require substantial manual parameter tuning or specialized model training for each distinct imaging modality, hindering broad applicability and scalability. This work introduces CellPose, a novel deep learning-based algorithm designed as a generalist solution for cellular segmentation across diverse microscopy images. Leveraging a unique architecture incorporating vector field flow and trainable cell boundaries, CellPose demonstrates robust performance on a wide range of 2D and 3D datasets, encompassing fluorescence, phase contrast, and brightfield microscopy. Empirical evaluations, conducted in late 2020, reveal that CellPose significantly minimizes the need for retraining or extensive parameter adjustments compared to existing approaches, while maintaining or exceeding segmentation accuracy.  The algorithm's adaptability and reduced reliance on dataset-specific optimization pave the way for more efficient and reproducible quantitative analyses in biological research, promising to accelerate discoveries across various fields, from cell biology to neuroscience.  We anticipate CellPose's generalizability will broadly impact automated image analysis pipelines.
