"Optimizing Subsidy Allocations under Income Uncertainty"

In the face of increasingly prevalent income shocks, policymakers require effective strategies for allocating subsidies to vulnerable populations. This paper addresses the algorithmic challenge of optimizing subsidy allocations in the presence of income uncertainty. We formulate the problem as a stochastic optimization task, where the objective is to minimize the total welfare loss incurred by households subject to income shocks. Specifically, we consider a min-sum objective, where the goal is to minimize the expected total cost of subsidy allocations over a given time horizon. We propose novel algorithms for various settings, including both offline and online scenarios, and provide rigorous theoretical guarantees on their performance. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly improve upon naive allocation strategies, and provide valuable insights for policymakers seeking to mitigate the impact of income shocks on household welfare. Experimental evaluations on realistic datasets validate the efficacy of our approaches.
