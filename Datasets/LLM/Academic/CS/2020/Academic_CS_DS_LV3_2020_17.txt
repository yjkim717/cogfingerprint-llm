**Abstract**

The global dissemination of COVID-19 data in 2020 presented an unprecedented test case for data integrity and forensic analysis at scale. This study posits that the statistical properties of reported epidemiological data can serve as a robust, independent mechanism for auditing its veracity. We apply a computational forensics framework, grounded in Zipf's Law, to analyze the international reporting of confirmed cases, recoveries, and fatalities. Zipf's Law, a quintessential power-law distribution, posits that the frequency of an item is inversely proportional to its rank in a frequency table. In the context of national case reports, we hypothesize that, barring significant anomalies or manipulation, the ranked distributions of cases across countries should conform to this expected statistical signature.

Our methodology involves the systematic collection of time-series data from major global repositories, including the WHO and Johns Hopkins University CSSE. For each dataset (confirmed, recovered, deaths), we construct rank-frequency distributions and employ maximum likelihood estimation to fit a power-law model. The goodness-of-fit is rigorously evaluated using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic, and p-values are calculated to quantify the probability that the observed data is drawn from a theoretical power-law distribution. Nations exhibiting significant statistical deviation—indicated by extremely low p-values—are flagged as outliers warranting forensic scrutiny.

Our analysis reveals a high degree of power-law conformity across most nations for death and recovery figures, suggesting a consistent, underlying stochastic process in pandemic spread and reporting. However, significant anomalies are identified. Most notably, the early-stage confirmed case data from China demonstrates a marked deviation from the expected Zipfian distribution, characterized by an implausibly steep drop-off in frequency. This statistical incongruity, detectable through our automated computational pipeline, suggests potential under-reporting or anomalous data generation processes. We conclude that Zipf's Law provides a powerful, low-cost tool for data forensics, enabling health organizations to prioritize in-depth investigations into outlier nations to ensure global data transparency and inform effective policy responses.
