**Abstract: Reinforcement Learning for Proactive Threat Assessment and Mitigation of Multi-Vehicle Collision Cascades in Autonomous Driving**

The increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust and proactive safety mechanisms to prevent collision scenarios, particularly those involving cascading multi-vehicle collisions. Traditional reactive approaches often prove inadequate in complex, dynamic traffic environments. This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed for real-time threat assessment and subsequent strategic decision-making aimed at mitigating the risk of rear-end and other multi-vehicle collision cascades.  Our approach utilizes a deep Q-network (DQN) to learn optimal policies for AV behavior, considering a multi-agent environment with probabilistic vehicle dynamics and imperfect sensing.  The state space incorporates relative velocities, distances, and predicted trajectories of surrounding vehicles, while the action space encompasses acceleration/deceleration commands.  We evaluate the framework through extensive simulations incorporating realistic traffic patterns and driver behaviors.  Results demonstrate that the RL-based threat assessment significantly outperforms rule-based systems in reducing collision probability and minimizing average stopping distance in high-density traffic, showcasing the potential for RL to enhance the safety and robustness of autonomous driving systems.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Focus on Cascading Collisions:** I emphasized "collision cascades" to reflect the "multiple vehicle collision" keyword and highlight a more complex scenario than single collisions.
*   **Reactive vs. Proactive:**  I explicitly contrasted reactive approaches with the proposed proactive RL solution to establish the novelty and value.
*   **Technical Detail:** I included specific technical details like "deep Q-network (DQN)" to signal the methodology's computational nature and align with a CS audience.  The mention of state and action spaces is standard in RL papers.
*   **Probabilistic Modeling:** Recognizing the uncertainty inherent in traffic, I added "probabilistic vehicle dynamics and imperfect sensing" to demonstrate a more realistic modeling approach.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Stating "collision probability and minimizing average stopping distance" provides concrete metrics for assessing performance.
*   **Year Context (2020):**  The technologies and approaches mentioned (DQN, simulation-based evaluation) were common and cutting-edge in the autonomous driving RL research landscape around 2020.
*   **Formal Tone:** I used precise language and avoided conversational phrasing.
