**Abstract:**

This research examines the interplay between competitive landscapes and revenue diversification strategies on risk-taking propensity within a simulated banking ecosystem. Utilizing a dynamic panel data model, we construct a computational agent-based model representing BRICS-aligned financial institutions, subject to evolving market conditions and competitor actions.  The core hypothesis posits that heightened competition – modeled as increased transaction costs and resource scarcity – incentivizes institutions to pursue revenue diversification, thereby mitigating risk exposure.  Specifically, we quantify the correlation between diversification metrics (e.g., product portfolio breadth, geographic reach) and measured risk indicators (e.g., volatility of simulated loan portfolios, capital adequacy ratios). Preliminary results suggest a non-linear relationship; initial risk-taking is driven by competition, but sustained diversification demonstrably reduces systemic vulnerability, aligning with observed trends within the BRICS banking sector in 2020.  Further analysis will explore the impact of varying levels of risk aversion among agents.
