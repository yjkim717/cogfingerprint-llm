**Abstract**

The paradigm of multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) has emerged as a pivotal framework for leveraging cross-lingual transfer to improve translation quality, particularly for low-resource languages. While traditional bilingual models operate in isolation, MNMT systems, built upon sequence-to-sequence architectures with attention mechanisms, consolidate translation knowledge from multiple languages into a single, unified model. This survey provides a systematic categorization of contemporary MNMT methodologies, primarily distinguishing between the use of a shared vocabulary and a universal encoder-decoder, and language-specific components. We critically analyze the mechanisms of transfer learning within these models, exploring how distributed representations in a shared semantic space facilitate positive knowledge transfer, while also examining the challenge of negative interference, especially between linguistically distant languages. Our analysis synthesizes findings from training on large-scale multilingual parallel corpora, highlighting the trade-offs between model capacity, data requirements, and generalization. We conclude by identifying promising future research avenues, including dynamic routing architectures, more sophisticated transfer learning techniques, and the integration of meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new language pairs, positing these as critical for achieving robust, scalable, and truly universal translation systems.
