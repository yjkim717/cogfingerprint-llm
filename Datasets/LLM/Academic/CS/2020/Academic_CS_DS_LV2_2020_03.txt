This paper investigates the performance of static pricing in multi-unit revenue management, establishing a tight characterization of its efficiency as a function of supply k. We demonstrate that static pricing achieves a competitive ratio of 1 - O(âˆš(log k / k)) against the optimal online algorithm in the prophet inequality framework, proving this bound is asymptotically optimal. Our analysis reveals how static pricing effectively balances two competing objectives: maximizing sales volume across multiple units while preserving sufficient utility from high-value customers. The results provide theoretical justification for simple pricing schemes in practical applications where dynamic pricing is computationally prohibitive or informationally constrained. This work contributes to approximation algorithm design by identifying fundamental limits of static strategies and offers actionable insights for revenue optimization under supply constraints.
