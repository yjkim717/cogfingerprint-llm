**Abstract**

The escalating complexity of urban driving environments necessitates advanced threat assessment frameworks capable of preempting multi-vehicle collision scenarios for autonomous vehicles (AVs). While traditional rule-based and probabilistic models offer foundational safety, their static nature often struggles with the high-dimensional, dynamic interactions between multiple agents. This paper posits that reinforcement learning (RL) provides a transformative paradigm for this challenge, enabling an agent to learn optimal safety-critical policies through direct interaction with simulated traffic environments. We propose a conceptual RL-based framework designed to continuously assess and rank potential threats from surrounding vehicles by modeling their predicted trajectories and intentions. The core of our methodology involves a deep Q-network architecture that fuses perceptual data with contextual scene understanding to output probabilistic collision risk estimates. Crucially, we argue that the validation and deployment of such data-driven systems demand rigorous, interdisciplinary collaboration between machine learning specialists and safety assurance engineers to establish verifiable performance guarantees. Our discussion, situated in the 2020 research landscape, concludes that this synergistic approach is critical for bridging the gap between high-level autonomy and certifiable real-world safety, thereby accelerating the path toward robust, large-scale AV deployment.
