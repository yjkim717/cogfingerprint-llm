**Abstract:**

Pharmacokinetic modeling plays a crucial role in simulating complex biological systems, particularly in drug development. This research presents a novel population pharmacokinetic (PK) model designed to enhance the accuracy of losartan and its active metabolite, EXP-3174, concentration-time profiles. Integrating gastric emptying rate variability, a significant physiological factor, into the model’s architecture allows for more realistic simulations of drug disposition. Utilizing a Monte Carlo approach, we demonstrated the model’s capability to predict inter-individual variability in losartan exposure.  Specifically, simulations revealed a strong correlation between gastric emptying rate and peak plasma concentration, highlighting the importance of incorporating such mechanistic details.  The resulting model, designated ‘exp-3174’, offers a valuable tool for evaluating bioequivalence studies and informing dosage optimization strategies, representing a step forward in physiologically-informed simulation.
