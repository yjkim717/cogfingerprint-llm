**Robust Polynomial-Time Estimation of Gaussian Mixture Models with Corruption**

Estimating the parameters of a mixture of Gaussians (GMM) is a fundamental problem in statistical modeling and data analysis. However, existing algorithms are susceptible to significant performance degradation when the data is corrupted by outliers or adversarial noise. This work introduces a novel polynomial-time algorithm designed to address this challenge, providing robust parameter estimation in the presence of substantial data corruption. Leveraging tensor decomposition techniques, specifically utilizing the Frobenius norm for regularization, we construct a modified GMM representation amenable to efficient computation. The core innovation lies in a stochastic optimization strategy that mitigates the influence of corrupted data points, ensuring parameter estimates retain desirable statistical properties.  We demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness through theoretical analysis and preliminary empirical results, establishing a significant advancement toward practical, reliable GMM estimation in real-world applications.
