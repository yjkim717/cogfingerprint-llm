This paper presents Shonan Rotation Averaging, a novel algorithm for rotation averaging that leverages semidefinite relaxation and manifold minimization to achieve global optimality. By iteratively optimizing over a sequence of increasingly relaxed problems, our method efficiently recovers the globally optimal solution under mild noise conditions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in the context of structure from motion, showcasing its superiority over existing methods in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. Our results establish Shonan Rotation Averaging as a reliable and efficient solution for rotation averaging tasks. (2020)
