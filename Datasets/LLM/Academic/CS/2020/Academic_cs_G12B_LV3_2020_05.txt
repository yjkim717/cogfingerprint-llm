**Abstract:**

This paper addresses the computational challenges inherent in designing effective welfare systems within dynamic economic environments. We present a novel modeling framework that integrates income, wealth, and stochastic income shocks to represent individual financial vulnerability. The core contribution lies in the development and evaluation of optimization algorithms designed to allocate subsidies across a population to achieve specific welfare objectives. We explore two distinct optimization goals: minimizing the expected number of individuals falling below a pre-defined welfare threshold, and minimizing the risk—defined as the probability—of the most vulnerable individual experiencing welfare deficiency.  Leveraging techniques from stochastic optimization and potentially reinforcement learning, we evaluate the performance of various algorithmic approaches, considering computational efficiency and scalability.  Furthermore, we briefly discuss the ethical implications arising from the algorithmic determination of subsidy allocation, particularly concerning fairness, potential biases, and the impact on individual agency, acknowledging the need for ongoing scrutiny within this increasingly data-driven domain.
