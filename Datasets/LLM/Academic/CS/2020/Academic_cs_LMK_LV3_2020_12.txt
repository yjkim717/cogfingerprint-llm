"In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework for modeling dynamical systems, ensuring Lyapunov stability through joint optimization of a dynamics model and a non-expansive Lyapunov function. By integrating generative models, our approach enhances system modeling accuracy while guaranteeing stability. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method, outperforming existing techniques in 2020 benchmarks."
