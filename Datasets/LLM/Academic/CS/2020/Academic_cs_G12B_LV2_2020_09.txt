**Improving Software Comment Readability through Automated Suggestion and Readability Assessment**

The maintainability and understandability of software systems are critically dependent on the quality of associated documentation, particularly within code comments. However, comment clarity is frequently overlooked, leading to reduced comprehension and increased maintenance costs. This paper introduces a novel tool designed to address this issue by automatically enhancing the readability of software comments. Our approach leverages natural language processing techniques to analyze existing comments and suggest alternative phrasings that improve clarity and conciseness. Crucially, the tool incorporates quantitative readability metrics to objectively evaluate comment quality. We employ established formulas, including the Flesch Reading Ease score and the Fog Index, to provide developers with actionable feedback on comment readability.  Empirical evaluation, conducted on a corpus of open-source projects, demonstrates the tool’s ability to significantly improve comment readability scores without substantially altering the original meaning.  Furthermore, we investigate the impact of these improvements on code review efficiency, hypothesizing that more readable comments lead to reduced review time and fewer comprehension-related queries. Preliminary results suggest a positive correlation, indicating the potential for this tool to streamline software development workflows and improve overall code quality within agile development environments. This research contributes to the growing body of work focused on automated documentation improvement and provides a practical tool for developers aiming to enhance software maintainability.
