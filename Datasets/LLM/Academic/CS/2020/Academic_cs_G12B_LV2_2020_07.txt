Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, targeting a CS audience and reflecting a 2020 timeframe, based on the provided summary. I've aimed for precision, clarity, and a structured argument, keeping the word count around the requested target.  Following the abstract, I'll include a brief explanation of the choices I made in crafting it.

**Abstract**

The pursuit of high accuracy in machine learning (ML) models across diverse prediction problems has frequently been linked to the capacity of these models to memorize substantial portions of their training data. However, a critical question remains: is the memorization of *irrelevant* information inherent to, or even essential for, achieving optimal performance? This paper investigates this relationship, exploring the role of irrelevant data within the learning process and its impact on predictive capabilities. We formalize the problem through the lens of information complexity, arguing that the presence of irrelevant information introduces a specific complexity that models must address to generalize effectively.  Through empirical analysis involving a range of prediction tasks and machine learning architectures, including neural networks and kernel methods, we examine the extent to which models demonstrably rely on memorizing irrelevant examples. Our findings suggest that while memorization, in general, can contribute to accuracy, the necessity of memorizing *irrelevant* data is contingent on the inherent complexity of the prediction problem and the model's architectural capacity. We further demonstrate scenarios where strategies minimizing the influence of irrelevant information during training lead to comparable, and in some cases superior, predictive performance, potentially mitigating overfitting and enhancing generalization.  These results challenge the conventional wisdom that extensive memorization is universally beneficial and offer insights into designing more efficient and robust ML models.

**Explanation of Choices & Considerations:**

*   **Formal Tone & Jargon:** I used terms like "machine learning (ML) models," "prediction problems," "information complexity," "generalization," "architectural capacity," and "empirical analysis" to establish a clear CS academic tone.
*   **Structured Argument:** The abstract follows a logical progression:
    *   **Introduction of the Problem:** States the existing assumption (memorization = good) and the question being addressed.
    *   **Formalization:** Introduces 'information complexity' as a framework.
    *   **Methodology:** Briefly mentions empirical analysis and types of models used.
    *   **Findings:**  Summarizes the key results (memorization not always necessary).
    *   **Implications:**  Highlights the challenge to conventional wisdom and potential benefits.
*   **2020 Context:** The field of ML was already focused on generalization and mitigating overfitting, so the abstract's discussion of these aspects aligns with that context. The mention of neural networks and kernel methods reflects commonly used architectures at the time.
*   **Specificity:**  I emphasized the distinction between *general* memorization and the memorization of *irrelevant* information, which is the core focus of the original summary.
*   **Conciseness:** While aiming for ~237 words, I prioritized conveying the essential information clearly and avoiding unnecessary verbosity.
