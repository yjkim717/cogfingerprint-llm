**Learning Stable Deep Latent Dynamics via Lyapunov-Augmented Training**

Deep learning has demonstrated remarkable success in modeling complex systems; however, ensuring the stability of learned dynamics remains a critical challenge, particularly when deploying these models for control or prediction over extended horizons. This paper introduces a novel approach to training deep neural networks for learning stable latent dynamics by explicitly incorporating Lyapunov function estimation into the training process. We formulate the learning problem as a joint optimization of a dynamics model parameterized by a deep network and a candidate Lyapunov function, encouraging the dynamics to exhibit non-expansive behavior in a learned latent space. Our method utilizes a differentiable approximation of Lyapunov functions, enabling end-to-end training via gradient descent.  Theoretical analysis, based on contraction mappings and fixed-point theorems, provides guarantees regarding the stability of the learned dynamics under specific conditions. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Lyapunov-augmented training significantly improves the stability and long-term predictive accuracy of learned dynamics models compared to standard training procedures, particularly in scenarios exhibiting chaotic or sensitive behavior.  We believe this work represents a crucial step towards deploying robust and reliable deep learning models for real-world dynamical systems.
