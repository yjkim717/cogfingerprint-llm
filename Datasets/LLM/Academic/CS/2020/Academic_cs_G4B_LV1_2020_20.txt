**Abstract**

Automated cell segmentation remains a critical bottleneck in biological image analysis, demanding robust and adaptable algorithms. This paper introduces Cellpose, a novel deep learning framework designed to address the limitations of traditional, specialized cell detection methods. Cellpose leverages a convolutional neural network architecture trained on a comprehensive dataset of cellular images, enabling it to perform accurate cell segmentation across a broad spectrum of imaging modalities.  Crucially, the algorithm operates as a ‘generalist’ – exhibiting minimal performance degradation upon deployment with new image types, obviating the need for extensive retraining or manual parameter tuning. We demonstrate Cellpose’s efficacy through preliminary experiments, highlighting its capacity to preserve cellular morphology and achieve high segmentation accuracy.  Future work will focus on integrating Cellpose into existing image analysis pipelines and exploring its potential for quantitative cellular profiling, contributing to advancements in biomedical research.
