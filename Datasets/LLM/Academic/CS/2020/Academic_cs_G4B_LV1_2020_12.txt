**Abstract**

The inherent complexity of dynamical systems presents a significant challenge for predictive modeling, particularly within deep neural network architectures. This work investigates a novel approach to learning stable dynamics from data, leveraging the complementary strengths of recurrent neural networks and Lyapunov function theory. We propose a joint learning framework wherein a deep network is trained to approximate the underlying dynamical evolution, while simultaneously constructing a Lyapunov function to quantify local stability.  Specifically, the network’s state transitions are used to estimate Jacobian matrices, which are then employed in the Lyapunov function construction.  This iterative process, executed within a stochastic gradient descent regime, facilitates the discovery of intrinsically stable regimes within the learned system. Preliminary results demonstrate enhanced predictive accuracy and improved robustness to noise compared to conventional recurrent neural network approaches, suggesting a pathway toward more reliable and interpretable dynamical modeling via deep learning. Future work will explore scaling to higher-dimensional systems and incorporating uncertainty quantification.
