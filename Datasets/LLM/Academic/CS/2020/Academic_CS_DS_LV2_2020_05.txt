This paper presents a computational framework for optimizing welfare subsidy allocations under stochastic income shocks. We formulate poverty alleviation as an objective-driven optimization problem, introducing a dynamic welfare model that captures household consumption volatility and heterogeneous shock distributions. Our primary contribution lies in developing two efficient allocation algorithms: the first minimizes the poverty gap index under budget constraints, while the second maximizes population coverage above the poverty line. Through empirical simulations using synthetic household data calibrated to developing economies, we demonstrate that our model-based approach achieves 23-41% greater poverty reduction compared to uniform allocation baselines. The algorithms maintain computational tractability for large-scale deployments while accommodating non-linear welfare effects and liquidity constraints. Our findings establish that explicitly modeling income volatility through algorithmic optimization significantly enhances the cost-effectiveness of social protection programs, providing policymakers with scalable tools for evidence-based resource allocation in uncertain economic environments.
