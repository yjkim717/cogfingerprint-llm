Title: Enhancing Biometric Authentication with Multimodal Fusion using Deep Neural Networks

Abstract:
Unimodal biometric authentication systems are often plagued by limitations such as vulnerability to spoofing attacks, noisy data, and limited scalability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a multimodal biometric authentication system that leverages the strengths of deep learning to fuse fingerprint and palmprint modalities. Our proposed system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract robust features from both modalities, which are then concatenated and fed into a fully connected neural network for classification. The multimodal fusion is achieved through a weighted score-level fusion technique, optimizing the weights using a genetic algorithm. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system, achieving an equal error rate (EER) of 0.73% and a genuine acceptance rate (GAR) of 98.5% at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 0.1%. Our results indicate that multimodal biometric authentication using deep learning can significantly enhance the security and accuracy of biometric systems.
