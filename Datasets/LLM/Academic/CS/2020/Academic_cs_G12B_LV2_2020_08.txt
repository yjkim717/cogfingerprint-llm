## Shonan Rotation Averaging: Globally Optimal Rotation Estimation via Manifold Minimization for Structure-from-Motion

Estimating a consensus rotation from a set of noisy measurements is a fundamental problem with applications spanning Structure-from-Motion (SFM), robotics, and computer vision. Existing approaches often struggle to achieve global optimality, particularly when dealing with large datasets and substantial noise. This paper introduces Shonan Rotation Averaging (SRA), a novel and computationally efficient method for globally optimal rotation averaging. SRA leverages semidefinite relaxation techniques to reformulate the rotation averaging problem as a convex optimization problem defined on the Stiefel manifold.  By exploiting this manifold structure, we enable efficient minimization that guarantees finding the globally optimal solution, unlike iterative methods susceptible to local minima.  Our approach is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing SFM pipelines, utilizing pose estimates generated by standard algorithms as input.  Experimental results, conducted on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrate that SRA consistently achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to state-of-the-art rotation averaging techniques, while maintaining a favorable computational complexity that allows for scalability to large-scale problems.  The effectiveness of SRA highlights the potential of manifold optimization for addressing globally optimal estimation problems in visual computing.
