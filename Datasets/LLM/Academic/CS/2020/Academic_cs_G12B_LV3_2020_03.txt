**Abstract**

This paper investigates the performance characteristics of static pricing strategies within the domain of revenue management, specifically addressing the multi-unit setting. While computationally simpler than dynamic approaches, static pricing remains prevalent due to its operational ease. We present a rigorous analysis of static pricing utility as a function of available inventory, demonstrating that performance is not uniformly poor and identifying a critical supply level – a ‘sweet spot’ – which maximizes expected revenue. Utilizing approximation algorithms, we explore the theoretical limits of static pricing’s optimality and develop bounds on the revenue loss compared to optimal dynamic policies. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the trade-offs between complexity and revenue in resource allocation problems. This work provides practical insights for businesses seeking to optimize pricing decisions with limited computational resources, a particularly valuable consideration in the evolving economic landscape of 2020.
