**Abstract**

The conventional wisdom in machine learning posits that generalization stems from learning salient patterns while discarding irrelevant training details through regularization. However, we formally demonstrate that for a broad class of natural prediction problems characterized by high information complexity, this paradigm is incomplete. We prove a fundamental trade-off: achieving near-optimal generalization error necessitates that the learning algorithm memorizes a non-trivial portion of the training samples, including those without apparent predictive utility. This memorization is not an artifact of overfitting but an information-theoretic requirement for extracting the underlying signal. Our analysis introduces a novel framework linking the *intrinsic complexity* of a problem class to the *memorization capacity* of any near-optimal learner. We establish lower bounds showing that below a certain threshold of memorization, no algorithm can achieve high accuracy. This result provides a theoretical justification for the empirical success of large, over-parametrized models and challenges the strict dichotomy between memorization and generalization, suggesting they are often co-dependent phenomena in complex learning tasks.
