**Abstract:**

This research investigates the efficacy of dynamically optimized scoring rules in enhancing the performance of probabilistic forecasters.  Traditional scoring rules often exhibit suboptimal sensitivity to forecaster uncertainty, limiting their ability to efficiently refine posterior beliefs. We propose a novel framework leveraging Bayesian optimization to iteratively adjust scoring rule parameters, directly correlated with binary effort expenditure during belief revision.  Our methodology evaluates the impact of this adaptive scoring on forecast accuracy, measured through expected utility maximization. Preliminary simulations, conducted under synthetic data distributions reflecting increasingly complex decision environments, demonstrate that optimized scoring rules significantly reduce the expected cost of erroneous predictions compared to static scoring protocols.  Further investigation will explore scaling strategies for deployment in real-time forecasting systems, anticipating challenges in computational complexity by 2021.
