**Abstract**

The burgeoning field of multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) necessitates systematic evaluation and strategic direction. Dabre’s (2020) seminal survey offers a critical analysis of current MNMT methodologies, classifying them primarily through transfer learning paradigms. This work demonstrates that leveraging knowledge across multiple languages significantly improves translation quality, particularly for low-resource languages. However, the survey also identifies key challenges, including catastrophic forgetting and the difficulty of effectively transferring stylistic nuances. Current approaches utilizing pivot languages often introduce additional bottlenecks. Future research should prioritize techniques mitigating these limitations, such as domain adaptation and unsupervised transfer learning.  Furthermore, exploring novel architectures that explicitly model cross-lingual relationships represents a promising avenue.  Ultimately, continued investigation into MNMT, guided by comprehensive surveys like Dabre’s, is crucial for realizing truly universal and efficient machine translation systems.
