This paper presents a novel polynomial-time algorithm for robust estimation of Gaussian mixtures in high-dimensional spaces. Leveraging the sum-of-squares method and tensor decomposition techniques, our approach achieves algorithmic robustness to a constant fraction of arbitrary corruptions. Specifically, we demonstrate that a mixture of k arbitrary Gaussians in ‚Ñùd can be accurately estimated despite adversarial noise. Our result advances the field of robust statistics, providing a robust and efficient solution for density estimation in the presence of outliers and corruptions, with significant implications for machine learning and statistical analysis applications.
