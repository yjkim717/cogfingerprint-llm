**Abstract**

This research investigates the design of optimal subsidy allocation mechanisms in the face of fluctuating income and the imperative to protect vulnerable populations. Utilizing a welfare model framework, we formulate a computational problem centered on minimizing aggregate welfare thresholds within a simulated economic environment.  Specifically, we explore the application of algorithmic optimization techniques – including, but not limited to, dynamic programming and evolutionary algorithms – to determine efficient subsidy distributions.  Crucially, the model incorporates stochastic income shocks, reflecting real-world economic volatility and its impact on recipient welfare. Preliminary results demonstrate the potential of adaptive algorithmic strategies to outperform traditional, static subsidy allocation policies.  The work introduces a novel simulation platform for evaluating subsidy schemes, parameterized to capture heterogeneous agent vulnerabilities. Future work will focus on incorporating agent heterogeneity and exploring the scalability of these algorithms within larger, more complex socioeconomic systems, with a targeted publication date of 2020.
