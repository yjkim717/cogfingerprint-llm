Title: Enhancing Code Comprehension through Optimized Comment Readability: A Tool-Based Approach

Abstract:

Code readability is a crucial aspect of software maintainability, with comment statements playing a vital role in facilitating programmer understanding. However, the readability of software comments is often overlooked, potentially hindering code comprehension. In this paper, we present a novel tool that leverages the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) and other established readability metrics to enhance the readability of software comments. Our tool employs a multi-faceted approach, analyzing comment statements for clarity, concision, and syntax, and providing recommendations for improvement. We evaluated the effectiveness of our tool through a mixed-methods study involving professional programmers and students. Participants were tasked with comprehending code snippets with and without optimized comments. Results show that code comprehension significantly improved when comments were optimized using our tool, as measured by task completion time and accuracy. Notably, the FRES metric proved to be a reliable indicator of comment readability, correlating strongly with participant performance. Our findings suggest that optimizing comment readability can have a positive impact on code comprehension, particularly for novice programmers. The proposed tool has the potential to be integrated into existing development environments, promoting better code understanding and maintainability. This research contributes to the ongoing effort to improve software quality and programmer productivity, highlighting the importance of readable comments in the software development lifecycle.
