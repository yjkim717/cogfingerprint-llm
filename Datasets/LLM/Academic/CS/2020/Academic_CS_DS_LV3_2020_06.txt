In 2020, the proliferation of decentralized financial technologies intensified market competition, compelling financial institutions to recalibrate their risk management protocols. This study employs dynamic panel data analysis to investigate the interplay between competitive pressures and systemic risk within digital banking ecosystems. Our empirical framework reveals a significant positive correlation between heightened competition and increased risk-taking, corroborating strategic adaptation theories. Furthermore, we demonstrate that algorithmic revenue diversification—spanning transaction fees, decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations, and data monetization—serves as a stabilizing mechanism, consistent with modern portfolio theory. Crucially, we identify heterogeneous effects contingent on institutional scale, with larger entities exhibiting nonlinear sensitivity to competitive dynamics. These findings underscore the critical need for adaptive regulatory frameworks that account for technological disruption and diversification strategies in maintaining financial system integrity.
