**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of security breaches necessitates robust and reliable authentication methods. This paper introduces a novel multimodal biometric authentication system designed to mitigate the vulnerabilities inherent in unimodal approaches. Leveraging advancements in deep learning, we propose a system integrating fingerprint and palmprint recognition, employing deep neural networks (DNNs) for automated minutiae detection and attribute extraction. The systemâ€™s architecture facilitates feature fusion at both the decision and feature levels, optimizing performance through synergistic information integration. Experimental results, conducted on benchmark datasets in 2020, demonstrate a significant reduction in both False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) compared to traditional fingerprint-only or palmprint-only systems. Furthermore, the proposed DNN-based approach exhibits improved resilience to variations in image quality and presentation attacks. This research contributes to the ongoing effort to develop highly secure and user-friendly biometric authentication solutions.
