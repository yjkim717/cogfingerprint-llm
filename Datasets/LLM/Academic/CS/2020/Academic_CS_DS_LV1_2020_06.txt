In the rapidly evolving financial technology landscape of 2020, this computational study investigates how competitive pressures and service diversification influence systemic risk in digital banking platforms. We develop a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework simulating BRICS financial ecosystems, where banking agents dynamically adjust their service portfolios in response to market competition. Using high-frequency transactional data from 2015-2019, we implement a dynamic panel data analysis with fixed effects to model risk propagation. Our results demonstrate that while revenue diversification through fintech integration initially stabilizes returns, excessive service heterogeneity coupled with intense competition significantly increases operational vulnerability. The computational model reveals emergent risk concentration patterns undetectable through traditional econometric methods, providing crucial insights for regulating AI-driven financial systems in emerging economies. This research establishes a foundational computational framework for proactive financial risk assessment in increasingly automated banking environments.
