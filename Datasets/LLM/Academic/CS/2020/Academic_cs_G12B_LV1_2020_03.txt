Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a CS publication, and set within a 2020 context.  I've aimed for precision and a structured argument, roughly around the 179-word target.  Following the abstract, I'll include some notes explaining my design choices.

**Abstract: Equilibrium Efficiency in Static Multi-Unit Revenue Management with Incomplete Valuation**

The problem of revenue management, particularly in scenarios involving limited supply and heterogeneous customer demand, remains a critical challenge in algorithmic economics. While dynamic pricing strategies offer theoretical optimality, their implementation complexity and computational cost often preclude their use in practical settings. This paper investigates the efficiency of static pricing policies within a multi-unit selling environment where customer valuations are private and incomplete. We model the setting as a Bayesian game with a single seller and a population of potential buyers, each possessing a private valuation drawn from an unknown distribution. We characterize conditions under which a simple, fixed-price strategy achieves an equilibrium, and analyze its resulting revenue and social welfare compared to the first-best outcome achievable with complete information and dynamic pricing. Our findings demonstrate that, under specific distributional assumptions and demand elasticity conditions, static pricing can approach near-optimal efficiency, particularly when coupled with careful selection of the pricing point. We provide bounds on the approximation gap and discuss implications for practical revenue management systems, noting the trade-off between computational simplicity and potential revenue loss.

**Notes on Design Choices & Justification:**

*   **Formal Language:** I used phrases like "investigates," "characterize," "equilibrium," "approximation gap," "first-best outcome" to establish a formal academic tone.
*   **Precise Terminology:**  I incorporated terms like "Bayesian game," "heterogeneous customer demand," "private valuation," "social welfare," and "demand elasticity" to align with CS/algorithmic economics vocabulary.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow:
    *   **Context/Motivation:**  Establishes the importance of revenue management.
    *   **Problem Definition:** Clearly states the problem being addressed (static pricing, limited supply, incomplete valuation).
    *   **Approach:**  Mentions the modeling framework (Bayesian game).
    *   **Results/Findings:** Highlights the key result (static pricing can be near-optimal under certain conditions).
    *   **Implications/Future Work:** Discusses practical implications and acknowledges the trade-offs.
*   **2020 Context:** The abstract implicitly acknowledges the ongoing research landscape â€“ dynamic pricing's complexities are well-known, so the focus shifts to exploring simpler, yet effective, alternatives.  The emphasis on approximation gaps and trade-offs reflects a trend in algorithmic economics towards practical, implementable solutions.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for the target of ~179 words, recognizing that abstracts often have length constraints.
