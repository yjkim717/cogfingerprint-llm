In this 2019-2020 research, we develop a computational framework for dynamic subsidy allocation under stochastic income shocks, addressing critical limitations in traditional welfare models. By formalizing poverty thresholds as multidimensional constraints, we introduce two polynomial-time approximation algorithms that optimize resource distribution while maintaining fiscal feasibility. The first algorithm minimizes extreme poverty incidence through adaptive targeting mechanisms, while the second implements a fairness-aware redistribution protocol that outperforms static allocation methods by 23% in simulation. Our model incorporates real-time household consumption data and probabilistic shock forecasting to enable proactive rather than reactive interventions. Through extensive validation across heterogeneous demographic datasets, we demonstrate significant improvements in poverty gap reduction metrics compared to existing systems. The research concludes with a rigorous analysis of the ethical-computational tradeoffs in automated welfare optimization, proposing formal safeguards for equitable implementation. This work establishes new foundations for algorithmic governance in social protection systems.
