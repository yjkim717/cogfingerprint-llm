**Abstract**

The increasing reliance on digital systems necessitates robust and adaptable biometric authentication methods. This paper introduces a novel multimodal biometric authentication framework leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance security and accuracy compared to traditional unimodal approaches. Specifically, the system integrates fingerprint and palmprint identification modalities, capitalizing on the complementary strengths of each.  We propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) architecture, trained via a Siamese network framework, to extract discriminative features from both fingerprint and palmprint images.  Feature fusion is achieved through a weighted concatenation strategy, optimizing performance via cross-validation.  Experimental results, evaluated on a publicly available dataset, demonstrate a significant improvement in authentication accuracy – measured by FAR (False Acceptance Rate) and FRR (False Rejection Rate) – compared to standalone fingerprint or palmprint systems.  Future work will explore the integration of additional biometric modalities and adaptive learning strategies to further bolster system resilience and address evolving security challenges within 2020’s landscape.
