Title: Enhancing Biometric Authentication with Multimodal Fusion and Deep Learning

Abstract:
Unimodal biometric systems are plagued by limitations such as vulnerability to spoofing attacks, noisy data, and restricted scalability. To address these shortcomings, we propose a multimodal biometric authentication system leveraging deep learning techniques. Our system integrates fingerprint identification with other modalities to create a robust and reliable authentication framework. By utilizing a neural network architecture, we effectively fuse multiple biometric traits, enhancing the overall system performance. The proposed system employs a deep learning-based approach to learn feature representations from multiple biometric modalities, thereby improving the accuracy and security of the authentication process. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our multimodal system over traditional unimodal approaches, achieving a significant reduction in error rates. Our work contributes to the advancement of biometric authentication systems, providing a more secure and efficient solution for identity verification in various applications.
