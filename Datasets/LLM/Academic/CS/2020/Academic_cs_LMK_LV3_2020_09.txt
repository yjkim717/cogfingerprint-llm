Title: Enhancing Code Comprehension through Readable Comments: A Metrics-Driven Approach

Abstract:
Code comprehension is a crucial aspect of software maintenance, and comment readability plays a significant role in facilitating this process. In 2020, the increasing complexity of software systems underscored the need for effective comment readability metrics. This paper presents a novel tool that leverages readability metrics, including the Flesch Reading Ease score, Fog index, and Flesch-Kincaid grade levels, to assess and improve comment readability. By analyzing the linguistic properties of comments, our tool provides alternative comments with enhanced readability, thereby augmenting code comprehension. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach through a comprehensive study, demonstrating a significant improvement in code comprehension when using readable comments. Our findings suggest that the integration of readability metrics into software development workflows can substantially enhance code maintainability and facilitate knowledge transfer among developers. The proposed tool has the potential to become a valuable asset in software engineering practices.
