**Abstract**

Structure from Motion (SfM) reconstruction frequently confronts the challenge of global optimality, particularly when dealing with large datasets. Existing optimization techniques often struggle to guarantee convergence to the true global solution, instead settling for local minima. This paper introduces Shonan Rotation Averaging (SRA), a novel approach integrating semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and manifold minimization to address this limitation. SRA’s core innovation lies in iteratively refining a rotation matrix representation of the scene’s fundamental matrix, leveraging SDR to enforce geometric constraints and subsequently minimizing a manifold-based cost function.  Experimental results presented in 2020 demonstrate SRA’s efficacy in achieving globally optimal SfM solutions while maintaining a favorable trade-off between computational efficiency and scalability.  The method’s robust performance underscores its potential for advanced SfM applications requiring high accuracy and reliable reconstructions.
