Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided keywords and summary, targeting a Computer Science audience and set in a 2020 context.  I've aimed for precision and structured reasoning, and have kept it around the 200-word target.  Following the abstract, I've included some notes about the choices I made and potential areas for expansion.

**Improving Software Comment Comprehension Through Readability-Driven Refactoring**

The proliferation of large-scale software systems necessitates a focus on maintainability and developer productivity.  A significant, often overlooked, contributor to these factors is the clarity and readability of software comments. While comments are intended to clarify code, poorly written comments can introduce ambiguity and impede understanding, particularly for novice programmers and during code review processes. This paper introduces "ClarityAssist," a novel tool designed to evaluate and improve the readability of software comments. ClarityAssist leverages established readability metrics, specifically the Flesch Reading Ease score and the Fog Index, to quantify comment complexity.  The tool then provides automated suggestions for refactoring comments, aiming to enhance comprehension while preserving semantic meaning.  We present a prototype implementation integrated with a standard IDE and evaluate its effectiveness through a user study involving both experienced and novice developers. Preliminary results indicate that ClarityAssist facilitates a statistically significant improvement in comment readability, as measured by both automated metrics and subjective user assessments of comprehension.  We discuss implications for software engineering education and industry practices, highlighting the potential for automated tools to improve code maintainability and reduce cognitive load during software development.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Formal Tone & Vocabulary:** I've used terms like "necessitates," "proliferation," "semantic meaning," "cognitive load," and "statistically significant" to maintain a formal academic tone.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: Problem -> Proposed Solution -> Implementation -> Evaluation -> Results -> Implications.
*   **Specificity:** I gave the tool a name ("ClarityAssist") to make it more concrete.
*   **Year Context (2020):** While not explicitly mentioned, the focus on large-scale systems and developer productivity aligns with trends in software engineering around 2020.
*   **Potential Expansion:** The abstract could be further enriched by:
    *   Briefly mentioning the programming language(s) targeted by ClarityAssist.
    *   Elaborating on the specific types of refactoring suggestions provided (e.g., sentence simplification, vocabulary substitution).
    *   Including a quantitative measure of the improvement in readability scores (e.g., "average Flesch Reading Ease score increased by X points").
