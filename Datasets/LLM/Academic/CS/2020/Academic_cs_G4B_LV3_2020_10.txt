Here’s an abstract inspired by the provided summary and keywords, suitable for a 2020 computer science publication:

“This work examines the triangular ratio metric defined within the unit disk of the complex plane, leveraging its properties to rigorously analyze quasiconformal mappings. Utilizing Hölder continuity bounds established via the unit disk framework, we demonstrate improved convergence rates for these mappings. Specifically, we provide novel estimates relating the metric distortion to the smoothness of the mapping, contributing to theoretical advancements in geometric analysis and computer graphics.”
