Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a CS conference/journal publication, and framed within a 2020 context.  I've aimed for ~186 words and structured reasoning.  Following the abstract, I'll include notes on my rationale.

**Abstract: Discrepancies in Semantic Representation: A Comparative Analysis of Neural Language Models and Human Grounding**

Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have yielded sophisticated neural language models capable of capturing complex lexical and semantic relationships.  This work investigates the extent to which these models effectively represent word meaning, contrasting their performance against established psychological theories of grounding â€“ specifically, the embodied cognition perspective emphasizing the role of desires, beliefs, and perceptual experience. We evaluate several state-of-the-art transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet) on semantic similarity tasks, demonstrating robust performance in identifying words with comparable denotations. However, our analysis reveals a critical divergence: while models excel at distributional semantics, they exhibit a marked deficiency in representing the nuanced grounding of word meaning inherent in human understanding.  We argue that the absence of explicit modeling of intentionality and subjective experience limits the ability of current NLP systems to fully capture the richness of linguistic meaning.  This research highlights the need for incorporating cognitive grounding mechanisms, potentially through multimodal learning or symbolic integration, to bridge the gap between computational semantic representations and human-like comprehension, a crucial step towards more robust and contextually aware NLP.

**Rationale and Notes on Choices:**

*   **Formal Tone & Terminology:** Used phrases like "investigates the extent," "demonstrating robust performance," "critical divergence," "intentionality," "subjective experience," "distributional semantics," and "multimodal learning" to establish a formal academic voice.
*   **Specific Models:** Mentioning BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet grounds the work in the specific landscape of NLP research in 2020. These were highly relevant models at that time.
*   **Psychological Theories:** Explicitly referenced "embodied cognition" as the framework for human grounding, aligning with the original summary.
*   **Structured Reasoning:**
    *   **Introduction/Context:** Establishes the progress in NLP and the research question.
    *   **Method/Findings:** Describes the evaluation of models on similarity tasks and the observed limitation.
    *   **Argument/Implication:** Presents the argument about the lack of intentionality and the consequences.
    *   **Conclusion/Future Work:** Suggests potential directions for future research (multimodal learning, symbolic integration).
*   **Year Context (2020):**  The state-of-the-art in NLP was rapidly evolving around transformer models.  The focus on grounding was gaining traction as researchers recognized the limitations of purely statistical approaches.
*   **Word Count:**  Carefully managed to stay within the approximate target.
