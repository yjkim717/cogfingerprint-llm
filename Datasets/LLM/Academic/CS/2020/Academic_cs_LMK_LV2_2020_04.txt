This paper presents an optimization framework for proper scoring rules to maximize the expected payoff gain of a forecaster exerting binary effort to refine their posterior belief. By analyzing the interplay between effort, posterior refinement, and scoring rules, we derive optimal rules that incentivize forecasters to invest effort in improving their predictions. Our results demonstrate that optimized scoring rules can significantly enhance forecaster payoff, shedding new light on the design of decision-support systems. The proposed framework is validated through theoretical analysis, providing a rigorous foundation for future applications in AI-assisted forecasting.
