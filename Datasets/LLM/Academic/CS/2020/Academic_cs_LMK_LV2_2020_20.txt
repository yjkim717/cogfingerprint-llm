Title: Cellpose: A Generalist Algorithm for Cellular Segmentation in Diverse Microscopy Images using Deep Learning

Abstract:
Cellular segmentation is a crucial step in the analysis of microscopy images, enabling the quantification of cellular features and behaviors. However, existing methods often require extensive retraining or fine-tuning for specific image types, limiting their applicability. In this work, we present Cellpose, a deep learning-based approach that achieves robust cellular segmentation across various microscopy images without necessitating model retraining or parameter adjustments. By leveraging a comprehensive dataset of annotated images and a novel neural network architecture, Cellpose learns to capture the underlying morphology of cells, allowing it to generalize effectively to unseen image types. Our results demonstrate that Cellpose outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and versatility, providing a valuable tool for researchers in the field. As of 2020, Cellpose has the potential to streamline cellular analysis workflows and facilitate new discoveries in biology and biomedicine.
