**Abstract**

We address the problem of optimal scoring rule selection for probabilistic forecasting, focusing on scenarios where forecasters can exert binary effort to refine their belief elicitation. Proper scoring rules incentivize accurate probability assignments, but their utility is contingent upon forecaster behavior. This work investigates the optimization of scoring rules under the assumption of rational forecasters who strategically allocate effort to improve forecast accuracy. We derive algorithms for identifying near-optimal scoring rules within a specified class, considering the trade-off between rule complexity and expected payoff. Our approach explicitly models forecaster beliefs as posterior distributions and determines rules that maximize the expected reward given a binary effort choice.  Empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in identifying rules that outperform standard alternatives, particularly when forecasters are incentivized to invest effort. This research contributes to the burgeoning field of mechanism design for forecasting and provides practical guidance for designing scoring systems that elicit high-quality probabilistic predictions.
