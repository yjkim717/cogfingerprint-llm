This 2020 survey systematically examines deep learning methodologies for image segmentation, addressing both semantic and instance segmentation paradigms. We analyze predominant encoder-decoder architectures, evaluating their capacity to preserve spatial information while achieving hierarchical feature extraction. The review critically assesses performance metrics across benchmark datasets, revealing architectural trade-offs between computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy. Our analysis identifies three key research trajectories: attention mechanisms for contextual modeling, lightweight architectures for edge deployment, and unified frameworks bridging semantic and instance segmentation. The survey establishes that while fully convolutional networks remain foundational, emerging transformer-based architectures demonstrate significant potential for capturing long-range dependencies, positioning this as a pivotal transition period in segmentation methodology.
