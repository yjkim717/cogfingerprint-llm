**Abstract**

Contemporary Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems demonstrate remarkable proficiency in capturing lexical similarity between words, frequently achieving state-of-the-art performance on semantic relatedness benchmarks. However, a critical examination reveals a fundamental limitation: these models primarily operate on distributional representations, lacking the embodied conceptual basis crucial for genuine understanding. This paper argues that current NLP approaches, rooted in statistical correlations within text corpora, fail to adequately integrate human psychology – specifically, the role of perception, intentionality, and belief – in shaping word meaning.  We posit that the success of NLP in identifying superficial semantic connections does not equate to a robust, grounded representation.  Further research necessitates incorporating cognitive science principles to develop NLP systems exhibiting a more nuanced and ecologically valid understanding of language, moving beyond purely computational mimicry of human linguistic behavior.  This constitutes a crucial step toward building truly intelligent NLP systems (2020).
