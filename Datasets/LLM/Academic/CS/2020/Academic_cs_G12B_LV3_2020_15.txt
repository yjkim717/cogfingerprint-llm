**Abstract:** The rapid advancement of pre-trained models (PTMs) has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of natural language processing (NLP) since 2018. This survey comprehensively examines the burgeoning field of language representation learning, providing a structured overview of prominent PTM architectures and their adaptation strategies for diverse downstream tasks. We categorize existing models based on training objectives and architectural innovations, detailing fine-tuning methodologies and prompting techniques employed for optimal performance. Furthermore, this work identifies key challenges and proposes promising avenues for future research, including exploring efficient transfer learning, mitigating bias in language representations, and developing PTMs tailored for low-resource languages â€“ critical areas for continued progress within the NLP community.
