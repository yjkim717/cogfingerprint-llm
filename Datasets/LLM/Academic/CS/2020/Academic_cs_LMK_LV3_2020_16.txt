Abstract:
Multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) has emerged as a pivotal area of research in natural language processing (NLP), leveraging deep learning to facilitate translation across multiple languages. By harnessing transfer learning, MNMT models can capitalize on shared linguistic representations and improve translation accuracy for low-resource languages. This survey provides a comprehensive review of MNMT approaches, categorizing them into three primary paradigms: (1) multilingual models with a single encoder-decoder architecture, (2) multi-task learning frameworks, and (3) meta-learning strategies. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, highlighting their performance on various language pairs and datasets. As of 2020, the field is witnessing a growing interest in exploiting pre-trained language models and multimodal information to further enhance MNMT. This review aims to provide a structured overview of the current state-of-the-art in MNMT and identify promising research directions for future exploration.
