Title: Investigating COVID-19 Reporting Integrity through Zipf's Law: A Data Forensic Analysis

Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of reliable and accurate reporting in epidemiological investigations. As the global community grappled with the rapidly evolving crisis, concerns emerged regarding the veracity of COVID-19 case and mortality data reported by various countries. This paper proposes a novel data forensic approach leveraging Zipf's law to scrutinize the integrity of COVID-19 reporting. Zipf's law, a statistical principle governing the distribution of frequencies in large datasets, has been widely applied in various domains, including linguistics and network analysis. By examining the distribution of COVID-19 cases and fatalities across different regions, we test the hypothesis that authentic reporting adheres to a power-law distribution, as predicted by Zipf's law.

Our analysis focuses on COVID-19 data reported by countries during 2020, employing a robust statistical framework to detect deviations from the expected power-law distribution. We demonstrate that countries with anomalous reporting patterns exhibit significant departures from Zipf's law, suggesting potential data manipulation or irregularities. Conversely, countries with robust reporting mechanisms tend to conform to the expected distribution. Our findings have significant implications for pandemic investigation and data-driven decision-making, highlighting the utility of Zipf's law as a forensic tool for identifying potential anomalies in COVID-19 reporting. By enhancing the accuracy and reliability of epidemiological data, our approach contributes to a more informed global response to the pandemic.
