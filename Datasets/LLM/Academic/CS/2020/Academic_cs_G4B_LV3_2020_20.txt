**Abstract**

Automated cell segmentation within microscopy images remains a critical challenge in biomedical research and high-throughput screening. This study investigates the efficacy of Cellpose, a deep learning framework, for robust and adaptable cell identification. Specifically, we evaluated Cellpose’s performance across a range of image modalities, demonstrating its capacity for precise 2D and, crucially, 3D cell segmentation without necessitating bespoke retraining. Leveraging a transfer learning approach, the 3D extension effectively utilizes pre-trained 2D models, accelerating deployment and minimizing data requirements. Furthermore, the algorithm’s design facilitates community-driven curation through automated labeling, promoting reproducible results and expanding its applicability.  These findings underscore Cellpose’s potential as a foundational tool for advancing quantitative analysis in cellular imaging, particularly within the context of evolving microscopy technologies and data-intensive research workflows.
