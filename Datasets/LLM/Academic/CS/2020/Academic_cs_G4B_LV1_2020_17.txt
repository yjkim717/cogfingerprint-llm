**Abstract**

The rapid dissemination of data during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic presented unprecedented challenges for global epidemiological analysis. This research investigates the potential for systematic biases in international reporting using principles derived from Zipf’s law, a statistical model describing the inverse relationship between rank and frequency. We hypothesize that deviations from expected Zipfian distributions within confirmed case counts across nations may indicate data manipulation or inaccuracies. Applying this framework to a dataset of publicly available COVID-19 case reports from multiple international sources, we identified statistically significant anomalies, notably a pronounced divergence in reported case numbers from China compared to predicted values based on its global prevalence.  These discrepancies warrant further investigation using forensic data analysis techniques. The findings suggest that automated anomaly detection systems, leveraging Zipf’s law and other statistical measures, could be valuable tools in enhancing the reliability and validity of international pandemic investigation and supporting robust data forensic practices. Future work will explore the application of this methodology to other public health datasets.
