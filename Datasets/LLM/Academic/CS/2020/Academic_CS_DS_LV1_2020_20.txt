**Abstract**

The accurate segmentation of cellular structures in microscopy imagery remains a foundational challenge in computational biology. While deep learning has demonstrated considerable efficacy, prevailing models are typically specialized, requiring extensive retraining and parameter tuning for each new dataset, which impedes scalability and generalizability. This paper introduces Cellpose, a novel generalist algorithm for cellular segmentation that circumvents these limitations. Inspired by the morphological principles of cell geometry, our approach employs a deep neural network trained on a highly diverse, curated dataset of microscopy images. A key innovation is the formulation of segmentation as a flow-based problem, where the model predicts vector fields pointing towards cell centers, enabling it to generalize across disparate cell types and imaging modalities without retraining. We quantitatively validate Cellpose against specialist models on a broad benchmark, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy in 2D. Furthermore, we present a principled 3D extension of the architecture, establishing its utility for volumetric data analysis. Our work provides a robust, off-the-shelf tool that significantly lowers the barrier to high-throughput biological image analysis.
