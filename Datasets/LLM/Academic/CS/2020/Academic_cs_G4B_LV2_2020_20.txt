**Abstract: Automated Cell Segmentation via a Generalist Deep Learning Framework – Cellpose**

Recent advances in deep learning have yielded promising solutions for automated cell segmentation within cellular imaging workflows. However, traditional methods often necessitate extensive retraining and parameter optimization for specific image modalities and experimental conditions. This study introduces Cellpose, a generalist deep learning algorithm designed to address this limitation, demonstrating robust performance across a diverse range of cellular imaging datasets. Cellpose leverages a convolutional neural network architecture trained on a large, multi-modal dataset, enabling it to perform accurate cell segmentation without requiring task-specific adaptation. 

Our analysis reveals Cellpose’s efficacy in minimizing user intervention, effectively eliminating the need for iterative retraining or manual parameter adjustments – a critical advantage for high-throughput analysis.  Preliminary results, presented in 2020, indicate a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy compared to established, modality-specific algorithms.  Further investigation is warranted to explore the algorithm’s adaptability to novel image types and to quantify its potential impact on downstream analyses within image analysis and bioinformatics research.
