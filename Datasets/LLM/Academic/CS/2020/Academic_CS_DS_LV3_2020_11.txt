In 2020, deep learning has fundamentally reshaped the landscape of image segmentation within computer vision. This paradigm shift is primarily characterized by the proliferation of sophisticated convolutional and encoder-decoder architectures, which have enabled unprecedented accuracy in both semantic and instance segmentation tasks. The field's rapid advancement is underpinned by the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and continuous benchmarking, driving performance on established metrics to new heights. However, significant research challenges persist, including model generalization across domains, computational efficiency for real-time applications, and the nuanced delineation of object boundaries in complex scenes. Addressing these limitations is critical for deploying robust segmentation systems in practical scenarios such as autonomous driving and medical image analysis, thereby charting a clear trajectory for future investigative efforts.
