**Abstract**

Image segmentation, a fundamental task in computer vision, has witnessed significant advancements driven by deep learning techniques. This survey critically examines recent developments in deep learning-based image segmentation, focusing on the evolving landscape of semantic and instance segmentation methodologies. We explore the prevalence of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their adaptations within architectures such as U-Net and Mask R-CNN, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Specifically, the distinctions between semantic segmentation, which assigns a class label to each pixel, and instance segmentation, which differentiates individual objects within a scene, are delineated. Furthermore, the survey addresses ongoing challenges, including boundary ambiguity, handling small objects, and the computational demands associated with complex architectures.  Future research directions are considered, emphasizing the need for improved robustness and efficiency in achieving accurate and comprehensive image understanding.
