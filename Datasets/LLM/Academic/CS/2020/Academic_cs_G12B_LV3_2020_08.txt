**Abstract**

The rotation averaging problem, a fundamental challenge in structure-from-motion (SfM) and computer vision, seeks to determine a consensus rotation from a set of noisy measurements. Traditional approaches often struggle with global optimality, particularly in the presence of significant outliers. This paper introduces a novel algorithm, termed Shonan Rotation Averaging, that addresses these limitations by integrating semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and manifold minimization techniques. Our method formulates the rotation averaging problem as a constrained optimization problem on the Special Orthogonal group SO(3), leveraging SDR to obtain a convex relaxation. Subsequent manifold minimization refines this relaxation, converging to a globally optimal solution while preserving the computational efficiency crucial for large-scale SfM applications. Experimental results demonstrate that Shonan Rotation Averaging significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with substantial noise and outlier contamination, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in robust and globally optimal rotation estimation.
