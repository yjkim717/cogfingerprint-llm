**Abstract**

This study investigates the impact of architectural complexity and workload diversification on system failure resilience in large-scale, distributed cloud datacenters. As these systems form the backbone of global digital infrastructure, understanding the determinants of their operational risk is critical. We posit that increased inter-service competition for finite computational resources exacerbates systemic instability, while a diversified workload profile may mitigate correlated failures. To test these hypotheses, we model the datacenter ecosystem and employ a dynamic panel data analysis on a longitudinal dataset of performance metrics and failure incidents from a major provider. Our findings indicate that heightened competition significantly increases crash and performance degradation risks. Conversely, strategic workload diversification acts as a stabilizing mechanism, reducing overall system volatility. These results provide a quantifiable framework for resource scheduling and fault tolerance policy design, contributing to the engineering of more robust and reliable cloud computing platforms.
