Title: Assessing the Interplay between Competition, Revenue Diversification, and Risk-Taking in BRICS Banking Sector: A Dynamic Panel Data Analysis

Abstract:
This study investigates the nexus between competition, revenue diversification, and risk-taking behavior in BRICS banks using a dynamic panel data approach. Leveraging a sample of 150 banks from BRICS countries over the period 2010-2020, we employ the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation technique to examine the impact of competition and revenue diversification on risk-taking. Our findings suggest that heightened competition is associated with increased risk-taking, while revenue diversification is found to mitigate risk-taking behavior. The results also indicate that the relationship between competition and risk-taking is moderated by revenue diversification. The study contributes to the existing literature by providing insights into the complex dynamics between competition, revenue diversification, and risk-taking in the BRICS banking sector, with implications for regulatory policies and risk management strategies.
