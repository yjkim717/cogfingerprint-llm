This work explores the properties of the triangular ratio metric within the unit disk in the complex plane, presenting novel bounds relevant to geometric function theory. We demonstrate a connection between this metric and the HÃ¶lder continuity of quasiconformal mappings, a class of functions vital for image processing and computer graphics. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of conformal geometry and offer potential for improved algorithms utilizing distortion-preserving transformations.
