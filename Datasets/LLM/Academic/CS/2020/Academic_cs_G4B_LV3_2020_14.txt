**Abstract**

The increasing deployment of autonomous vehicles necessitates robust and adaptive threat assessment systems. This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to proactively mitigate rear-end collisions, a primary contributor to cascading multiple vehicle collisions.  Our conceptual model employs an agent-based approach, wherein each autonomous vehicle learns optimal defensive maneuvers through simulated interactions.  Crucially, the framework incorporates a threat assessment module utilizing predictive analytics to anticipate potentially hazardous situations, prioritizing collision avoidance strategies.  Preliminary simulations demonstrate the potential of this RL-driven system to significantly reduce the incidence of rear-end collisions and subsequent complex traffic events.  Further research will focus on integrating this framework with collaborative decision-making protocols, fostering inter-vehicle communication and promoting a more resilient and safer autonomous driving ecosystem.
