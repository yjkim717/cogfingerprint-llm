**Abstract**

This research investigates the efficiency implications of static pricing strategies within multi-unit supply scenarios, employing a novel framework informed by multi-unit prophet inequalities.  Traditional revenue management models often assume dynamic pricing; however, this study examines the operational effectiveness of fixed pricing structures, hypothesizing an optimal pricing level representing a ‘sweet spot’ for maximized system efficiency. We formalize this analysis through a computational model, demonstrating a non-linear relationship between static price and overall supply chain performance.  The identified optimal price mitigates potential inefficiencies arising from both underutilization of supply and suboptimal revenue capture.  Preliminary results suggest that a carefully calibrated static price can outperform adaptive systems in certain contexts, particularly where supply variability is moderate. Further investigation is warranted to explore the robustness of this finding across diverse product categories and market dynamics.
