**Abstract**

Robust mixture model estimation remains a challenging problem, particularly when confronted with significant data corruption. Existing approaches frequently rely on computationally expensive iterative methods, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. This work introduces a novel polynomial-time algorithm for accurately estimating the parameters of a mixture of Gaussians in the presence of substantial noise. Leveraging tensor decomposition techniques, specifically utilizing the sum-of-squares method, our algorithm mitigates the impact of outliers by explicitly modeling the data covariance structure.  We demonstrate that this approach avoids the limitations of traditional maximum likelihood estimation, which is highly susceptible to corruption.  The resulting algorithm provides a significant advancement, offering a practical and efficient solution for robust clustering and density estimation tasks.  Preliminary results, presented in 2020, indicate superior performance compared to established robust estimators across diverse datasets exhibiting varying levels of contamination, suggesting a promising direction for future research.
