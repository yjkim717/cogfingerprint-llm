In computational pharmacology, the integration of physiological dynamics with pharmacokinetic modeling remains a critical challenge, particularly for drugs exhibiting complex absorption-metabolism relationships. This study introduces a novel computational framework employing delay differential equations (DDEs) to construct a population pharmacokinetic model that explicitly simulates gastric emptying kinetics. The primary objective is to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of the oscillatory plasma concentration-time profiles observed for losartan and its pharmacologically active metabolite, EXP-3174. Traditional compartmental models often fail to capture such rhythmic patterns, as they typically overlook the discontinuous nature of gastric emptying and its systemic repercussions. Our DDE-based model incorporates a distributed delay to represent the gastric emptying process, thereby providing a more physiologically realistic description of the drug input function into the systemic circulation. Parameter estimation was performed using a nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach applied to clinical data, enabling the quantification of inter-individual variability. The results demonstrate that the oscillatory profile of losartan is a direct consequence of the pulsatile entry of the drug into the duodenum, which is subsequently dampened for EXP-3174 due to its formation kinetics. This research, situated in 2020, underscores the significant potential of DDEs in pharmacoinformatics for enhancing the predictive accuracy of in silico models, ultimately contributing to more personalized and efficacious dosing regimens for drugs with complex pharmacokinetics.
