**Abstract: Algorithmic Welfare Allocation Under Stochastic Income Dynamics**

The increasing prevalence of algorithmic decision-making in social welfare programs necessitates robust methodologies for resource allocation under realistic economic conditions. This paper addresses the problem of optimally distributing subsidies to minimize poverty within a dynamic population experiencing stochastic income shocks. We formulate a novel welfare maximization framework that explicitly incorporates income volatility, recognizing that traditional static allocation strategies are often ineffective in mitigating the long-term effects of such shocks.  Specifically, we consider two prevalent poverty minimization objectives: the min-sum objective, aiming to reduce the aggregate poverty level, and the min-max objective, prioritizing the reduction of poverty among the most vulnerable individuals.  We develop and analyze efficient algorithms for solving the resulting optimization problems under both objectives. Our approach leverages dynamic programming principles adapted for computational feasibility within the context of large-scale populations.  We present a novel iterative min-sum algorithm and demonstrate its convergence properties.  Furthermore, we explore the complexities of the min-max problem, proposing a heuristic approximation strategy suitable for practical implementation.  Empirical evaluation, using simulated income shock data, demonstrates the significant welfare gains achieved by our dynamic subsidy allocation policies compared to static baseline methods, highlighting the importance of accounting for stochasticity in algorithmic welfare design.

**Notes on Reasoning & Choices:**

*   **Contextualization (2020):** The framing emphasizes the *increasing prevalence* of algorithmic decision-making, which was a significant and growing trend around 2020.  This sets the stage for the paper's relevance.
*   **Precise Terminology:** I used terms like "stochastic income shocks," "dynamic programming," "optimization problems," "convergence properties," "heuristic approximation strategy," and "empirical evaluation" to establish a technical tone.
*   **Structured Reasoning:**
    *   **Problem Statement:** Clearly defines the problem â€“ optimal subsidy allocation with income shocks.
    *   **Motivation:** Explains *why* this is important (ineffectiveness of static methods).
    *   **Objectives:** Explicitly states the min-sum and min-max objectives.
    *   **Approach:** Briefly describes the algorithmic methods (dynamic programming adaptation, iterative min-sum, heuristic for min-max).
    *   **Results:** Mentions empirical evaluation and demonstrates welfare gains.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for the ~216-word range.
*   **Focus on CS Aspects:** While the topic has social implications, the abstract emphasizes the *algorithmic* and *computational* aspects of the problem, which is appropriate for a CS audience. Phrases like "computational feasibility" and "convergence properties" reinforce this.
*   **"Novel" Claims:**  I included phrases like "novel welfare maximization framework" and "novel iterative min-sum algorithm" to suggest original contributions, which is standard in academic abstracts.
*   **"Empirical Evaluation":** Mentioning this indicates practical testing and validation of the proposed algorithms.
