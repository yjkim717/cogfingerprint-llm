**Abstract**

This work investigates the optimization of proper scoring rules for probabilistic forecasting, addressing limitations observed in standard implementations. We formulate an objective function designed to maximize the incremental information gain achieved through posterior belief refinement via binary effort allocation. Characterizing optimal strategies within simplified scenarios, we then develop computationally efficient algorithms for tackling complex, high-dimensional forecasting problems. Furthermore, we present methods for identifying approximately optimal scoring rules, demonstrating empirically that commonly employed rules frequently exhibit suboptimal performance. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of scoring rule properties and provide practical guidance for designing improved forecasting systems that more accurately reflect and update posterior beliefs.
