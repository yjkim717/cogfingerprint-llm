**Abstract**

This research investigates the operational efficiency of static pricing strategies within constrained supply networks, specifically examining the emergence of an optimal pricing regime. Leveraging concepts from multi-unit prophet inequalities, we demonstrate that a fixed, pre-determined price point does not necessarily represent the most efficient allocation of goods. Our analysis posits that a ‘sweet spot’ exists – a price level that balances supply responsiveness with revenue maximization – and that deviation from this point introduces diminishing returns. 

We formulate a simplified computational model to illustrate this phenomenon, considering factors such as inventory levels and anticipated demand. Simulation results suggest that dynamically adjusting pricing based on observable supply conditions, even through static thresholds, can outperform rigidly applied static pricing. This work highlights the potential for algorithmic refinement of pricing policies to improve overall system efficiency, particularly in scenarios characterized by predictable supply variability.
