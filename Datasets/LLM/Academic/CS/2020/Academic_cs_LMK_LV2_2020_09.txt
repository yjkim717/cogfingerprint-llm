Title: Enhancing Software Readability through Comment Understandability: A Flesch Reading Ease Approach

Abstract:
Software readability is a crucial aspect of maintainable code, with code comments playing a vital role in facilitating comprehension. This study presents a novel tool that leverages the Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) score to improve the readability of software comments. By analyzing the linguistic complexity of comments, the tool assesses their readability level and provides suggestions for enhancement. We evaluated the effectiveness of our tool through a mixed-methods study involving professional programmers and students. Participants assessed the understandability of comments before and after applying the tool's suggestions. Results indicate a significant improvement in comment understandability, as measured by the FRE score. Our findings suggest that using the FRE score as a metric for comment readability can lead to more maintainable software. The study's outcomes have implications for software development practices, highlighting the importance of readable comments in ensuring the long-term maintainability of software systems. The proposed tool offers a practical solution for enhancing software readability, contributing to the broader goal of improving software quality.
