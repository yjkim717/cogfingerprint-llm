**Abstract**

Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms frequently grapple with achieving global optimality, particularly when dealing with complex scene geometries. This paper introduces Shonan Rotation Averaging (SRA), a novel optimization technique designed to address these challenges. SRA integrates semidefinite relaxation (SDR) within a manifold minimization framework, offering a computationally efficient path to globally optimal solutions.  The method’s core innovation lies in iteratively refining a rotation matrix representation of the scene’s geometric structure, leveraging SDR to enforce geometric constraints and manifold minimization to ensure smoothness.  Experimental results, presented in 2020, demonstrate SRA’s efficacy in recovering accurate 3D reconstructions from sparse feature correspondences, exhibiting superior performance compared to conventional bundle adjustment approaches.  Furthermore, SRA maintains the scalability inherent in existing SfM pipelines, facilitating its application to large-scale datasets.
