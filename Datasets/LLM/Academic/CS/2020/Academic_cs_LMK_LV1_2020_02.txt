In this paper, we present a novel polynomial-time algorithm for robust estimation of Gaussian mixtures, leveraging the sum-of-squares method and tensor decomposition. Our approach achieves algorithmic robustness against arbitrary corruptions, yielding a reliable estimator for mixtures of k Gaussians. By exploiting the structural properties of Gaussian distributions and the robustness guarantees of the sum-of-squares framework, we establish a theoretical foundation for efficient robust estimation. As a result, our algorithm provides a significant advancement in the field, demonstrating improved performance and resilience in the presence of adversarial noise. (2020)
