**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles necessitates robust and proactive safety mechanisms to mitigate collision risks. This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed for real-time threat assessment and prediction of multiple vehicle collision scenarios, a critical challenge in autonomous driving. Traditional approaches often struggle to effectively model the complex interactions inherent in multi-agent environments, particularly in situations leading to rear-end collisions. Our framework addresses this limitation by utilizing an RL agent trained to dynamically evaluate potential hazards based on surrounding vehicle dynamics and predicted future trajectories. The agent learns an optimal policy for threat prioritization and proactive response, enabling the autonomous vehicle to anticipate and avoid collisions beyond those addressed by conventional rule-based systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach through simulations, showcasing improved performance in predicting and preventing multiple vehicle collisions compared to baseline methods. The results suggest that RL-based threat assessment provides a promising avenue for enhancing the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems.
