**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have been largely driven by the proliferation of pre-trained models. Sun’s (2020) seminal survey meticulously examines this trend, providing a structured categorization of prominent architectures, including transformer-based models and recurrent networks.  The work details a spectrum of adaptation strategies – fine-tuning, transfer learning, and domain-specific customization – employed to leverage these models for diverse downstream tasks.  Crucially, the survey identifies key challenges related to computational cost and data requirements associated with pre-training.  Furthermore, it articulates critical future research directions, emphasizing the need for more efficient training methodologies, improved interpretability of language representations, and exploration of unsupervised learning techniques to enhance the applicability of these models across a wider range of linguistic domains.
