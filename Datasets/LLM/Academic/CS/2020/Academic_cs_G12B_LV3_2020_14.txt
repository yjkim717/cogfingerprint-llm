**Abstract**

The increasing deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust and proactive threat assessment methodologies to guarantee operational safety. This paper introduces a novel conceptual framework leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) to address the complex challenge of preventing multiple vehicle collision scenarios, with a particular emphasis on mitigating the prevalence of rear-end collisions. Traditional rule-based systems often struggle to generalize across diverse and unpredictable traffic conditions, motivating the exploration of data-driven approaches. Our framework utilizes RL to train an agent capable of dynamically evaluating potential threats and generating evasive maneuvers within complex multi-agent environments. We argue that such an RL-based approach allows for adaptive decision-making and improved collision avoidance compared to static planning strategies. Furthermore, we highlight the crucial need for interdisciplinary collaboration between control systems engineers, safety experts, and behavioral scientists to ensure the comprehensive validation and effective deployment of this framework, ultimately contributing to enhanced safety assurance in autonomous driving systems.
