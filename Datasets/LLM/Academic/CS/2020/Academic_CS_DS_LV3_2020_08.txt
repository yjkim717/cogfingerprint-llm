This paper presents Shonan Rotation Averaging, a novel method for globally solving rotation averaging in structure-from-motion. By formulating the problem on the manifold of rotations and employing a tight semidefinite relaxation, our approach certifiably achieves global optimality, a significant challenge in 3D vision. Crucially, this is accomplished without sacrificing the scalability required by modern incremental SfM pipelines. We provide extensive experimental validation demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness compared to conventional local optimization techniques, establishing a new state-of-the-art for reliable 3D reconstruction.
