**Abstract**

The escalating need for robust and reliable authentication methods has driven research toward biometric solutions. While unimodal biometric systems, such as fingerprint and palmprint identification, offer convenience, they are vulnerable to presentation attacks and exhibit varying performance under diverse environmental conditions. This paper introduces a novel multimodal biometric authentication system leveraging deep learning techniques to mitigate these limitations. Our approach integrates fingerprint and palmprint data, employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and subsequent fusion strategies to enhance overall system accuracy. Experimental results, conducted on benchmark datasets, demonstrate a significant improvement in both the Equal Error Rate (EER) and False Acceptance Rate (FAR) compared to individual unimodal systems. The proposed architecture offers a pathway to more secure and resilient biometric authentication, effectively addressing the vulnerabilities inherent in single-biometric approaches. We conclude that deep learning-based multimodal biometrics holds considerable promise for advancing the state-of-the-art in secure access control and personal identification within the evolving landscape of cybersecurity.
