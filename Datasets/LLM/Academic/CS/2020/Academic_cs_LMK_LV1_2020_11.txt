"In the realm of computer vision, image segmentation has emerged as a crucial task, enabling the extraction of meaningful information from visual data. As of 2020, deep learning approaches have revolutionized this field, with encoder-decoder architectures being a prominent paradigm. This paper provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art deep learning models for semantic segmentation, examining their strengths and limitations. We discuss the efficacy of various techniques, including convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms, and analyze the challenges hindering their adoption. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, highlighting the potential of emerging architectures and the need for robust evaluation metrics."
