Title: Assessing Risk-Taking in BRICS Banking: A Dynamic Panel Analysis of Competition and Diversification

Abstract:

This study investigates the interplay between market competition, revenue diversification, and risk-taking behavior in BRICS banks (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) using a dynamic panel data framework. Employing a sample of 150 banks from 2010 to 2020, we estimate the impact of competition, measured by the Lerner index, and revenue diversification, proxied by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, on risk-taking, captured by the ratio of non-performing loans to total loans. Our results indicate that increased competition is associated with higher risk-taking, while revenue diversification reduces risk-taking. The findings suggest that BRICS banks' risk-taking behavior is influenced by the competitive landscape and diversification strategies. The study's outcomes have implications for policymakers and regulators seeking to mitigate systemic risk in emerging economies. By employing a dynamic panel Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator, we control for potential endogeneity and provide robust insights into the complex relationships between competition, diversification, and risk-taking in BRICS banking.
