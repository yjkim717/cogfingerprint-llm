**Computational Modeling of Gastric Emptying Effects on Drug Pharmacokinetics: A Delay Differential Equation Approach for Losartan and EXP-3174**

The accurate prediction of drug absorption and disposition is crucial for optimizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing adverse effects. Traditional pharmacokinetic (PK) models often simplify gastrointestinal (GI) physiology, potentially overlooking the significant influence of gastric emptying (GE) on drug bioavailability. This work presents a novel computational framework for modeling the PK of losartan and its primary metabolite, EXP-3174, incorporating a time-varying GE rate described by a delay differential equation (DDE).  The DDE model accounts for the lag between drug release and absorption, reflecting the complex, non-instantaneous nature of GE processes.

We implemented a population PK model, parameterized using available clinical data for losartan and EXP-3174, and augmented it with a physiologically-based GE model.  The resulting system of differential equations, including the DDE representing GE, was solved numerically using established methods for stiff systems, implemented in Python with SciPy.  Model validation involved comparing predicted plasma concentrations with observed data across a range of GE rates.  Sensitivity analysis, performed using Sobol’ indices, quantified the relative importance of various model parameters, highlighting the substantial impact of GE rate variability on losartan and EXP-3174 exposure.  Results demonstrate that incorporating a DDE-based GE model significantly improves the predictive accuracy of the PK model compared to models employing constant or simplified GE assumptions. This approach offers a computationally efficient and flexible platform for simulating drug absorption under diverse physiological conditions, with implications for personalized medicine and drug development in 2020 and beyond.
