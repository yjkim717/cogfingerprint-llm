**Abstract**

Software comments represent a critical, yet often neglected, component of software maintainability and developer productivity. This research introduces a novel automated tool designed to assess and enhance the readability of in-code comments. Utilizing the Flesch Reading Ease index alongside metrics quantifying word complexity, the tool provides a quantitative measure of comment quality. Preliminary investigations, conducted in 2020, demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in programmer comprehension scores when utilizing comments evaluated and subsequently revised by the tool.  Furthermore, analysis revealed a reduction in average word length and sentence complexity within improved comment sets.  The tool’s integration into existing developer workflows, facilitated through a dedicated plugin, promises to streamline the process of generating clear, concise documentation.  Future work will explore the tool’s efficacy across diverse programming languages and project scales, solidifying its role as a valuable developer tool for enhancing software quality.
