**Abstract**

Recent advances in deep learning have spurred interest in modeling complex dynamical systems. However, ensuring stability and predictability within these models remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a novel framework integrating dynamical systems theory with deep generative modeling to achieve stable system learning. We introduce a joint optimization strategy wherein a dynamics model is simultaneously trained alongside a carefully constructed Lyapunov function. This approach facilitates the identification and explicit representation of system stability properties, crucial for reliable simulation and control.  Specifically, the learned Lyapunov function provides a rigorous guarantee of stability, allowing for the generation of diverse, yet predictable, system trajectories via associated generative models. Preliminary results demonstrate the efficacy of this method in capturing and reproducing complex, nonlinear dynamics, suggesting a pathway towards more robust and interpretable deep system simulations.
