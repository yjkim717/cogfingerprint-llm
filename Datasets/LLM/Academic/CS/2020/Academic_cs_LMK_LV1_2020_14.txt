Title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Threat Assessment for Autonomous Vehicles: A Safety Assurance Framework

Abstract:
The increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles on public roads necessitates the development of robust safety assurance frameworks to prevent multiple vehicle collisions. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based threat assessment framework for autonomous driving, leveraging a Markov decision process to model the interactions between the ego vehicle and its surroundings. Our framework utilizes a deep Q-network to learn an optimal threat assessment policy, enabling the autonomous vehicle to anticipate and respond to potential hazards. We evaluate the proposed framework using a simulated driving environment, demonstrating its efficacy in reducing the risk of multiple vehicle collisions. The results show that our approach outperforms traditional rule-based methods, achieving a significant reduction in collision rates. This work contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems, with implications for the development of more sophisticated safety assurance protocols.
