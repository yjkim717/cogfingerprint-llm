**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles necessitates robust threat assessment capabilities to mitigate risks associated with complex traffic scenarios. This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to proactively identify and predict multiple vehicle collisions, specifically focusing on scenarios exhibiting potential for rear-end impact. We hypothesize that an RL agent, trained within a simulated environment, can learn to dynamically evaluate surrounding vehicle trajectories and predict collision probabilities with greater fidelity than traditional reactive systems.  The proposed architecture incorporates a multi-agent approach, allowing individual vehicles to simultaneously contribute to a collective threat assessment.  Evaluation metrics prioritize minimizing false negatives – the failure to identify imminent collisions – while maintaining computational efficiency. Preliminary results demonstrate the framework’s capacity to anticipate and respond to complex interactions, suggesting a pathway toward enhanced safety within autonomous driving systems and contributing to a reduced incidence of multiple vehicle collisions.
