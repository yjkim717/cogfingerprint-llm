Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a computational science publication, based on the provided summary and adhering to the specified constraints (year context: 2020, ~251 words). I've aimed for precision and a structured argument, typical of computational modeling research.  Following the abstract, I'll include a brief explanation of the choices I made in crafting it.

**Abstract**

The absorption and disposition of orally administered drugs are significantly influenced by gastrointestinal physiology, particularly gastric emptying rate (GER). This study presents the development and validation of a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model for losartan and its active metabolite, EXP-3174, incorporating a physiologically-based representation of gastric emptying. Utilizing sparse plasma concentration-time data from a clinical trial, we employed a non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach within a software environment to estimate individual model parameters and assess inter-subject variability. A key innovation of this model is the explicit inclusion of a delay differential equation (DDE) to represent the time-dependent impact of GER on drug absorption.  Model structure was optimized through a systematic exploration of potential covariates and mechanistic components, guided by principles of model parsimony and predictive performance.  The resulting PopPK model demonstrates a statistically significant and physiologically plausible influence of GER on the absorption kinetics of both losartan and EXP-3174.  Parameter identifiability analysis confirmed the robustness of the estimated GER parameter.  Furthermore, simulations using the developed PopPK model were conducted to explore the potential impact of varying GER rates on drug exposure, highlighting the importance of considering GI physiology in pharmacokinetic predictions.  This work provides a framework for improving the accuracy of pharmacokinetic predictions for orally dosed drugs, particularly those exhibiting delayed absorption, and offers insights into the role of GER in drug disposition. The model's predictive capabilities and modular design facilitate its application to other angiotensin II receptor blockers and related compounds.

**Explanation of Choices and Considerations:**

*   **CS Focus:** I framed the work within a computational science context by emphasizing the modeling approach (non-linear mixed-effects, delay differential equations, parameter identifiability analysis, simulations).
*   **Precise Terminology:** I used terms like "population pharmacokinetic (PopPK)," "non-linear mixed-effects modeling," "delay differential equation (DDE)," "parameter identifiability," and "physiologically-based" to establish the technical level.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical progression: introduction of the problem (GI physiology's influence), description of the methods (PopPK modeling, DDE inclusion), key findings (significant GER impact, parameter robustness), simulations and their implications, and finally, the broader significance and potential applications.
*   **Year Context (2020):**  The language and emphasis on model validation and predictive performance are consistent with trends in computational modeling research around 2020.
*   **Word Count:**  I aimed for the requested ~251 words. Actual word count may vary slightly depending on formatting.
*   **Emphasis on Innovation:** I highlighted the DDE inclusion as a key innovation.
*   **Model Parsimony:** Mentioning "model parsimony" is important in computational modeling â€“ it shows you aimed for the simplest model that still adequately explains the data.



I hope this abstract meets your requirements.
