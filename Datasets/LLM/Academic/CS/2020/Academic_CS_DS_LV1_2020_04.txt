This paper presents a novel optimization framework for proper scoring rules in sequential belief updating systems. We formulate the problem of maximizing cumulative forecaster payoff across multiple prediction tasks as a constrained optimization program where forecasters transition from prior to posterior beliefs under information acquisition costs. Our theoretical analysis establishes that standard quadratic scoring rules become suboptimal in multi-task environments, leading us to derive an adaptive scoring mechanism that dynamically adjusts rule parameters based on the forecaster's demonstrated expertise and belief refinement trajectory. Experimental evaluation demonstrates our method achieves 23% higher payoff retention compared to existing proper scoring rules while maintaining strict properness guarantees, providing enhanced incentives for accurate belief reporting in complex decision systems.
