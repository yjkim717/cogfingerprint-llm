In this work, we present a novel approach to learning stable deep dynamics models for continuous control tasks. By jointly optimizing a deep neural network dynamics model and a Lyapunov function, we ensure stability guarantees for the learned system. Our method leverages the Lyapunov stability theorem to constrain the optimization process, yielding a model that is provably stable. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on several benchmark dynamical systems, showcasing improved stability and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art generative models. Our results highlight the potential of integrating stability guarantees into deep learning frameworks for modeling complex dynamical systems. (2020)
