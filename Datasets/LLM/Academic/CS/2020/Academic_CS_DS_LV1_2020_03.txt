**Abstract**

We investigate the power of static pricing in sequential multi-unit revenue maximization against adversarial customer streams. While dynamic pricing adapts to market conditions, static pricing offers operational simplicity and fairness guarantees. This work establishes tight approximation ratios for static pricing schemes when selling k identical units to n buyers with arbitrary valuations arriving online. By connecting prophet inequalities with supply-constrained mechanism design, we prove that static pricing achieves a competitive ratio of 1 - O(âˆš(log k/k)) against the optimal online algorithm. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off: higher prices risk unsold inventory while lower prices sacrifice revenue from high-value customers. We construct a family of instances matching this bound using carefully crafted valuation sequences that exploit static pricing's lack of adaptation. These results demonstrate that for moderate inventory sizes, static pricing provides near-optimal revenue without requiring dynamic price adjustments, with implications for practical revenue management systems where implementation complexity matters.
