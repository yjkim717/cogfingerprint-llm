**Abstract**

This work investigates the geometric properties of distance functions within constrained domains, specifically the unit disk. We establish sharp bounds on the triangular ratio metric, leveraging a novel analysis utilizing the unit disk as a fundamental geometric building block. These bounds are rigorously derived, employing techniques related to HÃ¶lder continuity estimations.  Furthermore, we demonstrate the direct applicability of these metric constraints in analyzing the smoothness and regularity of quasiconformal mappings.  The resulting framework provides a refined understanding of distance distortion and offers a potential basis for algorithmic analysis concerning shape approximation and data compression, suggesting connections to efficient representation strategies.
