**Multimodal Deep Learning for Enhanced Biometric Authentication**

Biometric authentication systems are increasingly prevalent in security-critical applications; however, reliance on single biometric modalities (unimodal biometrics) remains vulnerable to presentation attacks, sensor limitations, and individual variations. This paper investigates a novel multimodal biometric authentication framework leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance robustness and accuracy. Our approach integrates fingerprint and palmprint recognition, two complementary biometric traits, within a unified deep neural network architecture. Specifically, we employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract robust feature representations from both fingerprint images and palmprint textures, followed by a learned fusion strategy to combine these features at the decision level.  Experiments conducted on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed multimodal system significantly outperforms unimodal fingerprint and palmprint recognition systems in terms of equal error rate (EER) and verification rate at a fixed false acceptance rate.  Furthermore, ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the deep feature learning and the chosen fusion method.  The results highlight the potential of deep learning-based multimodal biometrics to provide a more secure and reliable authentication solution, addressing limitations inherent in traditional unimodal approaches and aligning with the growing demand for enhanced security in automated systems. Future work will explore the incorporation of additional biometric modalities and investigate adversarial training strategies to further improve resilience against spoofing attacks.
