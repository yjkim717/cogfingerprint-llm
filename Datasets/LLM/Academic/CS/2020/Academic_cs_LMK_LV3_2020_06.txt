This study investigates the nexus between competition, revenue diversification, and risk-taking in BRICS banks using a dynamic panel data framework. Employing the two-step system generalized methods of moments (2GMM) estimator, our analysis reveals a significant relationship between competition and risk-taking, moderated by revenue diversification strategies. The findings suggest that increased competition leads to heightened risk-taking, while diversified revenue streams mitigate this effect. The results have implications for regulatory policies aimed at ensuring financial stability in emerging economies, particularly in the context of the 2020 global economic landscape.
