**Abstract**

This paper presents a novel polynomial-time algorithm for robustly estimating the parameters of a mixture of *k* Gaussian distributions in high dimensions under a constant fraction of adversarial corruptions. Departing from method-of-moments approaches that rely on brittle non-convex optimization, we develop a framework based on the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy. Our core contribution is a meta-theorem demonstrating that a low-degree SoS proof of certifiable subgaussianity for the good data, combined with a tensor decomposition algorithm, can be leveraged to efficiently recover accurate estimates of the mixture components. This yields the first computationally and statistically efficient estimator for this problem that is robust to a dimension-independent fraction of corruptions, resolving a central challenge in algorithmic robust statistics. Our work, situated in the 2020 landscape, bridges the theoretical guarantees of SoS with practical robust estimation.
