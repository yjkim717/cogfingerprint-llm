**Abstract**

This work examines triangular ratio metric properties within the unit disk, establishing novel bounds relevant to the analysis of quasiconformal mappings. Utilizing the framework of the complex plane and leveraging HÃ¶lder continuity, we derive precise estimates concerning the distortion inherent in triangular ratios. Specifically, we demonstrate how these ratio metric bounds directly impact the regularity of mappings under quasiconformal conditions. The investigation centers on quantifying the loss of information associated with mapping transformations, crucial for understanding their geometric behavior.  These results provide a foundational contribution to the field, offering a refined understanding of mapping smoothness and offering potential improvements to existing regularity theorems.  Our findings were validated through simulations conducted in 2020.
