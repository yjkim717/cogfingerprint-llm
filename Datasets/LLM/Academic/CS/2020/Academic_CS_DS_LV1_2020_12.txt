**Abstract**

This paper introduces a framework for learning stable dynamical systems from high-dimensional data using deep neural networks. We address the critical challenge of ensuring global stability in learned models by proposing a method that jointly trains a dynamics model and a neural Lyapunov function. The Lyapunov network is constrained to be positive definite, with a negative semi-definite derivative along the learned dynamics, thereby providing formal non-linear stability guarantees. We validate our approach on the task of generating infinitely looping video textures, where stability is paramount to prevent visual degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces significantly more stable and visually coherent long-term sequences compared to baseline models lacking such guarantees, establishing a new paradigm for certifiable deep dynamic modeling.
