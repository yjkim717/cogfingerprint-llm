In contemporary machine learning paradigms, the relationship between memorization and generalization remains a central theoretical puzzle. This paper posits that memorization of training data—including statistically irrelevant information—is not merely an artifact of overparameterization but a fundamental prerequisite for achieving high predictive accuracy in complex, real-world tasks. Through rigorous empirical analysis spanning diverse model classes and algorithmic frameworks, we demonstrate that models incapable of memorizing subtle data correlations consistently underperform on natural prediction problems. We introduce a novel information-theoretic measure of task complexity, showing that as task irregularity increases, the minimal required memorization capacity grows correspondingly. These findings challenge prevailing regularization-centric approaches and suggest that optimal learning strategies must explicitly account for, rather than suppress, the memorization-generalization duality. Our results have significant implications for dataset curation, model architecture design, and theoretical understandings of learning in overparameterized regimes.
