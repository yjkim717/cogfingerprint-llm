Title: Towards Human-Centric Representations of Word Meaning: A Comparative Analysis of NLP Systems

Abstract:
The efficacy of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems is contingent upon their ability to accurately capture word meaning. However, current NLP models often rely on distributional semantics, which may not align with human similarity judgments. This paper presents a comparative analysis of human and machine representations of word meaning, highlighting the limitations of existing NLP systems. We argue that the conceptual basis of current NLP models is inadequate, as it diverges from human cognition. By examining the discrepancies between human similarity assessments and machine-generated representations, we demonstrate the need for a more human-like conceptual foundation in NLP. Our findings suggest that incorporating cognitive insights into NLP architectures can improve their performance and provide a more nuanced understanding of word meaning. This research contributes to the ongoing effort to develop more sophisticated and human-centric NLP systems.
