Title: Assessing COVID-19 Reporting Integrity through Zipf's Law: A Data-Driven Approach to Global Health Surveillance

Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical importance of accurate and reliable global health surveillance. As the international community grappled with the rapid spread of the virus in 2020, concerns emerged regarding the consistency and veracity of COVID-19 reporting across nations. This study leverages Zipf's law, a statistical principle governing the distribution of frequencies in large datasets, to evaluate the accuracy of international COVID-19 case reporting. By applying Zipf's law to COVID-19 epidemiological data from 2020, we identify countries exhibiting anomalous reporting patterns that deviate significantly from expected distributions. Our data forensic analysis reveals that certain nations display irregularities in their reported case numbers, potentially indicative of data reporting inaccuracies or inconsistencies. These findings have significant implications for global health surveillance and pandemic investigation, highlighting the need for enhanced scrutiny and verification of COVID-19 data. The application of Zipf's law offers a novel and robust methodology for detecting anomalies in COVID-19 reporting, enabling global health authorities to target further investigation and data validation efforts effectively. By improving the integrity of COVID-19 data, this research contributes to a more accurate understanding of the pandemic's global spread and informs evidence-based policy responses to mitigate its impact.
