**Abstract**

This paper addresses the computational challenge of optimal subsidy allocation under stochastic income shocks for poverty alleviation. We formulate a dynamic welfare model where heterogeneous households experience Markovian income fluctuations, and a social planner seeks to distribute a fixed budget across multiple time periods. The core contribution is a comparative algorithmic framework for two fundamental objective functions: the min-sum objective, which minimizes the aggregate poverty gap, and the min-max objective, which minimizes the maximum poverty gap experienced by any householdâ€”a Rawlsian criterion of distributive justice. We prove that the min-sum problem can be solved efficiently via a greedy algorithm that prioritizes households based on a dynamic marginal utility of subsidies. For the min-max objective, we design a polynomial-time algorithm based on iterative feasibility testing and residual budget reallocation. Our simulation results, calibrated with household survey data, demonstrate a significant trade-off: while the min-sum approach yields superior aggregate welfare, the min-max algorithm provides substantially better protection for the most vulnerable cohorts, reducing the risk of catastrophic welfare losses by up to 40% under severe negative income shocks.
