Title: On the Necessity of Memorization in High-Accuracy Learning: A Study of Information Complexity in Prediction Problems

Abstract:
The phenomenon of memorization in machine learning, where models memorize training data, has garnered significant attention in recent years. This paper investigates the necessity of memorization in achieving high-accuracy learning in specific prediction problems. We examine the relationship between information complexity and memorization, focusing on scenarios where training data contains irrelevant information. Our analysis reveals that, for certain prediction problems, memorization of irrelevant training data is indeed necessary to achieve optimal accuracy. We provide theoretical evidence and empirical validation to support this claim, demonstrating that models that fail to memorize irrelevant data may suffer from suboptimal performance. Our findings have implications for the design of machine learning models and training protocols, highlighting the importance of considering information complexity in the development of high-accuracy learning systems.
