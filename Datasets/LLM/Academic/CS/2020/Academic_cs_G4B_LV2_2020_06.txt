**Abstract**

This research examines the intricate relationship between competitive pressures, revenue diversification strategies, and risk-taking behavior within the banking sectors of the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) during 2015-2020. Utilizing a dynamic panel data framework and employing Generalized Method of Moments (2GMM) estimation, we assess the influence of heightened competition and broadened revenue streams on banksâ€™ propensity for risk-taking activities.  The analysis posits that increased market rivalry and a reliance on non-interest income sources may incentivize greater risk exposure.  Specifically, we hypothesize a positive correlation between competitive intensity and risk-adjusted performance metrics.  Conversely, diversification is predicted to mitigate this effect.  Preliminary findings suggest a nuanced interplay, with certain diversification strategies proving more effective in buffering against competitive pressures than others.  Further investigation is warranted to explore the specific operational mechanisms driving these observed relationships, contributing to a deeper understanding of financial stability within emerging market banking systems.
