Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided summary and keywords, written as if it were published around 2020. I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and appropriate terminology within the field of Computer Science.  Following the abstract, I'll include notes explaining my choices and reasoning.

**Abstract**

The proliferation of software development necessitates a heightened focus on code maintainability and comprehension. While code itself undergoes rigorous scrutiny, the quality of accompanying comments often receives inadequate attention. This paper investigates the impact of comment readability on developer performance, specifically examining the utility of automated readability assessment tools. We introduce a novel developer tool leveraging the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) and related linguistic metrics to evaluate and suggest improvements to software comments. An experimental evaluation, conducted with both novice Computer Science students and experienced software engineers in 2020, reveals a statistically significant improvement in code comprehension among students when comments are revised to achieve higher FRES scores.  Notably, the impact on experienced programmers was less pronounced, suggesting a saturation effect attributable to their pre-existing strong English language proficiency and familiarity with code structures. These findings highlight the potential of automated readability assessment as a valuable pedagogical tool for fostering good commenting practices in early-career developers. Further research is warranted to explore the integration of these tools within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and to investigate the applicability of more sophisticated natural language processing techniques for comment refinement beyond simple readability metrics, ultimately aiming to improve long-term software sustainability.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Tone & Vocabulary:** I used phrases like "necessitates a heightened focus," "investigates the impact," "statistically significant improvement," and "saturation effect" to establish a formal, academic tone.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a clear structure:
    *   **Context/Problem:**  Software maintainability and comment quality.
    *   **Contribution:** Introduction of a tool and its methodology (FRES & related metrics).
    *   **Methodology:** Briefly mentions an experimental evaluation.
    *   **Results:** Specific findings for student and experienced programmers.
    *   **Discussion/Future Work:** Implications and directions for future research.
*   **Precise Terminology:**  I included terms common in CS literature: "code maintainability," "code comprehension," "Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)," "natural language processing."
*   **Year Context (2020):**  The phrase "in 2020" was explicitly included to anchor the research within that timeframe. This is important for establishing the context of the study.
*   **Addressing the Summaryâ€™s Points:** The abstract directly reflects the summary's key findings: improved readability for students, less impact on experienced programmers, and the use of the Flesch Reading Ease Score.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for the ~234 word target.
*   **Focus on Contribution:** The abstract emphasizes the *tool* and its specific contribution to the field, rather than just stating the general problem.



I believe this abstract effectively captures the essence of the provided summary while adhering to the conventions of academic writing in Computer Science.
