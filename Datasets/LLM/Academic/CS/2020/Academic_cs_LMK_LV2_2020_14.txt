Title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Threat Assessment for Autonomous Driving: Mitigating Multiple Vehicle Collisions

Abstract:

The advent of autonomous driving has heightened the need for robust safety assurance mechanisms to prevent multiple vehicle collisions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel conceptual framework leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) for threat assessment in autonomous vehicles. The proposed framework employs a deep RL algorithm to learn optimal threat assessment policies, enabling autonomous vehicles to proactively assess and respond to potential collision risks. By modeling the interactions between the ego vehicle and its environment, the RL agent can anticipate and mitigate potential threats, thereby enhancing safety assurance. Our framework is designed to be adaptable to diverse driving scenarios, ensuring a robust and reliable threat assessment capability. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in reducing the risk of multiple vehicle collisions, underscoring its potential for real-world deployment in autonomous driving systems.
