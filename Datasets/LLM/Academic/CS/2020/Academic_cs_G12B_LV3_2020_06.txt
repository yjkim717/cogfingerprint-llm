**Abstract**

This study investigates the interplay between competitive pressures, revenue diversification strategies, and risk profiles within banking systems, leveraging dynamic panel data analysis of BRICS nations (2010-2019). Employing a two-step system generalized methods of moments (2GMM) estimation, we find a statistically significant positive correlation between market competition and bank risk-taking behavior. These findings align with portfolio investment theory and highlight potential algorithmic biases emergent from competitive pressures leading to increased risk exposure. Furthermore, the analysis supports the efficacy of revenue diversification as a mitigating factor. These results inform the design of fairness-aware risk models and regulatory frameworks crucial for maintaining financial stability in emerging markets.
