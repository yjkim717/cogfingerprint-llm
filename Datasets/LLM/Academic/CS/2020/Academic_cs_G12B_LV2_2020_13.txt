## Abstract: Disparity in Semantic Representation: A Comparative Analysis of Human and Machine Understanding of Word Meaning

This paper investigates the divergence between human and machine representations of word meaning within the context of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Utilizing a comparative methodology, we analyze how contemporary NLP systems, leveraging techniques in semantic representation and distributional semantics, model lexical relationships. While these systems demonstrably excel at capturing statistical co-occurrence patterns indicative of semantic similarity, our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation: a lack of grounding in the embodied experiences and motivational factors that underpin human understanding. We argue that current NLP models, despite achieving impressive performance on various language tasks, operate within a symbolic space divorced from the experiential basis of meaning construction, as informed by psychological theories of semantics. This disconnect highlights a critical challenge for the field, suggesting that future research must explore methods of incorporating embodied cognition and affective elements to achieve more human-like semantic understanding within NLP systems. This work contributes to the ongoing debate concerning the nature of meaning and its computational representation.
