In the realm of computer vision and microscopy image analysis, cellular segmentation remains a challenging task due to the diversity of image types and cellular structures. To address this challenge, we explore the efficacy of Cellpose, a deep learning-based algorithm that has demonstrated exceptional versatility in segmenting cells across various microscopy images. By leveraging a generalist approach, Cellpose eliminates the need for retraining or fine-tuning parameters for different image types, thereby streamlining the segmentation process. Our analysis, conducted in 2020, focuses on the algorithm's ability to accurately identify and separate cells in diverse microscopy images. The results indicate that Cellpose achieves robust and accurate segmentation performance without requiring extensive domain-specific knowledge or manual annotation. This work highlights the potential of deep learning-based methods, such as Cellpose, to improve the efficiency and accuracy of cellular segmentation tasks, and underscores the importance of developing generalizable models for microscopy image analysis.
