**Abstract**

Contemporary Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, despite advancements in machine learning, exhibit a fundamental limitation in capturing the nuanced meaning of words. This paper investigates the prevailing reliance of current models on statistical correlations within textual data, neglecting the crucial role of human cognition. We argue that this text-based grounding fails to adequately represent concepts, particularly those intrinsically linked to human desires, goals, and perceptual understanding – a core aspect of human representation.  Specifically, the study demonstrates how current NLP struggles with semantic ambiguity and contextual inference when divorced from experiential knowledge.  Consequently, we propose a framework integrating symbolic and connectionist approaches to develop more robust conceptual representations, moving beyond purely distributional semantics towards a model more aligned with human cognitive processes. Future research will explore the integration of multimodal data to enhance grounding.
