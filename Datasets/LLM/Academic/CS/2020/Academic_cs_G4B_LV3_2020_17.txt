**Abstract:**

The rapid dissemination of COVID-19 necessitated robust mechanisms for pandemic investigation and international data verification. This research investigates the application of Zipf’s Law – a statistical measure of rank-frequency distribution – to analyze inconsistencies within reported COVID-19 case data across international reporting systems. Utilizing a dataset of publicly available national case counts from 2020, we identified statistically significant deviations from Zipf’s Law, notably in data originating from China. These anomalies suggest potential biases or limitations in data collection and reporting practices.  We propose a preliminary computational framework, leveraging data forensics techniques, for automated anomaly detection and visualization. This framework aims to provide health regulatory bodies with an early warning system, facilitating more accurate epidemiological modeling and resource allocation. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset and refining the algorithmic sensitivity to improve the system’s predictive capabilities.
