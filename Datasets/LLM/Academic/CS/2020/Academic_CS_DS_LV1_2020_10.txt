This paper introduces a computational framework for analyzing geometric distortions in planar embeddings using the triangular ratio metric. We establish sharp bounds on its HÃ¶lder continuity in the unit disk and apply these to quantify stability guarantees for graph drawing algorithms under quasiconformal perturbations. Our results provide new tools for robustness analysis in network visualization.
