Title: Modeling the Impact of Gastric Emptying on Pharmacokinetics using Delay Differential Equations: A Computational Analysis of Losartan and EXP-3174 Disposition


#### Abstract

In 2020, advances in computational modeling have enabled researchers to better understand complex physiological processes and their impact on pharmacokinetics. This study presents a novel population pharmacokinetic model that leverages delay differential equations (DDEs) to investigate the effect of gastric emptying on the disposition of losartan and its active metabolite, EXP-3174. By incorporating a DDE framework, we account for the delayed absorption of losartan due to gastric emptying, allowing for a more accurate representation of the pharmacokinetic profile. Our model is developed using a non-linear mixed-effects approach, enabling the estimation of population parameters and inter-individual variability. The results demonstrate that the proposed DDE model effectively captures the delayed absorption of losartan and its subsequent conversion to EXP-3174. Simulations indicate that variations in gastric emptying rates significantly influence the peak concentrations and area under the curve (AUC) of both losartan and EXP-3174. The developed model provides a valuable tool for predicting the pharmacokinetic behavior of losartan and EXP-3174 in diverse patient populations, facilitating personalized medicine approaches. Furthermore, this computational framework can be extended to other orally administered medications, offering insights into the impact of gastrointestinal factors on drug absorption and disposition. By integrating DDEs into pharmacokinetic modeling, we can enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between physiological processes and drug pharmacokinetics, ultimately informing optimized therapeutic strategies.
