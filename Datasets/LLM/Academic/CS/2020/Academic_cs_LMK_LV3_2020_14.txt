Title: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Threat Assessment in Autonomous Driving: Mitigating Multiple Vehicle Collisions

Abstract:
As autonomous vehicles increasingly populate public roads, ensuring their safety is paramount. This paper proposes a novel reinforcement learning-based framework to assess threats and prevent multiple vehicle collisions. By leveraging real-time sensor data and predictive modeling, our framework dynamically evaluates collision risks and optimizes evasive maneuvers. Evaluated through simulated scenarios, our approach demonstrates significant reductions in collision likelihood. This work contributes to the development of robust safety assurance systems for autonomous driving, aligning with the 2020 advancements in AI-driven automotive safety.
