**Optimizing Forecaster Calibration via Binary Effort Scoring Rules**

Calibration, the alignment of probabilistic forecasts with observed frequencies, is crucial for reliable decision-making under uncertainty. This paper investigates the optimization of proper scoring rules for forecasters operating under resource constraints, specifically modeling effort allocation as a binary choice. We formulate the problem of maximizing expected payoff for a forecaster choosing between a high-effort, detailed probabilistic prediction and a low-effort, simplified forecast.  Employing a Bayesian framework, we analyze the interplay between a forecaster's prior belief, the resulting posterior belief, and the choice of scoring rule.  We derive algorithms for identifying approximately optimal scoring rules within this binary effort setting, demonstrating that the optimal rule often deviates significantly from standard continuous effort formulations.  Empirical evaluation, using simulated data across various prior distributions, reveals the effectiveness of our approach in promoting calibration while acknowledging effort limitations.  This work provides a novel perspective on forecaster behavior and contributes a practical methodology for designing scoring systems that incentivize accurate and efficient probabilistic predictions.
