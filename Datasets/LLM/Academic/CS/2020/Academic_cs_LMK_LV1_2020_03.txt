Abstract: 
We investigate the performance of static pricing schemes in revenue management settings, where a seller has a fixed supply of $k$ units. By leveraging prophet inequalities, we derive tight bounds on the efficiency of static pricing as a function of $k$. Specifically, we show that the revenue generated by static pricing is at least $\frac{1}{2} (1 + \frac{1}{k})$-competitive with respect to the optimal revenue management policy. Our results provide a nuanced understanding of the trade-offs between simplicity and optimality in revenue management, shedding light on the asymptotic optimality of static pricing as $k$ grows large.
