"Incentivizing accurate forecasting, this study optimizes proper scoring rules to maximize payoff gains for binary effort exerted by forecasters refining posterior beliefs from prior ones. By analyzing the interplay between scoring rules and mechanism design, we derive conditions for optimal scoring rules that balance forecaster incentives and prediction accuracy, with implications for decision-making under uncertainty in 2020 AI and forecasting applications."
