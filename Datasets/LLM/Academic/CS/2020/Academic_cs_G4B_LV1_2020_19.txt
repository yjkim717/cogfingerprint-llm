**Abstract**

The escalating threat of identity fraud necessitates robust and adaptable biometric authentication systems. This paper investigates the development of a novel multimodal biometric framework leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance security and mitigate limitations inherent in single-modality approaches.  Specifically, we introduce a system integrating both facial and fingerprint data, processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture trained for minutiae detection – a critical component for reliable feature extraction.  Our methodology prioritizes minimizing the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) while simultaneously reducing the False Rejection Rate (FRR).  We hypothesize that combining complementary biometric modalities, coupled with deep learning’s ability to learn complex feature representations, yields superior performance.  Experimental results, evaluated on a standardized dataset, demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in FAR compared to traditional biometric methods utilizing individual modalities.  Future work will explore adaptive weighting schemes for modality fusion and incorporate explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance system transparency and trustworthiness.
