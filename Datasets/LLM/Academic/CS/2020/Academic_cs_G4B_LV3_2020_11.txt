**Abstract**

Deep learning has revolutionized image segmentation, driving significant advancements in computer vision applications. This 2020 survey critically examines the evolving landscape of deep learning-based techniques, specifically focusing on both semantic and instance segmentation methodologies.  The review synthesizes recent architectural innovations, including variations of fully convolutional networks (FCNs), U-Nets, and their subsequent adaptations, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations.  Furthermore, the analysis incorporates a comparative evaluation of established datasets – such as Cityscapes and COCO – demonstrating the impact of data characteristics on model performance.  Crucially, the paper addresses the inherent distinctions between semantic segmentation, which assigns a single label to each pixel, and instance segmentation, which identifies and delineates individual objects.  Finally, the survey concludes with a detailed exploration of current challenges and proposes promising research directions, anticipating future developments in robust, efficient, and adaptable image segmentation systems.
