This paper presents Cellpose, a novel deep learning-based framework for cellular segmentation in microscopy images. By leveraging a generalist algorithm, Cellpose achieves robust and accurate segmentation across diverse image types without necessitating model retraining or fine-tuning of parameters. Our approach utilizes a comprehensive dataset and a carefully designed neural network architecture to learn a versatile representation of cellular structures. Evaluated on a range of microscopy images, Cellpose demonstrates superior performance and adaptability, underscoring its potential as a versatile tool for biomedical image analysis applications in 2020.
