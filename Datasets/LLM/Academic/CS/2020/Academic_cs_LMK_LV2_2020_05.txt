Title: Optimal Subsidy Allocation under Income Shocks: A Computational Welfare Approach

Abstract:
We present a novel welfare model that integrates income, wealth, and income shocks to address the pressing issue of poverty alleviation through optimal subsidy allocation. By formulating the problem algorithmically, we provide a computationally tractable solution to a complex socioeconomic challenge. Our model leverages advances in computational welfare economics to capture the dynamic interplay between income shocks and household welfare. Using a robust optimization framework, we derive an efficient subsidy allocation mechanism that mitigates the adverse effects of income shocks on vulnerable populations. Evaluated on simulated data reflecting 2020 economic conditions, our approach demonstrates significant improvements in welfare outcomes compared to traditional allocation methods. The proposed framework offers policymakers a data-driven tool for designing targeted interventions, thereby enhancing the efficacy of poverty alleviation programs. Our results underscore the potential of computational methods in informing social welfare policy.
