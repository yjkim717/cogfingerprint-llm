"In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of static pricing mechanisms in revenue management settings with multi-unit supply. By leveraging prophet inequalities, we derive a characterization of the revenue gap between static pricing schemes and optimal dynamic pricing strategies as a function of available supply. Our analysis reveals that, in the presence of sufficient supply, static pricing achieves a constant fraction of the optimal revenue. We establish tight bounds on this fraction, providing insights into the trade-offs between pricing simplicity and revenue maximization in 2020 revenue management contexts."
