This paper presents a novel polynomial-time algorithm for robustly estimating the parameters of k-component Gaussian mixture models under adversarial corruptions. Leveraging sum-of-squares programming and tensor decomposition techniques, our method achieves optimal error bounds while tolerating a constant fraction of corrupted samples. The algorithm establishes the first computationally efficient estimator with provable guarantees for this fundamental problem, bridging theoretical robustness and practical implementation. Our 2020 analysis demonstrates significant improvements over prior methods in both computational complexity and corruption tolerance, with applications spanning statistical learning and data analysis.
