**Abstract**

The advent of deep learning has precipitated a paradigm shift in image segmentation, transitioning from handcrafted feature engineering to end-to-end learned representations. This paper provides a systematic review of contemporary deep learning architectures for semantic and instance segmentation as of 2020. We critically analyze the dominant encoder-decoder framework, wherein pre-trained convolutional networks extract hierarchical features that are subsequently refined by decoders to produce pixel-accurate masks. The survey further examines specialized mechanisms, such as atrous spatial pyramid pooling and attention modules, which enhance multi-scale contextual integration. We benchmark leading models on established datasets (e.g., PASCAL VOC, MS COCO), highlighting performance trade-offs in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency, and boundary delineation. Finally, we identify salient research challenges, including the annotation bottleneck, real-time processing for video, and the nascent field of panoptic segmentation, proposing directions for future investigation to bridge the gap between human and machine perception.
