“This study investigates the efficiency of static pricing strategies within multi-unit revenue management systems. Leveraging the framework of prophet inequalities, we demonstrate that optimal pricing exhibits a non-linear relationship with sales volume and customer utility.  Our analysis identifies a critical ‘sweet spot’ – a static price point – that maximizes overall system efficiency, exceeding the performance of purely elastic or fixed pricing models.  The findings suggest that carefully calibrated static pricing, informed by these inequalities, represents a viable approach for optimizing resource allocation and consumer satisfaction in environments characterized by limited dynamic adjustments.”
