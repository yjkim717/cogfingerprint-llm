This paper introduces a novel framework for learning stable deep dynamical systems through joint optimization of system dynamics and corresponding Lyapunov functions. We address the critical challenge of ensuring stability in learned nonlinear systems by formulating an end-to-end learning approach that simultaneously trains neural network representations of both the system dynamics and stability certificates. Our method enforces Lyapunov stability constraints during training, guaranteeing global asymptotic stability of the learned dynamics without restricting model expressivity. Experimental validation across multiple benchmark systems demonstrates that our approach achieves competitive predictive accuracy while providing formal stability guarantees, addressing a fundamental limitation in existing deep learning methods for dynamical systems modeling. The proposed framework enables reliable deployment of learned dynamics models in safety-critical applications.
