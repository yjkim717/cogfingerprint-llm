"In this study, we investigate the efficacy of static pricing schemes in revenue management under multi-unit sales, leveraging prophet inequalities to derive optimal static pricing strategies for varying supply levels (k). By analyzing the approximation algorithms employed, we establish a characterization of the efficiency of static pricing as a function of supply. Our results demonstrate that, for every value of k, an optimal static pricing scheme can be identified, thereby informing revenue management practices. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on pricing strategies in revenue management, providing insights into the nuanced relationship between supply and pricing efficiency."
