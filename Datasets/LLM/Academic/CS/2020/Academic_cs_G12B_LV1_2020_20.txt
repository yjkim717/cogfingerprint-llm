**Cellpose: A Generalist Deep Learning Framework for Robust Cellular Segmentation Across Diverse Microscopy Modalities**

Accurate and automated cellular segmentation remains a critical challenge in biological image analysis, often requiring laborious manual annotation or specialized algorithms tailored to specific imaging conditions. Traditional methods frequently struggle with variations in cell morphology, image contrast, and acquisition parameters across different microscopy techniques. This paper introduces Cellpose, a novel deep learning framework designed to address these limitations by providing a generalist solution for cellular segmentation without the need for retraining or extensive parameter optimization.  Cellpose employs a custom-designed convolutional neural network architecture based on a U-Net structure, trained on a large and diverse dataset of fluorescent microscopy images.  A key innovation is the use of distance transforms and contour detection as primary loss functions, promoting accurate boundary delineation and robust performance across varying cell sizes and shapes (Smith et al., 2019).  Experimental results on a variety of image datasets, including confocal, widefield, and two-photon microscopy data, demonstrate that Cellpose significantly outperforms existing methods (e.g., StarDist, Deep Watershed) in terms of segmentation accuracy (measured by Dice coefficient and Average Symmetric Surface Distance) and computational efficiency (Jones & Brown, 2018).  Furthermore, Cellpose exhibits remarkable adaptability to novel imaging modalities with minimal user intervention, representing a significant step toward automated and scalable biological image analysis pipelines.  Future work will focus on extending Cellposeâ€™s capabilities to 3D segmentation and incorporating uncertainty estimation for improved robustness.
