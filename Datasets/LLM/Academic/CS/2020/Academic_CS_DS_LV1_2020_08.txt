This paper introduces a novel semidefinite programming framework for globally optimal rotation averaging, a cornerstone problem in large-scale 3D reconstruction. While existing manifold optimization methods offer scalability, they often converge to suboptimal local minima. Our approach leverages a tight semidefinite relaxation to directly recover certifiably global solutions, bridging the gap between computational efficiency and optimality guarantees. Theoretical analysis confirms exact recovery under moderate noise regimes. Empirical evaluation on real-world structure-from-motion datasets demonstrates that our method achieves superior accuracy without sacrificing the scalability of leading iterative solvers, enabling more reliable 3D vision pipelines.
