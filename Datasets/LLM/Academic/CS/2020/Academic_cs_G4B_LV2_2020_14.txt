**Abstract**

The increasing deployment of autonomous vehicles necessitates robust threat assessment capabilities to mitigate the risk of collisions. This paper introduces a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework designed to proactively identify and predict multiple vehicle collisions within complex traffic scenarios. Utilizing a multi-agent RL approach, our system learns to evaluate potential hazards by considering the actions and trajectories of surrounding vehicles. Specifically, the architecture incorporates a threat assessment module employing a state-space representation informed by sensor data and predicted vehicle behavior.  This module then guides an RL policy optimizing for collision avoidance.  Evaluations, conducted through simulation, demonstrate the framework’s efficacy in anticipating scenarios leading to rear-end collisions and, crucially, predicting the likelihood of cascading multiple vehicle collisions – a critical safety concern currently lacking comprehensive solutions.  Future work will focus on integrating this framework with real-time perception systems and expanding the scope to encompass diverse environmental conditions.
