This paper presents a novel approach to learning stable deep dynamics models by leveraging Lyapunov functions. We propose a framework that integrates the principles of Lyapunov stability theory with deep generative models, ensuring the learned dynamics models are inherently stable. By parameterizing the Lyapunov function using a neural network, we enable the learning of complex, nonlinear systems while guaranteeing stability. Our method is validated on various dynamical systems, demonstrating its efficacy in capturing accurate and stable dynamics. The proposed approach has significant implications for modeling and controlling complex systems in various fields.
