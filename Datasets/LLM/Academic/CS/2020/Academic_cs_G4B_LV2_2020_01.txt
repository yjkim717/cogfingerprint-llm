**Abstract**

Image-to-image translation tasks frequently necessitate paired training data, a constraint often circumvented by the scarcity of such resources. This paper presents a novel contrastive learning framework designed to address unpaired image-to-image translation challenges. Our approach leverages a patch-based representation, enabling effective similarity assessment between corresponding image regions irrespective of paired training instances.  We hypothesize that maximizing mutual information between these patch representations will drive the network to learn robust and transferable transformations.  Specifically, we employ a contrastive loss function that encourages patches from the source and target domains to cluster together in a learned embedding space, while pushing dissimilar patches apart. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this method, exhibiting improved performance compared to existing unpaired translation techniques, particularly in scenarios demanding high fidelity and stylistic preservation.  Future work will explore adaptive patch selection strategies and incorporate attention mechanisms.
