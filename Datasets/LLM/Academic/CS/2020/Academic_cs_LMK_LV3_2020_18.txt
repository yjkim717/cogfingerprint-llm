Title: Modeling Gastrointestinal Motility using Delay Differential Equations: A Simulation Study on Pharmacokinetic Variability

Abstract:
The absorption rate of orally administered medications is significantly influenced by gastric emptying, a complex physiological process characterized by irregular motility patterns. To quantify the impact of such variability on the pharmacokinetics of losartan and its active metabolite EXP-3174, we developed a delay differential equation (DDE) model that simulates the delayed absorption of the drug due to gastric emptying. Our model integrates a population pharmacokinetic framework to account for inter-individual variability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDE model accurately captures the pharmacokinetic profiles of losartan and EXP-3174 under varying gastric emptying rates. The modeling approach presented herein provides a robust framework for predicting pharmacokinetic variability, enabling the optimization of dosage regimens for improved therapeutic efficacy. This study highlights the utility of DDE models in simulating complex physiological processes, underscoring their potential in pharmaceutical research and development.
