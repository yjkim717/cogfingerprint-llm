"In this work, we present a novel rotation averaging framework leveraging semidefinite relaxation and manifold minimization, achieving global optimality in structure-from-motion applications. By reformulating the rotation averaging problem on the manifold of rotation matrices, our approach, dubbed Shonan Rotation Averaging, ensures fast convergence and robustness to initialization. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in 2020."
