**Abstract: Anomaly Detection in COVID-19 Case Reporting via Zipf’s Law Analysis**

The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic was critically dependent on accurate and timely epidemiological data. However, concerns regarding reporting inconsistencies across nations quickly emerged. This paper investigates the applicability of Zipf's law – a well-established power-law relationship observed in numerous natural phenomena – as a novel data forensic tool for assessing the reliability of international COVID-19 case reporting. We hypothesize that deviations from expected Zipfian distributions in daily new case counts across countries may indicate data anomalies stemming from inconsistent reporting practices, deliberate manipulation, or systematic biases.

We apply Zipf’s law to a longitudinal dataset of daily new COVID-19 cases reported by national authorities worldwide from January 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020. Our analysis focuses on characterizing the rank-frequency relationship and quantifying the goodness-of-fit using metrics such as the R-squared value and Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance.  Significant deviations from the expected power-law behavior are identified and classified based on their magnitude and temporal patterns.  We propose a computational framework for automatically detecting these anomalies, offering a potential early warning system for identifying nations whose reported data warrants further scrutiny.

Preliminary results suggest that a subset of countries exhibit systematic deviations from the expected Zipfian distribution, particularly during periods of rapid case growth or policy changes.  We discuss the limitations of this approach, including the potential influence of testing rates and population size, and propose avenues for future research, such as incorporating mobility data and accounting for heterogeneous reporting standards. The findings highlight the utility of leveraging established statistical frameworks like Zipf's law for data quality assessment in the context of rapidly evolving public health crises, providing a computationally efficient and scalable method for identifying potential reporting inaccuracies and bolstering trust in global epidemiological datasets.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Language:** I used precise vocabulary common in CS research (e.g., "longitudinal dataset," "goodness-of-fit," "Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance," "computational framework," "heterogeneous").
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: Introduction (problem statement), Hypothesis, Methodology, Results (preliminary), Discussion/Limitations, Future Work.
*   **2020 Context:** The timeframe is explicitly stated.  The language reflects the urgency and concerns prevalent in 2020 regarding COVID-19 data.
*   **CS Focus:** I emphasized the computational aspects – the framework, automated detection, scalability. This aligns with a CS audience.
*   **Data Forensic Angle:** The abstract leans into the "data forensic" idea by framing the analysis as a method for uncovering anomalies and inconsistencies.
*   **Limitations Acknowledged:**  Addressing limitations is crucial for academic rigor. I included testing rates and reporting standards.
*   **Power-Law Emphasis:** Clearly stated the core concept of power-
