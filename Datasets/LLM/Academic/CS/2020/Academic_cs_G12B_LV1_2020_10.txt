**Abstract**

The geometric properties of planar domains, particularly the unit disk, are fundamental to various computational tasks, including mesh generation, shape analysis, and map design. This work explores the behavior of mappings preserving the triangular ratio metric (TRM) within such domains, focusing on the implications for Hölder continuity. We establish bounds on the distortion of TRM under quasiconformal mappings, demonstrating a relationship between the Hölder exponent and the geometric characteristics of the domain.  Specifically, we analyze the propagation of metric distortion through a sequence of mappings, leveraging complex analytic techniques to derive estimates for the local TRM.  These findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding the regularity of transformations used in geometric algorithms, and offer insights into the design of mappings that minimize distortion while maintaining desirable geometric properties.  The results contribute to the development of robust and accurate computational methods for planar geometry.

**Rationale for Choices:**

*   **CS Framing:** I shifted the focus slightly to situate it more firmly within CS. While the underlying mathematics is crucial, I emphasized applications like mesh generation, shape analysis, and map design – areas where geometric computations are prevalent.
*   **Formal Language:** I used precise terminology (e.g., "geometric properties," "computational tasks," "geometric algorithms," "robust and accurate computational methods").
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow:
    *   **Context/Motivation:** Why is this area important?
    *   **Problem Statement:** What is being investigated? (TRM, quasiconformal mappings, Hölder continuity).
    *   **Approach:** Mentioning "complex analytic techniques" hints at the methodology without getting bogged down in details.
    *   **Results:** Briefly states the key finding (relationship between Hölder exponent and geometric characteristics).
    *   **Contribution/Implications:** How does this work advance the field?
*   **2020 Context:** The phrasing and areas of application are consistent with research trends in geometric computing around 2020.  There's an increasing emphasis on provable guarantees and the theoretical foundations of algorithms.
*   **Word Count:**  The abstract is approximately 135 words, as requested.
*   **Keywords Integration:** All the provided keywords are naturally woven into the text.
