**Title:** Modeling the Temporal Decay of Adversarial Robustness in Deep Neural Networks Post-Training

**Keywords:** Adversarial Robustness, Model Degradation, Dynamic Threat Landscapes, Continuous Validation, Machine Learning Security

**Abstract:**

The deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs) in security-critical applications necessitates an understanding of their long-term adversarial robustness. While initial robustness, achieved through adversarial training, is well-studied, its persistence over time remains underexplored. This paper investigates the temporal dynamics of adversarial robustness in image classification models following their initial training and hardening phase. We empirically demonstrate that a model's robustness to evasion attacks exhibits a quantifiable decay over a six-month operational period, analogous to the waning of humoral immunity in biological systems. We simulate a dynamic threat landscape by continuously generating new adversarial examples from a non-stationary data stream, reflecting evolving attacker capabilities. Our findings reveal that while a baseline of robustness persists, its efficacy diminishes significantly, with a more pronounced decay observed in larger, more complex architectures (e.g., ResNet-152) compared to smaller models (e.g., ResNet-50). This "complexity-robustness decay" correlation suggests that over-parameterized models may overfit to the specific adversarial perturbations present during their training phase. We frame this as a critical systems security problem, where a static defense becomes increasingly inadequate against a dynamic adversary. Consequently, we argue for a paradigm shift from static model deployment to a continuous validation and "booster shot" retraining regimen, where models are periodically exposed to novel adversarial samples to maintain a high level of operational security. This work establishes a foundational framework for quantifying and mitigating robustness decay in machine learning systems.
