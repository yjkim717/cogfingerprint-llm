**Abstract**

The deployment of safe and robust autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dense, dynamic environments necessitates advanced collision avoidance systems. While traditional planning methods struggle with uncertainty and multi-agent interactions, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising data-driven alternative. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), for the critical task of decentralized multi-vehicle collision avoidance. We formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where each agent, equipped with limited sensor data, must navigate to a goal while avoiding collisions. Our simulation framework models complex traffic scenarios with interactive agents. The PPO algorithm, an on-policy method, is evaluated against the off-policy SAC algorithm, which incorporates an entropy maximization term for improved exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that both algorithms can achieve a high success rate of approximately 91% in preventing collisions across a range of test scenarios. However, analysis reveals a distinct performance trade-off: PPO exhibits higher sample efficiency during training, whereas SAC achieves more stable and robust final policies with superior asymptotic performance in edge cases. These findings, from a 2021 perspective, highlight that the choice between PPO and SAC involves a critical engineering trade-off between training time and policy robustness for real-world AV deployment.
