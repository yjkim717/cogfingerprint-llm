**Abstract**

This paper investigates the computational challenges inherent in approximating optimal policies for the Pandora's Box problem when dealing with correlated input distributions. We demonstrate a surprising and significant connection between this problem and the approximation complexities of Uniform Decision Tree construction and the Min-Sum Set Cover problem. Specifically, we establish a theoretical equivalence, revealing that achieving improved approximation guarantees for Pandora’s Box necessitates advancements in these related areas. Our primary contribution is the development of a constant-factor approximation algorithm tailored to a specific class of mixture distributions. The algorithm achieves a time complexity of $n^{  ilde O( m^2/\varepsilon^2 )}$, where *n* represents the problem size, *m* denotes the number of boxes, and ε signifies the approximation error. This result underscores the intricate relationship between distribution correlation and algorithmic tractability, offering valuable insights for the design of efficient algorithms in stochastic decision-making scenarios and highlighting the potential for cross-fertilization of techniques across these established combinatorial optimization problems.
