**Abstract**

Accurate bacterial cell segmentation remains a critical challenge in various biomedical imaging applications, hampered by inherent morphological variability within bacterial populations.  Traditional methods frequently exhibit sensitivity to subtle changes in cell shape and size, necessitating reliance on handcrafted features and leading to inconsistent performance. This paper introduces Omnipose, a deep neural network architecture specifically designed to enhance bacterial cell segmentation accuracy.  Omnipose leverages a gradient of distance field (GDF) representation, providing a morphology-independent approach to delineating cell boundaries.  Unlike prior deep learning techniques, Omnipose mitigates the limitations of feature engineering by directly learning robust segmentation maps from image data.  Experiments demonstrate that Omnipose substantially outperforms existing methods across diverse bacterial strains and imaging modalities.  The algorithmâ€™s capacity to generalize beyond specific morphological characteristics represents a significant advancement, suggesting its potential for broad application in automated bacterial analysis workflows, including microbiome research and diagnostic imaging. Further investigation into its adaptability to multi-channel data is warranted.
