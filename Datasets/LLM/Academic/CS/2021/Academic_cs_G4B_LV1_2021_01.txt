**Abstract**

Recent advances in generative modeling have demonstrated the capacity to produce visually compelling scenes. However, effectively translating human pose information into coherent and contextually appropriate visual representations remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel framework, termed Pose-Conditioned Scene Generation (PCSG), designed to address this limitation. PCSG leverages a generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture, specifically a modified StyleGAN2, conditioned on input human poses.  A critical component of our approach is the construction of a comprehensive meta-dataset comprising diverse human poses and corresponding realistic scene layouts.  We detail a rigorous training procedure emphasizing pose conditioning to encourage spatial consistency and semantic plausibility within generated scenes. Preliminary results demonstrate a substantial improvement in scene coherence and diversity compared to existing pose hallucination techniques.  Future work will explore incorporating explicit semantic constraints and evaluating PCSG across a wider range of pose variations and scene complexities.
