Title: Enhancing Low-Level Vision Tasks with Copy-Blend Data Augmentation: A Perceptual Quality Analysis

Abstract:
Data augmentation is a crucial technique for enhancing the performance of deep learning models in low-level vision tasks. This study investigates the efficacy of copy-blend data augmentation, a region modification technique, in improving the perceptual quality of images for tasks such as denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring. We demonstrate that copy-blend augmentation consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art models, leading to faster convergence and enhanced image fidelity. Our analysis reveals that the strategic manipulation of image regions through copy-blend augmentation enhances the model's ability to capture subtle visual cues, resulting in improved perceptual quality. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that models trained with copy-blend augmentation outperform their counterparts trained without it, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 2021. The findings of this study highlight the potential of copy-blend data augmentation as a valuable tool for improving the performance of low-level vision models.
