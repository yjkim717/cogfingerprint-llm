This paper presents novel theoretical contributions to the analysis of metric distortion under conformal and quasiregular mappings in computational geometry. We establish improved quantitative bounds for how these mappings transform intrinsic metrics, with particular focus on hyperbolic distance preservation. Our central result develops strengthened versions of the classical Schwarz lemma that provide sharper distortion estimates for quasiregular mappings between Riemann surfaces. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, we demonstrate that our inequalities are tight under specific geometric constraints and offer significant improvement over existing results in the literature. These findings have immediate applications in geometric function theory and potential implications for surface registration algorithms in computer graphics. The work bridges fundamental complex analysis with practical computational geometry problems, offering new tools for quantifying geometric distortion in manifold processing applications.
