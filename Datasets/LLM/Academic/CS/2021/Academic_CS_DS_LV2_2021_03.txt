In this work, we establish a unified computational framework by demonstrating approximation-preserving equivalences among three fundamental stochastic optimization problems: Pandora’s Box with correlated distributions, the Uniform Decision Tree (UDT) problem, and Min-Sum Set Cover (MSSC). We prove that these problems are polynomial-time interreducible, such that an α-approximation algorithm for any one of them yields an α-approximation for the others. This equivalence reveals a deep structural connection between adaptive information acquisition in stochastic settings and combinatorial search paradigms. Our reductions preserve approximation ratios up to constant factors, thereby transferring the state-of-the-art O(log n)-approximation guarantees for MSSC directly to the correlated Pandora’s Box and UDT problems. These results, situated in the 2021 landscape of approximation algorithms, resolve open questions regarding the approximability of these models and provide a consolidated toolkit for designing efficient adaptive strategies under uncertainty.
