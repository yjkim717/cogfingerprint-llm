**Abstract**

A central challenge in algorithmic mechanism design is the implementation of exactly incentive-compatible mechanisms in computationally tractable ways, particularly within the Bayesian setting. Traditional approaches often rely on approximations or make strong equilibrium assumptions, which can compromise strategic robustness. This paper introduces a novel black-box reduction that leverages the theory of Bernoulli factories to achieve exact Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC) in polynomial time. Our method transforms a possibly non-truthful algorithm into a BIC mechanism without significantly degrading its approximation ratio or computational efficiency. The key technical innovation lies in using Bernoulli factories to simulate the precise fractional probabilities required for exact incentive constraints, thereby circumventing the prohibitive sampling complexity that typically plagues such reductions. We demonstrate the generality of our framework by applying it to several canonical problem domains, including single-parameter and certain multi-parameter settings. This work establishes a new connection between probabilistic pro-cesses and mechanism design, resolving a significant barrier in the quest for computationally feasible and strategically robust algorithms.
