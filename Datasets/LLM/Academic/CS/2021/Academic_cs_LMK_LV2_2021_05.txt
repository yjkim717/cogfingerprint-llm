Title: Rethinking Algorithmic Fairness: A Causal Inference Approach to Addressing Inequality and Power Imbalance

Abstract:
Traditional fairness notions in algorithmic decision-making have been criticized for oversimplifying the complexities of social inequality. In response, this paper proposes a novel framework that reexamines algorithmic fairness through the lens of causal inference, focusing on the structural drivers of inequality and power distribution. By analyzing the causal relationships between algorithmic decisions, social outcomes, and existing power dynamics, we reveal the limitations of prevailing fairness metrics and propose alternative perspectives that prioritize the mitigation of inequality. Our approach recognizes that fairness is not solely a matter of individual treatment, but also involves addressing the systemic inequalities perpetuated by algorithmic decision-making. Through a causal inference lens, we demonstrate how algorithmic fairness can be reimagined to promote more equitable power distributions, ultimately contributing to a more just and equitable society.
