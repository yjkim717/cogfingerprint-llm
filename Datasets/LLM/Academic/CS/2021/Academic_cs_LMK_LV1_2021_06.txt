Title: Assessing the Interplay between Competition, Scale, and Macroeconomic Factors on the Technical Efficiency of BRICS Banking Sectors: A Stochastic Frontier Analysis

Abstract:
This study investigates the determinants of technical efficiency in the banking sectors of BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) over the period 2000-2015. Employing a stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) approach, we examine the impact of competition, bank size, and macroeconomic development indicators on the efficiency of BRICS banks. Our results indicate that the level of competition, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), has a significant positive effect on bank efficiency. Furthermore, we find that larger banks tend to be more efficient, suggesting the presence of scale economies. Additionally, our analysis reveals that macroeconomic development indicators, such as GDP per capita and inflation rate, exert a significant influence on bank efficiency. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers and regulators seeking to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the BRICS banking sectors in the post-2021 global financial landscape.
