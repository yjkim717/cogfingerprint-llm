**Abstract**

This paper presents a novel generative scene synthesis framework predicated on conditional human pose input, addressing a critical gap in realistic scene generation for human-computer interaction (HCI) applications. Utilizing a StyleGAN2 architecture, we introduce a method for producing photorealistic scenes directly conditioned on skeletal pose data. A key contribution is the construction and utilization of a large-scale dataset comprising over 19 million frames, meticulously curated to ensure pose compatibility and stylistic diversity. Our approach facilitates the generation of scenes where human figures are seamlessly integrated and realistically interact with the environment. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating plausible and visually compelling scenes, with potential applications spanning pose visualization, automated animation, and interactive virtual environments. This work advances the state-of-the-art in generative adversarial networks for scene understanding and synthesis.
