**Abstract**

Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have witnessed a notable trend toward paradigm shifts in task formulation. Traditional, rigidly defined classification approaches are increasingly being supplanted by methodologies leveraging the expressive power of deep learning, particularly within the context of sequence labeling. This work investigates the burgeoning influence of pre-trained language models (PLMs) – such as BERT and its variants – as foundational components in these evolving architectures. We argue that the ability of PLMs to capture contextualized semantic representations significantly enhances performance across a range of sequence labeling tasks, including named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging.  Furthermore, we explore the integration of these models within a classification paradigm, demonstrating improved robustness and generalization capabilities. Future research will focus on optimizing fine-tuning strategies and adapting PLMs to specialized domains, ultimately pushing the boundaries of NLP performance.
