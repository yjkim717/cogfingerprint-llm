**Abstract**

This 2021 computational study investigates the determinants of operational efficiency within the banking sectors of BRICS nations, employing a data-driven methodology. We conceptualize the banking system as a complex network of interacting financial agents and model bank efficiency using non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). To address endogeneity concerns and infer causal dynamics, we utilize a dynamic panel estimator, specifically the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). Our empirical results, derived from a longitudinal dataset spanning 2010-2020, indicate that heightened market competition and increased bank size are statistically significant drivers of enhanced efficiency, likely due to economies of scale and innovation incentives. Conversely, macroeconomic indicators such as national inflation rates demonstrate no significant predictive power, while the level of economic development yields an ambiguous, non-linear relationship. These findings underscore the primacy of structural market factors over broad macroeconomic conditions in optimizing the performance of financial institutions within emerging economies.
