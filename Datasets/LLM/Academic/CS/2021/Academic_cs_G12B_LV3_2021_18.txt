**Abstract:**

The rapid deployment of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 necessitated a thorough understanding of the resultant humoral immune response. This prospective study, conducted on a cohort of 308 healthy individuals throughout a six-month period post-vaccination in 2021, quantitatively characterized the kinetics of neutralizing antibodies. Our findings demonstrate a gradual decline in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers, indicative of waning immunity, with an accelerated reduction observed in older age groups. These longitudinal data provide a valuable dataset for developing computational models of vaccine efficacy and immune persistence. Specifically, the observed age-related decline highlights the potential need for adaptive vaccination strategies and informs the development of machine learning algorithms designed to predict individual immune trajectories and optimize booster deployment schedules, contributing to improved pandemic response modeling.
