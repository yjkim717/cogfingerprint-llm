This paper presents a comparative analysis of fuzzy logic and optimal control methodologies for stabilizing underactuated mechanical systems. We investigate a double inverted pendulum configuration as a benchmark problem exhibiting complex nonlinear dynamics and inherent instability. Our 2021 study implements both a fuzzy inference system with adaptive rule bases and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with optimized weighting matrices. Experimental results demonstrate that the fuzzy controller achieves superior disturbance rejection capabilities, maintaining stability under parametric variations where the LQR approach shows performance degradation. The fuzzy system reduces angular displacement overshoot by approximately 32% while improving settling time by 41% compared to the optimal controller. These findings suggest that model-free control strategies offer significant advantages for high-dimensional nonlinear systems where accurate system identification remains challenging. This research contributes to robust control theory by quantifying performance trade-offs between computational intelligence and classical control paradigms.
