**Abstract**

We present a novel computational framework for Bayesian mechanism design that achieves exact Bayesian incentive compatibility (BIC) in multi-dimensional continuous type spaces. Our approach establishes a polynomial-time black-box reduction from BIC mechanism design to standard algorithm design for welfare maximization. The central technical innovation is the application of *Bernoulli factories*—a class of algorithms that simulates new Bernoulli random variables from existing ones—to the problem of precisely correcting the interim allocation rule of an arbitrary algorithm. By treating the algorithm as a black-box sampler, we construct a transformed rule where truth-telling becomes a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, eliminating the approximation errors inherent in prior sampling-based methods. This reduction holds for general continuous distributions and requires only oracle access to the original algorithm's allocation probabilities for a given type report. Consequently, it enables the design of exactly BIC mechanisms for complex settings by leveraging advances in algorithmic optimization, without sacrificing strategic rigor. This work bridges a significant gap between computational tractability and exact economic incentive guarantees.
