Abstract: 
Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have catalyzed a paradigm shift towards unified deep learning frameworks. Leveraging pre-trained language models, task unification has emerged as a pivotal strategy, enhancing model generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. As of 2021, this trend has garnered significant attention, with researchers exploring the potential of unified paradigms to improve performance and reduce task-specific architectural complexity. This review synthesizes key findings, highlighting the impact of task unification on NLP model efficacy and future research directions.
