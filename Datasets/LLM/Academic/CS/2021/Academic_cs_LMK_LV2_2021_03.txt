Title: Approximation-Preserving Equivalence between Pandora's Box and Uniform Decision Tree under Correlated Distributions

Abstract:
We establish a novel approximation-preserving equivalence between the Pandora's Box problem and the Uniform Decision Tree problem, under the assumption of correlated distributions. Our result bridges two fundamental stochastic optimization problems, demonstrating that the optimal solution to one problem can be efficiently translated into a near-optimal solution for the other. Leveraging this equivalence, we derive new insights into the Min-Sum Set Cover problem, a closely related optimization challenge. By exploiting the correlated structure of the distributions, our reduction preserves approximation guarantees, enabling the transfer of algorithmic advances between these problems. This equivalence has significant implications for the development of efficient algorithms in stochastic optimization, and our findings contribute to the growing body of research on decision-theoretic models under uncertainty. Our results are grounded in a rigorous analysis, ensuring the validity of the proposed equivalence.
