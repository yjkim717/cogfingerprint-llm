**Abstract**

The landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone a pronounced transformation in 2021, largely propelled by the emergence and refinement of pre-trained language models (PLMs). This shift represents more than a simple algorithmic improvement; it constitutes a fundamental paradigm shift away from conventional sequence labeling and classification methodologies.  Traditional NLP pipelines, reliant on feature engineering and task-specific architectures, are increasingly being supplanted by approaches centered on task reformulation leveraging the contextual understanding inherent within these PLMs.  Specifically, techniques such as prompt engineering and few-shot learning demonstrate the capacity to adapt PLMs to a diverse range of downstream tasks with minimal task-specific training.  Further research necessitates a deeper investigation into the interpretability and potential biases embedded within these models, alongside the development of robust methodologies for effectively employing task reformulation within complex NLP applications.
