This paper presents a novel application of association rule mining to counterterrorism forensics through analysis of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). We implement the Apriori algorithm to systematically extract frequent patterns from terrorist incident data in Nigeria spanning 2010-2020. Our methodology addresses critical gaps in conventional forensic approaches by enabling automated discovery of latent relationships between attack modalities, temporal sequences, and geographic distributions. The algorithm identifies significant association rules with minimum support of 0.05 and confidence threshold of 0.7, revealing previously undocumented correlations between weapon types, target selections, and perpetrator groups. Results demonstrate that iterative pattern refinement through Apriori's anti-monotonic property effectively isolates forensically significant attack signatures with 89% precision in retrospective validation. This computational framework establishes a reproducible methodology for transforming unstructured terrorism data into actionable intelligence, providing law enforcement agencies with predictive capabilities for anticipating attack vectors and allocating investigative resources.
