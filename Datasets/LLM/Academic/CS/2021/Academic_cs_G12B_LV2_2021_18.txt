**Abstract: Longitudinal Analysis of Waning Neutralizing Antibody Responses Following BNT162b2 Vaccination: Implications for Humoral Immunity Modeling**

**Background:** The rapid development and deployment of mRNA vaccines, such as BNT162b2, represented a critical intervention in mitigating the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. While initial efficacy demonstrated robust protection, concerns regarding waning humoral immunity have emerged. Understanding the temporal dynamics of neutralizing antibody responses post-vaccination is essential for informing booster strategies and refining predictive models of vaccine-induced immunity. This study examines the longitudinal trajectory of neutralizing antibody titers six months following BNT162b2 vaccination, with a particular focus on identifying age-related variations.

**Methods:** We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of vaccinated individuals, evaluating neutralizing antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 at baseline (post-vaccination) and at six-month follow-up. Antibody titers were quantified using [Specify Assay – e.g., microneutralization assay]. Statistical analyses, including mixed-effects models, were employed to assess the decline in neutralizing antibody responses over time and to identify significant age-dependent effects.  Furthermore, we explored the potential for applying machine learning techniques, specifically time-series analysis and recurrent neural networks, to model the observed waning trends and predict future antibody levels based on age and initial titer.  Data preprocessing included normalization and outlier detection to ensure model robustness.

**Results:** Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant decline in neutralizing antibody titers six months post-BNT162b2 vaccination.  Age-related heterogeneity was observed, with older individuals exhibiting a more pronounced reduction in antibody levels compared to younger cohorts (p < 0.05). Preliminary modeling efforts suggest that incorporating age as a key feature improves the accuracy of predictive models for waning antibody responses.

**Conclusion:** This study provides empirical evidence of waning neutralizing antibody responses following BNT162b2 vaccination and highlights the importance of age as a modulating factor. The observed trends underscore the need for continued surveillance and potential booster vaccination programs.  Future work will focus on refining computational models to better capture the complex dynamics of humoral immunity and inform personalized vaccination strategies.
