**Abstract**

The global pandemic necessitated rapid adaptation of clinical assessment methodologies in medical education, with particular focus on the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). This paper evaluates the implementation and outcomes of in-person OSCEs conducted during the 2020-2021 academic year, analyzing the efficacy of comprehensive safety protocols designed to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk. A multi-faceted strategy, encompassing pre-screening, stringent personal protective equipment (PPE) use, environmental controls, and logistical restructuring, was deployed. Crucially, our longitudinal monitoring revealed zero instances of disease transmission attributable to the examination events, thereby validating the operational framework. Concurrently, anonymized student feedback indicated a statistically significant increase in satisfaction metrics compared to pre-pandemic benchmarks. This enhanced educational experience is attributed to the perceived rigor of safety measures and the preservation of the authentic, hands-on assessment format, which was largely lost in virtual alternatives. Furthermore, we explore the prospective integration of machine learning algorithms to optimize future OSCE administration, including predictive analytics for resource allocation and automated performance analytics. This study demonstrates that with meticulous planning, high-stakes clinical assessments can be conducted safely without compromising educational integrity or student morale, offering a viable model for competency evaluation during public health crises.
