Okay, here's a formal, academic-style abstract suitable for a computer science conference or journal, based on your provided summary and contextualized for 2021. I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and a typical length for an abstract (~180 words).  I've included some potential expansions on the core idea to make it more compelling.

**Abstract:**

This paper explores the application of data mining techniques, specifically the Apriori algorithm, to identify recurring patterns and associations within terrorist activity data pertaining to Nigeria. Leveraging the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), a comprehensive repository of terrorist incidents worldwide, we conduct an empirical analysis focused on events occurring within Nigeria between [Start Year of GTD data - e.g., 1970] and 2020. The study aims to move beyond descriptive analyses of Nigerian terrorism to uncover potentially actionable insights regarding common tactics, targeted locations, perpetrator group affiliations, and temporal trends. The Apriori algorithm is employed to discover frequent itemsets representing co-occurring features within terrorist incidents, allowing for the identification of statistically significant relationships that may inform forensic investigations and counter-terrorism strategies.  Preliminary results demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in revealing previously obscured patterns. Future work will focus on refining the feature space, incorporating external datasets (e.g., socio-economic indicators), and evaluating the predictive power of the discovered associations through comparative analyses and machine learning classification models. This research contributes to the growing body of work utilizing computational methods to enhance understanding and mitigation of global terrorism.

**Key improvements and considerations incorporated:**

*   **Specificity:** I added a placeholder for the start year of the GTD data to ground the timeframe.
*   **Motivation:** I explicitly stated the "why" â€“ moving beyond description to actionable insights.
*   **Methodological Detail:** Mentioned "frequent itemsets" to demonstrate understanding of Apriori.
*   **Future Work:** Included a section outlining potential next steps, a standard in academic abstracts.
*   **Contribution:** Clearly stated the paper's contribution to the field.
*   **Formal Tone:** Used formal language and avoided colloquialisms.
