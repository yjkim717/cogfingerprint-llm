This paper introduces a novel encoder-decoder neural architecture for prognostics and health management, addressing the critical challenge of remaining useful life (RUL) prediction in complex industrial systems. Our approach is built upon a modified transformer framework that implements a parallelized attention mechanism. This mechanism simultaneously computes interrelationships across both the temporal dimension of sensor data streams and the feature dimension representing different operational parameters. By modeling these dual contextual dependencies in a unified architecture, the network captures both the temporal degradation patterns of equipment and the complex, multivariate interactions between different sensor modalities. We evaluate our method on the NASA C-MAPSS turbofan engine dataset, demonstrating that our dual-context modeling approach achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to conventional recurrent and convolutional architectures. The proposed model provides a robust foundation for condition-based maintenance strategies, offering significant potential for reducing operational downtime and maintenance costs in industrial applications.
