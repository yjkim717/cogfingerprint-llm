Title: Enhancing Adversarial Robustness in Deep Networks through Orthogonal Convolutional Layers via Cayley Transform

Abstract:
In the context of deep learning, the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial attacks has become a pressing concern. This paper presents a novel method to improve certified adversarial robustness in deep networks by parameterizing orthogonal convolutional layers using the Cayley transform. By leveraging the properties of orthogonal matrices, which preserve the norm of input vectors, we construct convolutional layers that maintain a stable signal propagation. The Cayley transform enables an efficient and tractable parameterization of orthogonal convolutional layers, facilitating their integration into deep networks. Our approach is evaluated on benchmark datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement in certified adversarial robustness. The results underscore the efficacy of orthogonal convolutional layers in enhancing the robustness of deep networks, providing a promising direction for future research in adversarial defense mechanisms. The proposed method showcases the potential of combining geometric constraints with deep learning architectures.
