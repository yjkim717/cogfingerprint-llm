This paper presents the first differentially private algorithm for correlation clustering achieving subquadratic additive error in the general metric setting. We establish a novel analysis proving our method maintains (ε,δ)-differential privacy while achieving O(n^(3/2)) error, significantly improving upon prior work. Furthermore, we demonstrate a fundamental limitation by proving a linear error lower bound for any algorithm satisfying pure (ε,0)-differential privacy. These results delineate the privacy-utility tradeoff for private correlation clustering and provide optimal algorithms for the approximate privacy regime.
