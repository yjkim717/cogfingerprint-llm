**Abstract**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has engendered a novel landscape for cybersecurity threats, particularly Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these attacks specifically targeting IoT ecosystems, examining their evolving methodologies and resultant impact on device functionality and network stability. We analyze the unique vulnerabilities inherent in IoT architectures – constrained resources, heterogeneous communication protocols, and often-lax security practices – which contribute to their susceptibility.  Furthermore, we investigate a range of proposed countermeasures, categorizing them into detection-based, mitigation-based, and prevention-based strategies.  Specifically, we evaluate the efficacy of intrusion detection systems, rate limiting techniques, and secure boot methodologies.  Our assessment underscores the urgent need for proactive and layered security approaches to safeguard the growing IoT infrastructure from increasingly sophisticated DoS/DDoS campaigns, concluding with recommendations for future research focused on resilient IoT design and dynamic defense mechanisms (2021).
