**Abstract**

The Pandora’s Box problem, a combinatorial optimization challenge concerning the selection of sets to minimize the number of uncovered elements, has historically resisted efficient algorithmic solutions. This work establishes a novel approximation-preserving equivalence between Pandora’s Box and a suite of closely related problems, notably the Min-Sum Set Cover and certain correlated distribution scenarios. We demonstrate that leveraging techniques from uniform decision tree construction allows for the derivation of constant-factor approximation algorithms applicable across these interconnected formulations. 

Specifically, we present a mapping that transforms the Pandora’s Box instance into a corresponding instance of Min-Sum Set Cover, retaining the original approximation ratio.  Furthermore, we illustrate how this equivalence can be extended to analyze scenarios where set selections are inherently correlated.  The core contribution lies in providing a unified framework for approaching these problems, facilitating the transfer of existing approximation techniques.  This research offers a significant advancement in understanding the structure of this NP-hard problem and provides a practical pathway toward improved solution guarantees, marking a notable step towards more efficient algorithms in combinatorial set selection.  Future work will explore the scalability of this equivalence for larger problem instances.
