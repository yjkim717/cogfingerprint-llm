Title: Bridging Mechanism Design and Algorithmic Efficiency: A Bernoulli Factory Approach

Abstract:
In the realm of mechanism design, achieving Bayesian incentive compatibility remains a significant challenge, particularly in multi-dimensional and continuous type spaces. This paper, drawing on the principles of Bernoulli Factories, presents a novel polynomial-time reduction from Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism design to Bayesian algorithm design. By leveraging the computational capabilities of Bernoulli Factories, we demonstrate that exact incentive compatibility can be attained in complex type spaces. Our reduction enables the translation of algorithmic solutions into mechanisms that maximize welfare, while ensuring truthful reporting is a dominant strategy for agents. This breakthrough, grounded in the theoretical foundations of Bayesian algorithm design, has far-reaching implications for the design of efficient and incentive-compatible mechanisms in various domains. As of 2021, our work contributes to the ongoing discourse on mechanism design, offering a fresh perspective on the interplay between algorithmic efficiency and incentive compatibility.
