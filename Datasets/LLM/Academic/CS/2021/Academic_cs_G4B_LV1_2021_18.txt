**Abstract: Longitudinal Analysis of BNT162b2-Induced Neutralizing Antibody Dynamics – A Cohort-Based Assessment**

This research presents a longitudinal investigation into the durability of neutralizing antibody responses elicited by the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine in a cohort of healthy adult participants, conducted in late 2021.  The study’s primary objective was to characterize the waning kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies six months post-vaccination, employing a quantitative assay to measure antibody titers against key viral epitopes.  Our findings demonstrate a discernible decline in neutralizing antibody concentrations over the observation period, indicative of a natural attenuation characteristic of humoral immune responses.  However, crucially, a substantial proportion of participants maintained detectable neutralizing activity, suggesting a persistent, albeit reduced, immunological memory.

We employed a Bayesian statistical model to predict antibody decay rates, factoring in demographic variables and initial vaccine dose.  These predictive models highlight the importance of considering individual variation in immune response.  The observed persistence warrants further investigation into the mechanisms driving this sustained immunity, potentially involving memory B cell populations and antibody class switching.  These results contribute to a broader understanding of the long-term efficacy of BNT162b2 and inform strategies for optimizing vaccination schedules and assessing the potential for broadened protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants – effectively representing a critical data point in the ongoing ‘immunological system’ analysis.
