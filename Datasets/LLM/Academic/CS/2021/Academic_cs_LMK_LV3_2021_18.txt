Title: Assessing Long-Term Immunogenicity of BNT162b2 Vaccine: A Prospective Study on Neutralizing Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2

Abstract:
The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of effective vaccination strategies. As of 2021, the BNT162b2 vaccine has been widely administered to combat SARS-CoV-2. This prospective study investigates the persistence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 humoral immunity in 308 healthy individuals six months post-full vaccination with BNT162b2. Our findings indicate a decline in neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a waning immunity over time. The study's results have significant implications for the timing and administration of booster shots, crucial for maintaining long-term protection against COVID-19. By elucidating the dynamics of BNT162b2-induced immunity, this research informs public health policies on COVID-19 vaccination strategies, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring of vaccine efficacy and adaptive immunization protocols. The data presented herein contribute to the ongoing discourse on optimizing vaccination regimens to mitigate the pandemic's impact.
