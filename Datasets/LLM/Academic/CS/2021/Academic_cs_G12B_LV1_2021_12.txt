**Orthogonal Convolutional Layers via Cayley Parameterization for Enhanced Adversarial Resilience**

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable performance across various computer vision tasks; however, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a significant impediment to reliable deployment. This work investigates the design of convolutional layers with inherent robustness properties by leveraging the Cayley transform to enforce orthogonality within the convolutional kernel parameter space. We propose a novel parameterization scheme that directly constrains convolutional filters to lie on the Stiefel manifold, efficiently maintained through the application of the Cayley transform during both forward and backward passes. This approach circumvents the computational overhead often associated with traditional iterative orthogonalization methods.  Empirically, we demonstrate that networks employing our Cayley-parameterized orthogonal convolutional layers exhibit significantly improved adversarial robustness against common attack strategies (e.g., FGSM, PGD) compared to standard CNNs, while maintaining competitive performance on clean data. Furthermore, we explore the scalability of our method to deeper architectures, showing its feasibility for large-scale image classification.  Future research directions include investigating the interplay between orthogonalization and spectral normalization within the Fourier domain to further enhance robustness and exploring the theoretical underpinnings of the observed resilience gains. We believe this work provides a promising avenue for constructing more robust and reliable CNNs.
