**Abstract**

The increasing complexity of robotic systems necessitates efficient methods for representing and solving intricate optimization challenges. This work investigates the application of factor graphs within the robotics domain, demonstrating their potential to significantly enhance computational efficacy. Factor graphs provide a flexible and modular framework for encoding probabilistic relationships inherent in robotic tasks, allowing for the decomposition of complex problems into a series of interconnected, manageable sub-problems. Specifically, we examine how bipartite graphical models, a specialized instantiation of factor graphs, can streamline the estimation of robot state and control parameters.  The inherent graph structure facilitates efficient inference via techniques like maximum likelihood estimation, offering a compelling alternative to traditional methods.  Preliminary results suggest a substantial reduction in computational burden and improved convergence rates when employing this approach, particularly for systems exhibiting significant redundancy. Further research will focus on scaling factor graph methodologies to more complex robotic architectures.
