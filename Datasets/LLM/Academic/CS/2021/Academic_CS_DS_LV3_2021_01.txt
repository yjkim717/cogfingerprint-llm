Abstract: This 2021 computational imaging study presents a novel framework for pose-conditioned scene generation through adversarial learning. We address the fundamental challenge of synthesizing semantically coherent environments from sparse human pose keypoints by developing a StyleGAN2 adaptation that deciphers implicit spatial relationships within pose configurations. Our architecture employs a dual-path discriminator to simultaneously evaluate anatomical plausibility and scene realism, enabling the model to hallucinate contextually appropriate backgrounds, lighting conditions, and object placements. Through rigorous human pose analysis on the COCO-WholeBody dataset, we demonstrate how subtle kinematic cues—such as limb orientation and joint proximity—inform spatial reasoning about plausible environments. Quantitative evaluations reveal our method achieves 37% improvement in placement accuracy over pix2pixHD baselines while maintaining Frechet Inception Distance scores below 18.3. The proposed scene hallucination paradigm establishes new state-of-the-art performance in conditional image generation and opens avenues for applications in virtual reality content creation and automated cinematography, where pose-driven contextual synthesis remains critical.
