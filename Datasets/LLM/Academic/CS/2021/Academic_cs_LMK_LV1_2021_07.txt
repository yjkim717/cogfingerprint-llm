In 2021, we present a novel differentially private algorithm for correlation clustering, a fundamental problem in unsupervised machine learning. Our approach ensures individual privacy while achieving subquadratic additive error, a significant improvement over existing methods. By leveraging advanced techniques in differential privacy, we develop a robust clustering algorithm that balances accuracy and privacy, providing a reliable solution for sensitive data analysis.
