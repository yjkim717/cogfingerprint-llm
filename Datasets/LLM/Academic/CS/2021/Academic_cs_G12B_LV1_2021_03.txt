Okay, here's an academic-style abstract, aiming for precision and formality, inspired by the provided keywords and summary. I've structured it to follow common abstract conventions (motivation, problem, approach, results, implications). I've also included a year context of 2021, aiming for a style and referencing appropriate for that timeframe.

**Abstract**

The problem of sequential exploration under uncertainty, often framed as the "Pandora's Box" scenario, presents a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning and algorithmic decision-making. In this setting, an agent must strategically open a series of boxes, each revealing a probabilistic reward distribution, with the goal of maximizing cumulative reward. While traditionally studied through the lens of regret minimization, recent work has hinted at deeper connections to combinatorial optimization problems. This paper investigates these connections, demonstrating a surprising equivalence between the Pandora’s Box problem and the Uniform Decision Tree/Min-Sum Set Cover (UDT/MSSC) framework. Specifically, we prove that under correlated reward distributions – a setting increasingly relevant to real-world applications exhibiting dependencies between observations – the optimal policy for Pandora's Box can be formally represented and approximated using techniques developed for UDT/MSSC.  Our analysis reveals that both problems share analogous approximation bounds and computational complexity classes within this correlated setting.  Furthermore, we characterize the impact of correlation structure on the achievable regret, highlighting scenarios where the equivalence yields significant practical benefits. This finding bridges the gap between sequential exploration and combinatorial optimization, potentially enabling the transfer of techniques and insights from one domain to the other.  The theoretical implications suggest a broader applicability of UDT/MSSC beyond its established use cases, while the practical implications offer new avenues for designing efficient exploration strategies in reinforcement learning, especially within environments exhibiting complex dependencies.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Refinements:**

*   **Formal Language:** I used phrases like "investigates these connections," "demonstrating a surprising equivalence," "analogous approximation bounds," etc., to maintain a formal tone.
*   **Terminology:** I incorporated all keywords and related terms (regret minimization, sequential exploration, reinforcement learning, algorithmic decision-making).
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: problem introduction, specific focus (equivalence), methodology (analysis, characterization), results (shared bounds, impact of correlation), and implications (bridging domains, practical/theoretical benefits).
*   **Year Context (2021):** The references to "recent work" and "increasingly relevant" are designed to reflect the timeframe.  In a full paper, citations would, of course, be included.
*   **Correlated Distributions:** I emphasized the importance of correlated distributions as a key condition for the equivalence, as this seems to be a central element of the original summary.
*   **Word Count:** I aimed for approximately 259 words, as requested.
