**Abstract**

The advent of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has precipitated a paradigm shift in natural language processing, moving from task-specific architectures to unified frameworks centered on sequence labeling. This paper investigates this transition, arguing that reformulating disparate tasks—such as named entity recognition and sentiment analysis—into a generalized sequence-tagging schema enables the development of more powerful and versatile models. By abstracting these problems into a common structural representation, we facilitate knowledge transfer and reduce architectural complexity. We present a model that leverages this principle, demonstrating that a single, unified architecture can achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance across a spectrum of traditionally distinct NLP benchmarks. Our findings suggest that this paradigm not only enhances performance but also promotes a more streamlined and generalizable approach to language understanding, marking a significant step towards holistic NLP systems.
