In computer vision research, the persistent challenge of data scarcity in low-level vision tasks has driven innovation in data augmentation methodologies. This paper introduces COPY-BLEND, a novel region modification technique that substantially advances perceptual quality preservation in augmented training datasets. Unlike conventional augmentation approaches that often compromise textural consistency, our method strategically blends source and target regions through learned affinity matrices, maintaining structural coherence while expanding dataset diversity. Through comprehensive evaluations across super-resolution, denoising, and deblurring tasks, we demonstrate that COPY-BLEND achieves statistically significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and human perceptual studies. The technique reduces required training samples by 40-60% while maintaining competitive performance with state-of-the-art baseline architectures. Our ablation studies confirm that the perceptual quality gains stem directly from the method's capacity to preserve high-frequency textural patterns during the blending process. This research establishes a new paradigm for resource-efficient computer vision training, particularly relevant given the computational constraints and data acquisition challenges prevalent in 2021. The proposed approach demonstrates that strategic data augmentation can bridge the gap between model complexity and training data requirements without architectural modifications.
