**Abstract**

The efficacy of mRNA vaccination strategies against emerging viral pathogens necessitates robust longitudinal immunological analysis. This study investigates the decay of neutralizing antibody responses following full vaccination with the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in a cohort of 308 healthy adult participants, conducted in 2021.  Our findings reveal a sustained, albeit declining, neutralizing antibody titer profile six months post-vaccination.  Specifically, a statistically significant correlation was observed between participant age and the magnitude of the antibody response, suggesting potential age-related variations in immunological memory.  These results align with broader immunological models predicting waning immunity and highlight the importance of adaptive immune system dynamics in vaccine-induced protection.  Further research employing advanced computational modeling – incorporating individual patient data – is warranted to predict optimal booster schedules and refine vaccine design for sustained, age-tailored protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants.
