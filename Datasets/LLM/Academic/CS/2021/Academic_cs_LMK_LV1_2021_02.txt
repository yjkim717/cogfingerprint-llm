"Title: Optimal SQ Lower Bounds for Agnostic Learning of Polynomial Threshold Functions under Gaussian Distributions

Abstract:
We investigate the complexity of agnostic learning under Gaussian distributions, focusing on polynomial threshold functions (PTFs). By developing a novel framework for constructing hard instances, we establish optimal Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds for learning PTFs of arbitrary degree. Our results significantly extend the existing literature on agnostic learning, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the inherent difficulties in learning complex concept classes. Specifically, we show that any SQ algorithm for agnostic learning of degree-$d$ PTFs under the Gaussian distribution requires a sample complexity of at least $\Omega(n^d)$, where $n$ is the dimensionality of the input space. Our lower bounds are derived through a careful analysis of the Gaussian noise sensitivity of PTFs and a reduction to known SQ lower bounds for polynomial regression. Our findings have implications for the design of efficient learning algorithms and highlight the importance of considering the interplay between noise and complexity in agnostic learning settings."
