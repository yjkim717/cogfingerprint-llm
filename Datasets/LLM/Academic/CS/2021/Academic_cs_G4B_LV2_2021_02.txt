**Abstract**

Acoregressive learning frameworks represent a significant paradigm shift in statistical learning, offering robustness against model misspecification. This work investigates the optimality of polynomial regression within the context of agnostic learning, specifically focusing on Gaussian distributions. We rigorously demonstrate that polynomial regression achieves optimal performance under this assumption, providing a foundational result for understanding the capabilities of agnostic methods. Crucially, we establish tight lower bounds on the computational complexity required for solving the agnostic regression problem with polynomial features, leveraging techniques from LP duality and combinatorial analysis. These bounds highlight the inherent limitations of alternative approaches and underscore the efficiency of polynomial regression. Our analysis reveals that the complexity scales polynomially with the degree of the polynomial, reflecting its expressive power while maintaining computational feasibility.  The findings contribute substantially to the theoretical understanding of agnostic learning, offering valuable insights for practitioners and stimulating further research into efficient agnostic algorithms.  This work was completed in 2021 and builds upon recent advances in agnostic learning theory.
