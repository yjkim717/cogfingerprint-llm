**Abstract**

Weakly supervised semantic segmentation presents a significant challenge due to the scarcity of accurately labeled data. This work investigates a novel trust region optimization framework designed to mitigate these limitations. We propose a regularized loss function, incorporating geometric priors, which effectively guides deep learning segmentation networks.  Specifically, the introduced losses are constrained within a trust region, leveraging a robust solver to ensure stable and efficient convergence. This approach allows for the integration of complex geometric constraints – previously difficult to implement – without requiring extensive manual annotation.  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this method achieves superior segmentation accuracy compared to existing weakly supervised techniques.  The combination of regularized losses and a trust region method significantly enhances the applicability of deep learning for semantic segmentation tasks, representing a key advancement in the field by 2021.
