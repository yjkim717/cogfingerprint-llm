**Abstract:**

This study investigates the interplay of competitive dynamics, bank size, and macroeconomic development on the operational efficiency of financial institutions within the BRICS economies. Employing a panel data analysis of 1137 BRICS banks spanning 2000-2015, we model revenue efficiency, considering the evolving regulatory landscape and data analytics capabilities increasingly leveraged during this period. Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant positive correlation between market competition and bank size with overall efficiency scores. Furthermore, we observe a positive impact of national GDP on revenue efficiency, alongside a non-linear relationship suggesting diminishing returns at higher levels of development. These results carry implications for algorithmic fairness in credit scoring and resource allocation within BRICS banking systems, highlighting the need for nuanced regulatory interventions.
