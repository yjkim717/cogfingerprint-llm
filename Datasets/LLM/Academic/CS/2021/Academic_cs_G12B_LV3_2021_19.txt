 Here's a formal academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided summary and keywords, suitable for a computer science conference proceeding (circa 2021):

**Abstract:**

The increasing demand for robust and efficient algorithms in low-level vision domains—specifically image enhancement, dehazing, and deblurring—necessitates innovative training methodologies. This paper introduces a novel data augmentation strategy leveraging a copy-blend approach to address challenges posed by limited training datasets. Our technique preserves crucial textural information during augmentation, mitigating artifacts often introduced by traditional methods and promoting more semantically consistent synthetic data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that copy-blend augmentation facilitates earlier convergence during training and yields improved performance across various low-level vision tasks. The results indicate a reduced reliance on extensive training corpora, suggesting potential for resource-constrained deployments. We argue that this approach offers a pragmatic pathway towards enhanced generalization and efficiency in low-level vision algorithms, contributing to advancements in image processing and computer vision research.
