**Abstract**

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone a profound paradigm shift since 2018, largely attributable to the emergence and proliferation of deep learning-based pre-trained language models (PLMs). Prior to this period, NLP research was characterized by task-specific architectures and feature engineering. However, the success of models like BERT, GPT-3, and their variants has fostered a move towards task unification, where a single, general-purpose model can be adapted to a diverse range of downstream applications through fine-tuning or prompting techniques. This represents a fundamental change in NLP methodology, diminishing the need for bespoke solutions and accelerating progress across tasks including question answering, text classification, and machine translation. This abstract explores the implications of this paradigm shift, examining both the benefits of PLMs – namely their enhanced performance and transfer learning capabilities – and the emerging challenges related to computational resource requirements and potential biases embedded within these large-scale models. Further research is warranted to understand the long-term impact of this transition on the trajectory of NLP.
