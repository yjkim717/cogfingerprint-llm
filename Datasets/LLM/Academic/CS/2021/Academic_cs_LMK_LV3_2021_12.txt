Title: Adversarial Robustness in Deep Neural Networks: A Survey of Attacks and Defenses

Abstract:
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised significant concerns in the research community. As of 2021, the proliferation of DNNs in real-world applications has underscored the need for robust defenses against such attacks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on adversarial attacks and defenses in DNNs. We categorize attacks into white-box, black-box, and gray-box scenarios, and examine the corresponding defense strategies, including adversarial training, input preprocessing, and certified defenses. Our analysis highlights the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and computational complexity, and identifies key challenges in developing effective defenses. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of adversarial robustness on the broader field of AI safety and security. By synthesizing the current state of knowledge, this survey aims to inform the development of more robust DNNs and inspire future research in this critical area.
