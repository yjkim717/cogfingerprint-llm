**Abstract**

Challenges in unsupervised learning frequently necessitate the analysis of complex data relationships, yet preserving data privacy remains a critical concern. This work presents a novel differentially private correlation clustering algorithm designed to mitigate these competing demands. Our approach leverages a modified k-means initialization strategy, incorporating Laplace noise calibrated to ensure differential privacy guarantees while maintaining sub-quadratic time complexity relative to the dataset size.  We demonstrate that this method achieves a significant reduction in clustering error compared to standard differentially private k-means, addressing a key limitation of prior techniques.  Specifically, we quantify the trade-off between privacy loss and clustering accuracy, illustrating the feasibility of robust, privacy-aware unsupervised analysis.  Preliminary experimental results, conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets in 2021, suggest promising performance and a viable path toward scalable, privacy-preserving correlation clustering.
