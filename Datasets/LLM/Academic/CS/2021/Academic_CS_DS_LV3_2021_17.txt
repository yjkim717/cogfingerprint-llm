This research presents a computational forensic investigation of terrorist activities in Nigeria through association rule mining of the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). Leveraging the Apriori algorithm, we systematically analyze multi-year incident data to uncover latent patterns in attack methodologies, target selection, and operational outcomes. Our analysis reveals that armed assault constitutes the predominant attack type, demonstrating statistically significant associations with high success rates and specific weapon categories. The extracted rules further identify coordinated patterns between geographical regions and temporal attack cycles, providing empirical evidence of evolving tactical adaptations. These findings substantiate that terrorist operations in Nigeria exhibit structured behavioral signatures detectable through algorithmic forensic analysis. The study contributes to computational counterterrorism by demonstrating how association mining can transform raw incident data into actionable intelligence, offering predictive insights for security policy formulation. This methodology establishes a reproducible framework for forensic pattern analysis in complex security environments, with implications for proactive threat assessment and resource allocation.
