**Abstract**

This study explores the application of data mining techniques, specifically the Apriori algorithm, to the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) for the purpose of identifying significant patterns and associations within terrorist events occurring in Nigeria. Leveraging the GTDâ€™s comprehensive record of terrorist incidents, we aim to move beyond descriptive analyses and uncover latent relationships between attack characteristics, geographic locations, and perpetrator profiles. Our implementation of the Apriori algorithm facilitates the discovery of frequent itemsets related to attack methods (e.g., explosive devices, armed assault), target types (e.g., government facilities, civilian populations), and temporal trends. Preliminary findings suggest a notable prevalence of non-suicidal attacks and reveal correlations between specific tactics and success rates, offering insights into the operational strategies of terrorist groups within the Nigerian context. This research contributes to the field of computational social science by demonstrating the utility of data mining in terrorism studies and provides actionable intelligence for forensic investigations and counter-terrorism strategies. The results, evaluated within the context of 2021 data availability, highlight opportunities for further research incorporating evolving datasets and advanced analytical methodologies.
