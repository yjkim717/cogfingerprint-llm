**Abstract**

The safe and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles in dense, multi-agent scenarios remains a critical challenge. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising, data-driven alternative to traditional model-based control, the comparative efficacy of modern policy-based algorithms for this high-stakes application requires rigorous evaluation. This study conducts a systematic empirical comparison of two leading deep RL algorithms—Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)—for the task of decentralized multi-vehicle collision avoidance. We formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where each agent perceives a localized state and must learn a robust policy. Our methodology involves training and evaluating both algorithms in a high-fidelity simulation environment featuring dynamic, non-cooperative agents. The results demonstrate that both PPO, an on-policy method, and SAC, an off-policy maximum-entropy algorithm, are capable of learning sophisticated collision avoidance behaviors, achieving statistically comparable success rates of 91% in complex test scenarios. This high performance underscores the maturity of deep RL by 2021 for complex control tasks. However, qualitative analysis reveals distinct behavioral characteristics: PPO policies exhibit more conservative maneuvers, whereas SAC policies leverage its exploratory nature for more agile, but occasionally less predictable, trajectories. These findings provide critical insights for algorithm selection, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between robustness and agility that must be considered for the real-world deployment of learning-based navigation systems.
