Title: Unveiling Terrorist Activity Patterns in Nigeria using the Apriori Algorithm: A Forensic Analysis of the Global Terrorism Database

Abstract:
The escalating threat of terrorism in Nigeria necessitates a data-driven approach to understanding the dynamics of terrorist activities. This study leverages the Apriori algorithm, a well-established data mining technique, to uncover patterns and associations within the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). By analyzing GTD records from 2021, we identify significant correlations between terrorist incidents, target types, and attack modalities in Nigeria. Our Apriori-based analysis reveals novel insights into the modus operandi of terrorist organizations operating in the region. The findings of this research contribute to the field of forensic investigation by providing a data-driven framework for predicting and preventing terrorist activities. The study's results have implications for policymakers and security agencies seeking to develop targeted counter-terrorism strategies in Nigeria. Our research demonstrates the efficacy of applying data mining techniques to combat global terrorism.
