**Title:** Analyzing Neutralizing Antibody Responses to BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination: A Longitudinal Study

**Abstract:**

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for effective vaccination strategies against SARS-CoV-2. The BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine has been widely administered to combat the pandemic. This study investigates the longitudinal neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses in a cohort of 308 healthy individuals up to six months post-BNT162b2 vaccination. Employing a data-driven approach, we analyze the dynamics of nAb titers and their implications for SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Our results demonstrate a significant correlation between nAb titers and vaccine-induced immunity, with a notable decline in nAb levels over the six-month period. Furthermore, we identify key factors influencing nAb responses, including age, sex, and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. Our findings have important implications for the design of booster shot regimens and vaccine efficacy assessments. Using computational modeling and machine learning algorithms, we predict the optimal timing for booster shots to maintain robust nAb responses and inform vaccine development strategies. This study contributes to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 immunity and provides insights into the development of effective vaccination protocols. Our results support the use of data-driven approaches in vaccine research, highlighting the potential for computational methods to inform public health policy and optimize vaccine efficacy.
