Title: Exploiting Locality Structure in Robotics Optimization using Factor Graphs

Abstract:
In robotics, numerous optimization problems arise in estimation and inference tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and motion planning. The complexity of these problems often necessitates efficient and scalable solutions. This paper leverages factor graphs, a type of graphical model, to model the locality structure inherent in these optimization problems. By representing the problem as a factor graph, we can decompose the optimization into smaller sub-problems, exploiting the conditional independence structure between variables. This decomposition enables the application of efficient optimization algorithms, such as variable elimination and message passing. Our approach demonstrates improved computational performance and enhanced problem modeling capabilities compared to traditional optimization methods. Experimental results on SLAM and motion planning benchmarks (2021 datasets) validate the effectiveness of our factor graph-based optimization framework, showcasing its potential to tackle complex robotics optimization problems.
