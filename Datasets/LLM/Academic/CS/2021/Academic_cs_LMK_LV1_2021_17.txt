Title: Unveiling Patterns in Nigeria's Terrorism: An Apriori Algorithm Approach to the Global Terrorism Database

Abstract:
The escalating threat of terrorism in Nigeria necessitates a data-driven understanding of the phenomenon. This study leverages the Apriori algorithm, a prominent association rule mining technique, to uncover hidden patterns in terrorist activities within the country. Utilizing the comprehensive Global Terrorism Database (GTD), we conducted an in-depth analysis of terrorist incidents in Nigeria from 1997 to 2021. Our methodology involved preprocessing the GTD dataset to extract relevant features, followed by the application of the Apriori algorithm to identify significant associations between variables such as attack type, target, and perpetrator group. The results reveal insightful patterns and correlations that can inform forensic investigation and counter-terrorism strategies. The findings of this research contribute to the existing body of knowledge on Nigeria's terrorism landscape, providing policymakers and security agencies with data-driven insights to enhance their response to the threat.
