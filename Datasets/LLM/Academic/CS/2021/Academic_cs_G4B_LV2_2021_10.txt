**Abstract**

This work examines the geometric consequences of conformal and quasiregular mappings on intrinsic metrics within topologically simple domains. Building upon established theorems in complex analysis, we present refined inequalities concerning the distortion of hyperbolic metric structures induced by these mappings. Specifically, we leverage the Schwarz Lemma and the properties of quasiregular functions to derive tighter bounds than previously reported. Our analysis centers on quantifying how the intrinsic metric, defined by an associated intrinsic metric, transforms under conformal transformations.  The presented results demonstrate a systematic approach to understanding the geometric impact of these mappings, offering improved constraints on metric deformation.  This research contributes to a deeper theoretical understanding of mapping properties and their implications for geometric analysis, with potential applications in areas such as image processing and data visualization where preserving intrinsic distances is crucial. Further investigation into more complex domains is warranted.
