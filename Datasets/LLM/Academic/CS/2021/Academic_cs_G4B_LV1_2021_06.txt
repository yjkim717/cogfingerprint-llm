**Abstract: Performance Modeling of Distributed Ledger Technology Networks – An Efficiency Analysis**

This research investigates the influence of network scale, competitive dynamics, and underlying economic indicators on the operational efficiency of distributed ledger technology (DLT) networks, specifically focusing on those mirroring the characteristics of BRICS banking systems. Employing a panel data analysis approach utilizing network performance metrics from 2021, we model the relationship between network size (nodes, transactions), competitive intensity (number of participating validators), and macroeconomic variables (GDP growth, institutional stability).  Preliminary findings suggest a non-linear correlation, with moderate network size exhibiting optimal efficiency, while extreme scaling may introduce bottlenecks.  Furthermore, heightened competitive pressures appear to positively correlate with improved throughput, though potentially at the expense of consensus stability.  These results contribute to a broader understanding of resource allocation and optimization strategies within complex, evolving distributed systems – informing the design of more resilient and scalable DLT infrastructures.
