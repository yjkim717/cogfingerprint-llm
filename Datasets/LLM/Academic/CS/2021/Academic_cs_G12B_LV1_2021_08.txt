## Factor Graphs for Efficient Robotic Motion Planning and Control

**Abstract:** The complexity of modern robotic systems, demanding real-time adaptation and intricate task execution, necessitates efficient computational frameworks for motion planning and control. This work investigates the application of factor graphs, a powerful bipartite graphical model, to address optimization challenges prevalent in robotics. We argue that leveraging the inherent locality structure within robotic tasks – such as kinematic constraints, sensor measurements, and control objectives – can significantly enhance optimization performance compared to traditional methods. Factor graphs provide a natural and intuitive representation of these localized relationships, allowing for incremental message passing algorithms like the Sum-Product algorithm to efficiently solve complex, non-convex optimization problems. Specifically, we demonstrate how factor graphs can be employed to represent and solve problems in trajectory optimization, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and adaptive control, with a focus on scalability and robustness. Our analysis highlights the potential of factor graphs to facilitate the design of modular and easily extensible robotic systems, enabling rapid prototyping and adaptation to novel environments and tasks. We conclude by outlining future research directions, including the integration of learning techniques to automatically construct factor graph representations from raw sensory data.
