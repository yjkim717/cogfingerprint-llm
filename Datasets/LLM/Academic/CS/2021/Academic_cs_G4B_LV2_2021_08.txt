**Abstract**

The increasing complexity of robotic systems necessitates efficient and scalable methods for solving intricate optimization problems. This work investigates the application of factor graphs as a powerful tool for addressing these challenges within the robotics domain. We demonstrate how factor graphs provide a structured representation for decomposing complex, multi-variable optimization tasks into a series of smaller, more manageable sub-problems. Specifically, we focus on their efficacy in modeling local optimization strategies, leveraging their inherent graphical structure to facilitate efficient inference and parameter estimation. 

Our analysis reveals that the bipartite graphical model inherent within factor graphs allows for a modular approach to problem formulation, substantially reducing computational burden compared to traditional methods. We argue that this framework offers a robust foundation for developing adaptive control algorithms and planning strategies.  Preliminary results suggest a significant performance improvement, particularly in scenarios involving high-dimensional state spaces, and highlight the potential for further research into specialized factor graph constructions tailored to specific robotic tasks.
