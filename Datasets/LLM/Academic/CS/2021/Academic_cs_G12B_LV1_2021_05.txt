Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a CS conference proceeding in 2021. I've aimed for precision and a structured argument, approximately 233 words in length.  Following the abstract, I've included a brief explanation of the choices I made in crafting it.

**Abstract: Beyond Group Parity: Causal Modeling for Algorithmic Fairness Under Power Imbalances**

The increasing deployment of algorithmic decision-making systems across critical domains necessitates rigorous investigation into their fairness implications. Traditional algorithmic fairness metrics, often rooted in group parity comparisons (e.g., equal opportunity, demographic parity), are demonstrably insufficient to address systemic bias, particularly when embedded within contexts of pre-existing societal inequality and power imbalances. These metrics frequently fail to account for the causal pathways through which historical and structural factors influence both protected attribute status and outcomes. This paper argues for a paradigm shift towards incorporating causal inference and empirical economic frameworks into the evaluation and design of fair algorithms. We propose a methodology leveraging causal discovery techniques and structural causal models (SCMs) to explicitly model the causal relationships between protected attributes, mediating variables representing sources of power and privilege, and ultimate outcomes.  This approach allows for the identification of interventions that mitigate unfairness while preserving or even enhancing overall system utility.  We demonstrate, through a synthetic case study and preliminary analysis of a real-world lending dataset, that naive application of group fairness constraints can inadvertently exacerbate existing inequalities when power dynamics are not explicitly modeled. We conclude by outlining future research directions, including the development of scalable causal inference methods and the integration of behavioral economic insights into algorithmic design to foster truly equitable outcomes.

**Explanation of Choices & Design Decisions:**

*   **Year Context (2021):** The language and references to recent trends in fairness research are within the timeframe.
*   **CS Terminology:** I used precise terms like "algorithmic decision-making," "structural causal models (SCMs)," "causal discovery techniques," and "group parity" to align with a CS audience.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a clear structure:
    *   **Problem Statement:** Highlights the limitations of existing fairness metrics.
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Advocates for causal inference and empirical economics.
    *   **Methodology:** Briefly describes the methodology involving SCMs and causal discovery.
    *   **Results/Demonstration:** Mentions a case study and preliminary analysis to hint at findings.
    *   **Conclusion/Future Work:** States conclusions and suggests future research directions.
*   **Emphasis on Power Dynamics:** I explicitly incorporated the concept of "power imbalances" and "sources of power and privilege" to reflect the summary's core idea.
*   **Causal Language:**  Frequent use of terms like "causal pathways," "causal relationships," and "interventions" emphasizes the causal inference focus.
*   **Conciseness:** Each sentence is carefully crafted to convey maximum information within the word limit.
*   **Academic Tone:** Formal language, objective phrasing, and avoidance of colloquialisms maintain an appropriate academic tone.
