**Abstract**

Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have witnessed a significant paradigm shift, driven primarily by the adoption of pre-trained language models (PLMs) and their application across diverse NLP tasks. Traditional, task-specific approaches are increasingly being superseded by methodologies leveraging the extensive knowledge encoded within models like BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-3. This paper examines this evolving landscape, arguing that the current trajectory represents a fundamental change in how NLP challenges are formulated and addressed. Specifically, we observe a move towards unified modeling strategies, wherein a single PLM is adapted for multiple downstream tasks through techniques such as fine-tuning and prompt engineering.  This approach demonstrates compelling improvements in performance while concurrently fostering greater task generalization.  Further investigation into the implications of this paradigm shift for future NLP research and development is warranted, particularly concerning computational efficiency and the interpretability of these increasingly complex models (2021).
