In 2021, recent advancements in geometric function theory have led to a deeper understanding of intrinsic metrics under conformal and quasiregular mappings. This study refines existing inequalities for hyperbolic metrics in specific domains, yielding novel sharp versions of the Schwarz lemma. By leveraging quasiregular mapping properties, we establish improved distortion bounds, enhancing our comprehension of geometric transformations and their implications for computational geometry and complex analysis applications.
