This study examines the distortion of intrinsic metrics under conformal and quasiregular mappings within simple domains, leveraging insights from quasiconformal mappings. Focusing on the hyperbolic metric, we analyze how these mappings alter intrinsic distances. Our research, contextualized within the advancements of 2021, contributes to the understanding of geometric function theory. By investigating the interplay between conformal, quasiregular, and quasiconformal mappings, we establish new bounds on metric distortion, enhancing the theoretical framework for analyzing complex geometric transformations. Our findings have implications for various applications in mathematics and computational sciences.
