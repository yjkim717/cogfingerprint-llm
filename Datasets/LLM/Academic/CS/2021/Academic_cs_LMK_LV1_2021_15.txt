Abstract:

The advent of pre-trained language models has precipitated a paradigm shift in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Traditional sequence labeling tasks, such as named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging, have witnessed a significant transformation in their methodological approaches. This paper reviews the impact of pre-trained language models on NLP tasks, with a particular emphasis on sequence labeling. We examine the role of contextualized representations, such as those generated by BERT and its variants, in enhancing the performance of NLP models. Our analysis reveals that the incorporation of pre-trained language models has led to state-of-the-art results in various NLP tasks, thereby redefining the benchmarks for task-specific models. We discuss the implications of this paradigm shift, including the potential for improved performance and the need for re-evaluation of existing NLP methodologies. By synthesizing the findings of recent studies, this review aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of NLP research in the era of pre-trained language models.
