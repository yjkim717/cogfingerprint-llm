**Abstract**

The escalating threat of terrorism necessitates advanced analytical techniques for proactive risk assessment and targeted intervention. This research investigates the application of the Apriori algorithm to the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) to identify recurring patterns and associated methodologies within terrorist activity in Nigeria. Utilizing a dataset encompassing attacks recorded between 2000 and 2020, we employed a frequent itemset mining approach to uncover statistically significant associations between attack characteristics, geographic locations, and temporal trends. The results demonstrate the algorithm’s efficacy in revealing previously obscured connections, potentially informing forensic investigation strategies and predictive modeling.  Specifically, identified ‘itemsets’ represent combinations of attack types, weapons used, and operational contexts.  Future work will explore incorporating these insights into a dynamic risk assessment framework, leveraging machine learning techniques to forecast potential future attack vectors within the Nigerian context.
