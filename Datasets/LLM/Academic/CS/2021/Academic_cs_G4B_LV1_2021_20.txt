**Enhancing Bacterial Cell Segmentation via Morphology-Independent Deep Learning with Gradient of Distance Fields**

Accurate bacterial cell segmentation remains a critical challenge in microscopy-based diagnostics and metagenomics. Traditional methods frequently struggle with the inherent morphological variability of bacterial cell shapes and sizes, leading to inconsistent performance. This paper introduces a novel deep neural network architecture, leveraging a gradient of distance field (GDF) representation, to substantially improve bacterial cell segmentation accuracy.  We detail the implementation of this approach within a modified Omnipose framework, demonstrating its capacity to generate morphology-independent segmentations.  Quantitative evaluation using established datasets reveals a significant performance increase compared to existing techniques, evidenced by a [insert specific metric, e.g., Dice coefficient] improvement.  The GDF representation allows the network to learn robust features less reliant on pixel-level morphology, thereby enhancing generalization across diverse bacterial strains and imaging conditions.  Future work will explore integrating this methodology with automated cell counting and characterization pipelines.
