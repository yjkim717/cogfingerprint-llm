**Abstract: Metric Distortion Analysis via Conformal and Quasiregular Transformations**

This work explores the sensitivity of intrinsic metric properties to transformations within geometrically constrained spaces.  We investigate the behavior of *intrinsic metrics* – defined locally to preserve distances – under the influence of *conformal mappings* and, more generally, *quasiregular mappings*. Leveraging the established framework of *Schwartz Lemma* and its implications for metric preservation, we present refined inequalities characterizing the distortion introduced by these mappings. Specifically, we demonstrate how the local geometry, quantified by the *hyperbolic metric* associated with a domain, is systematically altered. Our analysis extends beyond simple domains, offering a foundational understanding for applications in data representation and dimensionality reduction, where preserving local distance relationships is paramount.  The results contribute to a more robust theoretical basis for algorithms reliant on faithful metric embeddings, particularly in contexts involving non-Euclidean data. (2021)
