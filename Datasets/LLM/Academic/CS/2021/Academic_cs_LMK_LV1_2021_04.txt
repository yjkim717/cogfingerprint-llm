Title: Efficient Black-Box Reductions for Welfare Maximization in Bayesian Mechanism Design

Abstract:
We present a novel polynomial-time black-box reduction from Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism design to Bayesian algorithm design for welfare maximization problems. Our reduction leverages the concept of Bernoulli factories to create a generic framework that converts any Bayesian algorithm into a Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism while preserving the welfare guarantees. Specifically, given a Bayesian algorithm that achieves an $\alpha$-approximation to the optimal welfare, our reduction yields a Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism that achieves an $\alpha$-approximation to the optimal welfare in expectation. Our result has significant implications for mechanism design, as it enables the creation of efficient and incentive compatible mechanisms for complex welfare maximization problems. Our techniques are broadly applicable and can be used to derive new results in various domains, including combinatorial auctions and public goods allocation. (2021)
