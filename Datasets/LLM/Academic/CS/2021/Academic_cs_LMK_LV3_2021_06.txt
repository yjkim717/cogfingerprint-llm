"Assessing BRICS Banking Efficiency through a Competitive Lens"

This study investigates the interplay between competition, bank size, and development indicators on the efficiency of BRICS banking institutions using a comprehensive panel dataset of 1137 banks spanning 2000-2015. Employing a robust econometric framework, our analysis reveals that intensified competition and optimal bank size significantly enhance efficiency. Furthermore, development indicators exhibit a positive correlation with banking efficiency. Our findings have pertinent implications for policymakers seeking to bolster the resilience and competitiveness of BRICS banking systems amidst evolving global financial landscapes (2021).
