The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems has introduced significant vulnerabilities, particularly concerning Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. This paper examines the evolving threat landscape in 2021, focusing on how the inherent constraints of IoT devices—such as limited computational resources and heterogeneous communication protocols—render them susceptible to exploitation for large-scale network disruptions. We analyze attack vectors across the IoT architecture stack, from perception to application layers, and assess the cascading impact on critical infrastructure. In response, the study proposes a multi-layered defense framework integrating lightweight cryptographic protocols, behavioral anomaly detection, and software-defined networking (SDN) for dynamic traffic management. Our findings underscore the necessity of adaptive, cross-layer security mechanisms to mitigate the escalating risks posed by IoT-based DoS/DDoS incursions in interconnected environments.
