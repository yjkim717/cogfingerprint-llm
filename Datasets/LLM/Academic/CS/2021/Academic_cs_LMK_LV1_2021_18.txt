**Title:** Modeling the Dynamics of Neutralizing Antibodies in Response to BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccination: A Computational Approach to Understanding SARS-CoV-2 Immunity

The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the critical role of computational modeling in understanding the complex dynamics of immune response to vaccination. This study presents a novel computational framework to analyze the kinetics of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in individuals vaccinated with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Leveraging a dataset of 308 healthy individuals, we develop a machine learning-based model to predict the longitudinal profile of neutralizing antibodies up to six months post-vaccination. Our model integrates a stochastic simulator with a gradient boosting algorithm to capture the variability in immune response and identify key factors influencing antibody kinetics. We validate our model using a hold-out test set and demonstrate its robustness in predicting antibody titers at multiple time points. Our results show that the model can accurately forecast the decline in neutralizing antibodies over time, providing insights into the duration of immunity conferred by the BNT162b2 vaccine. Furthermore, we apply our model to simulate the impact of booster shots on antibody levels, informing strategies for optimizing vaccination schedules. This study highlights the potential of computational modeling to support data-driven decision-making in vaccine development and public health policy, particularly in the context of emerging infectious diseases. Our findings have implications for the design of future vaccine trials and the development of personalized vaccination strategies.
