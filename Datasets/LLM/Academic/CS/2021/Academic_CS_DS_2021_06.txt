This study investigates the determinants of banking efficiency within BRICS economies, employing a dynamic panel analysis for the period 2005â€“2020. We posit that the structural characteristics of national banking sectors, specifically the degree of market concentration and the scale of financial institutions, are critical yet under-examined factors influencing operational performance. Furthermore, we integrate macroeconomic development indicators to assess their moderating role in this relationship. Utilizing a stochastic frontier analysis to derive efficiency scores, our regression models test the hypothesis that heightened competition and optimal bank size are positively correlated with efficiency, while controlling for institutional quality and financial market depth. The findings offer critical insights for policymakers aiming to enhance financial stability and credit allocation efficiency in major emerging markets amidst evolving post-pandemic economic landscapes.
