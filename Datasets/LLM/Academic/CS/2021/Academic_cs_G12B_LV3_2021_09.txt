**Abstract**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced a rapidly expanding attack surface, rendering these systems increasingly vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. This paper examines the escalating threat landscape of DoS/DDoS attacks targeting IoT ecosystems, analyzing common attack vectors and the inherent security weaknesses exploited within these deployments. We investigate the vulnerabilities arising from resource-constrained IoT devices, insecure network protocols, and inadequate authentication mechanisms.  The analysis is framed within the context of the layered IoT architecture, identifying critical points of failure at each stratum. Furthermore, we explore a range of mitigation strategies, including intrusion detection systems, rate limiting, traffic filtering, and blockchain-based solutions, evaluating their efficacy in alleviating DoS/DDoS impacts.  Finally, we highlight the need for proactive security measures, emphasizing the importance of secure-by-design principles and ongoing vulnerability assessments to bolster the resilience of IoT infrastructure against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.
