Title: Approximating Pandora's Box under Correlated Distributions: A Unified Framework via Uniform Decision Tree and Min-Sum Set Cover

Abstract:
We investigate the Pandora's Box problem in the context of correlated distributions, a scenario where the costs or values associated with the box's contents are interdependent. By establishing a novel equivalence between Pandora's Box and the Uniform Decision Tree problem, we demonstrate that approximating the former under correlated distributions is reducible to approximating the latter. Furthermore, we reveal a connection between Uniform Decision Tree and the Min-Sum Set Cover problem, thereby unifying these seemingly disparate stochastic optimization problems. Leveraging this unified framework, we derive a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for Pandora's Box under correlated distributions, achieving a guaranteed approximation ratio. Our results contribute to the understanding of stochastic optimization problems with correlated uncertainties and provide a new lens through which to analyze complex decision-making processes under uncertainty. This work advances the state-of-the-art in approximating Pandora's Box, with implications for various applications in operations research and computer science.
