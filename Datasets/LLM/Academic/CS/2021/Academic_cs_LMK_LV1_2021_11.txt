In 2021, a novel trust region-based approach was introduced to tackle the challenging task of weakly supervised semantic segmentation. By leveraging the strengths of low-level solvers and incorporating regularized losses, this method achieves state-of-the-art results. The proposed framework effectively constrains the optimization process within a trust region, ensuring robustness and stability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, underscoring the potential of trust region-based optimization in deep learning-based segmentation tasks. This work advances the field of weakly supervised semantic segmentation, offering a promising direction for future research in this area.
