This paper presents a novel probabilistic attention framework for multimodal learning systems that leverages Gaussian mixture models to enable continuous region selection in visual processing pipelines. Unlike discrete attention mechanisms that operate on predefined grid structures, our method models visual saliency as a continuous probability density over image coordinates, allowing for more precise localization of relevant regions. The proposed architecture integrates visual and textual modalities through a density estimation approach where attention weights are derived from the mixture components' responsibilities. We develop an efficient optimization procedure combining variational inference with gradient-based methods to learn the mixture parameters without requiring explicit region annotations. Experimental validation across multiple visual question answering benchmarks demonstrates that our continuous attention model achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing superior interpretability through spatially-grounded attention maps. The framework's mathematical formulation naturally handles uncertainty in region selection and enables seamless integration with existing deep learning architectures. This work establishes a principled connection between density estimation techniques and attention mechanisms, offering new directions for building more transparent and geometrically-aware vision-language systems.
