**Abstract**

Accurate cell segmentation is a foundational prerequisite for quantitative biological image analysis, yet existing deep learning models, such as Cellpose, are often constrained by specific morphological assumptions, limiting their generalizability. This paper introduces Omnipose, a deep neural network architecture engineered to overcome these limitations by enabling morphology-independent segmentation of bacterial cells. Our model is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by highly curved, elongated, or otherwise irregular cell shapes that confound traditional approaches. We demonstrate that Omnipose achieves superior segmentation accuracy across a diverse range of imaging modalities, including phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Crucially, we extend its capability to the accurate reconstruction of three-dimensional cellular structures from volumetric image data, a significant advancement for studying cell morphology and spatial organization. Benchmarks against contemporary methods confirm that Omnipose sets a new state-of-the-art, providing the research community with a robust and versatile tool that generalizes effectively across bacterial species and experimental conditions.
