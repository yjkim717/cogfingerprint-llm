**Abstract**

Mechanism design, traditionally focused on eliciting optimal strategic behavior from agents, faces significant challenges in complex environments. This work introduces a novel approach leveraging black-box reduction techniques to translate mechanism design problems into equivalent algorithm design formulations. We demonstrate a polynomial-time reduction from incentive-compatible mechanism design to a corresponding algorithmic specification, crucially employing a parameterized ‘Bernoulli factory’ – a modular architecture facilitating the precise control of agent behavior.  Specifically, we achieve exact incentive compatibility within this algorithmic framework.  This represents a fundamental shift, allowing for the application of established algorithmic design methodologies to previously intractable mechanism design scenarios.  The Bayesian algorithm employed within the Bernoulli factory enables robust adaptation to varying agent distributions.  Preliminary results suggest this approach provides a scalable pathway for designing effective incentive structures, opening new avenues for research in areas such as distributed systems and game theory.
