This paper investigates distributed computing systems with non-uniform resource allocation, modeled through nonlocal interaction protocols. We establish existence conditions for stable computational equilibria in heterogeneous network topologies. Using asymptotic analysis of scaling parameters, we characterize how information propagation rates affect system-wide convergence properties. Our theoretical framework provides fundamental limits for emergent behavior in decentralized computing environments, with implications for large-scale parallel processing architectures. Numerical simulations validate the analytical predictions across diverse connectivity regimes.
