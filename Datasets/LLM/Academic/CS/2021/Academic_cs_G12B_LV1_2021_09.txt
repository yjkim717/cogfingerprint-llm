**Abstract: Escalating Denial-of-Service Vulnerabilities in Internet of Things Ecosystems: A Layered Security Analysis**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has engendered a rapidly expanding attack surface, rendering these systems increasingly vulnerable to Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks. This paper investigates the escalating threat landscape posed by DoS/DDoS attacks specifically targeting IoT infrastructure, analyzing inherent security weaknesses across the physical, network, and application layers. We present a comprehensive review of common attack vectors, including botnet recruitment strategies exploiting default credentials, firmware vulnerabilities, and resource exhaustion techniques leveraging constrained device capabilities.  Furthermore, we examine existing and emerging mitigation strategies, evaluating their efficacy in addressing vulnerabilities at each layer.  These countermeasures range from device-level hardening and secure boot practices to network-based traffic filtering and anomaly detection systems leveraging machine learning.  Finally, we identify critical research gaps concerning the scalability and adaptability of security solutions in dynamic IoT deployments, highlighting the need for proactive, layered defenses capable of combating evolving attack methodologies and the increasing sophistication of malicious actors targeting this burgeoning ecosystem.  Future work will explore blockchain-based solutions for device authentication and secure firmware updates.
