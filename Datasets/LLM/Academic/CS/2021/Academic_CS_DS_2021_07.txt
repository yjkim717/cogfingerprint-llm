This paper investigates differentially private algorithms for unsupervised clustering tasks, focusing on correlation clustering under approximate privacy constraints. We establish a novel algorithm achieving sublinear additive error in the average case while maintaining rigorous privacy guarantees. Our analysis demonstrates that this error bound is nearly optimal for the problem structure. Additionally, we prove a linear additive error lower bound for any pure differentially private mechanism, highlighting the fundamental trade-off between privacy preservation and clustering accuracy in the centralized model.
