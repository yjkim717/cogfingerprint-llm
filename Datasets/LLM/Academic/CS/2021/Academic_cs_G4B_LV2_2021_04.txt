**Abstract**

Mechanism design, a cornerstone of game theory, frequently grapples with challenges in achieving robust incentive compatibility and computational tractability. This work introduces a novel polynomial-time reduction from mechanism design to algorithm design, offering a fundamentally different approach to guaranteeing desirable properties. We demonstrate that exact incentive compatibility, a notoriously difficult attainment within mechanism design, can be achieved through the strategic deployment of ‘Bernoulli factories,’ effectively transforming the problem into a tractable algorithmic one. 

Our reduction utilizes a black-box reduction framework, allowing for an algorithmic solution to be constructed directly from the constraints inherent in mechanism design problems.  This represents a significant departure from traditional approaches, circumventing the complexities associated with directly formulating incentive-compatible mechanisms.  The resulting algorithm design paradigm, informed by Bayesian algorithm design principles, provides a concrete pathway toward verifiable incentive compatibility in a computationally accessible manner.  Preliminary results suggest broad applicability, with potential implications for areas such as resource allocation and online auctions (2021).
