This 2021 survey systematically examines the escalating threat landscape of Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. The analysis adopts a structured, layer-based methodology to categorize vulnerabilities inherent across the IoT architectureâ€”from perception and network layers to application and support layers. We critically evaluate how inherent IoT constraints, including resource limitations and heterogeneous communication protocols, are exploited to orchestrate large-scale attacks. Correspondingly, the paper synthesizes a comprehensive taxonomy of prevention and mitigation mechanisms tailored to each architectural stratum. These countermeasures range from lightweight cryptographic authentication and network traffic filtering to advanced anomaly detection systems leveraging machine learning. The survey concludes that effective DDoS mitigation in IoT necessitates a multi-layered, cross-stack defense strategy, highlighting persistent research challenges in scalability and interoperability for future security frameworks.
