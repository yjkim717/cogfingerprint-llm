**Abstract**

The increasing complexity of state estimation and planning in modern robotics necessitates computationally efficient representations of high-dimensional optimization problems. This paper investigates the application of factor graphs, a class of probabilistic graphical models, as a unifying framework for structuring these problems. We posit that by explicitly modeling the sparse connectivity between variables through factors—which encode local constraints, motion models, and sensor measurements—the underlying problem structure is rendered explicit and computationally tractable. We demonstrate that this abstraction not only facilitates rapid prototyping and modular problem design but also enables the direct application of high-performance inference algorithms, such as incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM2). Our empirical evaluation across simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and multi-robot trajectory optimization scenarios shows that the factor graph paradigm consistently yields superior computational performance and enhanced solver convergence compared to monolithic optimization approaches, solidifying its role as a foundational tool for scalable robotic systems.
