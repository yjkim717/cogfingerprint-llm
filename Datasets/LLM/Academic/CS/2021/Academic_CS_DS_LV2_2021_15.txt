The advent of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has precipitated a paradigm shift in natural language processing, moving from fragmented, task-specific architectures toward unified frameworks. This paper analyzes how PLMs have enabled a cohesive approach to diverse NLP tasks, particularly through sequence labeling formulations that generalize across domains such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and semantic role labeling. We argue that this unification not only simplifies model design but also enhances cross-task knowledge transfer and data efficiency. By examining architectural innovations and training methodologies up to 2021, we demonstrate how PLMs reconcile structural disparities between tasks while maintaining competitive performance. The implications for future research include exploring task-agnostic representations and addressing lingering challenges in low-resource and multimodal settings.
