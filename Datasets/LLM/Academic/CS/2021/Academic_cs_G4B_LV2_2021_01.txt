**Abstract**

Recent advancements in generative modeling have demonstrated significant potential for scene understanding and synthesis. However, generating visually compelling and semantically consistent scenes conditioned on complex human pose remains a challenging problem. This paper presents a novel approach, termed Pose-Conditioned Scene Generation (PCSG), designed to address this limitation. PCSG leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, meticulously trained on a newly curated *meta-dataset* comprising diverse human poses and corresponding scene layouts. 

Crucially, the model incorporates explicit *pose conditioning* via a learned latent space, enabling fine-grained control over the generated scenes’ spatial arrangement relative to the input pose. We demonstrate that this targeted conditioning significantly mitigates the prevalent issue of *pose hallucination*, where generated scenes exhibit inconsistencies with the provided pose data.  Experimental results, evaluated using established metrics for image quality and pose alignment, reveal substantial improvements over existing methods.  Specifically, PCSG exhibits enhanced diversity and fidelity compared to baseline approaches, showcasing its capacity to produce realistic and contextually appropriate scenes.  Future work will explore incorporating semantic information and expanding the meta-dataset to further bolster the model’s robustness and creative potential, particularly within the broader domain of *scene generation*.
