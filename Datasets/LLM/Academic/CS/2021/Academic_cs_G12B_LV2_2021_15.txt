Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a CS conference or journal, based on your provided summary and targeting a 2021 context. I've aimed for precision, structured reasoning, and appropriate terminology.  I've also included a few potential avenues for expansion that a full paper would explore.

**Abstract**

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone a significant paradigm shift in recent years, largely driven by the emergence and widespread adoption of pre-trained language models (PLMs). This paper examines this transformative trend, analyzing how the reformulation of traditional NLP tasks through fine-tuning and adaptation of PLMs has yielded substantial performance gains across a diverse range of applications. We argue that this shift represents a departure from task-specific architectures and feature engineering, towards a more unified approach leveraging the general linguistic knowledge encoded within these models.  Specifically, we explore the impact of PLMs on tasks including, but not limited to, text classification, question answering, and natural language generation.  Further, we discuss the implications of this paradigm shift for resource-constrained languages and the potential for developing more robust and generalizable NLP systems. Finally, we briefly address current limitations, such as the computational cost of PLMs and the challenges associated with interpretability and bias mitigation, highlighting areas for future research within this rapidly evolving landscape.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Expansion:**

*   **Year Context:** The language used ("recent years," "in 2021") subtly acknowledges the timeframe.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a logical flow: introduction of the shift, explanation of the mechanism (fine-tuning), examples of impact, discussion of implications, and a brief mention of limitations/future work.
*   **Precise Terminology:**  Terms like "paradigm shift," "pre-trained language models," "fine-tuning," "task-specific architectures," and "generalizable NLP systems" are used accurately.
*   **Potential Expansion (for a full paper):** The abstract hints at areas a full paper would delve into: specific PLM architectures (BERT, GPT-3, etc.), quantitative results demonstrating performance improvements, a more detailed discussion of bias and interpretability challenges, and exploration of few-shot learning techniques.
