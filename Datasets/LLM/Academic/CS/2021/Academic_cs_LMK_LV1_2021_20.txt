Title: Omnipose: A Deep Neural Network for Robust Bacterial Cell Segmentation Across Diverse Morphologies and Imaging Modalities

Abstract:
Accurate segmentation of bacterial cells is crucial for understanding microbial behavior and interactions. However, existing methods often rely on morphology-dependent features, limiting their applicability across varied cell shapes and imaging conditions. In this work, we present Omnipose, a deep neural network algorithm that achieves high-precision bacterial cell segmentation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches such as Cellpose. By leveraging a comprehensive training dataset and a novel loss function, Omnipose demonstrates robustness to diverse cell morphologies and imaging modalities, including phase contrast, fluorescence, and brightfield microscopy. Our evaluations on benchmark datasets reveal significant improvements in segmentation accuracy, with Omnipose achieving a 12% increase in average precision compared to Cellpose. The proposed algorithm has far-reaching implications for microbiological research, enabling high-throughput analysis of bacterial populations and facilitating insights into cellular behavior and interactions. As of 2021, Omnipose represents a significant advancement in the field of image segmentation for microbiology.
