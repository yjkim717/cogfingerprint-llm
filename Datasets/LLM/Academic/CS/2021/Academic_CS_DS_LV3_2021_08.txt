Abstract: In the domain of robotics, the formulation and resolution of complex optimization problems are central to achieving robust performance in estimation, planning, and control. This paper investigates the application of factor graphs, a class of probabilistic graphical models, as a unifying framework for structuring these problems. By representing a system as a bipartite graph of variables and factors—where factors encode local constraints, objectives, or measurement models—we demonstrate a systematic methodology for problem specification. This structured representation not only enhances model interpretability but also facilitates the exploitation of sparsity inherent in many robotic systems. We analyze how this sparsity, when leveraged by inference algorithms such as Gauss-Newton or variable elimination, yields substantial gains in computational performance, enabling real-time solutions for large-scale state estimation and trajectory optimization. Through case studies in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and motion planning, we validate that the factor graph paradigm streamlines both algorithm design and implementation, contributing to more efficient and scalable robotic systems. Our findings, contextualized in 2021, underscore the growing significance of graphical models as a foundational tool for advancing computational robotics.
