Title: Rethinking Algorithmic Fairness: A Causal Perspective on Inequality and Power Distribution

Abstract:
Traditional notions of algorithmic fairness have been criticized for their narrow focus on individual-level parity, neglecting the broader socio-economic context in which algorithms operate. This paper challenges the status quo by introducing a causal inference framework that reconceptualizes algorithmic fairness in terms of inequality and power distribution. We argue that fairness should be evaluated not only by statistical parity metrics, but also by the distributional consequences of algorithmic decisions on marginalized groups. By applying causal graph theory, we identify the structural drivers of inequality perpetuated by algorithmic decision-making systems. Our analysis reveals that fairness is not solely a matter of eliminating bias, but also of understanding the complex interplay between algorithmic decisions, social context, and power dynamics. This reframing offers a more nuanced understanding of algorithmic fairness, enabling the development of more equitable decision-making systems in 2021 and beyond.
