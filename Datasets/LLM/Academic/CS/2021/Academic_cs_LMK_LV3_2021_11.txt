This paper presents a novel trust region framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation, leveraging regularized losses to enhance deep learning models. By integrating robust trust region methods with state-of-the-art low-level solvers, our approach achieves significant improvements over existing techniques. The proposed framework enables the effective utilization of regularization techniques, resulting in enhanced segmentation accuracy. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 2021. The proposed trust region approach has far-reaching implications for weakly supervised segmentation tasks, advancing the field of computer vision.
