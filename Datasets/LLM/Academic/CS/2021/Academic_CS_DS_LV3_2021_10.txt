This paper establishes sharp distortion bounds for intrinsic metrics under conformal and quasiregular mappings in the unit ball, addressing a fundamental problem in geometric function theory with implications for computational conformal geometry. We prove refined inequalities between the hyperbolic metric and triangular ratio metric, demonstrating optimal control over metric distortion that previous Schwarz lemma variants could not achieve. Our main contribution is a unified framework quantifying how quasiregular mappings—generalizing conformal mappings to higher dimensions—preserve geometric structures while admitting controlled distortion. These results, proven through innovative potential-theoretic methods, provide the theoretical foundation for enhanced algorithms in shape analysis and mesh generation. The developed techniques offer new tools for analyzing metric spaces in complex domains, with particular relevance to computer graphics and geometric processing applications where precise metric preservation is computationally advantageous.
