**Abstract:**

The integration of probabilistic reasoning into robotic systems has driven considerable research into efficient computational frameworks. This work investigates the application of factor graphs as a versatile modeling paradigm and optimization strategy for a range of robotic tasks. Factor graphs, representing relationships between variables through factors, offer a structured approach to encoding complex dependencies inherent in estimation, planning, and optimal control problems. We demonstrate how this graphical representation facilitates the decomposition of large, intractable optimization problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems, enabling scalable inference and improved solution quality. Furthermore, we explore the compatibility of factor graphs with various inference algorithms, including message passing and variational methods, highlighting their practical utility in real-time robotic applications. This study contributes to the broader field by providing a rigorous analysis of factor graph methodologies and their potential for advancing robotic autonomy in dynamic environments.
