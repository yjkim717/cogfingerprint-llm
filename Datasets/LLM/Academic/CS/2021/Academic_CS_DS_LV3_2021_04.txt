This paper presents a novel computational framework that establishes a polynomial-time reduction from Bayesian incentive compatible mechanism design to Bayesian algorithm design for multi-dimensional continuous type spaces. Our approach fundamentally addresses the computational barriers that have historically prevented exact incentive compatibility in complex mechanism design settings. By leveraging Bernoulli factories as a core technical component, we develop black-box reductions that transform arbitrary sampling algorithms into precisely incentive-compatible mechanisms without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying distributional properties.

Our methodology enables the construction of mechanisms where truth-telling constitutes an exact Bayesian Nash equilibrium, overcoming the approximation limitations inherent in prior work. The reduction maintains computational efficiency while preserving the original algorithm's performance guarantees, creating a versatile bridge between algorithmic and economic objectives. This work significantly expands the feasible design space for multi-parameter mechanisms and provides new tools for automated mechanism generation. The theoretical framework demonstrates broad applicability across auction design, social choice, and resource allocation domains, establishing a foundational connection between computational tractability and economic incentives in complex environments.
