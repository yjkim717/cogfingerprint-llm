## Robust Trust Region Optimization for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Regularized Losses

Weakly supervised semantic segmentation aims to learn pixel-level classifications from limited annotation data, typically image-level labels. A critical challenge lies in optimizing the segmentation network given the inherent ambiguity and noise introduced by weak supervision. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel trust region optimization strategy within a regularized loss framework. We hypothesize that constraining the optimization updates within a dynamically adjusted trust region promotes more stable convergence and mitigates the impact of noisy gradients arising from inaccurate pseudo-labels. Our approach leverages geometric priors, specifically shape constraints derived from the image content, to further refine the regularization terms. Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that our method consistently outperforms existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation techniques, achieving improved segmentation accuracy and robustness. Specifically, we observe significant gains when utilizing a trust region with adaptive radius, showcasing the efficacy of our proposed strategy for navigating the complex optimization landscape inherent in weakly supervised learning. The findings suggest a promising direction for future research in weakly supervised segmentation, prioritizing stability and geometric awareness.
