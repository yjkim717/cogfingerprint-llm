**Abstract:**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has concurrently expanded the attack surface available to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. This paper investigates the escalating threat landscape surrounding IoT security, specifically examining the vulnerabilities exploited in these attacks.  Analysis reveals that the resource constraints and inherent heterogeneity of IoT devices—often lacking robust security mechanisms—render them particularly susceptible.  We categorize observed attack vectors and quantify their impact on device availability and network performance.  Furthermore, this study proposes a layered security architecture incorporating intrusion detection systems, device authentication protocols, and rate limiting techniques as viable countermeasures.  Preliminary simulations demonstrate the efficacy of these combined approaches in mitigating DDoS and DoS attacks, suggesting a critical need for proactive defense strategies within the burgeoning IoT ecosystem by 2021.
