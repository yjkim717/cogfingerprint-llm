**Abstract**

Correlation clustering, a foundational unsupervised learning problem, aims to identify clusters within a graph of pairwise correlations. This paper addresses the challenge of performing correlation clustering while simultaneously guaranteeing differential privacy, a rigorous privacy model protecting against membership inference attacks. We present a novel algorithm achieving a subquadratic runtime complexity while providing Îµ-differentially private solutions. Our approach leverages techniques for controlled perturbation within the correlation matrix, bounding the additive error introduced by the privacy mechanism. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical lower bound on the achievable error for pure differentially private correlation clustering, demonstrating the inherent trade-off between privacy and solution quality. This result highlights the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing for accuracy and privacy in this setting. The proposed algorithm and accompanying lower bound contribute to a deeper understanding of privacy-preserving unsupervised learning and provide a benchmark for future research in this area.
