**Abstract**

Axiomatic agnostic learning, a framework prioritizing model transparency and interpretability, presents significant challenges in achieving optimal predictive performance, particularly under Gaussian distributions. This work investigates the optimality of polynomial regression within this paradigm, leveraging techniques from LP duality and sparse regression. We demonstrate that polynomial regression, specifically utilizing L1-regularization, provides a provably optimal solution for estimating the underlying true function when the data is generated from a Gaussian prior.  

Central to our analysis is the reformulation of the agnostic learning problem as a constrained optimization, facilitating the application of LP duality.  Furthermore, we establish novel lower bounds on the achievable prediction error, quantifying the inherent limitations imposed by the agnostic constraints.  These bounds are rigorously derived, highlighting the trade-off between model complexity and predictive accuracy.  The results underscore the effectiveness of leveraging Gaussian marginals and sparse polynomial representations to achieve optimal agnostic learning outcomes, representing a key advancement in the fieldâ€™s theoretical understanding.
