**Differentially Private Correlation Clustering with Subquadratic Error and Privacy-Utility Trade-off Analysis**

Correlation clustering, a fundamental unsupervised learning task, aims to identify latent cluster structures based on pairwise correlation observations. However, applying this technique in sensitive datasets raises critical privacy concerns. This paper presents a novel algorithm for correlation clustering that provides strong, pure differential privacy guarantees while achieving a subquadratic runtime complexity. Our approach leverages an additive error mechanism within a modified iterative refinement process, allowing for controlled information leakage while preserving data utility. We demonstrate that achieving optimal clustering accuracy under strict differential privacy constraints is inherently challenging. Specifically, we establish a lower bound on the expected clustering error for any purely differentially private solution, highlighting the fundamental trade-off between privacy and accuracy. Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets showcases the efficacy of our algorithm, demonstrating a significant improvement in clustering quality compared to existing differentially private correlation clustering methods, while rigorously maintaining the specified privacy level.  This work contributes a practical and theoretically grounded solution for privacy-preserving correlation clustering, advancing the field of secure unsupervised machine learning.
