**Abstract**

This study investigates the application of advanced computational models to analyze the operational efficiency of financial institutions within the BRICS economic bloc. Leveraging a longitudinal dataset spanning 2000-2015, we employ ensemble machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting and Random Forests, to quantify the non-linear relationships between bank efficiency and key predictors: market competition, institutional size, and macroeconomic development indicators. Our methodology addresses limitations of traditional econometric models by effectively capturing complex, high-dimensional interactions within the data. The analysis reveals that technological adoption and digital infrastructure, salient features of the modern banking landscape, act as critical moderating variables. Findings indicate that while scale remains a significant factor, competitive intensity in digitally maturing markets exerts a pronounced, U-shaped influence on efficiency. This research provides a data-driven framework for policymakers and financial analysts to optimize banking sector performance in emerging economies, with particular relevance to the post-2020 digital acceleration.
