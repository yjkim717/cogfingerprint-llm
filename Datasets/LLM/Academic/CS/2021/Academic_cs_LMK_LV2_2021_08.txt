Title: Factor Graphs in Robotics: A Paradigm for Efficient Estimation and Optimization

Abstract:
In recent years, factor graphs have emerged as a powerful graphical model for representing and solving complex estimation and optimization problems in robotics. By encoding probabilistic relationships between variables as a bipartite graph, factor graphs enable efficient inference and optimization algorithms. In the context of robotics, this framework has been successfully applied to various tasks, including simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), motion planning, and sensor fusion. The benefits of factor graphs in robotics are multifaceted, including improved modeling flexibility, enhanced computational performance, and facilitated integration of heterogeneous sensor data. This paper reviews the theoretical foundations of factor graphs and their applications in robotics, highlighting successful case studies and discussing future research directions. By leveraging the expressive power of factor graphs, researchers can develop more accurate and efficient solutions to challenging robotics problems. (2021)
