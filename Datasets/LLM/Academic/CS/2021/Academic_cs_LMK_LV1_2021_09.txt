Abstract:

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has introduced significant security concerns, particularly with regards to Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. As IoT devices become increasingly interconnected, their vulnerability to such attacks poses a substantial threat to the stability of the global network infrastructure. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on DoS/DDoS attacks targeting IoT devices, examining the various attack vectors and mitigation strategies employed to counter these threats. We analyze the unique security challenges posed by IoT devices, including their limited computational resources and lack of robust security protocols. Furthermore, we discuss the efficacy of existing countermeasures, such as traffic filtering and rate limiting, and explore emerging solutions, including artificial intelligence-powered detection systems. By synthesizing the current state of knowledge on IoT-based DoS/DDoS attacks, this review aims to inform the development of more effective security measures to safeguard IoT ecosystems in 2021 and beyond.
