Okay, here's an academic-style abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, aiming for precision, formality, and a 2021 context.  I've focused on expanding on the "morphology-independent" aspect and highlighting the potential impact.  I've also included a brief mention of potential future directions.

**Omnipose: Morphology-Independent Bacterial Cell Segmentation via Deep Neural Networks**

Accurate and robust bacterial cell segmentation is a critical prerequisite for quantitative microbial research, underpinning analyses of cell morphology, population dynamics, and responses to environmental stimuli. However, existing image segmentation methods often struggle with the inherent morphological diversity of bacterial cells and the variability introduced by different imaging modalities (e.g., brightfield, fluorescence microscopy). This paper introduces Omnipose, a novel deep learning-based algorithm designed to address these limitations. Omnipose leverages a convolutional neural network architecture trained on a large, diverse dataset of bacterial cell images acquired under varying conditions.  A key innovation is the algorithm’s design to achieve *morphology-independence*, meaning it performs consistently well regardless of cell shape, size, or staining characteristics.  Experimental results, evaluated on multiple bacterial species and imaging datasets, demonstrate that Omnipose significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including Cellpose, in terms of segmentation accuracy and robustness, as measured by metrics such as Dice coefficient and Boundary F1-score. Furthermore, we show that Omnipose’s efficient inference speed allows for high-throughput analysis of large microscopy datasets.  The release of Omnipose as an open-source tool aims to facilitate reproducible research and accelerate the automation of bacterial cell analysis. Future work will focus on extending Omnipose's capabilities to handle 3D image data and incorporating contextual information for improved segmentation accuracy in complex microbial communities.
