>Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a CS conference or journal, based on the provided keywords and summary, and reflecting a 2021 context. I've aimed for precision, structure, and a reasonable word count (around 171 words).  I've also included some potential avenues for expansion that a full paper would likely address.

**Abstract:**

The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has created an exponentially expanding attack surface, rendering these systems increasingly vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current threat landscape concerning DoS/DDoS attacks specifically targeting IoT deployments. We analyze prevalent attack vectors, including botnet recruitment methodologies exploiting inherent device vulnerabilities, amplification attacks leveraging IoT protocol weaknesses (e.g., MQTT, CoAP), and resource exhaustion strategies exploiting limited processing power and memory.  Furthermore, we examine the unique security challenges posed by the heterogeneity of IoT devices, their often-constrained computational resources, and the prevalence of insecure configurations.  The review evaluates existing and emerging countermeasures, encompassing network-level mitigation techniques (e.g., traffic filtering, rate limiting), device-level hardening strategies (e.g., secure boot, firmware updates), and blockchain-based solutions for enhanced device authentication and integrity. Finally, we identify critical research gaps, including the need for adaptive and AI-driven mitigation approaches capable of responding to the evolving sophistication of IoT-based DDoS attacks, and explore potential directions for future research in this critical area.
