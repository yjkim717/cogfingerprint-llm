**Trust Region Regularization for Robust Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation**

Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to learn pixel-level classifications from limited annotation, typically image-level labels. While recent advances utilizing regularized losses have demonstrated promise, they often suffer from optimization instability and sensitivity to hyperparameter tuning, particularly when dealing with noisy or sparse weak supervision. This paper proposes a novel Trust Region Regularization (TRR) framework to mitigate these challenges. TRR dynamically constrains the update steps of the network during optimization, ensuring that changes to the segmentation map remain within a predefined “trust region” around the current estimate.  We introduce a geometric prior-informed regularization term that biases the learning process towards plausible segmentation boundaries, further enhancing robustness.  Empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC, Cityscapes) demonstrates that TRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods, exhibiting improved convergence speed and superior segmentation accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both the trust region constraint and the geometric prior.  Our results highlight the potential of TRR as a practical and effective strategy for improving the reliability and performance of weakly-supervised semantic segmentation systems.
