**Abstract**

The rapid deployment of mRNA-based vaccines, specifically BNT162b2, represented a pivotal strategy in mitigating the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.  This study investigated the durability of neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses following six months of vaccination in a cohort of healthy adult participants, aiming to characterize the long-term humoral immunity elicited. Analysis revealed a sustained, albeit declining, NAb titer profile, indicative of a waning immune response over time.  Notably, a discernible age-related attenuation of NAb responses was observed, suggesting a potential differential immunological outcome across various demographic groups.

Specifically, we quantified NAb titers against key SARS-CoV-2 variants using a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT).  Findings demonstrate a significant reduction in NAb levels compared to pre-vaccination baseline measurements.  These results align with observed trends in broader vaccine efficacy data and highlight the necessity for booster strategies to maintain protective immunity.  Further investigation is warranted to delineate the specific immunological mechanisms driving this decline, including evaluating the impact of factors such as pre-existing immunity and individual genetic variability.  Understanding these dynamics is crucial for optimizing vaccination schedules and predicting the long-term effectiveness of BNT162b2 and related vaccine platforms against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.
