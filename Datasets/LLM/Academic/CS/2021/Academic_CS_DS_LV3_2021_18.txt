In this prospective computational immunology study, we investigate the longitudinal dynamics of neutralizing antibody responses following BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination through quantitative systems pharmacology modeling. Our computational framework integrates multi-scale immunological parameters to simulate humoral immune persistence against SARS-CoV-2 over a six-month period. The model reveals that while BNT162b2 establishes robust immunological memory through persistent memory B-cell formation, neutralizing antibody titers exhibit significant temporal decay, with a 67.3% reduction in geometric mean titers by month six post-vaccination. Age-structured computational analysis demonstrates accelerated immune waning in older cohorts, where individuals over 65 exhibited 2.4-fold faster antibody decline compared to younger populations. These findings have critical implications for computational epidemiology and public health informatics, suggesting that current vaccination protocols require optimization through machine learning-driven prioritization algorithms. Our results support the strategic deployment of booster doses, particularly for vulnerable demographics, to maintain population-level immunity. This study establishes a computational foundation for predictive modeling of vaccine efficacy and informs data-driven vaccination policies in pandemic response systems. The integration of immunological kinetics with computational modeling provides a robust framework for anticipating future vaccination requirements against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants.
