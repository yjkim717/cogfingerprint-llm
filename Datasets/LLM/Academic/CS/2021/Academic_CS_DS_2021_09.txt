This paper investigates distortion bounds for intrinsic distance functions under conformal and quasiconformal mappings between planar domains. We establish new quantitative relationships between the hyperbolic metric and the triangular ratio metric in multiply connected regions, extending classical Schwarz-Pick lemmas to more general geometric configurations. Our analysis reveals how metric distortion correlates with domain connectivity and boundary regularity, providing sharper constants than previously known results. For quasiregular mappings, we demonstrate how the analytic distortion coefficient governs the maximal contraction of intrinsic metrics, with applications to geometric function theory and computational conformal geometry. These findings yield improved estimates for modulus preservation and boundary behavior, contributing to the theoretical foundation for surface mapping algorithms in computer graphics and geometric processing.
