**A Computational Framework for Modeling the Longitudinal Waning of Humoral Immunity Post-Vaccination**

**Abstract:** The durability of vaccine-induced immunity is a critical determinant of public health strategy. While clinical studies track biological markers like neutralizing antibodies, a robust computational model to simulate their temporal decay and predict population-level immunity thresholds is lacking. This paper introduces a novel, data-driven simulation framework to model the waning of humoral immune response following a two-dose BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination regimen. Our model, calibrated with empirical serological data, formalizes the observed phenomenon of persistent but quantitatively declining neutralizing antibody titers over a six-month post-vaccination period. A key innovation is the explicit parameterization of demographic covariates, which reveals a statistically significant, non-linear acceleration in the rate of antibody decline correlated with increasing age. This is implemented via an age-dependent decay coefficient within our differential equation-based system. The simulation outputs enable the projection of sub-population susceptibility timelines and provide a quantitative basis for optimizing booster shot deployment schedules. By framing a biological process as a computational prediction problem, this work provides a critical tool for policymakers. It demonstrates how in-silico models can augment clinical trials to forecast immunity gaps, thereby informing strategic, pre-emptive public health interventions in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic response.
