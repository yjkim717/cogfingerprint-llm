In 2021, the integration of factor graphs in robotics has revolutionized the field by leveraging the inherent locality structure of optimization problems. By representing complex estimation problems as graphical models, factor graphs facilitate efficient computation and enhance modeling capabilities. This paradigm enables robots to effectively solve simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and other estimation problems, thereby improving their autonomy and adaptability. By exploiting the sparsity of factor graphs, researchers can develop scalable and robust optimization algorithms, driving advancements in robotics and related fields. This synergy has far-reaching implications for intelligent systems.
