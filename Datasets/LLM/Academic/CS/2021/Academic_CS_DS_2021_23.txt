Abstract

This research presents a novel computational framework for forensic intelligence by applying association rule mining to open-source terrorism data. Focusing on Nigeria as a case study, the methodology employs the Apriori algorithm to systematically analyze a large-scale, open-source terrorism event database to uncover latent patterns and frequent itemsets within terrorist operations. The objective is to identify statistically significant co-occurrences among attack attributes—such as weapon types, target categories, perpetrator groups, and temporal-spatial factors—that may elude manual investigation. Conducted in a 2021 context, this study addresses the growing need for data-driven forensic tools to support counter-terrorism analysis. The findings demonstrate how computational methods can reveal complex relational structures in terrorist behavior, offering actionable intelligence for investigative prioritization and threat assessment. This approach underscores the potential of algorithmic forensic science to augment traditional investigative techniques, providing a scalable and systematic means of interpreting complex security datasets in Nigeria and other conflict-affected regions.
