This paper investigates the theoretical foundations of generalization in overparameterized deep learning models, challenging classical statistical learning frameworks. We demonstrate that modern neural architectures achieve near-zero training error even on completely randomized labels, suggesting that conventional capacity measures fail to explain their generalization performance. Through extensive experiments with stochastic optimization methods, we establish that implicit regularization induced by gradient-based training algorithms plays a crucial role in determining which solutions are selected from the vast hypothesis space. Our analysis reveals that the interaction between network architecture, optimization dynamics, and data structure creates an inductive bias toward simpler functions, even when the model possesses sufficient expressivity to memorize noise. These findings necessitate a paradigm shift in generalization theory, moving beyond traditional uniform convergence arguments toward understanding the algorithmic regularization properties of deep learning. We propose new metrics for quantifying this implicit bias and discuss implications for model selection and architecture design in practical applications.
