**Abstract**

This paper introduces a novel framework for analyzing the stability of learned representations in deep generative models by leveraging concepts from geometric function theory. We model the latent space geometry using data-dependent intrinsic metrics, analogous to the hyperbolic metric, and investigate their distortion under the generator's mapping to the data manifold. By formulating the generator as a quasiregular mapping, we establish new, tighter inequalities bounding the contraction and expansion of semantic neighborhoods. Our primary theoretical contribution is a computational Schwarz lemma, which provides a data-driven guarantee on the Lipschitz constant of the generator, ensuring that interpolations in the latent space yield semantically smooth transitions in the output. This result directly enhances the robustness and interpretability of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), addressing critical challenges in controllable synthesis and adversarial vulnerability prevalent in 2021. We validate our theoretical bounds with experiments on image and graph datasets, demonstrating improved control over sample fidelity and diversity.
