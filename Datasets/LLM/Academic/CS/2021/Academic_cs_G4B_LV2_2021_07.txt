**Abstract**

Correlation clustering techniques offer a powerful approach to unsupervised learning, revealing latent relationships within datasets. However, traditional implementations often struggle with scalability and maintain privacy guarantees. This work presents a novel differentially private correlation clustering algorithm designed to mitigate these challenges. Leveraging recent advances in subquadratic error estimation, our method achieves improved clustering accuracy compared to existing approaches while rigorously preserving differential privacy. Specifically, we introduce a modified correlation estimation framework incorporating noise injection tailored to the specific clustering objective.  Experimental results, presented in 2021, demonstrate that our algorithm successfully balances accuracy and privacy, achieving subquadratic error rates on benchmark datasets under stringent privacy budgets.  This represents a significant step toward practical, privacy-preserving unsupervised learning, enabling the analysis of sensitive data without compromising individual user privacy.
