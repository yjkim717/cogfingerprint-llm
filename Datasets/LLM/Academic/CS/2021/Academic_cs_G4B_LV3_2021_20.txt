**Abstract**

Accurate bacterial cell segmentation remains a critical challenge in computational microbiology, necessitating methods robust to variations in cell morphology and imaging conditions. Existing approaches frequently demonstrate limitations in achieving consistently high precision. This paper introduces Omnipose, a novel deep neural network architecture specifically designed to address these deficiencies. Omnipose employs a morphology-independent segmentation strategy, leveraging [mention specific network architecture detail – e.g., a convolutional encoder-decoder framework] to extract salient features irrespective of cell shape. Preliminary results, presented in 2021, demonstrate Omnipose’s superior performance compared to established image segmentation techniques across diverse datasets obtained via fluorescence microscopy and phase contrast imaging.  Further investigation will focus on integrating Omnipose into automated bacterial identification pipelines, contributing to improved diagnostic accuracy and research capabilities.
