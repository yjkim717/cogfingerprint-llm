**Abstract**

Recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks have highlighted vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, necessitating robust defense mechanisms. This work introduces a novel approach leveraging the Cayley transform to directly parameterize orthogonal convolutional layers, offering a pathway to enhanced network stability and certified defenses. Utilizing the Cayley transform’s inherent geometric properties, we achieve precise control over layer orthogonality, directly influencing the Lipschitz constant and consequently, the network’s sensitivity to input perturbations.  Experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement in adversarial robustness against white-box attacks, exceeding the performance of conventional regularization techniques.  Specifically, we observe a notable increase in certified defense radii, indicating a strengthened guarantee against adversarial manipulation.  This parameterized orthogonality facilitates a more principled and scalable design for robust convolutional architectures, representing a significant step toward reliable and secure deep learning systems in 2021.
