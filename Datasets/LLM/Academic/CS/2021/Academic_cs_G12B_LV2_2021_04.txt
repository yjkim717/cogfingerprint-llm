## A Polynomial-Time Reduction from Bayesian Mechanism Design to Algorithm Design with Exact Incentive Compatibility

**Abstract:** This paper addresses the computationally challenging problem of Bayesian mechanism design, specifically focusing on achieving incentive compatibility (IC) when dealing with continuous type spaces. Existing approaches often rely on complex, non-polynomial time algorithms or sacrifice strong IC guarantees. We introduce a novel framework leveraging *Bernoulli factories* – parameterized distributions over binary outcomes – to bridge the gap between Bayesian mechanism design and algorithm design. Our core contribution is a polynomial-time reduction that transforms an arbitrary Bayesian mechanism design problem with continuous types into an equivalent algorithm design problem.

Crucially, this reduction demonstrates *exact* incentive compatibility.  The resulting algorithm, when appropriately parameterized, guarantees that no agent has an incentive to misreport their private information, even with continuous type spaces.  The reduction relies on a black-box approach, meaning the underlying mechanism design problem is treated as a "black box" from which we extract requirements for the equivalent algorithm.  This allows for flexibility in the mechanism design setting while maintaining computational tractability.  We formally characterize the conditions under which this reduction holds and provide a detailed analysis of the resulting algorithm’s complexity. The implication of this work is a significant advancement in the practical applicability of Bayesian mechanism design, enabling the design of incentive-compatible systems for continuous type spaces in polynomial time.
