This paper introduces a novel framework for pose-conditioned scene generation, addressing the challenge of synthesizing photorealistic and semantically compatible environments from input human poses. Leveraging a StyleGAN2-based architecture, our model incorporates pose cues as structural priors to guide the generative process, ensuring spatial coherence between human figures and their surroundings. We propose a large-scale adversarial training strategy that learns rich scene distributions from diverse pose-scene pairs, enabling the synthesis of contextually appropriate backgrounds without manual layout specifications. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baseline models in both quantitative metrics and human perceptual studies. The generated scenes exhibit enhanced diversity and realism while maintaining strict pose-scene compatibility. This work establishes new capabilities for dynamic scene synthesis in applications ranging from virtual reality to automated content creation, advancing the state of pose-aware generative modeling.
