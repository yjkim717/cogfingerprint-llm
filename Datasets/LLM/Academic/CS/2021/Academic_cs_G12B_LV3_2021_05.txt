**Abstract:** Contemporary algorithmic fairness research frequently operationalizes fairness through notions of 'merit,' inadvertently reinforcing existing societal inequalities. This paper argues that such frameworks fail to adequately account for underlying power dynamics and causal structures that generate disparate outcomes. We propose a shift towards fairness definitions grounded in the analysis of inequality distributions and power structures, leveraging causal inference techniques and insights from empirical economics. This approach facilitates a more nuanced algorithmic auditing process, moving beyond superficial parity metrics to assess and potentially mitigate the perpetuation of systemic disadvantage embedded within algorithmic systems.
