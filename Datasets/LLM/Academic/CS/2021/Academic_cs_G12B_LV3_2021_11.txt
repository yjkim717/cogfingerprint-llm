**Abstract**

Weakly supervised semantic segmentation presents a significant challenge due to the limited availability of pixel-level annotations. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel trust region optimization framework for training semantic segmentation networks with complex, regularized losses. Our approach leverages geometric priors to constrain the solution space, promoting spatially coherent segmentations and mitigating the instability often encountered when employing strong regularizers.  We propose a higher-order generalization of the chain rule within a trust region, enabling the effective use of sophisticated regularizers previously intractable under weak supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets. This work advances the field by facilitating the integration of advanced regularization techniques in weakly supervised learning, thereby improving the quality and robustness of semantic segmentation models.
