**Abstract**

This work investigates agnostic learning for polynomial regression functions sampled from Gaussian distributions, presenting novel theoretical results concerning the optimality of L1-regularized regression and establishing information-theoretic lower bounds. We leverage the duality framework inherent in linear programming to characterize the generalization performance of agnostic learners. Specifically, we demonstrate that L1-regularized polynomial regression achieves the minimax optimal rate under Gaussian noise, confirming its theoretical justification in this setting. Furthermore, we derive tight sample complexity lower bounds for a broad class of polynomial regression functions, proving that achieving arbitrarily accurate learning requires a quadratic dependence on the degree of the polynomials. Our results are established through a combination of techniques, including novel applications of LP duality theory and concentration inequalities. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of agnostic learning in high-dimensional settings and provide a rigorous foundation for the design and analysis of robust regression algorithms. The lower bounds presented offer a benchmark against which future algorithms can be evaluated.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Tone:** The language is formal, avoiding colloquialisms and using precise terminology (e.g., "information-theoretic lower bounds," "minimax optimal rate," "sample complexity").
*   **Structured Argument:** The abstract follows a logical flow: (1) Problem statement, (2) Key Result 1 (optimality), (3) Key Result 2 (lower bound), (4) Methodology, (5) Contribution/Significance.
*   **Keywords Incorporation:** The keywords were naturally woven into the text where appropriate.
*   **Year Context (2021):** While the abstract doesn't explicitly state the year, the language and focus on high-dimensional learning align with trends in machine learning research prevalent around 2021.
*   **Specificity:** I added specificity where possible (e.g., "quadratic dependence on the degree of the polynomials") to make the abstract more informative.
*   **LP Duality Emphasis:** The prompt mentioned LP duality, which is a technically significant aspect, so I highlighted its role in the methodology.
*   **Word Count:** The abstract falls within the requested range of ~176 words.
* **Agnostic Learning:** The term "agnostic learning" is a key concept, so I made sure it was central to the description of the study.
