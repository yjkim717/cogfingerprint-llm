**Abstract**

This work addresses the fundamental challenges in agnostic learning within the context of Gaussian distributions, presenting a novel theoretical analysis of computational complexity. Utilizing the framework of Gaussian marginals and polynomial regression, we demonstrate the inherent optimality of polynomial regression models for achieving agnostic representation learning. Specifically, we establish tight bounds on the sample complexity required for accurate concept representation, contingent upon the chosen polynomial degree.  Crucially, we derive significant lower bounds on the number of samples needed to learn various functions and threshold functions agnostically, leveraging techniques from LP duality. These lower bounds provide a rigorous constraint on the achievable performance, informing the design of more efficient agnostic learning algorithms. Our findings suggest that polynomial regression, despite its apparent simplicity, offers a surprisingly powerful and fundamentally optimal approach.  The results, presented in 2021, contribute substantially to the theoretical understanding of agnostic learning and offer valuable insights for practitioners seeking to develop robust and scalable machine learning systems capable of generalizing across diverse distributions.
