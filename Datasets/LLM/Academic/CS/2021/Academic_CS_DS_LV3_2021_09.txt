In the rapidly expanding domain of the Internet of Things (IoT), the proliferation of interconnected devices has introduced unprecedented security vulnerabilities, with Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks representing a critical threat vector. This 2021 survey systematically analyzes the architectural weaknesses inherent in IoT ecosystems that render them susceptible to such debilitating attacks. By adopting a layered structure framework—encompassing perceptual, network, and application layers—this investigation delineates the specific attack surfaces and methodologies employed by malicious actors at each level. Consequently, the study proposes a corresponding taxonomy of proactive and reactive countermeasures, including protocol hardening, traffic anomaly detection, and dynamic resource allocation, tailored to fortify each respective layer. The findings underscore that a defense-in-depth strategy, integrating cross-layer security intelligence, is paramount for constructing resilient IoT infrastructures capable of mitigating the escalating sophistication of DoS/DDoS incursions and ensuring operational integrity.
