This paper introduces a unified algorithmic framework for sequential decision-making under correlated uncertainty by establishing new computational equivalences between three fundamental problems: stochastic probing with adaptivity constraints, generalized binary identification, and weighted set exploration. We demonstrate that approximation guarantees for non-adaptive strategies in correlated stochastic environments directly translate to bounds for adaptive search procedures in structured information acquisition problems. Our technical contributions include the first constant-factor approximation algorithms for constrained Pandora's Box with positively correlated distributions via a novel reduction to adaptive submodular optimization. Furthermore, we prove matching hardness results that characterize the computational limits of these equivalences under standard complexity assumptions. These findings reveal deep connections between optimal stopping theory, combinatorial optimization, and active learning, providing new insights into the design of efficient algorithms for stochastic optimization problems where information gathering and decision costs are intrinsically linked.
