Title: Enhancing Low-Level Vision Tasks with Copy-Blend Data Augmentation

Abstract:
Data augmentation is a crucial component in training robust low-level vision models. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of copy-blend data augmentation for enhancing the performance of low-level vision tasks. By applying region modification through copy-blend, we demonstrate a significant improvement in model performance while concurrently reducing the requisite training dataset size. Our analysis reveals that the strategic application of copy-blend augmentation enhances perceptual quality by introducing diverse, yet realistic, variations in the training data. The results indicate that models trained with copy-blend data augmentation outperform their counterparts trained on unaugmented datasets, achieving superior performance metrics. This research underscores the potential of copy-blend data augmentation as a valuable technique for low-level vision tasks, offering a promising avenue for future exploration in the field. Our findings are supported by comprehensive experiments conducted in 2021, highlighting the benefits of this augmentation strategy.
