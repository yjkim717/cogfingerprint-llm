Title: Pose-Guided Scene Synthesis using Adversarial Learning

Abstract:
We propose a novel generative framework that leverages human pose as a conditioning mechanism to synthesize compatible scenes, addressing the challenging task of pose-conditioned scene generation. Building upon the StyleGAN2 architecture, our approach integrates a pose conditioning module that injects pose information into the generator network. By utilizing a large-scale dataset of human pose and scene pairs, our model learns to capture the complex relationships between human pose and scene compatibility. The proposed generative adversarial network (GAN) consists of a generator that produces scene images conditioned on human pose and a discriminator that evaluates the realism and compatibility of the generated scenes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating realistic and pose-compatible scenes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and scene coherence. Our work has implications for various applications, including data augmentation, image synthesis, and human-computer interaction.
