In this 2021 theoretical computer science contribution, we establish fundamental connections between three seemingly disparate optimization problems: Pandora's Box with correlated distributions, Uniform Decision Tree, and Min-Sum Set Cover. Through approximation-preserving reductions, we demonstrate that these problems share equivalent computational hardness under polynomial-time constraints. Our work reveals that the Pandora's Box problem with correlated cost distributions admits a logarithmic approximation factor, mirroring the known bounds for Min-Sum Set Cover. Conversely, under independent distributions or with quasi-polynomial time algorithms, we achieve constant-factor approximations by exploiting structural similarities to Uniform Decision Tree objectives. These equivalences provide new algorithmic insights for adaptive information acquisition problems where query costs and revelation probabilities exhibit complex dependencies. Our reductions maintain approximation guarantees across problem domains while respecting computational complexity barriers, thereby unifying the study of optimal decision-making under uncertainty across multiple research threads in theoretical computer science and operations research.
