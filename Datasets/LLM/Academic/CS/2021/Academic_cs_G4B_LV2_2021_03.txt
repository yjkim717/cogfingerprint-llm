**Abstract**

The Pandora’s Box problem, a notoriously difficult instance of set cover optimization, has long presented a significant challenge for approximation algorithm design. This paper establishes a novel approximation-preserving equivalence between Pandora’s Box and several related combinatorial optimization problems, specifically focusing on correlated distributions and the inherent complexities arising from dependent sets.  We demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, the optimal solutions to instances of the min-sum set cover problem exhibit a structural similarity to those of Pandora’s Box, offering a valuable bridge for transferring algorithmic techniques. 

Specifically, we leverage the properties of uniform decision trees to analyze the approximation ratios of these related problems.  Our core contribution lies in rigorously proving that any approximation algorithm achieving a specific ratio for min-sum set cover can be adapted, with minor modifications, to provide an equivalent approximation for Pandora’s Box. This equivalence underscores the fundamental interconnectedness of these problems and provides a methodological framework for designing more efficient approximation strategies.  The findings suggest that existing techniques for tackling correlated distributions – a recurring obstacle in set cover – can be directly applied to improve Pandora’s Box approximation bounds.  Future research will explore the practical implications of this equivalence for real-world applications requiring efficient set selection.
