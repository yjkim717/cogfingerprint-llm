**Abstract**

Recent advancements in robotics increasingly rely on efficient optimization techniques for tasks ranging from state estimation to motion planning. This paper explores the application of factor graphs as a powerful modeling framework within this domain, specifically as articulated in Dellaert’s (2021) work. We argue that factor graphs provide a structured representation for complex robotic systems, facilitating the decomposition of optimization problems into interconnected, locally-optimized factors.  This modularity dramatically improves computational efficiency compared to traditional approaches.  The inherent graph structure allows for parallel processing and targeted updates, leading to substantial performance gains across diverse robotic applications, including sensor fusion and control.  Further research utilizing factor graphs promises to unlock more sophisticated and robust solutions for challenging robotic systems, particularly those requiring real-time decision-making.
