Title: Evaluating Multimodal Neural Networks for Cross-Situational Word Learning: An Analysis of Inductive Biases and Cognitive Modeling

Abstract:
Cross-situational word learning is a fundamental mechanism in language acquisition, enabling humans to disambiguate word-referent mappings across multiple exposures. Recent advances in multimodal neural networks have led to their application in modeling this cognitive process. This study (2021) investigates the capacity of these networks to capture the complexities of cross-situational word learning. Our results indicate that while multimodal neural networks successfully model certain aspects of this phenomenon, they fail to fully replicate the associated cognitive phenomena. An examination of the inductive biases inherent in these models reveals that their performance is contingent upon the alignment of their architectural priors with the statistical properties of the learning environment. This analysis underscores the need for refining cognitive models to better capture the intricacies of human language acquisition, highlighting the importance of integrating insights from both cognitive science and machine learning to advance our understanding of cross-situational word learning.
