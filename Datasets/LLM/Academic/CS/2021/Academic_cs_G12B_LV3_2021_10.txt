**Abstract:**

This work examines the geometric properties of intrinsic metrics following transformations induced by conformal and quasiregular mappings within planar domains. Building upon established inequalities, we present improved bounds on conformal distortion, with a particular focus on the triangular ratio metricâ€”a critical measure of local geometric change. Our analysis leverages refined versions of the Schwarz lemma, adapted to accommodate the complexities introduced by quasiregular mappings. The investigation aims to provide a more granular understanding of how these mappings alter the underlying geometry of a space, moving beyond traditional distortion metrics. Results demonstrate that the interplay between conformality and quasiregularity significantly impacts the preservation or amplification of geometric features. These findings contribute to a deeper theoretical foundation for applications requiring distortion analysis in areas such as image processing and computer graphics.
