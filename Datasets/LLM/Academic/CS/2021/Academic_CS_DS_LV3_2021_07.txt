This paper presents a novel differentially private algorithm for correlation clustering that achieves subquadratic additive error, advancing the state of privacy-preserving unsupervised learning. We demonstrate a fundamental separation from non-private adaptations, which inherently fail to provide meaningful utility guarantees under a strict privacy regime. Furthermore, we establish a tight Î©(n) lower bound on the additive error for any algorithm satisfying pure differential privacy, thereby characterizing the intrinsic cost of privacy for this problem. Our work provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for private clustering in graph-based data analysis.
