Title: Analyzing Efficiency Dynamics in BRICS Banking Sectors: A Computational Approach

Abstract:
This study leverages a Two-Step Generalized Method of Moments (2GMM) estimation to investigate the intricate relationships between competition, bank size, development indicators, and operational efficiency within the BRICS banking sectors over the period 2000-2015. Employing a computational framework, we analyze an extensive dataset to discern the impact of these variables on banking efficiency. Our results provide insights into the complex dynamics governing the banking sectors of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The findings have significant implications for policymakers and stakeholders seeking to enhance banking sector performance in emerging economies. By integrating computational methods with econometric analysis, this research contributes to the advancement of data-driven decision-making in the financial sector, aligning with contemporary trends in computational science and finance.
