**Abstract**

This work investigates the intersection of unsupervised learning and privacy preservation, specifically addressing the problem of correlation clustering under a differentially private framework. Correlation clustering, a fundamental problem in unsupervised machine learning, aims to identify clusters within data based on pairwise correlation observations. In 2021, despite significant advancements in differentially private algorithms, theoretical understanding of privacy-preserving correlation clustering remained limited. We introduce a novel algorithm achieving a subquadratic additive error guarantee while maintaining differential privacy, representing a practical improvement over existing approaches. Critically, we establish an algorithmic lower bound demonstrating the fundamental challenges inherent in achieving pure Îµ-differential privacy for correlation clustering. Our results highlight the trade-offs between accuracy and privacy in this setting and provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for future research exploring privacy-preserving unsupervised learning techniques, ultimately informing the design of more robust and privacy-respecting data analysis methods.
