**Abstract:**

This work addresses the computational complexity of Bayesian mechanism design, specifically the challenge of achieving exact incentive compatibility (IC) under general type spaces. We present a novel polynomial-time reduction from Bayesian IC mechanism design to Bayesian algorithm design for welfare maximization. Our approach leverages a generalized framework of Bernoulli Factories, a computational model allowing for efficient manipulation of probability distributions. This reduction circumvents the inherent #P-hardness associated with repairing incentive constraints in mechanism design, enabling the construction of IC mechanisms even with multi-dimensional and continuous type spaces. The results provide a significant advancement in tractable mechanism design, extending applicability to complex real-world scenarios.
