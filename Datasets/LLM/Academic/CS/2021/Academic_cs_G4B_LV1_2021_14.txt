**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles necessitates robust and scalable collision avoidance strategies. This research investigates the efficacy of two prominent reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms – Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) – in facilitating decentralized collision avoidance within a multi-vehicle system. We hypothesize that both algorithms offer viable approaches, yet their performance may diverge based on the complexity of the interaction dynamics.  A simulation environment was developed to model a cohort of autonomous vehicles navigating a dynamic, partially observable scenario.  Each algorithm was implemented utilizing a decentralized control architecture, enabling vehicles to react independently to perceived threats.  Performance evaluation centered on minimizing collision frequency and maximizing overall system throughput. Preliminary results indicate that SAC demonstrated superior convergence rates and a more stable policy, potentially attributable to its inherent exploration strategy. Further analysis will explore the trade-offs between exploration and exploitation within each algorithm and assess the impact of varying network latency on the overall collision avoidance performance.
