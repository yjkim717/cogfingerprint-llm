Here's a formal academic-style abstract, inspired by the provided summary and keywords, suitable for a CS conference proceeding in 2021:

**Abstract:** Accurate image segmentation of bacterial cells remains a critical challenge in biological research, particularly given the morphological heterogeneity observed across species and experimental conditions. Traditional segmentation approaches often struggle to generalize across diverse imaging modalities and exhibit limitations in handling complex cell shapes. This paper introduces Omnipose, a novel deep learning architecture designed to address these deficiencies. Utilizing a convolutional neural network framework, Omnipose demonstrates significantly improved performance in bacterial cell segmentation compared to established methods, notably Cellpose, across a broad range of datasets. Experimental results demonstrate Omniposeâ€™s superior ability to delineate cells with varying morphologies, sizes, and spatial arrangements. We evaluate the algorithm's robustness against noise and imaging artifacts, highlighting its adaptability to fluorescence microscopy, phase contrast, and brightfield imaging. Omnipose represents a substantial advancement in automated bacterial cell analysis, facilitating more precise quantification of cell populations and enabling deeper insights into microbial behavior.



I aimed for a tone consistent with a CS conference abstract, emphasizing technical details and quantifiable improvements.
