Title: Robust Trust Region for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Regularized Losses

Abstract:
Weakly supervised semantic segmentation has garnered significant attention in the realm of deep learning, owing to its potential to alleviate the need for exhaustive pixel-level annotations. However, the optimization of neural networks under weak supervision remains challenging due to the lack of robust regularization techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel trust region approach that enables the effective integration of strong low-level solvers for regularizers into neural network optimization. By leveraging regularized losses within a trust region framework, our method ensures robust and stable updates, thereby improving the accuracy of weakly supervised segmentation models. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in 2021. Our work contributes to the advancement of weakly supervised semantic segmentation, bridging the gap between low-level vision tasks and deep learning-based segmentation models.
