**Abstract**

This research investigates the application of data mining techniques to enhance understanding of terrorist activity within Nigeria. Leveraging the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) – a comprehensive repository of terrorist events – we employed the Apriori algorithm, a frequent pattern mining method, to identify recurring patterns in attack characteristics and methodologies. The study’s objective was to move beyond descriptive analysis of individual incidents and uncover statistically significant associations indicative of broader trends. Preliminary results suggest the Apriori algorithm effectively revealed previously obscured relationships between specific attack types, geographic locations within Nigeria, and temporal sequences.  Further analysis will explore the implications of these patterns for forensic investigation and predictive modeling.  This work contributes to the growing field of computational approaches for counter-terrorism, offering a novel methodology for extracting actionable intelligence from large-scale terrorist event data.
