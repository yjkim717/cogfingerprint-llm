This paper presents a novel pose-conditioned scene generation framework leveraging a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthesize realistic scenes that are compatible with a given human pose. Building upon the StyleGAN2 architecture, our proposed model takes a human pose as input and hallucinates a corresponding scene that adheres to the pose's spatial and semantic constraints. The generator is trained to capture the intricate relationships between human pose and scene layout, ensuring that the synthesized scenes are not only visually plausible but also contextually relevant. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in generating diverse and pose-compatible scenes, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. By conditioning scene generation on human pose, our framework has significant implications for applications in computer vision, robotics, and graphics, where understanding the interplay between humans and their environment is crucial. Our work advances the field of pose-conditioned scene generation, enabling more realistic and context-aware scene synthesis.
