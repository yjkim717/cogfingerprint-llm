"In this study, we investigate the distortion of intrinsic metrics under conformal and quasiregular mappings within simple domains. Focusing on the hyperbolic metric, we analyze the behavior of quasiconformal mappings and their impact on metric distortion. By employing a rigorous mathematical framework, we establish bounds on the distortion of intrinsic metrics under these mappings. Our results contribute to the understanding of geometric function theory and have implications for the development of algorithms in computational geometry and geometric deep learning, as of 2021."
