**Abstract**

Recent advancements in deep convolutional neural networks have highlighted increasing vulnerability to adversarial attacks. This work presents a novel approach to enhancing adversarial robustness by directly parameterizing orthogonal convolutional layers via a Cayley transform. We demonstrate that leveraging the Cayley transform facilitates a more structured and interpretable representation of convolutional kernels, enabling tighter control over layer orthogonality.  Specifically, the parameterized nature allows for the explicit imposition of Lipschitz constants, a crucial factor in mitigating adversarial perturbations.  Our methodology is designed to scale effectively to larger network architectures, addressing a key limitation of existing techniques. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets reveal a significant improvement in adversarial robustness compared to standard orthogonal convolutional layers, while maintaining competitive performance on clean data.  We argue that this approach represents a fundamental shift towards more robust and controllable convolutional architectures.
