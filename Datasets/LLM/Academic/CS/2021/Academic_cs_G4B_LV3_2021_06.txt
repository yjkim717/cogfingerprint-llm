**Abstract**

This study investigates the performance dynamics of banking systems within the BRICS nations, utilizing a panel data analysis conducted in 2021. Examining key performance indicators – efficiency, competition, size, and associated development indicators – reveals a nuanced relationship between these factors. Our findings demonstrate a statistically significant positive correlation between competitive intensity and overall bank efficiency. Furthermore, the size of the banking institution positively impacts its operational efficiency, suggesting economies of scale contribute to improved performance.  Crucially, economic development exerts a complex influence; while bolstering revenue efficiency, it simultaneously degrades cost efficiency through increased operational complexity. These relationships exhibit nonlinear characteristics, indicating diminishing returns to scale and potential thresholds for development impact.  These results have implications for algorithmic optimization strategies within financial systems, highlighting the need for adaptive models that account for both competitive pressures and developmental stage.
