In 2021, Boykov et al. introduced a robust trust region framework that significantly advances weakly supervised segmentation by integrating geometric priors and leveraging strong low-level solvers for regularized losses. This approach mitigates the inherent limitations of sparse annotations through a higher-order generalization of the chain rule, which refines gradient-based optimization in neural networks. By embedding domain-specific constraints directly into the learning objective, the method ensures more stable convergence and reduces sensitivity to noisy labels. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the efficacy of combining analytical solvers with data-driven models. This work establishes a principled pathway for enhancing segmentation accuracy where full supervision is impractical, bridging combinatorial optimization with deep learning.
