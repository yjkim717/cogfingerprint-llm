**Abstract:**

The increasing deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust and efficient decentralized control strategies to ensure safety and optimize traffic flow within complex, dynamic environments. This paper investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for centralized control of a multi-agent AV system, specifically focusing on collision avoidance and traffic efficiency. We comparatively evaluate the performance of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms in a simulated vehicular traffic scenario. Both algorithms are implemented to learn centralized policies that dictate the actions of individual AVs, aiming to minimize collisions and maximize overall system throughput.

Our experimental results demonstrate that while both PPO and SAC achieve significant improvements over traditional rule-based collision avoidance systems, SAC consistently exhibits superior performance in terms of both collision reduction and average speed, particularly in scenarios with high agent density and complex interaction patterns. Analysis of learned policies reveals that SACâ€™s entropy maximization objective encourages exploration and adaptation to unforeseen circumstances, leading to more robust navigation strategies. Furthermore, we explore the impact of reward function design and network architecture on the convergence and scalability of both algorithms. These findings suggest that SAC holds considerable promise for developing decentralized, learning-based control systems for autonomous vehicle fleets, though further research is needed to address challenges related to real-world deployment, such as safety certification and computational efficiency.

**Notes on the Abstract & Potential Paper Directions:**

*   **Formal Tone:** Uses precise language ("necessitates," "robust," "throughput," "convergence," "scalability").
*   **Structured Reasoning:** Clearly states the problem, approach, results, and implications.
*   **2021 Context:** While not explicitly stating the year, the focus on RL for AVs aligns with the trends of that period.
*   **Potential Expansion Areas (Implied in the Abstract):** The abstract alludes to aspects that the full paper would likely delve into:
    *   Detailed description of the simulation environment.
    *   Specific reward function formulations and their impact.
    *   Network architectures used for the RL agents.
    *   Scalability analysis (how performance degrades with increasing numbers of AVs).
    *   Discussion of limitations and future work (safety, real-world considerations).
