This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of factor graph formulations for optimization problems in robotics. As graphical models that explicitly represent local dependencies between variables and factors, factor graphs provide a unifying framework for structuring inference across perception, planning, and control tasks. We demonstrate that exploiting the sparse connectivity inherent in robotic systems yields significant computational advantages, particularly through efficient message-passing algorithms. Our 2021 evaluation shows that factor graph-based implementations achieve up to 40% faster convergence in SLAM and motion planning benchmarks compared to conventional optimization approaches. Furthermore, we establish that the modular nature of factor graphs enhances problem design flexibility, enabling rapid prototyping of complex robotic systems. These findings underscore factor graphs as both a computational tool and a design paradigm for next-generation robotic architectures.
