In 2021, the persistent challenge of accurate bacterial cell segmentation across diverse morphologies and imaging modalities necessitated advanced computational solutions. This paper introduces Omnipose, a novel deep neural network architecture engineered for high-precision, morphology-independent cellular segmentation. Unlike predecessor models such as Cellpose, which exhibit performance degradation with irregular cell shapes, our framework leverages a unique objective function and training paradigm to disentangle segmentation accuracy from morphological bias. We rigorously validate Omnipose on a comprehensive dataset encompassing rod, spherical, filamentous, and curved bacterial species imaged in both two and three dimensions using phase-contrast and fluorescence microscopy. Quantitative benchmarks demonstrate that Omnipose significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy and boundary delineation, particularly for morphologically complex or densely clustered cells. This breakthrough provides the microbiological research community with a robust, general-purpose tool, enabling more reliable quantitative analysis of bacterial physiology, pathogenesis, and community dynamics from complex image data.
