**Abstract**

Cross-situational word learning (CSWL) – the ability to infer word meanings from repeated co-occurrence across diverse contexts – represents a fundamental challenge in artificial intelligence and a crucial element of human language acquisition. This work investigates the capacity of multimodal neural networks to emulate key behavioral patterns observed in CSWL, specifically examining their ability to leverage visual-linguistic mappings and the principle of mutual exclusivity. We employ a recurrent multimodal architecture trained on a simulated environment where words are associated with objects across multiple visual contexts. Our experiments demonstrate that these networks can, to a significant degree, learn meaningful word-object associations, mirroring human performance in initial stages of CSWL. However, we also identify limitations in the networks’ ability to robustly resolve ambiguity and generalize to novel situations, particularly when encountering lexical overlap or violations of mutual exclusivity.  These findings suggest that while current multimodal neural network architectures possess promising capabilities for modeling aspects of CSWL, they currently lack the sophisticated reasoning mechanisms – such as sophisticated contextual inhibition—necessary to fully replicate human-like learning efficiency and generalization.  Further research is warranted to incorporate explicit constraints and cognitive biases into these models to improve their performance and advance our understanding of the underlying computational principles of language acquisition.

**Note:** I aimed for a word count around 222 and used terminology common in CS and cognitive science (recurrent multimodal architecture, lexical overlap, contextual inhibition). The abstract highlights both the successes and the limitations, as per your original summary, and suggests avenues for future research.
