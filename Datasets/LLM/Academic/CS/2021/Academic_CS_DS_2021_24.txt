This study investigates the prevalence and predictors of social challenges among adolescent learners in Ghanaian secondary education systems. Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected from 420 students across six public schools in Greater Accra Region during the 2021 academic year. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant associations between demographic variables and social adjustment difficulties. Female students demonstrated higher vulnerability to interpersonal conflicts (β = 0.34, p < 0.01), while students from low-income households showed greater susceptibility to peer pressure and social exclusion (β = 0.28, p < 0.05). The model explained 42% of variance in social challenge scores (R² = 0.42), with parental education level and school transition history emerging as additional significant predictors. These findings underscore the need for targeted intervention strategies and enhanced counselling support services tailored to specific demographic profiles within Ghana's educational landscape.
