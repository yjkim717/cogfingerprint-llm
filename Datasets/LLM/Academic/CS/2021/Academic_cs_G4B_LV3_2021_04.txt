**Abstract**

This work introduces a novel polynomial-time reduction between Bayesian Incentive Compatible (BIC) mechanism design and algorithmic problem solving, offering a significant advancement in computational mechanism design.  Traditional black-box reductions often suffer from inaccuracies due to reliance on sampling, hindering the attainment of strict BIC properties.  We address this limitation by utilizing the Bernoulli Factories computational model, providing a precise and verifiable representation of agent behavior.  Specifically, our reduction demonstrates exact BIC incentive compatibility within a polynomial time complexity.  This capability enables the application of established algorithm design techniques – including those focused on optimization and approximation – to the fundamentally challenging domain of mechanism design.  The resultant framework promises to accelerate the development of robust and efficient mechanisms, particularly in scenarios involving heterogeneous agents and strategic interactions, representing a crucial step toward scalable and reliable incentive alignment.
