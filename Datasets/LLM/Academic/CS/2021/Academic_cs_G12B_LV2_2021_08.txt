## Factor Graphs for Efficient Robotics Optimization: Exploiting Locality Structure

This paper investigates the application of factor graphs as a powerful and flexible modeling framework for a broad range of robotics tasks. Traditional robotics optimization problems often suffer from computational bottlenecks due to complex objective functions and constraints. We argue that factor graphs, a specific instance of bipartite graphical models, offer a compelling solution by explicitly representing the problem's decomposition into local, interacting factors. This decomposition inherently exposes the inherent locality structure frequently present in robotics domains – such as kinematics, motion planning, and control – enabling the design of highly efficient inference algorithms. We demonstrate how factor graph formulations facilitate modular problem design, allowing for easy incorporation of new constraints and objectives. Furthermore, the graphical representation lends itself to parallelization and distributed computation, crucial for real-time robotic applications. We analyze the computational advantages of factor graph-based optimization compared to traditional approaches, particularly focusing on the scalability benefits derived from exploiting the underlying locality. This work contributes to the growing body of research leveraging graphical models to enhance the performance and design of robotic systems.
