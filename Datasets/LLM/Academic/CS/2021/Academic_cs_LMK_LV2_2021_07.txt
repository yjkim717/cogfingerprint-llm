This paper presents a differentially private correlation clustering algorithm, ensuring individual privacy in unsupervised machine learning. We achieve subquadratic additive error, a significant improvement over existing methods. By leveraging advanced techniques in differential privacy, our algorithm provides robust and accurate clustering results while safeguarding sensitive information, thus advancing the field of private machine learning as of 2021.
