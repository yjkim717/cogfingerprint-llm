**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in multimodal neural networks have spurred investigation into their capacity to replicate human cross-situational word learning. This research examines the extent to which these networks, specifically those employing visual-linguistic mappings, can capture the observed behavioral patterns documented in psychological studies of infants and young children. We hypothesize that while current architectures demonstrate proficiency in establishing word-referent associations, they exhibit limitations in reasoning based on mutual exclusivity – a critical component of robust semantic understanding.  Our experiments, simulating training regimes analogous to classic cross-situational learning paradigms, reveal a discrepancy between network performance and human-level inference.  These findings underscore the need for enhanced neural network architectures capable of representing and applying more sophisticated relational constraints, moving beyond simple statistical correlations towards genuine conceptual grounding.
