Okay, here's an original abstract inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a formal, academic style suitable for a CS conference proceeding, and reflecting a 2021 context.  I've aimed for precision and a logical structure.  Following the abstract, I'll include some notes on the choices I made.

**Abstract**

The performance of low-level vision algorithms, particularly those addressing image enhancement and restoration, remains sensitive to variations in training data, especially concerning textural fidelity. Traditional data augmentation strategies often introduce artifacts that degrade perceptual quality and hinder generalization. This paper introduces a novel data augmentation technique, termed Copy-Blend Augmentation (CBA), designed to mitigate these issues by selectively blending portions of source images to generate synthetic training samples.  Unlike methods that rely on random transformations or generative models, CBA explicitly prioritizes the preservation of local textural structures.  The core mechanism involves identifying and copying statistically similar regions from a separate, curated dataset, then seamlessly blending these copied regions into the original image with learned weights.  Experiments conducted on benchmark image enhancement datasets demonstrate that CBA consistently improves the performance of deep convolutional neural networks across a range of enhancement tasks (e.g., denoising, deblurring, contrast enhancement) compared to standard augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, and color jittering.  Furthermore, subjective evaluations using established perceptual quality metrics (NIQE, BRISQUE) indicate that CBA-augmented training data yields models producing perceptually more pleasing and realistic enhanced images, suggesting a significant advancement in training methodologies for low-level vision systems.

**Notes on Choices & Reasoning:**

*   **Formal Tone:** I used precise language (e.g., "mitigate," "generalization," "statistically similar regions," "perceptually pleasing") and avoided colloquialisms.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a clear structure:
    *   **Problem Statement:**  Sensitivity of low-level vision to data variations and shortcomings of existing augmentation.
    *   **Proposed Solution:** Introduction of Copy-Blend Augmentation (CBA).
    *   **Mechanism Description:** Briefly explains how CBA works (copying and blending with learned weights).
    *   **Results:** Quantitative improvement on benchmarks and qualitative improvement in perceptual quality.
    *   **Conclusion/Significance:** CBA represents an advancement in training methodologies.
*   **Terminology:** I incorporated the keywords provided ("data augmentation," "low-level vision," "perceptual quality," "image enhancement") naturally within the text. I also added terms common in this field like "deep convolutional neural networks" and specific perceptual quality metrics (NIQE, BRISQUE) to enhance credibility.
*   **2021 Context:**  While the core idea isn't necessarily *new* in 2021, the focus on preserving textural fidelity and using perceptual quality metrics for evaluation was a growing area of interest. The language reflects the sophistication of the field at that time.
*   **Conciseness:** The abstract is within a reasonable length for a conference proceeding (around 200 words).
*   **"Curated Dataset":** This is included to imply that CBA isn't just blending *any* regions, but those chosen for texture consistency.



I hope this is helpful! Do you want me to modify it in any way?
