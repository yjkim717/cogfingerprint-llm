**Decentralized Multi-Agent Collision Avoidance via Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic in Simulated Autonomous Vehicle Environments**

The increasing prevalence of autonomous vehicles (AVs) necessitates robust and scalable solutions for collision avoidance, particularly in complex, dynamic traffic scenarios. While decentralized control architectures offer advantages in terms of robustness and computational efficiency, coordinating multiple AVs to ensure global safety remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates the application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), for centralized training of decentralized policies aimed at mitigating collision risk in multi-AV systems.  We evaluate these algorithms within a simulated environment comprising a population of interacting AVs, focusing on scenarios with varying traffic density and unpredictable agent behaviors.  The proposed approach leverages a centralized critic to facilitate learning of coordinated strategies across agents, while maintaining decentralized execution for enhanced scalability.  Experimental results demonstrate that both PPO and SAC achieve significant improvements in collision avoidance performance compared to traditional rule-based methods and simpler reactive strategies.  SAC, with its entropy regularization, consistently exhibits superior exploration and demonstrates greater resilience to noisy sensor data. Furthermore, we analyze the learned policies to understand the emergent cooperative behaviors and identify potential limitations regarding generalization to unseen scenarios.  These findings contribute to the growing body of research on RL-based autonomous navigation and highlight the potential of advanced RL algorithms for enhancing the safety and efficiency of future transportation systems.
