This paper presents a systematic analysis of attention-based architectures in visual computing systems, examining their transformative impact on representation learning. We establish a unified taxonomy that distinguishes between channel-wise, spatial, and temporal attention paradigms, analyzing how each modality enables selective feature amplification across different dimensions of visual data. Our investigation reveals how these mechanisms facilitate dynamic weight allocation, allowing networks to prioritize semantically salient regions while suppressing redundant information. The study further identifies emerging hybrid approaches that integrate multiple attention forms within unified frameworks. Building on current limitations, we propose research directions toward more efficient attention formulations, better integration with lightweight architectures, and enhanced interpretability. This work provides both a conceptual framework for understanding attention in visual systems and practical insights for developing next-generation computer vision models.
