**Abstract**

The Pandora’s Box problem, a notoriously difficult combinatorial optimization challenge, has been reformulated within the context of correlated distributions, revealing a surprising approximation-preserving equivalence to several established problems. This work demonstrates that the Pandora’s Box instance can be mapped to instances of the min-sum set cover and uniform decision tree problems, allowing for the application of existing algorithmic techniques. Specifically, we present constant-factor approximation algorithms leveraging subexponential time complexity for mixtures of product distributions, effectively addressing a significant limitation of prior approaches.  Our analysis establishes a theoretical framework wherein the inherent difficulty of Pandora’s Box stems from its interaction with correlated data structures.  These findings provide a novel perspective on the problem’s structure and offer practical pathways toward improved solution strategies, potentially impacting areas such as resource allocation and data clustering. Further research will explore the scalability of these methods across increasingly complex instances.
