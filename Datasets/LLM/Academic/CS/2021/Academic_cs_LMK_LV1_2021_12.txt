Title: Enhancing Adversarial Robustness in Deep Networks via Orthogonal Convolutional Layers Parameterized by the Cayley Transform

Abstract:
Deep neural networks are notoriously susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can be mitigated by controlling the Lipschitz constant of the network. In this work, we propose a novel method to parameterize orthogonal convolutional layers using the Cayley transform, enabling the construction of deep networks with provable Lipschitz constants. By leveraging the properties of orthogonal matrices, our approach ensures that the convolutional layers preserve the $\ell_2$ norm, thereby enhancing the robustness of the network to adversarial perturbations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by integrating the proposed orthogonal convolutional layers into a standard deep neural network architecture. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10 and ImageNet) show that our approach significantly improves adversarial robustness against state-of-the-art attacks, such as PGD and C&W, while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Our method provides a promising direction for the design of robust deep networks with guaranteed Lipschitz constants.
