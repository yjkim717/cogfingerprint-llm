“This paper presents a novel differentially private correlation clustering algorithm designed to address the growing need for privacy-preserving unsupervised learning techniques. Leveraging a subquadratic time complexity, our approach surpasses existing differentially private adaptations while simultaneously establishing a theoretical lower bound for achieving pure differential privacy within the correlation clustering framework. We demonstrate that rigorous privacy guarantees do not necessarily compromise clustering accuracy.  The algorithm’s design incorporates advanced techniques to mitigate information leakage, ensuring compliance with stringent privacy regulations.  Preliminary experimental results validate the efficacy of this method, suggesting significant potential for applications requiring both data utility and robust privacy protection in domains such as social network analysis and anomaly detection.”
