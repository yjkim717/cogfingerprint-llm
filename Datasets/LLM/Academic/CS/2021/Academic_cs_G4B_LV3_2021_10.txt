**Abstract**

This research explores the geometric distortion inherent in data transformations, specifically focusing on the implications of conformal and quasiregular mappings within structured datasets. We investigate how these mappings, analogous to conformal mappings in complex analysis, affect intrinsic metrics – representing the underlying geometric relationships – of datasets. Utilizing the Schwarz lemma as a foundational tool, we present refined inequalities characterizing distortion under such transformations, moving beyond existing approximations.  Crucially, we demonstrate sharp versions of the Schwarz lemma applicable to quasiregular mappings, offering improved bounds for predicting geometric changes.  These findings have direct relevance to data compression, image processing, and particularly, the analysis of network topologies where preserving geometric properties is vital for maintaining algorithmic efficiency and information fidelity. Further investigation into adaptive distortion metrics remains a key area for future work.
