**Abstract**

Achieving adversarial robustness in deep convolutional neural networks remains a critical challenge. This work investigates a novel parameterization strategy for convolutional layers, leveraging the Cayley transform within the Fourier domain to enforce orthogonality directly. In 2021, existing methods for orthogonalizing convolutional filters often suffer from computational bottlenecks or limited scalability. Our approach circumvents these limitations by formulating the parameterization in the Fourier domain, enabling efficient optimization and facilitating the construction of deeper, more robust architectures. We demonstrate that this Cayley transform-based orthogonalization significantly enhances certified adversarial defenses against common attacks, providing provable guarantees on network resilience. Experimental results on benchmark datasets illustrate improved robustness and scalability compared to prior techniques, suggesting a promising pathway towards more reliable and certifiable deep learning systems. This research contributes a computationally efficient and scalable method for incorporating orthogonality into convolutional layers, furthering the pursuit of robust and trustworthy AI.
