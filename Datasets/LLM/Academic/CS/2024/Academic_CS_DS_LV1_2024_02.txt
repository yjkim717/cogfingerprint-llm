**Abstract**

This work establishes novel statistical query (SQ) lower bounds for the non-Gaussian component analysis (NGCA) problem, significantly advancing the understanding of its intrinsic computational barriers. We consider the prototypical setting of recovering a hidden \( k \)-dimensional subspace within \( \mathbb{R}^d \) from samples where the projection onto this subspace is non-Gaussian, while the orthogonal component is standard Gaussian. Departing from prior analyses that relied on strong tail assumptions or lower-bounded \( \chi^2 \)-divergence norms, our framework operates under substantially milder moment-matching conditions. We demonstrate that any SQ algorithm achieving constant error in the presence of an adversarial noise rate \( \eta \) requires either super-polynomially many queries or queries of inverse-polynomially poor precision. This near-optimal lower bound, which nearly matches known algorithmic upper bounds, implies that efficient NGCA is information-theoretically impossible in the SQ model under these weak structural assumptions. Our results provide a more refined complexity-theoretic explanation for the empirical hardness of high-dimensional NGCA and delineate the boundary between tractable and intractable distributional assumptions.
