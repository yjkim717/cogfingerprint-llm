**Abstract**

Accurate robot state estimation remains a critical challenge in robotics, particularly in dynamic environments. This paper presents a novel metric for evaluating state estimation performance leveraging the SE2(3) Lie group representation and Chebyshev interpolation. Traditional metrics often fail to adequately capture the influence of temporal dynamics, specifically linear velocity, on estimation fidelity. To address this limitation, we introduce a method that explicitly incorporates ground truth linear velocity data during the evaluation process.  Chebyshev interpolation provides a computationally efficient and accurate representation of state trajectories, while the SE2(3) framework ensures geometric consistency.  We demonstrate that this approach yields a significantly improved correlation with ground truth compared to standard metrics, particularly when evaluating estimators exhibiting varying degrees of velocity tracking capability.  Future work will explore adaptive interpolation orders and extensions to higher-dimensional state spaces, furthering the robustness of this novel evaluation framework.
