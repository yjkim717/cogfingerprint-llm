In computational science, the scalability of causal discovery algorithms remains a critical bottleneck when analyzing high-dimensional datasets. This paper introduces AcceleratedLiNGAM, a novel framework that leverages GPU parallelization to enhance the DirectLiNGAM method, enabling efficient causal inference on large-scale data. By restructuring the algorithm’s independence testing and regression steps into parallelizable operations, our approach minimizes computational overhead and harnesses the massive parallelism of modern graphics processors. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that AcceleratedLiNGAM achieves speed-ups of up to 32× compared to CPU-based implementations, without compromising accuracy. We validate its utility through applications in genomics and finance, including gene regulatory network reconstruction and financial time-series analysis, where it uncovers interpretable causal relationships previously obscured by computational constraints. This work not only advances the state of the art in causal discovery but also provides a scalable, open-source tool for researchers tackling complex, data-intensive problems across disciplines.
