Title: Enhancing Cellular Segmentation in Degraded Microscopy Images with Cellpose3: A One-Click Restoration Approach

Abstract:
Accurate cellular segmentation in microscopy images is crucial for various biological analyses. However, image degradation due to factors such as noise and blurring often hinders the performance of segmentation models. To address this challenge, we introduce Cellpose3, a novel framework that integrates one-click image restoration with cellular segmentation. Leveraging advancements in generalist methods for image restoration, Cellpose3 enhances the quality of degraded microscopy images, thereby improving the accuracy of subsequent segmentation tasks. Our approach utilizes a unified model that synergistically combines restoration and segmentation capabilities, eliminating the need for separate preprocessing steps. Experimental results demonstrate that Cellpose3 outperforms existing segmentation models on degraded images, achieving robust and precise cellular segmentation. By streamlining the image analysis pipeline, Cellpose3 has the potential to significantly impact biological research and related applications. (2024)
