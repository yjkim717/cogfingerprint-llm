In the evolving landscape of healthcare digitization, this study addresses the critical intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and pharmaceutical informatics, with a specific focus on data governance frameworks. As AI systems become increasingly integral to clinical decision support, medication management, and patient safety protocols, the need for structured implementation guidelines is paramount. This research, contextualized within the Saudi healthcare ecosystem in 2024, employs a multi-phase Delphi methodology to establish a consensus-driven framework. The proposed model delineates 12 core principles for the ethical deployment of AI technologies in pharmacy practice, emphasizing data integrity, algorithmic transparency, and regulatory compliance. These recommendations are designed to mitigate risks associated with data bias, privacy breaches, and clinical accountability while fostering innovation. The findings contribute a scalable governance archetype that balances technological advancement with pharmacoethical imperatives, offering a strategic roadmap for healthcare institutions navigating AI integration in high-stakes clinical environments.
