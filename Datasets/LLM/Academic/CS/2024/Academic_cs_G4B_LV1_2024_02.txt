**Abstract**

Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) presents a significant challenge in statistical signal processing due to its inherent sensitivity to deviations from Gaussianity. This work introduces a novel theoretical framework for establishing lower bounds on the complexity of solving NGCA problems, circumventing the previously required assumption of a chi-squared distribution. We employ a statistical query (SQ) model, rigorously analyzing the inherent limitations imposed by the non-Gaussian component structure. Our primary contribution lies in deriving near-optimal lower bounds, demonstrating that performance degradation is fundamentally linked to the complexity of identifying a hidden subspace within the data, rather than the specific distributional properties of the underlying components.  These results provide a crucial benchmark for evaluating and designing efficient NGCA algorithms. Furthermore, we explore the implications of these bounds for practical computational strategies, suggesting avenues for improved complexity reduction and highlighting the persistent relevance of the SQ model in characterizing challenging statistical estimation tasks.
