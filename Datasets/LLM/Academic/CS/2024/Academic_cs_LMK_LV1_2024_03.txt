We present a novel online contention resolution scheme (OCRS) for revenue maximization in multi-dimensional settings with subadditive buyers. Our construction achieves an $O(\log^2 m)$ approximation to the ex ante revenue, where $m$ denotes the number of items. This improves upon existing results in the literature, which often rely on restrictive assumptions on buyer valuations. Our OCRS is based on a carefully designed sequential item pricing scheme, which adaptively adjusts prices in response to observed buyer behavior. We leverage the subadditivity of buyer valuations to establish a lower bound on the ex ante revenue, which is then used to bound the performance of our OCRS. Our results have implications for mechanism design in complex markets, where buyers have diverse and nuanced preferences. The proposed OCRS provides a robust and efficient solution for revenue maximization in these settings, and may be of independent interest in the design of online algorithms. Our techniques are likely to be applicable in a variety of related contexts.
