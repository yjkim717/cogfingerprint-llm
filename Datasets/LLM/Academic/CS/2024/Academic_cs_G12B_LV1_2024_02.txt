## Near-Optimal Statistical Query Lower Bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis

**Abstract:** Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique aiming to discover and isolate latent, subspace-structured signals embedded within complex, non-Gaussian data distributions. A critical challenge in analyzing NGCAâ€™s performance lies in establishing rigorous lower bounds on the number of statistical queries (SQs) required to achieve a desired level of accuracy. Prior work often relied on restrictive conditions concerning the Chi-squared norm of the underlying data, limiting the applicability and theoretical understanding of NGCA in practical scenarios. This paper significantly advances the state-of-the-art by deriving near-optimal SQ lower bounds for NGCA, demonstrably eliminating the dependence on these previously necessary Chi-squared norm constraints.

Our analysis leverages a novel combination of techniques from information-theoretic arguments and statistical learning theory. We formulate a general statistical query model for NGCA and then employ a reduction from a challenging hypothesis testing problem to establish a tight lower bound. This reduction showcases the inherent complexity of distinguishing the subspace signal from noise, even with sophisticated dimensionality reduction strategies. The resulting lower bound provides a definitive characterization of the SQ complexity of NGCA, revealing a fundamental limit on its query efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing NGCA algorithms achieve performance approaching this lower bound, thereby confirming their near-optimality. These findings provide valuable insights for algorithm design and a more robust theoretical framework for understanding the capabilities and limitations of NGCA in high-dimensional data analysis.
