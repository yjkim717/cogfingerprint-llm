Abstract:
In 2024, we present a novel theoretical framework for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) under the statistical query model, establishing near-optimal lower bounds for moment-matching distributions. By leveraging the chi-squared norm, we derive SQ lower bounds that generalize existing results, providing improved guarantees for various estimation tasks. Our analysis demonstrates that the moment-matching condition is sufficient to ensure robust NGCA performance. This work contributes to the understanding of NGCA's statistical limitations, shedding light on the fundamental trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency in high-dimensional statistical inference. Our results have implications for robust statistics and machine learning.
