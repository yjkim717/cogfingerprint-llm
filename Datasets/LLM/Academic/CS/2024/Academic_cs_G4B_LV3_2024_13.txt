**Abstract**

Recent progress in artificial neural networks has increasingly leveraged metalearning techniques to enhance adaptability and cognitive capabilities. This paper investigates the burgeoning role of incentivized practice within metalearning frameworks, specifically examining its impact on addressing fundamental limitations in neural network generalization and continual learning. We synthesize current research demonstrating how incorporating reward signals and strategic rehearsal mitigates catastrophic forgetting and facilitates robust few-shot learning performance. Furthermore, we explore the parallels between these approaches and the adaptive mechanisms observed in large language models’ sequence prediction with reinforcement feedback.  The implications extend to developing more efficient and flexible AI systems capable of robust reasoning and adapting to novel environments.  Future research will necessitate a deeper understanding of optimal incentive design and its interaction with diverse network architectures, ultimately contributing to more generalizable and human-like artificial intelligence.
