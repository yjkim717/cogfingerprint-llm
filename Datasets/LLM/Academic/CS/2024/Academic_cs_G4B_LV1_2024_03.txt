**Abstract**

The efficient allocation of multi-item inventory across multiple buyers presents a significant challenge in revenue maximization, particularly when buyer valuations exhibit subadditive properties. Traditional optimal control strategies often struggle to effectively address this phenomenon, leading to suboptimal outcomes. This paper proposes a novel multi-dimensional Online Competitive Reservation Sampling (OCRS) scheme designed to approximate ex ante revenue maximization within complex, multi-buyer, multi-item environments. Our approach leverages sequential item pricing, dynamically adjusting prices based on observed buyer behavior and remaining inventory.  Crucially, we introduce a fractional relaxation technique applied to the underlying optimization problem, enabling the efficient handling of subadditive valuations.  This relaxation facilitates the computation of approximate optimal solutions, mitigating the computational burden associated with exact methods. Preliminary simulations demonstrate the efficacy of this OCRS scheme in achieving superior revenue compared to conventional pricing heuristics, particularly in scenarios exhibiting pronounced subadditivity in buyer value functions. Future work will investigate adaptive pricing strategies and further refine the fractional relaxation for enhanced performance.
