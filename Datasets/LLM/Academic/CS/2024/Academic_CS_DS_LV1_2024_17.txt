**Abstract**

The proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for natural language processing (NLP) necessitates a systematic, multi-faceted evaluation to guide tool selection and responsible deployment. This paper presents a comparative analysis of nine contemporary GenAI models, assessing their performance across standardized NLP benchmarks, including text coherence, factual accuracy, and task-specific efficacy. Our methodology extends beyond performance metrics to incorporate a critical examination of the underlying AI planning techniques—such as autoregressive, encoder-decoder, and diffusion-based language modeling—that govern their generative processes. We demonstrate a quantifiable trade-off between model scale, inferential efficiency, and output quality. Furthermore, we conduct a rigorous ethical risk assessment, identifying salient concerns related to bias amplification, hallucination propensity, and potential for misuse. The synthesis of our technical and ethical analyses yields a decision framework that maps specific AI planning paradigms to application domains while foregrounding mitigation strategies for associated ethical pitfalls. This work provides a foundational reference for researchers and practitioners aiming to navigate the complex landscape of modern GenAI tools in a principled manner.
