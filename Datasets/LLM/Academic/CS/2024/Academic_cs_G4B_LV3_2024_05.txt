**Abstract**

Algorithmic prediction techniques are increasingly employed in resource allocation systems, yet their efficacy remains contingent upon underlying socio-economic conditions. This research investigates the relationship between algorithmic performance, group inequality, and intervention strategies. Utilizing unit-level statistical analysis, we demonstrate that predictive models exhibit diminished accuracy – and consequently, increased potential for exacerbating existing disparities – when inter-group inequality is elevated. Furthermore, the study reveals a positive correlation between intervention budget size and the effectiveness of algorithmic prediction; substantial investment in targeted interventions is crucial for mitigating bias.  These findings suggest a critical caveat regarding the wholesale adoption of predictive analytics in resource distribution.  Specifically, the research highlights the necessity of proactive measures to address inequality alongside the deployment of algorithmic solutions, advocating for a hybrid approach that prioritizes equitable outcomes.
