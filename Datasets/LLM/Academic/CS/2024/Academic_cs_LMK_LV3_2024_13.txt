Title: Enhancing Systematic Generalization in Artificial Neural Networks through Metalearning

Abstract:
Recent advancements in metalearning have empowered artificial neural networks to tackle longstanding challenges, including systematic generalization, few-shot learning, and multi-step reasoning. By providing machines with targeted incentives and practice, metalearning enables neural networks to acquire abstract representations and adapt to novel tasks. This paper presents a novel metalearning framework that integrates multi-step reasoning and few-shot learning to promote systematic generalization. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the framework's efficacy in improving generalization capabilities, paving the way for more robust and adaptable AI systems in 2024 and beyond.
