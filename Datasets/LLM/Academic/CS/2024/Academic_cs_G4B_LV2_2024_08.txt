**Abstract**

Accurate robot state estimation is paramount for robust trajectory planning and control. Conventional methods often struggle to effectively represent and analyze trajectories incorporating linear velocity constraints. This paper presents a novel metric for robot state estimation, predicated on Chebyshev interpolation, designed to explicitly model and refine velocity information. We leverage the SE(2)(3) Lie group to represent robot poses and velocities, facilitating a geometrically-informed approach to state estimation.  Crucially, Chebyshev interpolation provides a computationally efficient and accurate method for representing continuous trajectories with respect to linear velocity components, mitigating interpolation artifacts inherent in simpler techniques. 

Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of this approach within the context of trajectory analysis.  The incorporation of velocity directly into the interpolation process allows for enhanced sensitivity to velocity-dependent errors and improved prediction of trajectory deviations.  We detail the parameterization scheme, employing pseudospectral methods to ensure spectral smoothness and minimize numerical instability.  Preliminary results suggest a significant improvement in trajectory analysis fidelity compared to traditional methods, offering a valuable contribution to the field of robot state estimation and control.
