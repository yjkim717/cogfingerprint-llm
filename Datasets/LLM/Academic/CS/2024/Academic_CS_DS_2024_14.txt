This paper introduces a novel parallel framework for scalable causal structure learning through GPU-accelerated optimization of non-Gaussian causal models. Our method reformulates causal discovery as a constrained optimization problem solvable via massively parallel computation, enabling efficient processing of high-dimensional datasets previously intractable to traditional constraint-based and score-based approaches. The architecture leverages tensor cores for simultaneous evaluation of multiple conditional independence hypotheses while preserving the identifiability guarantees of independent component analysis. Experimental evaluation demonstrates order-of-magnitude performance improvements over existing methods when applied to neuroimaging and genomic datasets exceeding 10,000 variables. The proposed approach maintains statistical consistency while achieving practical computational feasibility, addressing a fundamental bottleneck in large-scale causal inference. This work establishes new performance benchmarks and enables causal discovery applications in previously prohibitive data domains.
