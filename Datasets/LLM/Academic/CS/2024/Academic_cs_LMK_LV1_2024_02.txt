Title: Tight Statistical Query Lower Bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis under Moment-Matching Conditions

Abstract:
We establish near-optimal Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) under the moment-matching condition, a widely adopted assumption in the NGCA literature. NGCA is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning, where the goal is to identify a subspace of non-Gaussian components within a high-dimensional Gaussian-dominated distribution. Our main result shows that any SQ algorithm that solves NGCA with $d^{1/2 - \epsilon}$ non-Gaussian components requires at least $d^{\Omega(\epsilon)}$ statistical queries, even when the moments of the non-Gaussian components match those of a Gaussian distribution up to order $4$. Our proof leverages a novel SQ lower bound technique that exploits the moment-matching condition to construct a family of hard NGCA instances. Our findings provide a rigorous justification for the hardness of NGCA and shed light on the limitations of SQ algorithms in solving this problem, with implications for the design of efficient algorithms in high-dimensional statistical inference.
