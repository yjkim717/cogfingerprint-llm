## Accelerated Causal Discovery via GPU-Accelerated LiNGAM for High-Dimensional Gene Expression Data

Causal discovery, the identification of causal relationships from observational data, is increasingly crucial for understanding complex systems, particularly in fields like genomics. However, traditional methods often struggle to scale to the high-dimensional datasets characteristic of gene expression analysis. This paper presents AcceleratedLiNGAM, a novel algorithmic framework designed to significantly accelerate the LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model) causal discovery algorithm through GPU parallelization. We leverage the inherent computational parallelism within the LiNGAM iterative estimation process, specifically targeting the matrix inversion and optimization steps, to implement a highly efficient CUDA-based accelerator. Our implementation demonstrates substantial speedups – up to an order of magnitude – compared to CPU-based LiNGAM implementations when applied to synthetic and real-world gene expression datasets with hundreds of variables.  Furthermore, we evaluate the accuracy and robustness of AcceleratedLiNGAM by comparing its estimated Causal Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) against ground truth structures and competing causal discovery algorithms. Results indicate that AcceleratedLiNGAM maintains competitive performance while dramatically reducing computational time, making it a viable solution for exploring causal relationships within large-scale gene expression data and facilitating more comprehensive causal inference studies.  Future work will focus on extending the framework to handle non-linear relationships and explore its applicability to other high-dimensional observational datasets.
