Title: Accelerating Causal Discovery with GPU-Parallelized LiNGAM

Abstract:
Causal discovery is a crucial task in understanding complex systems, but existing methods often struggle with high-dimensional data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to accelerate causal discovery using GPU parallelization, specifically targeting the Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM). By reformulating the LiNGAM estimation problem as a continuous optimization task, we leverage the massively parallel architecture of modern GPUs to scale to thousands of dimensions. Our proposed method, dubbed GPU-LiNGAM, achieves significant speedup over traditional CPU-based implementations while maintaining accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of GPU-LiNGAM on synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing its ability to efficiently uncover causal relationships in large-scale systems. As a result, our work enables the application of causal inference to a broader range of domains, including those with high-dimensional data, and paves the way for further advancements in causal discovery.
