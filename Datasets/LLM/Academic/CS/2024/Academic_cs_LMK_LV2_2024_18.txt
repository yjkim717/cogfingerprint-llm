Title: Integrating Artificial Intelligence into Clinical Practice: A Comprehensive Review of Applications, Benefits, and Ethical Considerations

Abstract:
The burgeoning integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical practice has revolutionized healthcare delivery, offering unprecedented opportunities for personalized treatment and improved patient outcomes. As of 2024, a comprehensive analysis of existing literature reveals that AI applications span various medical specialties, including diagnostics, predictive analytics, and tailored therapeutic interventions. This review synthesizes current research on the benefits and challenges associated with AI adoption in clinical settings, with a particular emphasis on ethical considerations. Our examination highlights the potential of AI to enhance clinical decision-making, streamline workflows, and facilitate precision medicine. However, it also underscores the need for rigorous validation, transparency, and addressing bias in AI-driven systems. The findings of this review provide a foundation for future research directions, informing the development of responsible AI frameworks that prioritize patient-centered care and mitigate potential risks.
