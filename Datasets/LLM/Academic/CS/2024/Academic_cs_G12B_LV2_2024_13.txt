## Metalearning with Incentive and Practice for Enhanced Artificial Neural Network Generalization and Mitigation of Catastrophic Forgetting

**Abstract:** Artificial neural networks (ANNs), despite their demonstrated success, continue to grapple with fundamental limitations including challenges in systematic generalization to unseen data and the pervasive issue of catastrophic forgetting when sequentially learning new tasks. This paper investigates metalearning paradigms designed to address these shortcomings by incorporating principles analogous to human learning â€“ specifically, the provision of incentives and opportunities for deliberate practice. We argue that traditional metalearning approaches, while effective in certain contexts, often lack the nuanced mechanisms that facilitate robust and adaptable learning observed in biological systems. 

Our work explores the integration of reward-modulated plasticity and curriculum learning strategies within a metalearning framework. We hypothesize that incentivizing ANNs to prioritize efficient and generalizable solutions, alongside structured practice schedules targeting specific skill acquisition, can significantly improve performance on both novel tasks and previously learned ones. We present a novel metalearning architecture that combines these elements, demonstrating its efficacy across a range of benchmark tasks and simulated environments.  Experimental results indicate a substantial reduction in catastrophic forgetting and improved systematic generalization compared to standard metalearning algorithms.  Furthermore, we analyze the learned representations to understand how incentive and practice influence the network's ability to extract and retain relevant knowledge.  This research contributes to the broader effort of developing more human-like and robust AI systems, moving towards ANNs capable of continuous learning and adaptation in dynamic environments.  Future work will focus on extending this approach to more complex, real-world applications and exploring theoretical guarantees for its stability and convergence.
