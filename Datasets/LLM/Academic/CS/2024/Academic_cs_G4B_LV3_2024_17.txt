**Abstract:**

The rapid proliferation of generative AI models has instigated a critical need for comparative evaluation within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. This study, published in 2024, undertakes a rigorous comparative analysis of nine prominent generative AI tools – including large language models and diffusion-based approaches – assessing their efficacy across a spectrum of NLP tasks. Our investigation delves beyond simple performance metrics, scrutinizing each tool’s inherent strengths and limitations, alongside pertinent ethical considerations related to bias amplification and misinformation generation. Furthermore, we examine the integration potential of these models with contemporary search engine architectures. 

Crucially, this research incorporates an exploration of AI planning methodologies, investigating how these generative models can be leveraged to augment traditional planning paradigms. We hypothesize that synergistic integration of generative AI and AI planning will unlock novel approaches to complex problem-solving. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the current landscape and inform future development strategies within the evolving field of NLP and AI planning.
