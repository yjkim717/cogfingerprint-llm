This paper investigates the integration of conformal prediction frameworks with large language models to establish rigorous, distribution-free uncertainty guarantees in natural language generation tasks. As LLMs are increasingly deployed in high-stakes applications, quantifying predictive uncertainty becomes critical for mitigating errors and enhancing trustworthiness. We propose a novel adaptive conformal methodology that calibrates prediction sets dynamically based on textual complexity and semantic coherence. Empirical evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the reliability of generated outputs while maintaining statistical validity under minimal assumptions. This work advances robust uncertainty quantification for next-generation NLP systems.
