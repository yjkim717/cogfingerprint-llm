This study investigates the efficacy of algorithmic prediction-based resource allocation in computational systems. We establish a formal model to analyze performance against aggregate allocation methods, with between-unit inequality and intervention budget as key parameters. Our theoretical and simulation-based results demonstrate a critical dependency: prediction-based allocation yields superior outcomes only under a specific conjunction of conditionsâ€”namely, low between-unit inequality and a high intervention budget. In high-inequality or low-budget regimes, its performance degrades, often falling below that of simpler aggregate strategies. These findings provide a crucial contingency framework for system designers, clarifying when the complexity of predictive modeling is justified for optimal resource distribution.
