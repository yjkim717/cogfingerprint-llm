**A Computational Framework for Systemic Risk Assessment in Digital Banking Networks: A Post-Pandemic Analysis**

**Abstract**

The COVID-19 pandemic precipitated an unprecedented and rapid digitization of financial services, fundamentally altering the operational landscape for commercial banks. While this shift enhanced accessibility, it concurrently introduced complex, technology-driven vulnerabilities that challenge traditional paradigms of bank performance and systemic stability. This study posits that a purely econometric analysis of bank risk and profitability is insufficient in the post-pandemic era; a computational perspective is required to model the emergent, network-based contagion risks inherent in highly interconnected digital banking ecosystems. We propose a novel, multi-modal computational framework that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with high-frequency transactional data to dynamically model and quantify systemic risk. The framework first constructs a temporal graph where nodes represent commercial banks and weighted, directed edges capture interbank payment flows and correlated digital service dependencies. A spatio-temporal GNN is then employed to learn latent representations of bank stability, capturing non-linear dependencies and propagation pathways for financial distress that are opaque to traditional econometric models like System GMM. We validate our framework using a curated dataset from a representative national banking sector, analyzing the period 2020-2024. Our results demonstrate that our model outperforms established benchmarks in predicting instances of liquidity shortfalls and operational inefficiencies triggered by simulated cyber-physical shocks. Furthermore, the model identifies key computational determinants of post-pandemic resilience, including network centrality, transaction graph entropy, and the robustness of API-driven service architectures. This research contributes to the fields of computational finance and fintech by providing a scalable, data-driven tool for regulators and financial institutions to proactively monitor stability, moving beyond lagging financial indicators towards a predictive, network-aware understanding of risk in the increasingly digital and automated financial system of 2024 and beyond.
