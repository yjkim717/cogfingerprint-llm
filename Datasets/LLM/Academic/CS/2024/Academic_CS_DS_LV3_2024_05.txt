This study critically examines the efficacy of algorithmic predictions in resource allocation for societal interventions. We demonstrate that the utility of prediction-based allocation is not universal but is contingent upon specific structural conditions. Through simulation and empirical analysis, we establish that such systems yield significant improvements in intervention efficacy primarily under two conditions: when between-unit inequality is low, thereby minimizing distributional skew, and when intervention budgets are sufficiently high to capitalize on predictive insights. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of algorithmic necessity, suggesting that in contexts of high inequality or constrained budgets, simpler allocation heuristics may be equally or more effective. This research provides a crucial framework for the conditional deployment of predictive algorithms in public policy and computational social science.
