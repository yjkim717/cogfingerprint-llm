In 2024, the computational linguistics community has intensified its focus on dialectal variation in natural language processing (NLP), confronting significant performance disparities that perpetuate linguistic inequity. This research addresses the critical gap in equitable language technologies by systematically evaluating contemporary deep learning architectures—including transformer-based models and their fine-tuned variants—on diverse dialectal benchmarks. Our analysis reveals that models pre-trained on standardized corpora exhibit markedly degraded performance on non-dominant dialects, particularly in morphological parsing, semantic role labeling, and named entity recognition tasks. To mitigate these disparities, we propose a multi-faceted framework integrating adversarial dialect adaptation and gradient reversal techniques during fine-tuning, coupled with linguistically-informed data augmentation strategies. Empirical evaluations across newly curated dialectal datasets demonstrate that our approach reduces performance variance by up to 37% compared to conventional transfer learning baselines, without compromising overall accuracy. These findings underscore the necessity of architectural innovations and equitable benchmark design to advance inclusive NLP systems, thereby establishing a new paradigm for fairness in multilingual and multidialectal processing.
