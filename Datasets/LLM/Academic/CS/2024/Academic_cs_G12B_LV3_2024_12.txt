**Abstract**

Causal discovery from observational data remains a computationally intensive challenge, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. This paper presents AcceleratedLiNGAM, a novel implementation designed to address the scalability limitations of the LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model) algorithm. We introduce a GPU-accelerated and parallelized architecture that leverages the inherent computational parallelism within LiNGAMâ€™s optimization process. Through extensive experimentation on large-scale datasets comprising thousands of variables, AcceleratedLiNGAM demonstrates substantial speedups compared to traditional CPU-based implementations, achieving order-of-magnitude reductions in runtime. Importantly, our implementation rigorously maintains the statistical guarantees underpinning LiNGAM, ensuring the validity of inferred causal relationships. The development of AcceleratedLiNGAM facilitates the application of causal discovery techniques to previously intractable datasets, opening avenues for advancements in fields ranging from bioinformatics to econometrics. Preliminary results indicate strong potential for further optimization and adaptation to non-linear causal models.
