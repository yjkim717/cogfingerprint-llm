**Abstract**

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) are a cornerstone of probabilistic graphical models for structured prediction in computer vision. However, a fundamental trade-off exists between model expressivity and computational tractability. Sparse CRFs, defined over local neighborhoods, are efficient for inference but fail to capture long-range dependencies. Conversely, dense CRFs model rich, non-local pixel interactions at a prohibitive computational cost, limiting their application to high-resolution imagery. This paper introduces a novel Sparse Non-Local CRF (SNL-CRF) that reconciles this dichotomy. Our model integrates sparsely distributed, yet long-range, connections within an otherwise sparse graph structure. This architecture selectively captures salient non-local contextual information—essential for tasks such as semantic segmentation and image denoising—while maintaining the efficient inference characteristic of sparse models. We demonstrate empirically that the SNL-CRF achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art dense CRFs on standard benchmarks, but with a significantly reduced computational footprint. This work establishes a new paradigm for designing efficient yet highly expressive graphical models for contemporary vision systems.
