Title: Evaluating Dialectal Diversity in NLP: A Survey of Models and Tasks

Abstract:
The proliferation of language technologies has underscored the need for robust natural language processing (NLP) models that can effectively handle dialectal variations. As dialects deviate from standard language norms, NLP tasks such as language modeling, sentiment analysis, and machine translation become increasingly challenging. This survey provides a comprehensive review of the performance of deep learning-based NLP models on dialectal datasets, highlighting their strengths and limitations. We examine the existing body of research in NLP for dialects, focusing on the development of dialect-specific models and the adaptation of standard NLP tasks to accommodate dialectal diversity. Our analysis reveals a notable gap in the availability of large-scale dialectal datasets and the need for more nuanced evaluation metrics. We discuss future research directions, including the integration of dialectal variation into mainstream NLP and the development of more inclusive language technologies.
