This paper investigates nonlocal diffusion processes with spatially varying kernels in bounded domains under Neumann boundary constraints. We analyze the asymptotic behavior as the interaction range vanishes, establishing rigorous convergence to classical elliptic operators. Our results demonstrate that anisotropic dispersal kernels yield symmetric second-order limits, generalizing prior homogenization findings. Applications to computational modeling of heterogeneous media are discussed.
