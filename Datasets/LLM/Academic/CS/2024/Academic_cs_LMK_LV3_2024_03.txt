Title: Approximating Optimal Revenue in Multi-Dimensional Auctions via Online Contention Resolution Schemes

Abstract:
In the realm of multi-buyer, multi-item auctions, achieving revenue maximization remains a pivotal challenge, particularly under subadditive buyer valuations. This paper introduces a novel Online Contention Resolution Scheme (OCRS) tailored to approximate the ex ante optimal revenue in sequential item pricing mechanisms. By leveraging the properties of subadditive valuations, our proposed multi-dimensional OCRS effectively navigates the complexities of buyer preferences and item interdependencies. We establish that our scheme achieves a provable approximation guarantee relative to the optimal ex ante revenue, thereby advancing the state-of-the-art in auction design. Our results underscore the efficacy of OCRS in managing contention in multi-dimensional auction environments, offering significant implications for the design of revenue-maximizing mechanisms in digital marketplaces as of 2024. The proposed framework contributes to the ongoing discourse on optimizing auction outcomes under complex valuation structures.
