**Abstract**

This paper introduces a novel framework for high-fidelity robot trajectory evaluation by formulating state estimation as an optimization problem on the SE₂(3) Lie group. Traditional metrics often decouple pose and velocity errors, leading to incomplete assessments of dynamic performance. Our approach unifies these elements within a single Riemannian metric on SE₂(3), which intrinsically models the coupling between rotational pose, translational position, and linear velocity. To achieve a continuous-time trajectory representation amenable to this metric, we employ Chebyshev polynomial interpolation for state reconstruction. This method provides superior approximation properties compared to linear assumptions. The trajectory is subsequently parameterized using a pseudospectral method, transforming the evaluation into a nonlinear programming problem that minimizes the integral squared error of the geodesic distance between estimated and ground-truth trajectories on the manifold. This formulation enables a holistic and physically meaningful comparison, rigorously accounting for kinematic constraints. Experimental results on wheeled robot and aerial vehicle datasets demonstrate that the proposed metric yields a more consistent and discriminating performance analysis than standard Euclidean or SE(3)-based methods, particularly in scenarios involving aggressive maneuvers and significant velocity discrepancies.
