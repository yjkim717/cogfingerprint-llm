"In 2024, we demonstrate a separation between learnability and private learnability under differential privacy. Specifically, we exhibit a class of distributions learnable to a target error ε via finite samples, yet not privately learnable under ε-differential privacy, with respect to total variation distance, highlighting a fundamental limitation in private distribution learning."
