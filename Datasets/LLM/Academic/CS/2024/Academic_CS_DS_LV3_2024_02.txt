In this work, we advance the theoretical foundations of Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) by establishing near-optimal Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds under significantly relaxed assumptions. Prior hardness results in the SQ model critically depended on stringent conditions related to the chi-squared norm of the non-Gaussian components. We demonstrate that such constraints are not fundamental to computational hardness. By leveraging refined moment-matching techniques, we prove that distributions satisfying specific moment conditions inherently induce query complexity barriers, even when chi-squared norm bounds are absent. Our analysis reveals that these moment-matching criteria suffice to construct hard instances where any SQ algorithm requires a super-polynomial number of queries to achieve non-trivial correlation with the hidden non-Gaussian direction. This result not only broadens the scope of provable SQ lower bounds for NGCA but also deepens the theoretical understanding of the interplay between distributional properties and computational tractability in high-dimensional statistics.
