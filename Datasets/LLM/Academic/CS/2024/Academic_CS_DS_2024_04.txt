**Abstract**

In the domain of algorithmic mechanism design, the challenge of maximizing revenue in multi-item auctions against strategic buyers with complex valuation functions remains a central pursuit. This work introduces a novel sequential pricing framework for environments with *m* heterogeneous items and a single buyer characterized by a subadditive valuation function—a natural model for complement-free preferences where the value of a bundle is at most the sum of its parts. We depart from the standard approach of competing against the elusive optimal Myersonian revenue by adopting the *ex ante relaxation* as our benchmark, which provides a tractable upper bound on the maximum achievable revenue.

Our primary contribution is the design of a *multi-dimensional Online Contention Resolution Scheme (OCRS)* that guides the sequential pricing process. The scheme carefully manages the inherent uncertainty in the buyer's stochastic consumption choices across items. We prove that this mechanism guarantees an expected revenue that approximates the ex ante benchmark within a factor of *O(log² m)*. This result significantly advances the state-of-the-art for sequential item pricing under subadditive valuations, demonstrating that near-optimal revenue can be extracted through a simple and practical sequential protocol without complex bundle pricing. The analysis hinges on new techniques for correlating prices across items to control the buyer's adaptive behavior, ensuring that the loss in revenue due to the sequential unveiling of prices is only polylogarithmic in the number of items. This establishes a powerful new connection between online selection algorithms and revenue-maximizing mechanisms.
