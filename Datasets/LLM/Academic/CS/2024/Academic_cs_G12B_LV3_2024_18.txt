**Abstract**

The accelerating integration of artificial intelligence (AI) within healthcare systems presents transformative opportunities alongside critical challenges. This paper examines the current landscape of AI-driven clinical practice, focusing on the computational advancements enabling improved diagnostic accuracy and workflow optimization. We analyze recent literature demonstrating the potential of machine learning models, particularly deep learning architectures, in areas such as medical image analysis, disease prediction, and personalized treatment planning. However, the deployment of these AI systems necessitates rigorous consideration of ethical and legal frameworks. This review investigates emergent concerns surrounding algorithmic bias, data privacy (specifically adhering to evolving HIPAA regulations and GDPR guidelines), and the accountability of AI-driven clinical decisions.  Furthermore, we explore the implications for professional liability and the evolving roles of healthcare practitioners in collaborative AI environments. The analysis concludes with a discussion of ongoing research aimed at developing explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance transparency and trust, alongside the need for standardized validation protocols and robust regulatory oversight to ensure responsible and equitable implementation of AI in clinical practice, ultimately maximizing patient benefit while mitigating potential risks.
