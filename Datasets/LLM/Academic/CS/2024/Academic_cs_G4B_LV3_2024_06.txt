**Abstract**

This research investigates the systemic vulnerabilities of Bangladeshi commercial banking sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic, employing a quantitative analysis of operational data from 2020-2023.  The study demonstrates a demonstrable increase in credit risk exposure and a concurrent decline in reported profitability within these institutions, attributable to macroeconomic shocks and disrupted operational paradigms.  However, analysis reveals a surprising counter-trend: enhanced operational efficiency, likely driven by accelerated digital transformation initiatives.  Crucially, the research identifies liquidity ratios, bank asset size, and prevailing macroeconomic indicators – specifically GDP growth and inflation – as significant predictors of post-pandemic performance resilience.  Furthermore, we model the impact of evolving regulatory frameworks on risk mitigation strategies.  These findings contribute to a broader understanding of financial system resilience in the face of exogenous shocks, offering valuable insights for policymakers and informing the design of adaptive risk management protocols within developing economies.
