**Abstract**

This paper introduces a novel Sparse Non-Local Conditional Random Field (SNL-CRF) model that reconciles the computational efficiency of sparse graphical structures with the powerful non-local contextual reasoning of dense CRFs. While Gaussian dense CRFs leverage long-range pixel interactions for superior segmentation and denoising, their quadratic complexity in pairwise connections is often prohibitive for high-resolution imagery. Conversely, traditional sparse CRFs with local connectivity, typically enforcing spatial coherence through short-range edge weights, fail to capture the global scene context essential for resolving ambiguities. Our proposed framework overcomes these limitations by constructing a sparse graph with a linear number of edges, yet it strategically preserves non-local connections by linking pixels based on feature affinity in a high-dimensional space, not just spatial proximity. This is achieved by integrating learned, data-dependent edge weights that modulate the influence of these long-range connections. Experimental validation on standard benchmarks demonstrates that the SNL-CRF achieves performance on par with its dense counterpart while reducing inference time by an order of magnitude, establishing a new state-of-the-art for efficient structured prediction in computer vision.
