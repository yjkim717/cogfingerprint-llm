Abstract: Cellpose3 (2024) introduces a paradigm-shifting framework that synergistically integrates image restoration with cellular segmentation to address pervasive challenges in microscopy data analysis. By training deep learning models to generate perceptually faithful yet structurally simplified outputs, the system transforms degraded inputs into optimally segmentable representations without compromising biological relevance. This generalist approach eliminates the need for application-specific tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse imaging modalities through perceptual similarity metrics that balance structural preservation with segmentation efficacy. The method's architectural innovation lies in its unified pipeline that jointly optimizes restoration and segmentation objectives, demonstrating significant improvements in boundary delineation and morphological accuracy. Implementation through both graphical interfaces and Python APIs provides researchers with one-click solutions that bridge the gap between computational complexity and practical usability, establishing new standards for accessible, high-throughput bioimage analysis.
