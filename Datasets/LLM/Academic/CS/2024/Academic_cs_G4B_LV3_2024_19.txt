**Abstract**

This paper presents a systematic review of recent developments in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), published within the last three years (2021-2024).  The burgeoning capabilities of GenAI, demonstrated across sectors including content creation, software development, and scientific research, necessitate a critical examination of their potential impacts.  Our analysis synthesizes current research to identify key application areas and associated challenges.  Crucially, we underscore the escalating imperative of Responsible AI (RAI) practices within this domain.  Specifically, we investigate the risks of bias amplification, misinformation generation, and potential misuse inherent in LLM architectures.  The review highlights the need for robust evaluation metrics and governance frameworks to mitigate these risks.  Ultimately, this systematic review argues that future GenAI development must prioritize ethical considerations alongside technical innovation, fostering a trajectory towards beneficial and trustworthy AI systems.
