Title: Enhancing Computer Vision with Sparse Non-Local CRF Models

Abstract:

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have been a cornerstone in computer vision for modeling complex dependencies between variables. However, traditional pairwise CRFs often struggle to capture long-range interactions, while non-local CRFs suffer from high computational costs. To address this, we propose a novel Sparse Non-Local CRF model that effectively balances efficiency and representational power. By introducing a sparsity-inducing regularization term, our model selectively establishes non-local connections between relevant variables, reducing computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on various computer vision tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. Our Sparse Non-Local CRF model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both traditional pairwise CRFs and dense non-local CRFs. The proposed model's ability to capture nuanced contextual relationships while maintaining computational tractability makes it an attractive solution for a wide range of computer vision applications in 2024 and beyond. Experimental results validate the superiority of our approach.
