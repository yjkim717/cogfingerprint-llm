**Abstract**

The unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated significant systemic vulnerabilities within financial sectors globally. This research investigates the impact of this exogenous shock on the operational landscape of commercial banks operating within Bangladesh, utilizing a quantitative analysis of post-pandemic performance data (2020-2023).  Our study identifies a complex interplay of risk factors and stability metrics, revealing a discernible shift in banking behavior following the initial outbreak. Specifically, we observe a demonstrable increase in credit risk exposure, evidenced by heightened non-performing loan ratios, alongside a concurrent decline in overall profitability attributable to reduced operational revenue and increased provisioning requirements. 

However, the analysis also highlights an unanticipated surge in operational efficiency – specifically, improvements in digital banking adoption rates and streamlined transaction processing – potentially driven by accelerated technological investment during the crisis.  These findings suggest a dynamic adaptation strategy by Bangladeshi banks to mitigate immediate financial strain.  Furthermore, we utilize a resilience modeling framework to assess the long-term risk-stability profile of these institutions, projecting potential vulnerabilities and identifying critical areas for regulatory oversight.  The results contribute to a growing body of literature concerning pandemic-induced financial stress and offer valuable insights for policymakers and banking supervisors navigating the post-COVID economic recovery in Bangladesh.
