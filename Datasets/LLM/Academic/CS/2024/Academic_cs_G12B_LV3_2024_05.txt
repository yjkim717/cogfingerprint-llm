**Abstract**

This study investigates the efficacy of algorithmic allocation strategies predicated on predictive modeling, specifically within the context of resource distribution and intervention design. While prediction-based approaches are increasingly favored for optimizing outcomes, our analysis reveals a nuanced relationship between predictive accuracy, between-unit inequality, and intervention budget constraints. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the performance advantage of algorithmic allocation over aggregate-level methods is contingent on low initial inequality across units and the availability of substantial intervention budgets.  When inequality is high or budgets are limited, the predictive gains are diminished, and aggregate allocation strategies can achieve comparable, or even superior, results. These findings challenge the widespread assumption of inherent superiority for prediction-driven resource allocation and highlight the importance of considering distributional factors and budgetary limitations when evaluating intervention efficacy.  Further research is warranted to explore robust allocation mechanisms capable of mitigating inequality and maximizing impact across diverse resource environments.
