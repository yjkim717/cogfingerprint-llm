**Deep Learning-Driven Computer Vision for Proactive Plant Health Management in Controlled Environment Agriculture: A Review and Future Directions**

Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA), particularly greenhouse systems, is undergoing a transformative shift driven by the adoption of precision farming techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the application of deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) methodologies for proactive plant health management within greenhouse environments. We analyze the current state-of-the-art, focusing on automated disease detection, phenotyping, and yield prediction leveraging image-based data acquired through various sensing modalities (RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral).  The review categorizes DL architectures commonly employed – including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and emerging Transformer-based models – and evaluates their performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, IoU) across diverse plant species and disease types.  

Crucially, we address the persistent challenges hindering broader adoption, namely limited and imbalanced datasets, computational resource constraints in edge deployment, and the need for robust models generalizable across varying environmental conditions and cultivar variability.  Furthermore, we explore the integration of CV with other sensor modalities (e.g., environmental data, soil moisture) through multimodal deep learning approaches for holistic plant health assessment.  Looking ahead, we identify key future research directions: the development of self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning techniques to mitigate data scarcity, the exploration of federated learning paradigms for collaborative model training while preserving data privacy, and the implementation of explainable AI (XAI) methods to enhance trust and facilitate human-machine collaboration in decision-making within smart farming systems. The ultimate goal is to enable real-time, data-driven interventions that optimize resource utilization and enhance crop resilience in the face of evolving agricultural challenges.
