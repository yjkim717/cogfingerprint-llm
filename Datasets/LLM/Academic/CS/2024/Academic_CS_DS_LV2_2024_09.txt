**Abstract**

The escalating global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases necessitates the development of robust, data-driven diagnostic tools to augment clinical decision-making. This research addresses the critical challenge of feature redundancy in high-dimensional medical datasets, which often degrades the performance and interpretability of predictive models. We propose a comprehensive machine learning framework for binary heart disease classification, predicated on a two-stage methodology. Initially, a rigorous comparative analysis of feature selection algorithms—including filter, wrapper, and embedded methods—is conducted to identify a minimal yet prognostically significant subset of clinical and demographic features. This curated feature set is then utilized to train and evaluate a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, selected for its efficacy in constructing optimal hyperplanes within complex, non-linear feature spaces. The model is benchmarked against other prominent classification algorithms, such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, to establish a performance baseline. Empirical validation on the publicly available Cleveland Heart Disease dataset demonstrates that our feature-optimized SVM model achieves superior predictive accuracy, alongside enhanced computational efficiency and model transparency. The findings substantiate the thesis that strategic dimensionality reduction is paramount for constructing reliable clinical decision support systems, offering a viable pathway for early and accurate non-invasive heart disease risk assessment.
