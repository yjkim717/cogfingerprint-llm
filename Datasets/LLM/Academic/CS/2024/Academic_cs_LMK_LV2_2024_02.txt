Title: Near-Optimal Statistical Query Lower Bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis under Moment-Matching Conditions

Abstract:
We establish near-optimal Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) under the moment-matching condition, a widely adopted assumption in the NGCA literature. NGCA is a fundamental problem in unsupervised learning, aiming to identify a subspace where the data distribution deviates from Gaussianity. By leveraging the chi-squared norm, we derive SQ lower bounds that quantify the minimum computational resources required to solve NGCA. Our analysis relies on the moment-matching condition, which ensures that the first few moments of the data distribution match those of a Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that any SQ algorithm that solves NGCA must incur a query complexity that is at least nearly polynomial in the dimensionality of the data. Our results provide a rigorous understanding of the computational hardness of NGCA and have implications for the design of efficient algorithms in this domain.
