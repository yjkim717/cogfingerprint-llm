**Abstract: The Expanding Landscape of Natural Language Processing for Language Dialects – A 2024 Survey**

The burgeoning field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) increasingly recognizes the significance of language variation, specifically encompassing diverse dialects. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of research trends in NLP addressing dialectal language, charting developments from 2014 to 2023 and highlighting key advancements anticipated for 2024. We categorize research based on core NLP tasks – Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) – examining the datasets employed, methodologies utilized, and performance metrics achieved.

A central theme is the integration of machine learning, with a pronounced shift towards deep learning architectures, including transformers and recurrent neural networks. We detail the application of these techniques to tasks such as dialect identification, speech recognition adaptation, and cross-dialectal machine translation.  Notably, the availability and quality of dialect-specific corpora remain a critical bottleneck, and the survey critically assesses current efforts to address this challenge, emphasizing the need for standardized annotation schemes and data augmentation strategies. 

Finally, we explore emerging research directions, anticipating increased focus on low-resource dialectal NLP, incorporating pragmatic knowledge, and developing robust evaluation protocols suitable for the nuanced characteristics of dialectal variation.
