**Abstract**

The integration of deep learning (DL) with computer vision (CV) is precipitating a paradigm shift in precision agriculture, particularly within the controlled environments of greenhouses. This review systematically analyzes the current landscape of DL-based CV applications dedicated to autonomous greenhouse management. We critically examine state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) for core tasks, including high-frequency plant growth monitoring through semantic segmentation and the early detection of biotic and abiotic stresses. While these methodologies demonstrate significant promise in enhancing yield prediction and optimizing resource allocation, their deployment faces substantial impediments. Key challenges identified include the scarcity of large-scale, annotated horticultural datasets, the computational constraints of edge-device deployment for real-time inference, and the limited model generalizability across diverse crop species and growth stages. We argue that future research must prioritize the development of lightweight, self-supervised architectures and robust multi-modal fusion techniques, integrating visual data with non-visual sensor streams. Addressing these directions is critical for transitioning these technologies from experimental validation to scalable, economically viable solutions that bolster the sustainability and productivity of modern greenhouse agriculture.
