Title: Enhancing Equitability in NLP: A Survey on Dialectal Dataset Performance and Future Directions

Abstract:
The proliferation of language technologies has underscored the need for equitable Natural Language Processing (NLP) models that cater to diverse linguistic variations. As of 2024, a significant body of research has focused on assessing the performance of NLP models on dialectal datasets across various tasks and languages. This survey synthesizes existing literature on the subject, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in developing NLP systems that are inclusive of dialectal variations. We examine the efficacy of current NLP models on dialectal datasets, identifying biases and performance disparities. Furthermore, we discuss emerging approaches to building more equitable language technologies, including data augmentation techniques and multilingual models. Our analysis underscores the importance of dialectal inclusivity in NLP, paving the way for future research directions that prioritize fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI-driven language processing.
