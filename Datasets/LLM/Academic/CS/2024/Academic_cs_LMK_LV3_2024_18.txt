Title: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Clinical Practice: A Review of Applications, Benefits, and Ethical Imperatives

Abstract:
The burgeoning integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical practice is transforming healthcare delivery across various medical specialties. As AI technologies continue to evolve, their applications in diagnostics, personalized medicine, and predictive analytics have shown significant promise in enhancing patient outcomes and streamlining clinical workflows. This literature review synthesizes current research on the adoption of AI in clinical settings, highlighting its potential to revolutionize healthcare innovation. However, the increasing reliance on AI-driven solutions also raises critical ethical considerations, including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and accountability. Addressing these concerns is essential to ensure the responsible development and deployment of AI in healthcare. As of 2024, it is imperative to establish robust frameworks that balance the benefits of AI with the need for transparency, fairness, and patient-centered care, thereby fostering trust in AI-driven clinical decision-making.
