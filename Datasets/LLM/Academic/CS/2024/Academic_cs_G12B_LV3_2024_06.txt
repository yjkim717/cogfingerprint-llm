**Abstract**

This study investigates the multifaceted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the financial performance of commercial banks operating within Bangladesh, a context exhibiting unique socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Utilizing a panel dataset spanning 2018-2023, we examine the interplay between pandemic-induced shocks, bank-specific characteristics, and macroeconomic conditions on key performance indicators including risk-adjusted returns, capital adequacy, and operational efficiency. Our analysis reveals a complex dynamic: while profitability demonstrably declined amidst heightened uncertainty, banks exhibited enhanced operational efficiency, potentially driven by accelerated digital transformation and algorithmic optimization of risk management protocols. Furthermore, we identify critical determinants of post-COVID resilience, including pre-existing digital infrastructure, loan portfolio diversification, and regulatory interventions. These findings highlight the necessity for developing robust, data-driven risk assessment models, incorporating pandemic-specific variables, to enhance the stability and resilience of financial institutions in emerging economies, particularly as future systemic shocks become increasingly probable. The insights contribute to the growing body of literature on algorithmic finance and the adaptive capacity of financial systems.
