**Abstract**

The rigorous evaluation of supervised machine learning models remains a critical challenge in contemporary computer science. This work presents a detailed examination of evaluation metrics and statistical hypothesis testing methodologies employed for robust model comparison and performance assessment. We delineate established metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), contextualizing their applicability across diverse supervised learning paradigms. Furthermore, we explore statistical tests such as the paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and McNemar's test, emphasizing their role in determining the statistical significance of observed performance differences. To illustrate these concepts, we provide concrete examples utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to medical image analysis, demonstrating the practical utility of these techniques. This comprehensive overview equips researchers and practitioners with the necessary tools for principled model selection and validation in the evolving landscape of machine learning, particularly as model complexity and data volume continue to increase.
