Title: Enhancing Robot State Estimation with SE2(3) Lie Group and Pseudospectral Parameterization

Abstract:
This paper presents a novel evaluation metric for robot state estimation algorithms, leveraging the SE2(3) Lie group to incorporate linear velocity into the assessment framework. By utilizing the SE2(3) Lie group, we effectively capture the complexities of robot motion in 3D space. We introduce Chebyshev interpolation and pseudospectral parameterization to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of state estimation. Our approach enables a more comprehensive evaluation of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms, accounting for both pose and velocity estimation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed metric in assessing the performance of robot state estimation algorithms. The integration of SE2(3) Lie group and pseudospectral parameterization offers a robust and precise framework for evaluating SLAM algorithms, paving the way for advancements in autonomous robotics. Our findings are validated through rigorous simulations and real-world experiments conducted in 2024.
