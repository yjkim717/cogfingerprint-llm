**Detecting Algorithmic Collusion Through Dynamic Statistical Auditing of Pricing Strategies**

The increasing prevalence of autonomous pricing algorithms presents novel challenges for competition law enforcement. Traditional methods of detecting collusion are often ill-suited to analyze the complex, data-driven decision-making processes embedded within these systems. This paper introduces a novel framework for detecting algorithmic collusion through dynamic statistical auditing of pricing behavior. Our approach moves beyond static analysis by incorporating temporal dependencies and adapting audit parameters based on observed market conditions. We define a statistical audit protocol centered on detecting supra-competitive prices that deviate significantly from predicted equilibrium pricing under conditions of independent algorithmic behavior.  The protocol utilizes sequential hypothesis testing, iteratively refining estimates of expected market behavior and evaluating deviations with adjusted significance levels.  We formally characterize the conditions under which the audit can effectively distinguish between independent and collusive algorithmic strategies, accounting for factors such as algorithm learning rates and the degree of market opacity.  Furthermore, we present a practical implementation leveraging time-series analysis and anomaly detection techniques. Empirical evaluations, simulated on datasets representing various market structures and algorithm configurations, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in identifying collusive behavior with high accuracy and minimal false positives. This research contributes a crucial tool for regulatory bodies seeking to proactively monitor and mitigate anti-competitive practices arising from the deployment of autonomous pricing systems in the evolving digital economy.
