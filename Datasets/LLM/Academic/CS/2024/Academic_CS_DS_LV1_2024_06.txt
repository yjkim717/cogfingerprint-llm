**A Computational Risk-Stability Analysis of Banking System Resilience: A Post-Pandemic Evaluation Framework**

**Year: 2024**

The global COVID-19 pandemic constituted a profound, exogenous shock to financial systems, serving as a critical stress test for the operational resilience and risk-bearing capacity of commercial banks. This paper presents a computational framework for a multi-faceted risk-stability analysis of the banking sector, drawing empirical insights from the Bangladeshi context as a representative emerging economy. We posit that the pandemic period induced a complex, non-linear perturbation in traditional bank performance metrics, decoupling conventional risk-return equilibria. To model this, we leverage a high-dimensional, longitudinal dataset encompassing financial statements and macroeconomic indicators from 2018-2023. Our methodology employs an ensemble of machine learning models, including Gradient Boosting for feature importance analysis and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal pattern recognition, to dissect the pandemic's impact.

Our empirical findings reveal a critical tripartite effect: a significant increase in systemic risk exposure and a contraction in profitability (ROA, ROE), concurrent with a paradoxical improvement in operational efficiency, measured via a novel Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) metric that incorporates digital transaction throughput. This suggests that while financial stability was compromised, forced digitalization and process automation led to short-term efficiency gains. Crucially, our post-hoc analysis identifies liquidity buffers (as a proxy for system robustness) and institutional scale (a composite metric of asset size and digital infrastructure) as the most salient determinants of post-shock performance and recovery trajectory. The study concludes by proposing a deterministic, agent-based simulation model that integrates these determinants to forecast banking sector stability under future systemic shocks, thereby contributing a predictive tool for regulators and a validated computational lens for understanding financial system resilience in the face of black-swan events.
