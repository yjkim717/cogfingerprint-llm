Title: Advancing Smart Greenhouse Agriculture through Deep Learning-Assisted Computer Vision: A Review of Recent Advancements and Future Directions

Abstract:
The integration of deep learning-assisted computer vision techniques in smart greenhouse agriculture has revolutionized data-driven decision-making in controlled environment agriculture. As of 2024, the proliferation of sensor technologies and imaging modalities has led to an unprecedented availability of visual data in greenhouse environments. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the recent advancements in deep learning-based computer vision techniques tailored for smart greenhouse agriculture, with a focus on crop monitoring, disease detection, and yield prediction. We examine the challenges associated with deploying these techniques in real-world greenhouse settings, including issues related to data quality, annotation, and model interpretability. Furthermore, we identify future trends and opportunities for research, including the development of multimodal fusion techniques and edge AI solutions. Our analysis aims to inform the development of more efficient and effective computer vision systems for smart greenhouse agriculture.
