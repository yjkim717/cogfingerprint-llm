**Abstract**

The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly large language models (LLMs) and diffusion-based image synthesis systems, necessitates a systematic analysis of their capabilities and societal implications. This review synthesizes cutting-edge research from 2022-2024 to map the architectural evolution of transformer-based and generative adversarial networks. We critically evaluate performance benchmarks in conditional text generation and multimodal tasks, such as text-to-image translation, highlighting emergent abilities in contextual reasoning and stylistic control. However, the operationalization of these models exposes significant challenges, including the propagation of biases embedded in training corpora, vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, and the high computational cost of model refinement. Consequently, this paper argues that the trajectory of GenAI is inextricably linked to the parallel development of Responsible AI (RAI) frameworks. We propose a consolidated framework integrating robust evaluation metrics, algorithmic auditing for fairness, and energy-efficient training paradigms. The findings underscore that advancing the technical frontiers of GenAI must be concomitant with a principled approach to ensure its ethical and sustainable integration into socio-technical systems.
