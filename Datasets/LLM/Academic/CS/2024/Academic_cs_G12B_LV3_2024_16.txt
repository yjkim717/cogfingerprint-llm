**Abstract:**

The increasing prevalence of pre-trained language models (LLMs) has expanded the scope of natural language processing (NLP) but has also highlighted critical limitations in dialect representation and equitable technological outcomes. This paper surveys the current landscape of NLP research addressing language dialects, analyzing existing datasets and methodologies applied to both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language generation (NLG) tasks. We identify a significant bias towards standardized language varieties within current benchmarks, leading to suboptimal performance and potential marginalization of speakers of under-represented dialects.  Furthermore, we argue for a re-evaluation of existing LLM benchmarks and propose architectural modifications to mitigate these biases and promote more inclusive language technologies.  Our analysis underscores the urgent need for dialect-aware NLP research to ensure fairness and accessibility in language-driven applications, contributing to a more equitable future for language technology in 2024.
