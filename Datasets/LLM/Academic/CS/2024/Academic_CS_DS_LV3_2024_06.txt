**A Computational Framework for Modeling Systemic Risk and Operational Resilience in Banking Networks: A Post-Pandemic Analysis**

The COVID-19 pandemic constituted an unprecedented, global-scale stress test for financial systems, compelling a re-evaluation of traditional risk-assessment models. This 2024 study posits that the pandemic's impact on commercial banks—characterized by a well-documented triad of heightened systemic risk, diminished profitability, and paradoxical gains in operational efficiency—cannot be fully apprehended through conventional econometric analysis alone. We argue that the complex, non-linear interdependencies within the banking sector and the macroeconomic environment necessitate a computational modeling approach. This research introduces a novel multi-agent simulation framework integrated with machine learning (ML) techniques to deconstruct the post-pandemic performance determinants of banking institutions. The model conceptualizes individual commercial banks as autonomous agents whose interactions—governed by policies on liquidity provision, credit issuance, and capital reserves—generate emergent system-wide stability or fragility. We calibrate this framework using a high-frequency dataset from a representative emerging market, mirroring the context of Gupta's (2024) study on Bangladeshi banks. Our computational experiments isolate two critical, algorithmically identifiable drivers of post-crisis outcomes: first, the *liquidity contagion threshold*, a network-derived metric that predicts failure cascades more accurately than static balance-sheet ratios; and second, the *operational efficiency frontier*, where process automation and digital service adoption, accelerated by the pandemic, served as a buffer against profitability erosion. The model demonstrates that macroeconomic shocks function as forcing functions that expose latent structural vulnerabilities within the digital-financial ecosystem. The primary contribution of this work is a predictive RegTech tool that enables regulators and financial institutions to perform dynamic stress-testing under simulated crisis conditions, moving beyond static compliance to proactive resilience engineering. This computational lens provides a foundational paradigm for building more antifragile banking systems capable of withstanding future, similarly disruptive global events.
