**Abstract**

The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) necessitates a systematic evaluation of its capabilities, methodologies, and associated ethical implications. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of nine contemporary GenAI tools, selected for their architectural diversity and prominence in the 2024 landscape. Our investigation is structured around a dual-axis framework. First, we quantitatively and qualitatively assess the performance of these tools across a spectrum of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, summarization, and complex question-answering. We analyze their proficiency in handling semantic coherence, contextual reasoning, and domain-specific knowledge retrieval. Second, we pivot to the operational and societal dimensions, critically examining the AI planning techniques that underpin these systems, such as chain-of-thought prompting and retrieval-augmented generation, to elucidate their role in steering model output and ensuring goal-directed behavior.

Our findings reveal a significant performance gradient among the tools, with transformer-based models exhibiting superior NLP fluency, while others demonstrate strengths in specialized planning and constraint satisfaction. Crucially, this technical analysis is juxtaposed with a rigorous dissection of emergent ethical challenges, including the propagation of biases embedded in training corpora, the potential for generating convincing misinformation, and concerns regarding data provenance and intellectual property. We argue that the integration of robust, transparent AI planning is not merely an engineering concern but a prerequisite for accountable and ethically-aligned GenAI deployment. This study provides a critical benchmark for researchers and practitioners, highlighting the inextricable link between technical sophistication and responsible innovation in the ongoing development of generative models.
