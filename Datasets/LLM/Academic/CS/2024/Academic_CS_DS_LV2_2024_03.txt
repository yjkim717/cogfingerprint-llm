**Abstract**

The problem of maximizing revenue when selling multiple heterogeneous items to buyers with complex valuation functions remains a central challenge in algorithmic mechanism design. While significant progress has been made for simpler classes like additive valuations, the setting with subadditive buyers—a natural model for items with diminishing marginal utility—has proven substantially more difficult. A prominent approach for such multi-dimensional environments is the use of Sequential Item Pricing (SIP), where the seller posts a price for each item upon its arrival. The key challenge is to design these price sequences to compete against the powerful benchmark of the *ex ante* optimal revenue, which relaxes the requirement to serve all buyers simultaneously.

In this work, we introduce a novel multi-dimensional Online Contention Resolution Scheme (OCRS) that directly addresses this challenge. An OCRS provides a framework for making sequential, irrevocable decisions under uncertainty, making it ideally suited for the adversarial order of item arrivals in a SIP. Our primary contribution is the construction of such a scheme that carefully coordinates the pricing decisions across all items and buyers. We prove that our mechanism, which leverages this OCRS to set prices, guarantees an expected revenue that achieves an \(O(\log^2 m)\)-approximation to the ex ante benchmark, where \(m\) is the number of items. This result significantly advances the state-of-the-art for revenue maximization with subadditive buyers, demonstrating that simple and practical sequential pricing mechanisms can, with a carefully designed online selection rule, yield near-optimal performance guarantees against strong theoretical benchmarks.
