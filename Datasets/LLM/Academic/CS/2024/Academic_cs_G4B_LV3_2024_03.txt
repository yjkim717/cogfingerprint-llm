**Abstract**

Recent advancements in multi-dimensional pricing necessitate robust mechanisms for revenue maximization within competitive online environments. This paper introduces a novel Online Contention Resolution Scheme (OCRS), termed “Logarithmic-OCRS,” designed to address limitations present in existing approaches. Logarithmic-OCRS leverages approximation algorithms to achieve an $O(\log^2 m)$ approximation factor, where *m* represents the number of items available for sale.  Crucially, the scheme accounts for subadditive values inherent in consumer preferences, a significant challenge in multi-buyer scenarios.  We demonstrate that Logarithmic-OCRS’s logarithmic dependence on item count provides a substantial improvement over prior OCRS constructions, offering a more scalable and efficient solution for maximizing revenue.  Further analysis reveals the scheme’s sensitivity to multi-dimensional pricing strategies, warranting continued investigation into its practical implementation and broader applicability across dynamic pricing systems.
