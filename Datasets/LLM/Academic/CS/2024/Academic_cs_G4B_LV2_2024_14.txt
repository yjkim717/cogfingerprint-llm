**Abstract**

The increasing demand for sustainable food production necessitates innovative approaches to agricultural management. This review synthesizes recent advancements in deep learning-assisted computer vision techniques specifically targeted at optimizing greenhouse environments, a critical area within smart greenhouse technology.  Traditional methods of crop monitoring and yield prediction often rely on manual data collection, presenting limitations in scalability and real-time responsiveness.  Consequently, we explore the burgeoning application of deep neural networks – including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) – to automate these processes. 

Specifically, this work investigates the deployment of data-driven methodologies for growth monitoring, leveraging image analysis to assess plant health, identify nutrient deficiencies, and track morphological development. Furthermore, we examine techniques for yield estimation, utilizing trained models to predict harvest quantities based on visual data acquired from within the controlled environment.  The integration of temporal data, through RNN architectures, is considered crucial for capturing dynamic growth patterns. 

Challenges remain in addressing issues of data variability within greenhouse settings, including lighting conditions and environmental fluctuations. Future research directions are highlighted, focusing on robust model training strategies utilizing transfer learning and synthetic data augmentation.  Ultimately, the successful implementation of these deep learning approaches promises to significantly enhance operational efficiency, resource utilization, and overall productivity within greenhouse agriculture, contributing to more sustainable and resilient food systems by 2024 and beyond.
