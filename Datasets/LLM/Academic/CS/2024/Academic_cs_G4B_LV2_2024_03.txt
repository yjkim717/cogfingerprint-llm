**Abstract: Approximating Ex-Ante Optimal Revenue in Multi-Buyer, Multi-Item Pricing with a Multi-Dimensional Online Contentious Resolution Scheme**

This paper addresses the challenging problem of revenue maximization in dynamic pricing environments involving multiple buyers and items, exacerbated by the presence of subadditive buyers. Traditional optimal pricing strategies often falter in these scenarios due to the complexities introduced by contention resolution and buyer behavior. We propose a novel multi-dimensional Online Contentious Resolution Scheme (OCRS) designed to approximate ex-ante optimal revenue, offering a significant advancement over existing approaches. 

Our methodology leverages a sequential item pricing strategy, iteratively adjusting prices based on observed buyer responses and contention levels.  Crucially, we introduce a fractional relaxation technique to handle the inherent duality in the optimization problem, enabling efficient computation within a logarithmic time complexity – specifically, $O(\log^2 m)$, where *m* denotes the number of items.  This approximation factor represents a substantial improvement, particularly as the number of items increases. 

The theoretical analysis demonstrates the convergence properties of our OCRS, highlighting its robustness against subadditive buyer preferences.  Empirical simulations validate the proposed scheme’s effectiveness, showcasing its ability to approach optimal revenue while maintaining computational feasibility.  This research contributes a practical and theoretically grounded framework for revenue management in increasingly complex multi-item, multi-buyer pricing scenarios, offering valuable insights for future algorithmic development.
