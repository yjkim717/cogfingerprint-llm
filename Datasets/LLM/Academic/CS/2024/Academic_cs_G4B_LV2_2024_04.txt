**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of algorithmic pricing strategies necessitates robust regulatory oversight to mitigate the risk of collusion and maintain competitive market dynamics. This paper introduces a novel framework for regulatory audits of pricing algorithms, designed to proactively identify instances of coordinated behavior without unduly restricting data utilization by sellers. Our approach leverages statistical complexity analysis to assess the inherent non-collusive nature of algorithmic pricing models. Specifically, we propose a methodology for quantifying the statistical distance between observed price distributions and those predicted by a non-collusive benchmark.  Deviations exceeding a pre-defined threshold trigger further investigation.  This audit process aims to provide a scalable and adaptable mechanism for detecting algorithmic collusion, informing regulatory decisions and fostering trust in dynamic pricing environments.  Future work will explore the integration of explainable AI techniques to enhance audit transparency and address concerns regarding algorithmic opacity, culminating in a practical tool for 2024 and beyond.
