**Abstract**

The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in 2024 necessitates a rigorous examination of their impact on core areas of computer science. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of nine contemporary generative AI tools, focusing on their capabilities within Natural Language Processing (NLP) and their implications for AI planning methodologies. We analyze the advancements facilitated by these models, particularly in areas such as text generation, dialogue systems, and automated task decomposition. Furthermore, we investigate emerging AI planning techniques that leverage generative AI for enhanced strategic decision-making and goal achievement. Critically, this work addresses the substantial ethical and regulatory challenges arising from widespread adoption, specifically concerning bias mitigation, intellectual property rights, and the potential for misuse within human-computer interaction paradigms. We conclude by outlining future research directions focused on developing robust, ethically aligned generative AI systems and establishing guidelines for responsible innovation within this transformative technological landscape.
