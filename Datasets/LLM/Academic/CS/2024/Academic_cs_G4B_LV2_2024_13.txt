**Abstract**

Contemporary artificial neural networks (ANNs) frequently struggle with systematic generalization and catastrophic forgetting, limitations fundamentally rooted in their reliance on gradient-based training and static parameter representations. This work investigates a novel approach leveraging metalearning techniques to mitigate these persistent challenges. Specifically, we propose an architecture incorporating incentive signals and targeted practice, designed to induce robust, transferable knowledge acquisition. Our framework posits that judiciously designed incentives can steer the learning process towards more generalizable feature representations, while iterative practice, informed by meta-learning algorithms, facilitates systematic generalization across diverse tasks. 

Preliminary results demonstrate a significant reduction in catastrophic forgetting – the tendency for networks to abruptly lose previously learned information upon encountering new data – alongside improved performance on out-of-distribution generalization. We hypothesize that this enhanced stability arises from the meta-learned optimization strategy effectively constructing a flexible internal model capable of adapting without compromising established knowledge. Future research will focus on quantifying the interplay between incentive design, practice schedules, and network architecture to further refine this approach and establish a theoretical understanding of its efficacy.
