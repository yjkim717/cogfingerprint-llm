Title: Advancements in Deep Learning-Enabled Computer Vision for Smart Greenhouse Agricultural Practices

Abstract:

The integration of deep learning-enabled computer vision techniques in smart greenhouse environments has revolutionized agricultural practices, facilitating data-driven decision-making. This review examines recent advancements in computer vision applications for greenhouses, with a focus on deep learning architectures. We analyze the current state-of-the-art in image-based crop monitoring, disease detection, and yield prediction, highlighting the role of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning. The challenges associated with deploying computer vision systems in greenhouse settings, including variability in lighting conditions, occlusion, and dataset bias, are also discussed. Furthermore, we explore the potential of emerging techniques, such as explainable AI and edge AI, to enhance the interpretability and efficiency of computer vision systems. Our analysis provides insights into the opportunities and limitations of deep learning-enabled computer vision for smart greenhouse agriculture, informing future research directions and practical applications in this rapidly evolving field.
