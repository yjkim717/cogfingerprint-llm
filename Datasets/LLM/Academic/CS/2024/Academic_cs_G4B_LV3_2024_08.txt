**Abstract**

Accurate robot state estimation is paramount for robust autonomous navigation and control. This paper presents a refined metric for evaluating state estimation algorithms, leveraging the SE2(3) Lie group to represent robot poses and Chebyshev interpolation for precise velocity estimation.  Traditional metrics often lack interpretability and fail to capture nuanced performance differences. We introduce a novel approach employing pseudospectral parameterization within Chebyshev interpolation, enhancing the fidelity of linear velocity reconstruction.  This methodology allows for a quantitative assessment of state estimation accuracy, providing insights into algorithm behavior during trajectory analysis.  Our technique demonstrably improves the ability to discern subtle performance variations between state estimation techniques, particularly in scenarios with rapid kinematic changes.  Preliminary results suggest this metric facilitates more targeted algorithm development and comparative analysis within the robotics community, contributing to advancements in real-time state estimation in 2024 and beyond.
