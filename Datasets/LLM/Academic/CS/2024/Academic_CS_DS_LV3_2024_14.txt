**Abstract**

The integration of deep learning with computer vision is fundamentally transforming the paradigm of smart greenhouse agriculture, enabling unprecedented levels of automation and precision. This 2024 review critically synthesizes recent methodological advancements in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and multimodal data fusion techniques tailored for the controlled yet complex greenhouse environment. We systematically analyze their deployment across three core applications: non-invasive, high-frequency growth monitoring through 3D reconstruction and biomass estimation; early and accurate disease detection by classifying spectral and morphological anomalies in plant leaves; and predictive yield estimation using temporal sequence models. Our analysis identifies significant challenges that impede widespread commercial adoption, including the acute scarcity of large-scale, annotated horticultural datasets, the computational constraints for real-time inference on edge devices, and the limited model generalizability across diverse crop species and cultivation conditions. We argue that future research must prioritize the development of lightweight, energy-efficient architectures, self-supervised learning to mitigate data bottlenecks, and robust cross-domain adaptation frameworks. By addressing these critical gaps, the next generation of deep learning-assisted vision systems holds the potential to significantly enhance crop resilience, optimize resource allocation, and secure global food production in the face of escalating climatic pressures.
