**Abstract**

The escalating global burden of cardiovascular diseases necessitates the development of robust, data-driven diagnostic tools to augment clinical decision-making. While machine learning (ML) models, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVMs), have demonstrated considerable promise in this domain, their efficacy is often compromised by high-dimensional, redundant feature spaces inherent to medical datasets. This research addresses this critical challenge by proposing a hybrid computational framework that synergistically integrates advanced feature selection (FS) techniques with a refined SVM classifier for enhanced heart disease prediction. We posit that intelligent feature subspace identification is paramount to improving model generalizability and interpretability. Our methodology employs a two-stage FS pipeline: initially, a filter method (Mutual Information) rapidly eliminates non-informative features, followed by a wrapper method (Recursive Feature Elimination) to identify a minimal, high-discriminatory feature subset. This curated feature set is then used to train a non-linear SVM with a radial basis function kernel, optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning. The proposed framework was rigorously evaluated on the publicly available Cleveland Heart Disease dataset and benchmarked against monolithic SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression baselines. Empirical results from a stratified 10-fold cross-validation confirm our hypothesis: the integrated FS-SVM model achieved a superior mean accuracy of 94.7% and an F1-score of 0.93, significantly outperforming baseline models while utilizing 60% fewer features. This study conclusively demonstrates that a principled feature selection paradigm is not merely a pre-processing step but a critical component for building parsimonious, high-performance diagnostic systems, thereby contributing a validated computational tool for precision cardiology.
