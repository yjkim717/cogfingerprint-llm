**Abstract**

The integration of deep learning with advanced computer vision systems is progressively transforming the operational paradigms of modern greenhouse agriculture. This paper investigates the synergistic application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers for the dual-purpose tasks of non-invasive plant growth analysis and pre-symptomatic disease identification. By processing high-resolution multispectral image streams, these models facilitate the automated extraction of phenotypic traits, such as biomass accumulation and leaf area index, while simultaneously detecting subtle spectral anomalies indicative of biotic stress. However, the deployment of such data-driven systems in controlled environments faces significant hurdles, including the need for large, domain-specific annotated datasets and model robustness to varying illumination and plant occlusion. This discussion delineates these computational challenges and posits future research trajectories focused on self-supervised learning for label-efficient model training and the development of lightweight architectures suitable for edge computing on distributed sensor networks. The ultimate objective is to catalyze a shift towards fully autonomous, precision-controlled greenhouse ecosystems that optimize resource allocation and enhance crop resilience.
