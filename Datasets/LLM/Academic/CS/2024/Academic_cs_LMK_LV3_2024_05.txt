Optimizing prediction-based resource allocations necessitates a nuanced understanding of treatment effect heterogeneity and between-unit inequality. This study (2024) demonstrates that the efficacy of algorithmic fairness in resource allocation is contingent upon mitigating inequality and ensuring sufficient intervention budgets. Empirical analysis reveals that high-budget interventions can offset the detrimental effects of between-unit heterogeneity, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of prediction-based allocations.
