**Abstract:**

Recent advancements in artificial neural networks (ANNs) have encountered limitations in achieving robust generalization and efficient adaptation to novel tasks. Traditional approaches often rely on emergent properties arising from extensive training data, a strategy that proves computationally expensive and may not consistently yield desired performance. This paper investigates the burgeoning field of metalearning as a paradigm shift in ANN training, specifically focusing on methodologies that incorporate explicit incentive structures and iterative practice schedules. Unlike conventional training regimes, these metalearning techniques actively guide the learning process, fostering skill acquisition and accelerating convergence. We analyze several contemporary metalearning architectures, evaluating their efficacy in promoting rapid adaptation and enhanced cognitive abilities within ANNs. Furthermore, we discuss the theoretical implications of incentivized practice on neural network representational learning and highlight promising avenues for future research, particularly concerning the design of task-specific reward functions and the development of more sophisticated meta-optimization strategies to optimize practice schedules.
