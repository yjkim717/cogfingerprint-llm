**Abstract**

Recent advances in contrastive learning, exemplified by models like CLIP, have demonstrated impressive multimodal alignment capabilities. However, a critical limitation remains: a lack of mechanistic understanding regarding the internal representations driving these alignments. This work introduces a “second-order lens” – a novel analytical framework – to probe the operational dynamics of CLIP’s neuron populations. We demonstrate that seemingly straightforward activations exhibit significant ‘second-order effects,’ manifesting as indirect influences across the text-image space.  Specifically, we identify instances of polysemantic neuron behavior, whereby individual neurons contribute to multiple, potentially conflicting, representations.  Crucially, this analysis reveals vulnerabilities exploitable through adversarial example generation, suggesting a pathway to induce targeted model misclassification.  Further investigation into these emergent properties is essential for robust and interpretable multimodal AI systems in 2024.
