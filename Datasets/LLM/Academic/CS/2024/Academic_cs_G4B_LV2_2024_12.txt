**Abstract: AcceleratedLiNGAM â€“ A GPU-Accelerated Framework for Causal Discovery in Gene Expression Analysis**

Causal discovery methods are increasingly vital for elucidating biological mechanisms, particularly within the complex landscape of gene expression data. However, traditional LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model) algorithms often struggle with the computational demands imposed by large datasets. This paper introduces AcceleratedLiNGAM, a novel framework designed to overcome these limitations through GPU acceleration and a modified direct LiNGAM implementation. We demonstrate a significant enhancement in processing speed, attributable to the parallelization of core LiNGAM computations leveraging modern GPU architectures. 

Specifically, AcceleratedLiNGAM optimizes the iterative estimation process, reducing runtime while maintaining the statistical rigor of the original LiNGAM approach. Preliminary results, applied to publicly available gene expression datasets, reveal the feasibility of analyzing substantially larger biological networks than previously attainable. Future work will explore integration with advanced feature selection techniques and further optimization strategies for diverse causal discovery applications.
