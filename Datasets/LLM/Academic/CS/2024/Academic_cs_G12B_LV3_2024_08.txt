**Abstract**

Accurate and efficient robot state estimation is crucial for advanced robotic applications. This paper presents a novel approach to robot state estimation leveraging the SE(2)(3) Lie group framework to inherently account for rotational and translational motion. A key contribution is the introduction of a group-theoretic metric for evaluating estimation accuracy, extending existing methods by explicitly integrating linear velocity information. To enable precise ground truth velocity computation within this framework, we employ Chebyshev interpolation, facilitating high-order polynomial approximation and minimizing estimation error. Furthermore, the proposed methodology incorporates pseudospectral parameterization to achieve trajectory data compression, reducing computational complexity while preserving essential kinematic information. This unified approach provides a single, quantitative metric for assessing state estimation performance and demonstrates potential for real-time applications requiring compact trajectory representations. Preliminary results indicate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to traditional methods.
