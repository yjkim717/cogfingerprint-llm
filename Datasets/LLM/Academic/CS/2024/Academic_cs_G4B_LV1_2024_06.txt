**Abstract: Assessing the Impact of Systemic Disruptions on Financial Stability – A Case Study of Bangladeshi Commercial Banks During the COVID-19 Pandemic**

This research investigates the multifaceted impact of exogenous shocks, specifically the COVID-19 pandemic, on the operational stability and performance metrics of commercial banks operating within Bangladesh. Utilizing Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation techniques applied to a panel dataset spanning 2019-2023, we analyze the interplay between increased operational risk, declining profitability, and surprising gains in operational efficiency observed post-pandemic.  Preliminary findings indicate a significant deterioration in risk-adjusted return on assets (RAROA) and capital adequacy ratios, attributable to heightened credit risk exposure and loan portfolio volatility.  

However, concurrent with these negative impacts, banks demonstrated accelerated digitization and process automation, leading to demonstrable improvements in transaction processing speed and reduced operational costs – a counterintuitive response consistent with observed global trends.  The GMM framework allows for the controlled estimation of causal relationships, mitigating potential endogeneity concerns.  Further investigation will explore the predictive power of early warning indicators and assess the long-term implications of these observed shifts for Bangladesh’s financial system resilience.  Ultimately, this study contributes to developing robust algorithmic risk management models adaptable to future systemic disruptions.
