Title: Assessing Dialectal Robustness in NLP Models: A Survey of Deep Learning Approaches

Abstract:
The proliferation of language technologies has underscored the need for natural language processing (NLP) models that can effectively handle dialectal variations. As deep learning continues to drive advancements in NLP, it is crucial to examine the performance of these models on dialectal datasets. This survey provides a comprehensive review of existing research in NLP for dialects, with a focus on the application of deep learning techniques to various NLP tasks. We analyze the strengths and limitations of current approaches, highlighting the challenges posed by dialectal diversity and the need for more robust and inclusive language models. Our examination reveals that while significant progress has been made in developing dialect-aware NLP models, further research is required to address the complexities of dialectal language and ensure equitable performance across diverse linguistic contexts. The findings of this survey have implications for the development of more effective NLP systems in 2024 and beyond.
