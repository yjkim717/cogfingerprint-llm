**Abstract**

The intersection of distribution learning and differential privacy remains a critical area of investigation. This work examines the limits of private learnability, specifically concerning distribution classes. We demonstrate the existence of a distribution class that is demonstrably learnable from a finite number of samples, yet provably resistant to learning under standard differential privacy constraints. This result directly contradicts a widely held conjecture, often referred to as the Ashtiani conjecture, which posited a fundamental trade-off between learnability and privacy. Our findings highlight the necessity for nuanced approaches to private distribution learning and suggest avenues for exploring alternative privacy mechanisms or modified learnability criteria.
