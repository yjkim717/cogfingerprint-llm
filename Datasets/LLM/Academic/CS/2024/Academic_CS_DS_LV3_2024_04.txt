In 2024, the proliferation of autonomous pricing algorithms in digital marketplaces necessitates robust regulatory frameworks to preemptively detect algorithmic collusion. This research formalizes a statistical audit mechanism for competition authorities, predicated on a novel definition of plausible algorithmic non-collusion. By analyzing high-frequency pricing data, we develop a hypothesis test that distinguishes pro-competitive parallel pricing from tacit collusive equilibria. Our methodology leverages econometric models of competitive markets to establish a baseline, against which deviations signaling coordinated price elevation are quantified. The proposed audit tool provides a computationally tractable and legally defensible empirical standard, enabling regulators to move from ex-post litigation to ex-ante monitoring. This work bridges computational economics and antitrust law, offering a critical safeguard for preserving market integrity in an era of increasingly opaque, AI-driven commerce.
