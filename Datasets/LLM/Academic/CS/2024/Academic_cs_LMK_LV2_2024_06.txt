**Title:** Analyzing Post-COVID-19 Commercial Bank Performance in Bangladesh: A Data-Driven Approach

**Abstract:**

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the global economy, with the banking sector being no exception. In Bangladesh, commercial banks have faced unprecedented challenges, affecting their performance. This study aims to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on commercial banks' performance in Bangladesh and identify key determinants of post-COVID performance using a data-driven approach. Leveraging a dataset of commercial banks' financial reports and macroeconomic indicators from 2020 to 2024, we employ a combination of machine learning algorithms and econometric models to analyze the effects of the pandemic on bank performance. Our analysis utilizes a range of performance metrics, including Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). The results indicate a significant decline in commercial banks' performance during the pandemic, with a gradual recovery observed in the post-COVID period. Our feature importance analysis reveals that key determinants of post-COVID bank performance include liquidity, capital adequacy, and credit risk management. The findings of this study have important implications for policymakers, regulators, and bank management, highlighting the need for data-driven decision-making to mitigate the impact of future economic shocks. By providing insights into the post-COVID banking landscape in Bangladesh, this research contributes to the development of effective strategies for enhancing bank resilience and promoting financial stability.
