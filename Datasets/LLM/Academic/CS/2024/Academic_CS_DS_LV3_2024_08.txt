This paper introduces a novel SE2(3) Lie group framework that advances robotic state estimation by integrating linear velocity estimation through Chebyshev interpolation techniques. Traditional estimation methods often treat position and orientation separately, leading to suboptimal performance in dynamic robotic systems. Our approach leverages the inherent geometric structure of the SE2(3) manifold to maintain consistency between rotational and translational states while explicitly estimating linear velocity. The proposed method employs Chebyshev interpolation for accurate state representation between measurement updates, coupled with pseudospectral parameterization for efficient trajectory optimization. This dual formulation enables both real-time state estimation and post-hoc trajectory analysis with bounded approximation errors. Experimental validation demonstrates that our framework provides an interpretable metric for evaluating estimation quality while achieving significant trajectory compression ratios. The 2024 implementation shows practical utility in resource-constrained robotic applications where computational efficiency and storage limitations are critical concerns, establishing new benchmarks for geometric state estimation in autonomous navigation systems.
