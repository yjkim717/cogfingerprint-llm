This paper establishes a separation between classical and differentially private distribution learning. We demonstrate that for certain structured distribution families, finite-sample learnability under total variation distance does not guarantee private learnability, even with relaxed privacy constraints. This reveals fundamental limitations in privacy-preserving statistical inference.
