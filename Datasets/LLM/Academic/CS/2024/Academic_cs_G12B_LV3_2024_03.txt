**Abstract:**

The problem of revenue maximization in sequential item pricing under online contention remains a significant challenge in algorithmic mechanism design, particularly when faced with numerous subadditive buyers. This paper presents a novel Online Contention Resolution Scheme (OCRS) designed to efficiently approximate the ex ante buy-many revenue in such settings. Our approach leverages a multi-dimensional pricing strategy, permitting flexible allocation and pricing decisions to respond to evolving buyer demand in real-time. We establish that OCRS achieves a logarithmic approximation factor relative to the optimal revenue, a substantial improvement over existing online mechanisms. Furthermore, we rigorously derive a lower bound for the achievable revenue in this problem, providing a theoretical benchmark against which to evaluate future algorithms. The logarithmic approximation guarantee is demonstrated through a combination of theoretical analysis and simulations, showcasing the practical viability of OCRS. This work contributes to the growing body of research on dynamic pricing and resource allocation, offering a valuable tool for optimizing revenue streams in online marketplaces and auction systems. The results presented here provide a foundation for future explorations into more complex buyer behaviors and market dynamics.
