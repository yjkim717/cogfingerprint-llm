Title: Assessing the Resilience of Commercial Banking Systems: A COVID-19 Impact Analysis using Machine Learning and Financial Metrics

Abstract:

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to the global financial landscape, particularly affecting the stability and profitability of commercial banks. This study focuses on the Bangladesh banking sector, examining the impact of the pandemic on its performance and efficiency. Leveraging a mixed-methods approach combining financial metrics analysis and machine learning techniques, we investigate the resilience of commercial banks in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our analysis encompasses a comprehensive dataset of financial indicators from 30 commercial banks in Bangladesh, covering the period from 2019 to 2022. We employ a range of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest and Support Vector Machines, to classify banks based on their financial health and predict their post-pandemic performance. Our findings indicate a significant decline in profitability and stability among commercial banks in Bangladesh during the pandemic, largely attributed to reduced lending activities, increased provisioning for loan losses, and decreased deposit growth. However, our analysis also reveals an improvement in banking efficiency, measured through the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method, suggesting that banks adapted to the challenging environment by optimizing their operations and reducing costs. The study's insights have implications for policymakers and banking regulators, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to enhance the resilience of commercial banks in Bangladesh and similar emerging economies. By integrating machine learning and financial metrics, this research contributes to the development of more sophisticated risk assessment frameworks for banking systems in the post-COVID era.
