Title: Accelerating Causal Discovery with GPU-Parallelized LiNGAM: A Continuous Optimization Approach

Abstract:
Causal discovery is a crucial task in understanding complex systems, but its scalability is hindered by computational bottlenecks. To address this challenge, we present a GPU-accelerated LiNGAM framework, leveraging continuous optimization techniques to facilitate causal inference on high-dimensional data. By harnessing the parallel processing capabilities of modern GPUs, our approach significantly accelerates the LiNGAM algorithm, enabling its application to datasets with thousands of variables. We achieve this by reformulating the LiNGAM optimization problem to exploit the massively parallel architecture of GPUs, resulting in substantial speedups over traditional CPU-based implementations. Our framework, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrates the efficacy of GPU-parallelized causal discovery, paving the way for large-scale causal inference applications in fields such as genomics and finance. This work showcases the potential of heterogeneous computing in advancing causal discovery methodologies.
