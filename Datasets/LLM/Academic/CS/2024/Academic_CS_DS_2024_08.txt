**Abstract**

The escalating global burden of cardiovascular diseases necessitates the development of robust, data-driven diagnostic tools to augment clinical decision-making. This paper presents a computational framework for enhancing the predictive accuracy of heart disease classification by integrating advanced feature selection methodologies with a high-performance Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. While machine learning algorithms offer significant potential in medical diagnostics, their efficacy is often compromised by high-dimensional, redundant feature spaces inherent in clinical datasets. To address this, our study conducts a comparative analysis of filter, wrapper, and embedded feature selection techniques to identify the most discriminative subset of clinical and anamnestic variables. The refined feature set is then used to train a non-linear SVM classifier, optimized via a grid search for its hyperparameters. We evaluate our framework on a benchmark cardiovascular dataset, employing a stratified 10-fold cross-validation protocol to ensure statistical reliability. Experimental results from our 2024 investigation demonstrate that the feature-engineered SVM model achieves a superior classification performance, with a mean accuracy of 96.2% and a marked improvement in F1-score compared to models trained on the full feature set. The findings underscore the critical role of systematic dimensionality reduction in mitigating overfitting and enhancing model interpretability for clinicians. This work contributes a validated, efficient pipeline for computer-aided diagnosis, highlighting a significant step towards reliable, automated risk stratification in cardiology.
