**Abstract**

The scalability of causal discovery algorithms remains a critical challenge in computational science, particularly when confronting high-dimensional, large-scale datasets. While the Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM) provides identifiable causal structures under realistic assumptions, its computational complexity has historically limited practical application. This paper introduces a novel, GPU-accelerated implementation of the LiNGAM algorithm, designed to overcome these scalability barriers. By parallelizing the independent component analysis (ICA) and causal ordering steps, our method exploits massive data-level parallelism, achieving a 32-fold speed-up over state-of-the-art CPU implementations on benchmark datasets. Crucially, this performance gain is attained without compromising the statistical guarantees of the original LiNGAM framework. Our results demonstrate that the proposed accelerator enables efficient causal discovery on previously intractable dataset sizes, thereby expanding the practical frontier for data-driven causal inference in fields such as genomics and econometrics.
