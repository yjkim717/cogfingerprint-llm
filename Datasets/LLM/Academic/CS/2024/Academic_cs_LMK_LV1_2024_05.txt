Optimizing Resource Allocation through Algorithmic Predictions: A Contextual Analysis

The increasing reliance on algorithmic predictions for resource allocation necessitates a nuanced understanding of their efficacy. This study examines the conditions under which prediction-based allocations outperform traditional methods. We demonstrate that the efficacy of such allocations is contingent upon two primary factors: low between-unit inequality in the outcome variable and sufficiently high intervention budgets. Through a rigorous analysis, we establish that these conditions facilitate more effective targeting of resources, thereby enhancing overall intervention efficacy. Our findings have significant implications for the design of allocation protocols in 2024 and beyond.
