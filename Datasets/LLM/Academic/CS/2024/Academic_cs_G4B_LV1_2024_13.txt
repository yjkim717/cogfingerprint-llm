**Abstract**

Contemporary artificial neural networks (ANNs) frequently exhibit limited systematic generalization capabilities, hindering robust performance across diverse, unseen tasks. This work investigates a novel approach leveraging metalearning techniques to mitigate these deficiencies. We hypothesize that strategically designed incentives, coupled with targeted practice on a carefully curated distribution of related tasks, can significantly enhance an ANN’s ability to rapidly adapt to novel situations.  Our methodology centers on a meta-learning architecture where the network learns not just to solve individual tasks, but to learn *how* to learn effectively.  Specifically, we explore the impact of reward signals that promote efficient knowledge transfer and discourage overfitting. Preliminary results demonstrate a substantial improvement in out-of-distribution generalization accuracy, suggesting that incentivized, practice-driven metalearning represents a promising pathway towards more adaptable and reliable ANNs in 2024 and beyond.
