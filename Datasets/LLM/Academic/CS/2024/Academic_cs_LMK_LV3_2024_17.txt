Title: Evaluating the Transformative Potential of Generative AI in NLP: A Comparative Analysis of Ethics and Human-Computer Interaction

Abstract:

As we navigate the complexities of artificial intelligence in 2024, the proliferation of generative AI tools in natural language processing (NLP) has sparked intense debate regarding their transformative impact, ethical implications, and potential applications. This study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of nine state-of-the-art generative AI tools, assessing their strengths, limitations, and operational nuances. By examining the efficacy of these tools in various NLP tasks, we elucidate the intricate dynamics between AI ethics, human-computer interaction, and the evolving landscape of NLP. Our findings underscore the need for fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI development, highlighting the tension between innovation and responsible AI governance. The results of this analysis provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness the potential of generative AI while mitigating its risks, ultimately informing the development of more equitable and effective NLP systems.
