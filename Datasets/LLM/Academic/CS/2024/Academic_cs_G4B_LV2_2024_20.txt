**Abstract**

Accurate cellular segmentation remains a critical bottleneck in high-throughput microscopy analysis. Traditional methods frequently struggle with the inherent challenges posed by noisy, blurred, or low-resolution images commonly encountered in biological imaging. This paper introduces Cellpose3, a novel system designed to address these limitations. Cellpose3 leverages a streamlined, one-click image restoration pipeline, significantly improving the quality of input microscopy data prior to segmentation.  We detail the core architecture, emphasizing its application to enhance cellular features obscured by image artifacts. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate a marked increase in segmentation accuracy, particularly when applied to datasets exhibiting significant noise and blur.  Future work will investigate the systemâ€™s adaptability across diverse microscopy modalities and explore integration with existing cell counting and analysis workflows.  Cellpose3 represents a valuable contribution toward automated and reliable cellular phenotyping.
