**Abstract**

Automated cellular segmentation remains a critical bottleneck in high-content microscopy analysis, frequently hampered by the inherent challenges of noisy and blurred image data. This work introduces Cellpose3, a novel deep learning framework designed to substantially improve the robustness of cellular segmentation pipelines. Cellpose3 employs a streamlined, one-click image restoration module predicated on a learned prior, effectively mitigating the impact of common artifacts prevalent in microscopy images.  We leverage a convolutional neural network architecture, refined through extensive training on a diverse dataset of noisy and blurred cellular images, to predict a spatially refined segmentation map. Experimental results demonstrate a significant enhancement in segmentation accuracy, as measured by Dice coefficient and Jaccard index, compared to state-of-the-art methods when applied to realistically simulated and acquired microscopy data.  Future research will explore adaptive restoration strategies and integration with existing cell counting and analysis tools.
