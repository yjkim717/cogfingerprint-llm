**Deep Learning for Computer Vision in Greenhouse Agriculture: A Review of Current Capabilities, Challenges, and Future Directions**

The integration of artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning (DL), into agricultural practices is rapidly transforming the landscape of smart farming. This review focuses on the burgeoning application of DL-assisted computer vision (CV) within controlled environment agriculture, specifically greenhouse settings. We analyze recent advancements in utilizing CV techniques to address critical challenges in greenhouse operations, with a particular emphasis on automated disease detection, crop monitoring, and yield prediction. The survey encompasses a range of DL architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer-based models, evaluating their efficacy in various greenhouse scenarios. [Smith et al., 2023] highlight the potential for reduced pesticide usage and improved resource allocation through early disease identification.

Our analysis reveals that while significant progress has been made, limitations remain. These include the need for large, labeled datasets, particularly for rare disease instances, and the computational demands of complex DL models. Furthermore, the variability of lighting conditions and plant morphology within greenhouses presents a substantial challenge to robust CV performance.  We discuss the impact of domain adaptation techniques [Brown & Jones, 2022] in mitigating these issues. Finally, we outline promising future research directions, such as the development of federated learning approaches to enable collaborative model training across multiple greenhouses without data sharing, the exploration of explainable AI (XAI) methods for improved model interpretability, and the integration of multi-modal data (e.g., hyperspectral imagery, environmental sensor data) to enhance predictive accuracy.  Ultimately, addressing these challenges will be crucial for realizing the full potential of DL-powered CV to optimize greenhouse agriculture and contribute to sustainable food production.
