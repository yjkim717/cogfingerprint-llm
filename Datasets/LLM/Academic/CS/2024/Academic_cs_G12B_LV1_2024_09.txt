**An Ensemble Approach to Enhanced Heart Disease Prediction via Hybrid Feature Selection and Optimized SVM Classification**

The escalating prevalence of cardiovascular disease necessitates robust and efficient diagnostic tools. This paper investigates a novel methodology for heart disease prediction leveraging machine learning, specifically focusing on the optimization of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification within an ensemble framework. Recognizing the computational burden and potential for overfitting associated with high-dimensional datasets, we introduce a hybrid feature selection strategy combining recursive feature elimination with a genetic algorithm-based wrapper approach. This hybrid method aims to identify a globally optimal subset of features, exhibiting both statistical relevance and predictive power, while simultaneously minimizing the computational complexity of model training.

We evaluate our proposed system using a publicly available heart disease dataset, comparing its performance against traditional SVM implementations and other established classification algorithms, including Random Forests and Logistic Regression.  Preliminary results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy (F1-score increased by X%, p<0.05) and a substantial reduction in training time (Y% decrease) compared to baseline models. Furthermore, an ensemble of multiple SVM classifiers, each trained on different feature subsets selected by our hybrid method, further enhances predictive performance.  This work contributes to the broader field of medical diagnostics by presenting a scalable and accurate approach to heart disease prediction, highlighting the synergistic benefits of advanced feature engineering and optimized machine learning techniques. Future work will explore the integration of deep learning techniques and the application of this methodology to other complex medical datasets.

**Notes and Potential Expansions:**

*   **X% and Y%:**  These placeholders need to be replaced with actual experimental results.
*   **p<0.05:** This indicates a statistically significant result (a common threshold). Replace with the actual p-value from your experiments.
*   **Ensemble Framework:** I've added the concept of an ensemble to build on the idea of improved accuracy.  The specific ensemble method could be elaborated upon (e.g., bagging, boosting).
*   **Hybrid Feature Selection:**  I've tried to make this sound more sophisticated by combining two common techniques. You could detail the specifics of the genetic algorithm wrapper.
*   **Comparison Algorithms:** I added some common comparison algorithms.
*   **Scalability:** Mentioning scalability is important in CS, especially when dealing with medical data.
*   **Future Work:** This is standard in abstracts and provides a direction for further research.
*   **Specific Dataset:**  While I mentioned a "publicly available dataset," it would be stronger to name the dataset explicitly (e.g., UCI Heart Disease dataset).
