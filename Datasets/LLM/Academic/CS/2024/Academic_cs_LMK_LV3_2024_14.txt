Title: Advancing Smart Greenhouse Agriculture through Deep Learning-Assisted Computer Vision: A Review of Recent Progress and Future Directions

Abstract:
The integration of deep learning-assisted computer vision techniques in smart greenhouse agriculture has revolutionized data-driven decision-making, enhancing sustainability and productivity. As of 2024, this rapidly evolving field has witnessed significant advancements in leveraging computer vision for crop monitoring, disease detection, and yield prediction. This review synthesizes recent research on the application of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning, in smart greenhouse agriculture. We examine the current state-of-the-art, highlighting the potential of these techniques to optimize resource allocation, reduce environmental impact, and improve crop quality. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and limitations associated with implementing these technologies in real-world settings, and outline future research directions to address these gaps. By providing a comprehensive overview of the field, this review aims to inform the development of more efficient and sustainable smart greenhouse agriculture practices.
