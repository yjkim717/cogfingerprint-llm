**Abstract**

Large multimodal models, exemplified by CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities. However, a critical limitation remains: susceptibility to adversarial examples and a potentially opaque internal representation. This work introduces a novel analytical framework, utilizing a “second-order lens,” to scrutinize the operational dynamics of CLIP’s neuronal architecture. We investigate the selective activation patterns of individual neurons, revealing instances of polysemy – the capacity to represent multiple, disparate visual concepts within a single unit.  Crucially, our analysis demonstrates that strategically manipulating these neuron activations can induce model deception, successfully generating outputs inconsistent with the input image. Furthermore, we identify specific neuronal pathways linked to enhanced segmentation performance, suggesting a potential avenue for improving CLIP’s robustness and interpretability.  These findings underscore the importance of considering second-order effects in the analysis of large neural networks and highlight the vulnerability of CLIP’s internal representations to targeted perturbations.
