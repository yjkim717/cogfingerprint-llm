In the era of digital markets (2024), the proliferation of pricing algorithms has raised concerns regarding algorithmic collusion. This paper introduces a rigorous definition of non-collusive behavior for pricing algorithms and proposes a novel statistical test to detect supra-competitive pricing. The non-collusion audit framework assesses algorithmic interactions, ensuring compliance with competitive market standards. By distinguishing between legitimate algorithmic coordination and collusive practices, this approach enables regulatory bodies to effectively monitor and maintain fair market competition, thus safeguarding consumer welfare and promoting a level playing field.
