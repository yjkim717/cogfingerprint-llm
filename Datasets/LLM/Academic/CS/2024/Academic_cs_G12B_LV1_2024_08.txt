## A Chebyshev-Parameterized Riemannian Metric for Enhanced Robot State Estimation via Lie Group Frameworks

**Abstract:** Accurate and efficient robot state estimation remains a critical challenge in robotics, particularly within the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) paradigm. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively incorporate linear velocity information and accurately represent the underlying manifold structure of robot configurations. This paper proposes a novel group theoretic metric for robot state estimation, leveraging the inherent geometric properties of Lie groups to improve accuracy and robustness. Our framework represents robot states as points on a Lie group and defines a Riemannian metric tailored to incorporate linear velocity, a factor frequently omitted in traditional pose estimation.  Crucially, we introduce a pseudospectral parameterization of the metric tensor field, utilizing Chebyshev interpolation to achieve high-order accuracy in approximating the true metric while maintaining computational efficiency. This approach allows for precise modeling of the robot's kinematic constraints and the associated uncertainty propagation. We demonstrate that this Chebyshev-based pseudospectral parameterization significantly reduces the approximation error compared to conventional polynomial or spline-based methods, particularly in scenarios with rapid changes in robot velocity.  Experimental results, evaluated on simulated and real-world datasets, validate the efficacy of our proposed metric in improving state estimation accuracy and convergence rate within a SLAM context, highlighting its potential for advanced robotic navigation and manipulation tasks, and offering a robust alternative to existing approaches in 2024 and beyond.
