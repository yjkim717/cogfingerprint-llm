**Deep Learning-Driven Computer Vision for Enhanced Greenhouse Agriculture: A Review and Emerging Trends**

Greenhouse agriculture faces increasing demands for optimized resource utilization and improved crop yields. This review synthesizes recent advancements in applying deep learning-assisted computer vision to address these challenges within controlled environment agriculture (CEA).  We examine the burgeoning role of data-driven approaches, specifically leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to automate and augment traditional monitoring techniques.  Analysis focuses on key applications, including automated plant health assessment through spectral analysis of imagery, real-time detection of pest and disease outbreaks, and precise environmental parameter control – such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity – based on visual data. 

Recent research highlights the potential of transfer learning to reduce training data requirements and expedite deployment in diverse greenhouse settings. Furthermore, we explore emerging trends such as multi-modal sensor fusion integrating computer vision with data from environmental sensors and robotic systems.  Challenges remain regarding data variability, robust model generalization across different greenhouse configurations, and the interpretability of deep learning models.  Future work will necessitate standardized datasets and the development of explainable AI (XAI) techniques to foster wider adoption of these sophisticated, data-driven solutions for sustainable greenhouse practices.
