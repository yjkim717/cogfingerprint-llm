**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of digital communication necessitates robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities that account for linguistic diversity. This paper presents a survey of contemporary research addressing dialectal NLP, a critical area for ensuring equitable access to and development of language technologies. We investigate the current landscape of datasets specifically designed for dialectal analysis, alongside prevalent Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks tailored to diverse linguistic variations.  The survey delineates a spectrum of methodological approaches, from traditional machine learning techniques to emergent deep learning models, including transformer-based architectures.  Notably, we analyze the application of transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies to improve performance across diverse dialectal corpora.  Ultimately, this research underscores the imperative for incorporating dialectal awareness into NLP systems, contributing to the broader goal of fostering inclusive and representative language models that mitigate biases and promote equitable outcomes within the field of NLU and NLG.
