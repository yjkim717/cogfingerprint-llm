**Abstract**

This paper advances the frontier of mechanism design for revenue maximization by establishing a novel connection between sequential item pricing and Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS) in the presence of subadditive buyers. While prior work has yielded strong approximations for unit-demand valuations, the multi-dimensional and combinatorial nature of subadditive preferences presents a formidable challenge, as the seller must navigate complex value interdependencies across items. We introduce the first multi-dimensional OCRS framework tailored for this setting, which allows the seller to make irrevocable pricing and allocation decisions online as buyers arrive in an adversarial order. Our central technical contribution is an algorithm that leverages this framework to achieve a revenue approximation of \( O(\log^2 m) \) relative to the ex ante relaxation benchmark, where \( m \) denotes the number of items. This benchmark, which upper-bounds the optimal revenue by considering the expected sale of each item independently, provides a tractable analytical foundation. Our methodology involves carefully constructing a pricing scheme that interacts with the OCRS to manage the contention for items across buyers, ensuring that high-value allocations are preserved without over-committing supply. The analysis demonstrates that the subadditivity of valuations can be effectively harnessed through this sequential process, preventing the revenue degradation typical of simpler pricing strategies. This result significantly broadens the applicability of sequential mechanisms beyond simple valuation classes, offering a principled and computationally feasible approach for maximizing revenue in complex multi-item markets.
