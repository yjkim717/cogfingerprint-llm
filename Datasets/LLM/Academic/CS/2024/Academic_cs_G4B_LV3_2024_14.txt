**Abstract**

The integration of data-driven approaches is rapidly transforming agricultural practices, particularly within controlled environment agriculture. This study presents a systematic review of deep learning and computer vision methodologies deployed in smart greenhouse systems, synthesizing insights from over 100 recent research publications (2020-2024).  We investigate the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for tasks including automated plant phenotyping, disease detection, and yield prediction.  A critical analysis reveals persistent challenges related to data scarcity, the need for robust and generalizable models across diverse greenhouse conditions, and the interpretability of deep learning outputs.  Furthermore, the review identifies emerging trends, such as federated learning for enhanced privacy and transfer learning to accelerate deployment in novel greenhouse designs.  Ultimately, this research underscores the potential of these techniques to optimize resource utilization, improve crop quality, and contribute to a more sustainable and efficient agricultural sector, demanding further investigation into hybrid AI-human approaches for effective implementation.
