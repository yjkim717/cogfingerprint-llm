**Abstract:**

The integration of deep learning and computer vision is rapidly transforming agricultural practices, particularly within controlled environment agriculture (CEA) systems like smart greenhouses. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in deep learning-assisted computer vision for precision agriculture within greenhouse settings, focusing on advancements realized since 2020. We analyze the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformer architectures for tasks including plant phenotyping, disease detection, automated irrigation control, and yield prediction. The review highlights the challenges associated with limited labeled data, computational resource constraints within greenhouse environments, and the need for robust models adaptable to varying lighting and environmental conditions. Furthermore, we explore emerging trends such as federated learning for collaborative model training across multiple greenhouses, and the use of synthetic data generation to augment training datasets. Finally, the paper outlines future research directions, emphasizing the crucial role of explainable AI (XAI) in fostering trust and enabling data-driven decision-making for sustainable and efficient smart greenhouse agriculture.
