Title: Evaluating the Landscape of Generative AI: A Comparative Analysis of NLP Capabilities and HCI Implications

Abstract:
The rapid proliferation of generative AI tools has significantly impacted the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of state-of-the-art generative AI models, assessing their performance, strengths, and limitations in various NLP tasks. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, we evaluate the efficacy of these models in tasks such as text generation, summarization, and dialogue systems. Our analysis reveals notable differences in their performance, highlighting the importance of task-specific fine-tuning and the need for more robust evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we examine the HCI implications of these models, discussing the potential benefits and challenges associated with their integration into real-world applications. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI planning, ethics, and the future of human-AI collaboration, providing insights for researchers and practitioners in the field. (2024)
