Title: Enhancing Spatial Coherence in Computer Vision with Sparse Non-Local CRFs

Abstract:
In the realm of computer vision, modeling spatial coherence is crucial for accurate image analysis. This paper introduces a novel Sparse Non-Local Conditional Random Field (SNL-CRF) model, striking a balance between efficiency and generality. By leveraging sparse graph structures and non-local pairwise potentials, SNL-CRF effectively captures long-range dependencies while mitigating computational overhead. Our model outperforms traditional pairwise CRFs and demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches in various computer vision tasks, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for enhancing spatial coherence in image analysis applications, as of 2024.
