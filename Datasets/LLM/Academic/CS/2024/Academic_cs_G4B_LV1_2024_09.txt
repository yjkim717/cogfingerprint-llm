**Abstract**

The accurate and timely prediction of cardiovascular disease remains a critical challenge in healthcare. This study investigates the application of machine learning techniques to enhance the diagnostic capabilities for heart disease. We propose a novel system leveraging a suite of classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of developing or experiencing specific cardiac conditions.  A core component of the methodology is a rigorous feature selection process, employing techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination and Principal Component Analysis, to identify the most salient predictive variables from a comprehensive dataset.  To mitigate overfitting and ensure robust performance, a stratified 10-fold cross-validation strategy was implemented throughout the model development and evaluation phases.  Preliminary results demonstrate significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy compared to traditional rule-based systems. Future work will focus on integrating interpretability methods and exploring the potential of deep learning architectures to further refine prediction models and personalize patient care strategies.
