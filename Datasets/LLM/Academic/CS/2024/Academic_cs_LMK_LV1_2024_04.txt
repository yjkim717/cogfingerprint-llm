Title: Detecting Algorithmic Collusion in Competitive Markets: A Statistical Framework

Abstract:
The proliferation of pricing algorithms in digital marketplaces has raised concerns about algorithmic collusion, where autonomous agents may tacitly coordinate to manipulate prices. In this paper, we propose a statistical framework to detect non-collusion among pricing algorithms, enabling regulatory bodies to identify potential collusive behavior. We define a notion of algorithmic non-collusion based on the convergence of algorithmic outputs to competitive equilibrium prices. Using real-world pricing data, we develop a statistical test to determine whether observed prices are consistent with non-collusive behavior. Our test leverages machine learning techniques to estimate the underlying market dynamics and detect deviations from competitive pricing. We evaluate our framework on simulated market data and demonstrate its efficacy in detecting collusive behavior. Our results provide a crucial tool for regulators to monitor and maintain fair competition in algorithmic markets.
