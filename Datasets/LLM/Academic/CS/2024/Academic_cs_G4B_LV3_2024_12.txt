**Abstract**

Causal discovery remains a critical challenge in analyzing complex, high-dimensional datasets. This paper introduces AcceleratedLiNGAM, a novel approach leveraging GPU acceleration to expedite the LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model) algorithm.  Traditional LiNGAM implementations face significant computational bottlenecks when applied to large-scale datasets, particularly those encountered in genomics, such as gene expression profiles. AcceleratedLiNGAM addresses this limitation through optimized GPU utilization, resulting in demonstrably faster causal structure learning.  Evaluations on synthetic and real-world gene expression data demonstrate that the method achieves competitive performance relative to established continuous optimization techniques while maintaining robustness.  This enhanced efficiency unlocks the potential for causal inference on previously intractable datasets, facilitating deeper biological insights and broader applications across fields including financial modeling and complex systems analysis. Future work will explore scaling strategies and adaptive GPU resource allocation.
