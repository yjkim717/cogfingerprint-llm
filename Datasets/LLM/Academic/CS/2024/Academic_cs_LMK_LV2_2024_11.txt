Title: Enhancing Computer Vision with Sparse Non-Local Conditional Random Fields

Abstract:
We present a novel sparse non-local Conditional Random Field (CRF) model, tailored to enhance the efficacy of computer vision applications. By integrating sparse CRF formulations with non-local connections, our model achieves a balance between computational efficiency and representational generality. The proposed architecture leverages the strengths of deep learning frameworks to capture complex contextual dependencies, while the sparse non-local CRF layer refines the output by modeling long-range interactions. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements over traditional CRF models, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced contextual understanding. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets validate the superiority of our method, showcasing its potential to advance various computer vision tasks. The proposed sparse non-local CRF model offers a versatile and efficient solution for modern computer vision applications, as evidenced by our results in 2024.
