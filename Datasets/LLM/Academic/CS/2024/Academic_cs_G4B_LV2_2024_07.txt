Here’s an academic abstract based on the provided summary, suitable for a 2024 computer science publication:

“This work investigates the learnability of distribution classes with controlled error, exploring the limitations imposed by differential privacy.  We present a novel approach enabling the learning of a specific distribution, though not under the constraints of differential privacy.  This result casts doubt on the Ashtiani conjecture, which posits the simultaneous learnability of a distribution and its privacy guarantees.  Notably, our findings are predicated on a finite number of samples, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in distribution learning and privacy preservation, and suggesting avenues for future research concerning robust distributional inference.”
