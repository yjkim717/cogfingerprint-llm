The integration of artificial intelligence into clinical practice represents a paradigm shift in modern healthcare, driven by advances in machine learning and big data analytics. This research examines AI's transformative impact on diagnostic methods, where deep learning algorithms enhance the accuracy and speed of medical imaging interpretation and predictive analytics. By leveraging multimodal data streams, these systems facilitate personalized treatment protocols, thereby improving patient outcomes across diverse medical specialties such as oncology, cardiology, and neurology. However, this technological evolution necessitates rigorous ethical considerations, including algorithmic transparency, data privacy, and bias mitigation, to ensure equitable deployment. Furthermore, adherence to evolving legal frameworks governing AI in medicine is critical for maintaining trust and compliance. Our analysis synthesizes recent empirical studies and proposes a governance model that balances innovation with accountability, underscoring AI's role not merely as a tool but as a collaborative agent in clinician decision-making processes. This work highlights both the realized benefits and the imperative for ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue to navigate the complex socio-technical landscape of AI-enhanced healthcare.
