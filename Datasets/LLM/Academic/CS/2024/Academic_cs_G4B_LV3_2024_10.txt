**Abstract**

The rigorous evaluation of machine learning models remains a critical challenge in diverse applications. This study synthesizes current methodologies for assessing model performance, focusing on the judicious application of evaluation metrics and statistical tests within the context of supervised learning. We examine established metrics – including precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve – alongside their appropriate utilization for classification and regression tasks. Furthermore, the paper investigates the necessity of employing statistical tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to determine the significance of observed performance differences between models.  Model comparison is approached with an emphasis on avoiding spurious correlations and ensuring robust conclusions.  Specifically, we highlight potential pitfalls associated with relying solely on single metrics and advocate for a multi-faceted evaluation strategy.  The research underscores the importance of selecting metrics and tests aligned with the specific task and data characteristics, contributing to more reliable and interpretable machine learning deployments in 2024 and beyond.
