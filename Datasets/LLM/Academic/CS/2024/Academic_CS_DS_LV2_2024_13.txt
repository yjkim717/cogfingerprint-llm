**Abstract**

The persistent challenges of catastrophic forgetting and limited systematic generalization continue to constrain the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in dynamic, real-world environments. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate emergent capabilities, their underlying architectures often lack the meta-cognitive faculties for robust and continual learning. This review posits that metalearning—framed as learning-to-learn—provides a foundational paradigm to address these core limitations. We argue that by explicitly training networks to acquire learning strategies rather than isolated tasks, metalearning incentivizes the development of internal representations that are inherently more compositional and reusable. This process equates to providing ANNs with structured "practice" in essential cognitive skills, such as abstract reasoning and rapid adaptation, thereby forging more resilient and generalizable systems. Our synthesis of current literature suggests that integrating metalearning objectives is a critical pathway toward models that not only perform well on static benchmarks but also exhibit the fluid intelligence necessary for sequential task acquisition and genuine domain understanding, marking a significant step beyond current LLM capabilities.
