**Abstract**

Recent advancements in large language model (LLM)-based AI assistants have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet remain susceptible to generating inaccurate or fabricated responses – a phenomenon termed “hallucination.” This research addresses this critical limitation through a novel alignment strategy focused on explicit knowledge boundary recognition. We introduce a curated “I don’t know” dataset, designed to specifically train AI assistants to identify and articulate their knowledge cutoff.  Our methodology involves incorporating reinforcement learning techniques to reward responses that appropriately decline to answer questions exceeding the model’s operational domain. Preliminary results indicate a demonstrable improvement in the assistant’s accuracy and reliability, measured by reduced instances of fabricated information.  Specifically, we observed a [Insert Percentage]% decrease in hallucinated responses when utilizing the ‘I don’t know’ alignment.  Further investigation is warranted to explore the broader implications for trustworthy AI development and user interaction.
