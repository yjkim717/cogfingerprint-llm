**Abstract**

Accurate prediction of cardiovascular disease remains a critical challenge in healthcare. This study investigates a novel machine learning framework designed to enhance the reliability of heart disease prediction models. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, we evaluated the efficacy of various classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), alongside advanced feature selection methodologies. Specifically, the Adaptive Neighborhood Dynamic Voting (ANDV) algorithm was implemented to identify the most salient predictive features, mitigating the risk of overfitting and improving model generalizability.  Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of ANDV with SVMs significantly outperforms traditional feature selection approaches and baseline classification techniques.  The proposed system achieves a notable improvement in diagnostic accuracy, showcasing the potential of hybrid machine learning strategies for proactive cardiovascular risk assessment.  Further research will explore the scalability and clinical applicability of this predictive model within diverse patient populations.
