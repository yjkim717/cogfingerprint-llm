**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of algorithmic pricing strategies necessitates robust mechanisms for detecting and mitigating potential collusion. This paper introduces a novel regulatory audit framework designed to assess the competitive impact of pricing algorithms operating within dynamic market conditions.  Our approach, termed “Statistical Collusion Detection via Algorithmic Audit” (SCDAA), leverages advanced statistical audit techniques to identify deviations from non-collusive pricing behavior. SCDAA incorporates a probabilistic model that analyzes pricing patterns, considering both historical data and real-time market signals.  Specifically, the system employs anomaly detection algorithms to identify statistically significant correlations indicative of algorithmic collusion, while accounting for inherent variability driven by market fluctuations.  The framework aims to provide sellers with a data-driven tool to ensure pricing transparency and adherence to competition regulations, fostering a more resilient and equitable marketplace. Future work will explore integration with reinforcement learning for adaptive audit strategies.
