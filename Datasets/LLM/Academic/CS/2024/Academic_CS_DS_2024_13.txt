In the rapidly evolving domain of side-channel analysis (SCA), the performance of deep learning models is critically dependent on the selection of optimal hyperparameters. Traditional manual and grid search methods are computationally prohibitive and often fail to identify robust configurations, creating a significant bottleneck for practical security evaluations. This paper introduces a novel, automated framework that leverages advanced Bayesian optimization to systematically navigate the complex hyperparameter space of neural networks employed in SCA. Our methodology formulates the tuning process as a sample-efficient global optimization problem, utilizing a probabilistic surrogate model to balance exploration and exploitation. Empirical validation on multiple public datasets demonstrates that the proposed framework consistently discovers hyperparameter sets that yield superior attack efficiency and generalization capability compared to conventional approaches. By substantially reducing the expert effort and computational resources required for model optimization, this work provides a scalable and accessible tool to enhance the reliability of deep learning-based side-channel evaluations, thereby strengthening the assessment of cryptographic implementations in real-world scenarios.
