Title: Enhancing Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis of Classification Models and Feature Selection Techniques

Abstract:

The escalating prevalence of cardiovascular diseases necessitates the development of accurate diagnostic systems. In response, this study proposes a heart disease prediction framework leveraging machine learning algorithms and feature selection methods. We evaluate the performance of various classification models, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines, on a comprehensive dataset. Our analysis incorporates multiple feature selection techniques, such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Mutual Information-based feature selection, to identify the most relevant risk factors. The results demonstrate that SVM with RFE achieves the highest accuracy of 92.5%, outperforming other classification models. Furthermore, our findings highlight the importance of feature selection in enhancing model performance. This research contributes to the development of robust heart disease diagnosis systems, enabling early detection and intervention. The proposed framework has significant implications for clinical decision-making and cardiovascular disease management in 2024 and beyond.
