Title: Enhancing Systematic Generalization in Artificial Neural Networks through Metalearning

Abstract:
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various tasks; however, they often struggle with systematic generalization, few-shot learning, and multi-step reasoning. Recent advancements in metalearning have shown promise in addressing these challenges by providing targeted incentives and practice for specific skills. By leveraging metalearning, ANNs can develop a more robust and flexible ability to generalize across diverse tasks and datasets. This paper explores the efficacy of metalearning in enhancing the systematic generalization capabilities of ANNs, with a focus on few-shot learning and multi-step reasoning. We present a metalearning framework that enables ANNs to acquire task-agnostic skills, facilitating improved performance in complex and dynamic environments. Our results demonstrate that metalearning can significantly enhance the ability of ANNs to generalize systematically, paving the way for more robust and adaptable AI systems in 2024 and beyond.
