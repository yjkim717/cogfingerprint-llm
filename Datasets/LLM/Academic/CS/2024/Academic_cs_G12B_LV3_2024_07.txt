This work investigates the fundamental limits of learnability within privacy-constrained machine learning. We demonstrate the existence of a distribution class exhibiting finite-sample learnability, achieving a bounded error in total variation distance. Crucially, we prove that learnability within this class is demonstrably impossible under differential privacy with the same error tolerance. This result directly contradicts the Ashtiani conjecture regarding the interplay between learnability and differential privacy, prompting a re-evaluation of established assumptions in the field and opening avenues for future research exploring tighter privacy-utility tradeoffs.
