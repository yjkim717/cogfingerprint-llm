Title: Evaluating the Efficacy of Generative AI Tools in NLP: A Comparative Analysis and HCI Implications

Abstract:

The proliferation of generative AI tools has transformed the landscape of natural language processing (NLP), offering unprecedented capabilities in text generation, summarization, and manipulation. As of 2024, a plethora of AI-driven NLP tools have emerged, each with its strengths and weaknesses. This study undertakes a comprehensive comparative analysis of top generative AI tools, assessing their performance across various NLP tasks and evaluating their impact on human-computer interaction (HCI). Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, our research combines quantitative metrics, such as perplexity and F1-score, with qualitative user feedback to provide a nuanced understanding of these tools' efficacy. Our findings indicate that while state-of-the-art generative AI tools demonstrate impressive performance in NLP tasks, their integration into HCI frameworks is hindered by limitations in explainability, controllability, and contextual understanding. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on AI planning in NLP and informs the development of more effective, user-centric AI-driven interfaces.
