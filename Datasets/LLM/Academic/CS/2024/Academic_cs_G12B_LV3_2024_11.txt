**Abstract:**

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) remain a cornerstone of structured prediction in computer vision, yet traditional formulations often face a trade-off between computational efficiency and modeling expressiveness. Dense CRFs, while offering maximal generality through unrestricted edge weights, suffer from scalability limitations. Conversely, sparse CRFs, while efficient, can restrict the ability to capture complex dependencies. This paper presents a novel Sparse Non-Local CRF (SN-CRF) architecture designed to bridge this gap. Our approach leverages sparse graph constructions to maintain computational tractability while permitting non-local connections and flexible edge weighting schemes characteristic of dense CRFs. Experimental results across diverse computer vision tasks demonstrate that the SN-CRF achieves performance comparable to Gaussian dense CRFs, showcasing its potential as a highly efficient and versatile alternative. We further analyze the impact of non-local connections on feature interactions within the CRF framework, offering insights into the modelâ€™s representational capacity.
