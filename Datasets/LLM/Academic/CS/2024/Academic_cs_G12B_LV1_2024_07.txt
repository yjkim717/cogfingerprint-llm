**Abstract**

The intersection of distribution learning and differential privacy remains a subject of ongoing investigation. A central question concerns the relationship between learnability in the non-private setting and its privacy-preserving counterpart. This work presents a novel distribution class, parameterized by a finite set of elements, demonstrating provable learnability from finite samples under standard statistical learning assumptions. Crucially, we establish that this same class is fundamentally *not* privately learnable, even under arbitrarily small privacy budgets (Îµ). This result directly contradicts a recent conjecture proposed by Ashtiani et al. (2023) concerning the inherent privacy limitations of distribution learning. Our findings highlight a non-trivial separation between finite-sample learnability and differential privacy, offering new theoretical insights and directions for research in secure machine learning.

**Notes on Choices Made:**

*   **Formal Tone:** I used precise language ("provable learnability," "fundamentally not privately learnable," "statistical learning assumptions").
*   **Year Context:** Included a reference to a potential prior work from 2023 (Ashtiani et al.) to situate the work within a timeline.
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract clearly lays out the problem, the contribution (the new distribution class), the result (contradiction of the conjecture), and the implications.
*   **Keywords Incorporation:** All keywords were naturally woven into the text.
*   **Word Count:** The abstract is approximately 118 words.
