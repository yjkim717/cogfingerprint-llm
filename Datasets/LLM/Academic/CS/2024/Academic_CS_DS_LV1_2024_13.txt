**Abstract**

While artificial neural networks (ANNs) have achieved remarkable success in specific domains, their capacity for systematic generalization and robustness to non-stationary data streams remains a fundamental challenge, often manifesting as catastrophic forgetting. Conventional optimization paradigms, which predominantly focus on monolithic task performance through gradient-based loss minimization, are inherently ill-suited for these meta-challenges. This paper posits that metalearning provides a transformative framework by reconceptualizing learning itself as the primary objective. Instead of optimizing for a single function, metalearning algorithms train networks to become efficient few-shot learners, thereby embedding generalization as an inductive bias through explicit practice across a distribution of tasks. We argue that this paradigm shift—from direct task optimization to learning-to-learn—equips models with the necessary incentives and procedural experience to dynamically acquire and retain compositional skills. Our analysis synthesizes recent advances to demonstrate that this approach not only mitigates catastrophic interference but also fosters the emergent, reusable representations required for human-like systematicity, charting a path toward more adaptable and generalizable artificial intelligence systems.
