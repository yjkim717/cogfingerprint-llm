**Abstract**

The rigorous evaluation of machine learning models remains a critical, yet frequently nuanced, challenge. This work presents a structured framework for assessing model performance, moving beyond simple accuracy scores to incorporate a suite of complementary evaluation techniques.  Specifically, we explore the application of established statistical tests, alongside a curated selection of relevant evaluation metrics, within the context of supervised learning paradigms.  Our analysis focuses on the utility of these methods across diverse tasks, recognizing the limitations of relying solely on heuristic measures.  We advocate for the strategic deployment of metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC, coupled with statistical significance testing (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) to determine the robustness of observed performance gains. Furthermore, we consider the application of these techniques to complex architectures, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), highlighting the importance of considering dataset-specific characteristics and potential biases during the evaluation process.
