Title: Integrating Artificial Intelligence in Clinical Practice: A Review of Applications, Benefits, and Ethical Considerations

Abstract:
The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has transformed clinical practice across various medical specialties. This literature review synthesizes current research on AI applications in personalized treatment, highlighting their benefits and ethical implications. We examine the utilization of machine learning algorithms and deep learning techniques in disease diagnosis, patient stratification, and tailored therapeutic interventions. Our analysis reveals that AI-driven clinical decision support systems enhance diagnostic accuracy, streamline clinical workflows, and improve patient outcomes. However, concerns regarding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and liability necessitate careful consideration. As AI continues to augment clinical practice, it is essential to address these ethical considerations and develop frameworks that ensure responsible AI deployment. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI in clinical practice, informing future research and guiding the development of AI-driven personalized treatment strategies in 2024 and beyond.
