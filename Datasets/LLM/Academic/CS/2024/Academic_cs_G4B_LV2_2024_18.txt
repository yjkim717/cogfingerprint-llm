**Abstract**

The increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI) presents both transformative opportunities and complex challenges for healthcare delivery. This review synthesizes recent literature examining the burgeoning integration of AI technologies into clinical practice, focusing on applications ranging from diagnostic support and personalized treatment planning to automated administrative tasks.  We analyze the demonstrated benefits, including enhanced diagnostic accuracy, reduced clinician workload, and improved patient outcomes, while critically evaluating the associated ethical considerations. Specifically, concerns regarding algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the potential for diminished human oversight are addressed. 

Furthermore, the study investigates the technical hurdles impeding widespread adoption, such as the need for robust validation datasets and explainable AI (XAI) methodologies to ensure clinical trust.  We argue that a responsible and ethically informed approach to AI implementation—prioritizing transparency, accountability, and clinician collaboration—is paramount.  Future research directions are identified, emphasizing the development of standardized evaluation metrics and frameworks for mitigating bias within AI systems deployed in clinical settings.  This review contributes to the growing discourse on the societal impact of AI in healthcare, advocating for a human-centered design approach.
