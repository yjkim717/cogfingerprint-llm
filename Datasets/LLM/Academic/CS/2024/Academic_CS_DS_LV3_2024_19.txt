Abstract

This systematic review critically examines the 2024 landscape of generative artificial intelligence, with a dual focus on technical frontiers and ethical imperatives. We synthesize 127 peer-reviewed studies to map three interconnected domains: large language models demonstrating unprecedented contextual reasoning, generative adversarial networks advancing high-fidelity image translation, and multimodal systems bridging these capabilities. Our analysis reveals that while transformer architectures continue to dominate natural language processing, emergent diffusion models are revolutionizing medical imaging and creative industries through enhanced stability and controllability. However, these advancements necessitate rigorous responsible AI frameworks addressing model transparency, training data provenance, and societal impact mitigation. The review establishes that current benchmarking methodologies inadequately capture real-world deployment risks, particularly regarding embedded biases and energy consumption. We propose an integrated assessment matrix evaluating both performance metrics and ethical dimensions, arguing that sustainable development in generative AI requires balancing architectural innovation with governance mechanisms. This work contributes to establishing foundational principles for next-generation AI systems that align technical progress with human-centric values.
