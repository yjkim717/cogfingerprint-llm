**Disentangling Semantic Polysemy and Second-Order Activations in Vision-Language Models**

Recent advances in vision-language pre-training have yielded powerful models like CLIP, exhibiting impressive zero-shot transfer capabilities. However, the internal representations of these models remain largely opaque, hindering both interpretability and the robust design of adversarial defenses. This work investigates the semantic landscape of CLIP neurons by analyzing their *second-order effects* – the influence of one neuron’s activation on the subsequent activations of others within the network. We posit that these second-order interactions reveal a hitherto underestimated degree of *polysemy* within individual neurons, where a single neuron responds to a broader range of semantically related concepts than previously assumed. Through a novel analysis of these interactions, we demonstrate that neurons exhibit complex, non-orthogonal response profiles. Critically, we leverage this understanding to generate targeted *adversarial examples* that exploit these polysemic activations, significantly degrading CLIP's performance on specific classification tasks. Furthermore, we present a preliminary exploration of using these second-order activation maps for *zero-shot segmentation*, demonstrating the potential for deriving geometric information from semantic representations. Our findings suggest that moving beyond first-order neuron analysis is crucial for a deeper understanding of vision-language models and for developing more reliable and interpretable AI systems.  We release our code and datasets to facilitate future research in neuron interpretation and adversarial robustness.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Formal Language:** I used precise terminology common in computer vision and machine learning (e.g., "second-order effects," "polysemy," "adversarial examples," "zero-shot segmentation," "non-orthogonal response profiles").
*   **Structured Reasoning:** The abstract follows a clear structure:
    *   **Context/Motivation:** Briefly introduces CLIP and the problem of interpretability/robustness.
    *   **Hypothesis:** States the core argument about polysemy and second-order effects.
    *   **Method:** Briefly describes the approach (analyzing second-order activations).
    *   **Results:** Highlights the key findings (polysemic neurons, adversarial example generation, segmentation potential).
    *   **Conclusion/Impact:** Discusses the broader implications and future directions.
*   **Year Context (2024):** The language reflects current trends in the field (e.g., a focus on interpretability, adversarial robustness, and the limitations of existing approaches).  The mention of releasing code/data is standard practice now.
*   **Potential Expansion:**
    *   **Specific Techniques:** The abstract could be strengthened by mentioning the specific techniques used to analyze second-order effects (e.g., PCA, clustering, mutual information).
    *   **Quantitative Results:** Including a few quantitative results (e.g., "adversarial success rate increased by X%") would make the abstract more compelling.
    *   **Segmentation Details:** Briefly elaborating on the zero-shot
