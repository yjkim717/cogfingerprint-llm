**Abstract: Predictive Modeling of Post-COVID Financial Resilience in Bangladeshi Commercial Banks: Leveraging Machine Learning for Determinant Identification and Performance Forecasting**

This research investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operational and financial performance of Bangladeshi commercial banks, with a particular focus on identifying key determinants of resilience and forecasting post-pandemic performance trajectories. Utilizing a longitudinal dataset comprising financial statements, macroeconomic indicators, and regulatory interventions from 2018 to 2023, we employ a multi-faceted methodological approach combining Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Feature Selection, and advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Initial EDA revealed significant shifts in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Non-Performing Asset (NPA) ratios, Return on Assets (ROA), and Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) following the onset of the pandemic.

To address the challenge of identifying critical determinants, we implemented a Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm coupled with Random Forest importance scoring to select a parsimonious set of predictors from a pool of over 50 variables. Subsequently, we evaluated the predictive power of several ML models, including Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast ROA and NPA ratios for the period 2024-2026. LSTM networks, due to their capacity to model temporal dependencies inherent in financial time series data, demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of [insert hypothetical MAE value, e.g., 0.02] and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of [insert hypothetical RMSE value, e.g., 0.03] on a held-out testing set.

Our findings highlight the significant influence of factors such as government stimulus packages, credit risk mitigation strategies, and digital transformation adoption on bank performance. Furthermore, the LSTM model’s performance underscores the potential of incorporating temporal dynamics into financial risk assessment. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on the application of ML in financial forecasting and provides actionable insights for policymakers and bank management in Bangladesh aimed at bolstering financial stability and promoting sustainable economic growth in the post-COVID era. Future work will explore the integration of sentiment analysis from news articles and social media to further refine predictive models.

**Explanation of Choices & Potential Expansion:**

*   **CS Focus:** The abstract emphasizes the *methods* – EDA, Feature Selection (RFE, Random Forest), and specifically mentions ML models (GBM, SVR, LSTM).  This positions the work within a CS/Data Science context, rather than solely a finance one.
*   **Temporal Emphasis (LSTM):** The choice of LSTM is intentional. It's a powerful ML model well-suited for time series data, which is inherently relevant to financial performance. Highlighting its performance justifies its use from a CS perspective.
