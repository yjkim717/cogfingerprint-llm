**Abstract: Statistical Auditability of Pricing Algorithms for Collusive Behavior Detection**

The increasing prevalence of algorithmic pricing strategies across diverse markets raises concerns regarding potential algorithmic collusion and the resulting supra-competitive price outcomes. This paper addresses the critical need for effective regulatory oversight in this domain by proposing a novel, data-driven methodology for statistically auditing pricing algorithms. We formulate algorithmic collusion as a deviation from independently optimal pricing behavior, detectable through analysis of observed price trajectories and market demand. Our approach leverages statistical process control and anomaly detection techniques, specifically employing the CUSUM (Cumulative Sum) chart and robust regression analysis, to identify patterns indicative of coordinated pricing without requiring access to algorithm internals. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through simulations and an empirical analysis of historical pricing data, quantifying the ability to detect collusive behavior under varying market conditions and algorithm complexity.  The proposed framework offers regulators a practical tool for assessing market fairness and enforcing competition, contributing to the development of robust market regulation in the age of automated pricing. Future work will focus on extending the framework to account for dynamic algorithm adaptation and incorporating game-theoretic considerations.
