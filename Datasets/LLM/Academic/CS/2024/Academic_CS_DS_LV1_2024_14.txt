**Abstract**

The integration of deep learning (DL) and computer vision (CV) is catalyzing a paradigm shift towards data-driven precision in controlled-environment agriculture. This review systematically synthesizes and evaluates recent advancements from 2020 to 2024, focusing on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers (ViTs), and multimodal fusion architectures for key greenhouse operational tasks. We critically analyze state-of-the-art methodologies for non-invasive plant growth monitoring—leveraging techniques such as instance segmentation for biomass estimation and temporal models for yield prediction—and for the early and accurate detection of biotic and abiotic stresses. A significant portion of our analysis is dedicated to the salient challenges impeding widespread deployment, including the acute scarcity of large-scale, annotated horticultural datasets, the critical need for model robustness against domain shift induced by varying illumination and plant phenology, and the computational constraints of edge deployment. We conclude by delineating promising research trajectories, emphasizing the development of self-supervised and few-shot learning frameworks to mitigate data dependency, the exploration of physics-informed neural networks for enhanced generalizability, and the imperative for scalable, lightweight models suitable for real-time decision-support systems in sustainable greenhouse management.
