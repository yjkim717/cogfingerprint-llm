**Abstract**

The increasing prevalence of pricing algorithms in digital markets raises concerns regarding potential algorithmic collusion and its impact on market competition. This paper addresses the challenge of empirically detecting supra-competitive pricing behavior in complex algorithmic systems, proposing a novel definition of algorithmic non-collusion. We outline a statistical audit procedure designed for regulatory oversight, specifically tailored to distinguish between legitimate price optimization leveraging side information and instances of coordinated pricing. Our approach utilizes techniques from causal inference and statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate price correlations while accounting for factors that justify deviations from competitive pricing. The proposed audit offers a practical framework for regulators to assess algorithmic market dynamics, contributing to the ongoing development of effective regulatory strategies in the face of increasingly sophisticated automated pricing mechanisms. Future work will explore the scalability of the audit and its adaptability to diverse market structures.
