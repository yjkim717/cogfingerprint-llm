**Abstract**

Contextual Random Field (CRF) models have demonstrated significant efficacy in various computer vision tasks, including image segmentation and object detection. However, traditional CRFs often suffer from computational bottlenecks, particularly with increasing data dimensionality. This work presents a novel Sparse Non-Local CRF (SNLCF) architecture designed to mitigate these limitations while retaining broad applicability. SNLCF leverages sparse connections to reduce the complexity of pairwise interactions, focusing computation on relevant feature relationships.  Furthermore, we incorporate non-local dependencies, extending the receptive field beyond immediate neighbors, thereby capturing long-range contextual information.  Crucially, the model incorporates edge weights to modulate the influence of spatially distant features, enhancing robustness to noise and improving segmentation accuracy. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SNLCF achieves competitive performance with substantially reduced computational cost compared to dense CRF alternatives, indicating an effective balance between efficiency and representational power.
