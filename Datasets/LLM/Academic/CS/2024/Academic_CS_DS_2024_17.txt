This paper introduces UV-GS, a novel framework that fundamentally rethinks appearance representation in 3D Gaussian splatting. While current methods bake illumination and material properties directly into the splats, our approach explicitly decouples these elements through a learnable, universal texture atlas. We parameterize each Gaussian primitive with UV coordinates, mapping it to this shared texture space. This disentanglement unlocks previously intractable real-time editing capabilities; users can seamlessly swap materials, adjust lighting, or modify surface properties by simply editing the 2D texture atlas, without retraining the underlying 3D geometry. Our method maintains the high-fidelity, real-time performance of Gaussian splatting while introducing an unprecedented level of artistic control. We demonstrate compelling applications in virtual prototyping and dynamic scene stylization, establishing a new paradigm for editable neural scene representations.
