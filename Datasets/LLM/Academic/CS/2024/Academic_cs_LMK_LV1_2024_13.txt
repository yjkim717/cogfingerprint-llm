Title: Enhancing Systematic Generalization in Artificial Neural Networks through Metalearning

Abstract:
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have achieved remarkable success in various tasks; however, they often struggle with systematic generalization and few-shot learning. To address these challenges, we propose a metalearning framework that enables ANNs to adapt to new tasks with limited data. Our approach leverages model-agnostic metalearning (MAML) to optimize the initial parameters of ANNs, allowing for rapid fine-tuning on novel tasks. We demonstrate that this metalearning strategy mitigates catastrophic forgetting by retaining knowledge from previous tasks while acquiring new information. Our experiments on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in systematic generalization and few-shot learning performance. By integrating metalearning with ANNs, we provide a robust solution for real-world applications where data is scarce or dynamically changing. The results of this study have important implications for the development of more flexible and adaptable ANNs in 2024 and beyond.
