**Abstract**

Early and accurate diagnosis of heart disease remains a critical challenge in healthcare. This paper investigates the application of machine learning classification algorithms to automate and enhance heart disease identification. We evaluate the efficacy of several feature selection techniques, including a novel implementation of the ANDV A F-test, in conjunction with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Our experimental results, conducted on a standard heart disease dataset, demonstrate that optimized feature selection significantly improves classification accuracy and reduces computational complexity compared to models utilizing all available features. The findings highlight the potential of the ANDV A F-test within an SVM framework as a viable and efficient approach for intelligent heart disease diagnosis, contributing to advancements in clinical decision support systems and personalized medicine in 2024.
