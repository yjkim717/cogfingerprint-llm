**Abstract**

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical practice represents a paradigm shift in modern medicine. This comprehensive literature review synthesizes recent advancements in AI-driven diagnostic methodologies across diverse medical specialties, including radiology, pathology, and oncology. We systematically evaluate the performance of machine learning and deep learning models in enhancing diagnostic accuracy, expediting image analysis, and predicting patient prognoses. The analysis demonstrates a significant correlation between the implementation of these AI systems and improved patient outcomes, primarily through earlier disease detection and personalized treatment planning. However, this technological integration necessitates a critical examination of concomitant ethical and legal challenges. This review rigorously addresses key issues of algorithmic bias, data privacy, model interpretability ("black box" problem), and professional accountability. We argue that for AI to be sustainably adopted in clinical workflows, a robust framework balancing technological efficacy with stringent ethical governance is imperative. The findings underscore the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, clinicians, and ethicists to ensure these powerful tools are deployed responsibly and equitably.
