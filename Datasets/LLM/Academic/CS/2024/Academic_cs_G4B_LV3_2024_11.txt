**Abstract**

Convolutional Recurrent Field (CRF) models have demonstrated efficacy in computer vision tasks, yet their computational demands often restrict scalability, particularly with high-resolution data. This work introduces a novel Sparse Non-Local CRF (SNLC) architecture, designed to mitigate these limitations. SNLC leverages sparse connections and non-local contextual aggregation to reduce the parameter space while preserving crucial relational information.  We demonstrate that this sparse representation significantly enhances efficiency without compromising model generalizability, achieved through rigorous evaluation on both established image classification benchmarks and recent deep learning architectures.  The pairwise potential function within the CRF framework is adapted to incorporate these sparsity constraints, fostering improved feature learning and robust segmentation.  Preliminary results suggest SNLC offers a viable pathway towards deploying CRFs in more complex and real-time computer vision applications, representing a key advancement in efficient probabilistic modeling.
