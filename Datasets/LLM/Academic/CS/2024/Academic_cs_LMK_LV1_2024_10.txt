Title: Evaluating Supervised Machine Learning Models for Medical Imaging Tasks: A Comparative Analysis using Statistical Tests and Performance Metrics

Abstract:
The proliferation of deep learning techniques in medical imaging has underscored the need for robust evaluation methodologies to compare the performance of supervised machine learning models. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of various evaluation metrics and statistical tests in assessing the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on medical image classification and object detection tasks. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of metrics such as accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and average precision (AP), alongside statistical tests including the McNemar test and the DeLong test. Our results demonstrate that the judicious selection of evaluation metrics and statistical tests is crucial in determining the superiority of one CNN model over another. The findings of this study provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to develop and compare machine learning models for medical imaging applications in 2024 and beyond.
