In 2024, the escalating global burden of cardiovascular diseases necessitates advanced diagnostic methodologies. This research presents a robust computational framework for early and accurate heart disease prediction by leveraging synergistic machine learning techniques. The proposed system addresses the curse of dimensionality through rigorous feature selection algorithms, identifying the most salient clinical and pathological indicators to optimize model performance and interpretability. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of multiple classification algorithms is conducted, with a particular focus on the efficacy of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in handling high-dimensional, non-linear medical data. Empirical results demonstrate that the integration of strategic feature selection with a finely-tuned SVM classifier yields a significant enhancement in predictive accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity compared to conventional diagnostic approaches. This data-driven paradigm not only augments diagnostic precision but also fosters operational efficiency within clinical workflows, paving the way for its integration as a decision-support tool in proactive healthcare management and personalized patient care.
