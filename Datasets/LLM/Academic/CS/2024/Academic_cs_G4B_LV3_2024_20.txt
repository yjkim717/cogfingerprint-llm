**Abstract**

Contemporary microscopy workflows frequently encounter image artifacts – noise, blur, and limited sampling – severely compromising accurate cellular segmentation. This study introduces Cellpose3, a novel deep learning framework specifically designed to address these challenges. Leveraging a refined training paradigm, Cellpose3 prioritizes both objective segmentation fidelity and perceptual similarity to ground truth, resulting in demonstrably improved performance compared to existing methods.  Employing a convolutional neural network architecture, Cellpose3 effectively learns robust features from noisy microscopy data.  Preliminary results, presented herein, indicate a significant enhancement in cellular segmentation accuracy across diverse imaging modalities, including brightfield and confocal microscopy.  Further investigation will focus on integrating Cellpose3 into automated image analysis pipelines and exploring its adaptability to various cellular phenotypes.  The implications of this work extend to improved biological data acquisition and downstream analysis within the broader field of computational microscopy.
