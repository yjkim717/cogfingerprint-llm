## Dialectal NLP: A Landscape of Challenges, Opportunities, and Equity Considerations in 2024

The escalating ubiquity of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has profoundly impacted Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet their performance often exhibits significant disparities when applied to language dialects. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the evolving landscape of Dialectal NLP in 2024, analyzing existing datasets, methodological approaches, and prevalent tasks including dialect identification (classification) and dialect-aware natural language generation (NLG). Our investigation highlights a critical gap: while research acknowledges the importance of representing linguistic diversity, equitable outcomes remain a substantial challenge.

We categorize current approaches into three primary strategies: fine-tuning PLMs on dialect-specific data, incorporating dialectal features directly into model architectures, and employing meta-learning techniques to facilitate adaptation across dialects. A detailed examination of publicly available dialectal corpora reveals limitations in size, annotation quality, and representational bias, hindering the development of robust and generalizable models. Furthermore, we explore the ethical considerations of dialectal NLP, particularly concerning perpetuation of stereotypes, linguistic discrimination, and the potential for marginalization of speakers of under-represented dialects.  Finally, we propose future research directions, emphasizing the need for creating more balanced and inclusive datasets, developing techniques for low-resource dialectal languages, and incorporating fairness metrics into evaluation protocols to ensure equitable performance across diverse linguistic communities. This work aims to provide a roadmap for advancing Dialectal NLP towards a more inclusive and socially responsible future.
