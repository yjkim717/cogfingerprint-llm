Okay, here's a formal academic-style abstract, suitable for a CS conference or journal, based on the provided summary and keywords, written with a 2024 context and aiming for ~218 words.  I've focused on clarity, precision, and a logical flow.  Following the abstract, I've included notes on rationale and potential expansions.

**Abstract**

The increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) as AI assistants across knowledge-intensive tasks has highlighted a critical challenge: the propensity for generating factually incorrect outputs, commonly referred to as "hallucinations." While significant advancements have been made in LLM capabilities, a persistent issue remains their inability to gracefully acknowledge knowledge limitations. This paper investigates methods for empowering AI assistants to explicitly recognize and communicate uncertainty through natural language refusals, specifically leveraging the “I don’t know” (IDK) response as a strategic mitigation technique. We argue that incorporating explicit refusal mechanisms, rather than attempting to fabricate responses, demonstrably reduces the frequency of factual errors and enhances the overall reliability of AI-driven assistance.

Our research explores both rule-based and learned approaches for identifying situations where an LLM’s confidence is below a predefined threshold, triggering a natural language refusal. We evaluate these methods across a diverse set of knowledge-intensive tasks, comparing performance against baseline LLMs operating without refusal capabilities. Preliminary results indicate a significant reduction in hallucination rates with minimal impact on task completion for queries within the model's knowledge domain. Furthermore, user studies suggest that transparent acknowledgement of limitations enhances user trust and satisfaction. This work contributes to the growing body of research focused on building more robust and trustworthy AI assistants by explicitly addressing the problem of knowledge boundaries. Future directions include exploring adaptive refusal thresholds and incorporating uncertainty estimation techniques to refine the response selection process.

**Rationale and Potential Expansions (Notes for context and further development):**

*   **CS Focus:** The language is geared toward a computer science audience (e.g., "LLMs," "hallucinations," "uncertainty estimation").
*   **Structured Argument:** The abstract follows a logical progression: problem statement, proposed solution/argument, methodology, preliminary results, contribution, and future work.
*   **Precision:** Terms like "knowledge-intensive tasks," "factual errors," and "natural language refusals" are used precisely.
*   **2024 Context:** The phrasing acknowledges the current state of LLM research and the ongoing challenges.
*   **"I Don't Know" (IDK):**  I included this directly, as it was a keyword.  While informal, it’s become a recognized term in this area.
*   **Potential Expansions (if more detail were needed):**
    *   **Specific Tasks:** Mentioning specific tasks used for evaluation (e.g., question answering, fact verification) would strengthen the abstract.
    *   **Model Architectures:** Briefly noting the LLM architectures involved (e.g., Transformer-based models) could be relevant.
    *   **Evaluation Metrics:** Specifying the metrics used to measure hallucination rates and task completion would add rigor.
    *   **Refusal Strategies:** Elaborating on the types of refusals (e.g., simple "IDK," more elaborate explanations) would provide more detail.
