## Abstract: Efficient and General Non-Local Conditional Random Fields for Computer Vision

Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) have proven effective for structured prediction in computer vision, yet balancing computational efficiency with modeling flexibility remains a challenge. Dense CRFs offer expressiveness through unrestricted edge weights, but suffer from quadratic complexity, limiting their scalability. Conversely, sparse CRFs, while computationally tractable, often impose restrictive graph structures that constrain model capacity. This paper introduces a novel Sparse Non-Local Conditional Random Field (SNL-CRF) designed to bridge this gap. Our approach leverages sparse graph representations to maintain computational efficiency while incorporating non-local connections, effectively approximating the expressive power of dense CRFs. The SNL-CRF allows for unrestricted edge weights between arbitrary nodes within the graph, facilitating the capture of long-range dependencies crucial for tasks such as semantic segmentation and object recognition. We demonstrate through empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets that the SNL-CRF achieves comparable or superior performance to both dense and traditional sparse CRFs, while maintaining significantly reduced computational costs. This work represents a valuable contribution to efficient and general structured prediction models for computer vision applications, offering a practical pathway toward scalable deployment of powerful CRF architectures.
