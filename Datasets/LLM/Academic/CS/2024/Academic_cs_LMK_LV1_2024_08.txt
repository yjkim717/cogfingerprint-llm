Title: Enhanced Robot State Estimation via SE2(3) Lie Group and Chebyshev Interpolation

Abstract:
Accurate robot state estimation is crucial for reliable trajectory analysis and control. This paper presents a novel metric for robot state estimation, leveraging the SE2(3) Lie group to model the robot's pose and motion. By exploiting the Lie group's properties, we derive a precise representation of the robot's state trajectory. Furthermore, we employ Chebyshev interpolation to reconstruct the continuous-time state trajectory from discrete-time measurements, ensuring accurate evaluation of the robot's motion. Our proposed metric is integrated into state estimation algorithms, demonstrating improved performance in simulation and real-world experiments. The results show that our approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with complex robot motions. The proposed metric provides a valuable tool for robotics researchers and practitioners, enabling more accurate and reliable state estimation in various applications. (2024)
