Title: Enhancing Cardiovascular Disease Diagnosis through Optimized Machine Learning Frameworks

Abstract:
In 2024, the integration of machine learning (ML) in cardiology has revolutionized the predictive analytics landscape, particularly in heart disease diagnosis. This study presents a novel ML-based framework that synergizes feature selection techniques with advanced classification algorithms to enhance diagnostic accuracy. By leveraging the ANDV A F-test for feature optimization and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, our proposed system achieves a significant improvement in predictive performance. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that the SVM classifier, when coupled with the ANDV A F-test feature selection method, outperforms other ML models in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The findings underscore the potential of optimized ML frameworks in augmenting clinical decision-making processes. This research contributes to the ongoing discourse in the field by providing a robust and efficient heart disease diagnosis system, paving the way for future advancements in cardiovascular disease prediction and management.
