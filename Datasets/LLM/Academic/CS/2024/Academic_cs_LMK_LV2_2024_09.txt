Title: Enhancing Heart Disease Prediction using Optimized Machine Learning Algorithms

Abstract:
Cardiovascular diseases remain a leading cause of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for accurate predictive models. This study, conducted in 2024, presents a heart disease diagnosis system leveraging machine learning techniques to improve predictive accuracy. We investigate the efficacy of various classification algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), in conjunction with feature selection methods to identify the most relevant risk factors. A comprehensive analysis of multiple classification models is performed, evaluating their performance on a benchmark dataset. Our results demonstrate that the integration of SVM with optimized feature selection significantly enhances the accuracy of heart disease prediction, outperforming other machine learning approaches. The proposed system achieves a classification accuracy of 94.7%, indicating its potential as a reliable diagnostic tool. This research contributes to the development of more effective heart disease diagnosis systems, enabling early intervention and improved patient outcomes.
