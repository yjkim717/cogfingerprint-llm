**Abstract**

Recent advances in Non-Gaussian Component Analysis (NGCA) have increasingly demanded robust theoretical frameworks. This work introduces a generalized approach to establishing near-optimal squared-lower bounds for NGCA, mitigating the restrictive reliance on chi-squared normality assumptions. We demonstrate that moment-matching conditions, coupled with the identification of a hidden subspace, provide a sufficient condition for guaranteeing complexity limitations. Specifically, our analysis leverages statistical query models to derive SQ lower bounds, offering a tighter and more flexible constraint than prior methods. The significance of this result lies in its broader applicability to scenarios where the underlying data distribution deviates significantly from Gaussianity. This generalization enhances the tractability of NGCA and provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating novel algorithms within the field of statistical inference and dimensionality reduction, particularly in complex, high-dimensional datasets.
