In 2024, metalearning frameworks have emerged as a pivotal strategy for addressing the persistent challenges of catastrophic forgetting and limited systematic generalization in artificial neural networks (ANNs). By architecting explicit metalearning incentives—such as structured curricula and meta-reinforcement loops—these approaches enable ANNs to acquire reusable schemas and compositional skills, markedly improving out-of-distribution reasoning. This paradigm contrasts with conventional static training, which often lacks the inductive biases necessary for robust generalization. Notably, insights from these computational models are increasingly informing theories of human cognitive development, suggesting that practice with varied, structured tasks is fundamental to building flexible knowledge systems. The scalability of such metalearning mechanisms is further evidenced in large language models, where meta-pretraining on diverse tasks enhances both knowledge retention and cross-domain adaptation. Consequently, metalearning not only advances ANN capabilities but also serves as a critical bridge connecting machine learning progress with cognitive science, highlighting a synergistic path toward more general and resilient artificial intelligence.
