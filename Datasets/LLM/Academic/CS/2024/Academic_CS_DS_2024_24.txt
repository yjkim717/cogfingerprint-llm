This study investigates the integration of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, within higher education environments from the perspective of undergraduate students in a Sub-Saharan African context. Through a mixed-methods approach involving surveys and focus group discussions conducted in 2024, the research explores student awareness, usage patterns, and perceived implications for academic integrity and learning outcomes. Findings indicate a high level of familiarity with GenAI capabilities among respondents, who acknowledge its potential as an auxiliary learning resource for tasks like brainstorming and content summarization. However, a significant discrepancy exists between this recognized potential and actual application, with usage predominantly concentrated on non-core academic and administrative functions. A critical emergent theme is a widespread self-reported lack of institutional guidance or formal training on the ethical and effective deployment of these tools, leading to uncertainties regarding citation protocols and plagiarism. The study concludes that proactive, curriculum-integrated policies are urgently needed to harness GenAI's pedagogical benefits while mitigating academic risks and equipping students with necessary digital competencies.
