**Abstract**

Causal discovery, the process of inferring causal relationships from observational data, faces significant computational challenges when applied to high-dimensional datasets. The LiNGAM (Linear Non-Gaussian Acyclic Model) algorithm, a popular approach for causal structure learning, suffers from computational bottlenecks that limit its scalability. This paper addresses this limitation by presenting a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of LiNGAM, designed to substantially reduce runtime for large-scale gene expression data analysis and beyond. Our approach leverages the parallel processing capabilities of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate the core matrix operations inherent in the LiNGAM algorithm, specifically focusing on the optimization routines required for identifying the causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We demonstrate significant performance gains compared to traditional CPU-based implementations, reporting speedups of up to [Insert Specific Speedup Value Here] on datasets with [Insert Dataset Size Information Here] variables. These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying LiNGAM to datasets previously intractable, opening avenues for deeper causal inference in fields like genomics and systems biology, and offering a scalable solution for broader applications of causal discovery within the machine learning landscape.
