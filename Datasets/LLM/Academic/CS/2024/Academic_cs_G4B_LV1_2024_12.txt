**AcceleratedLiNGAM: GPU-Accelerated Causal Discovery for High-Dimensional Gene Expression Data**

Causal discovery from observational data remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with the complexity of high-dimensional datasets, such as those arising from gene expression analysis. This paper introduces AcceleratedLiNGAM, a novel algorithm designed to address these limitations. Leveraging GPU acceleration, AcceleratedLiNGAM dramatically reduces the computational time required for the DirectLiNGAM method, a popular Bayesian network causal discovery technique. We demonstrate that optimized GPU implementation allows for the efficient exploration of complex causal relationships within large gene expression datasets.  Preliminary results indicate a substantial speedup – up to a factor of ten – compared to CPU-based DirectLiNGAM.  Further investigation explores the scalability of AcceleratedLiNGAM and its potential application to identifying key causal drivers of biological processes, contributing to advancements in systems biology research.
