## My Budgeting App & the Shiny Struggle (and a Little Social Learning)

So, I’ve been on a bit of a personal project kick lately – building a budgeting app in R Shiny. It's surprisingly satisfying to track expenses and visualize where my money goes! The real challenge, though, has been getting it *out* there. I wanted something I could easily update from my phone (because let's be honest, I’m more likely to log an expense on the go).

Shinyapps.io is great, but the free tier has its limitations. It’s made me realize how much we rely on these platforms, and how tricky it can be to maintain things when you're just a hobbyist. I’ve been lurking in the R Shiny community online, and it's amazing to see how many people are tackling similar problems! Sharing knowledge, even about the small hurdles, feels really valuable.




Hope this is what you were looking for! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
