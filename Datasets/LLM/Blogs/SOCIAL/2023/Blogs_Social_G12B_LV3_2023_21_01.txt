## The Unexpected Kindness of 8 PM

Anyone else ever feel that weird, solitary vibe of being the last one in the office? It's 8 pm, the fluorescent lights hum, and you're staring at your to-do list, wishing you could teleport home. I was there just last week. A Reddit poll popped up about it â€“ the scenario of needing a four-hour drive to see family, and suddenly, that late night felt *really* late.

Then I saw the custodian, quietly making his rounds. A quick chat, a shared understanding of the hours we both keep, and suddenly, a late-night coffee felt less like a burden and more like a small act of self-care. Sometimes, the smallest human connection can shift your entire perspective, right?
