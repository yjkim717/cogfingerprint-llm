**The Disconnect in the Digital Frontier**

Remember that feeling when a favorite game just…breaks? Not in a clever, challenging way, but in a frustrating, *wrong* way? Lately, I’ve been thinking about that with No Man’s Sky and its VR controls. The constant tweaks, the shifts in how you move – it’s a surprisingly poignant reminder of our relationship with technology and social connection. 

It’s easy to get lost in the individual experience, tweaking settings until *you* feel comfortable. But these changes, specifically the nausea and awkward movements, highlight a disconnect. We crave immersion, a shared experience, yet these updates feel like pulling us further apart.  It makes you wonder – are we building worlds that truly connect us, or just isolating us with slightly altered interfaces?
