There’s something special about finishing a game like Baldur’s Gate 3 in 2023—it’s more than just credits rolling. It’s the quiet satisfaction of seeing your choices ripple through to the very end. In my first playthrough, I remember holding my breath during those final moments, wondering if my companions would find the peace they’d fought so hard for.

And they did. From the fiery-hearted Lae’zel finding a new purpose, to Shadowheart finally unburdening her heart, each one felt like a friend I’d helped guide home. The reunion scene was bittersweet—a mix of farewells and hopeful new beginnings. It struck me then how rare it is for a game to make you feel like you’ve not just “won,” but truly impacted a world and its people.

That’s the real magic: when pixels and code leave you reflecting on your own connections and the paths we choose.
