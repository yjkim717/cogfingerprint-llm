### The Day I Faced the Dragon and Won: My Mirena Story

It’s a strange thing, to willingly walk into a situation you know will be painful. To lie back on a crinkly paper sheet, stare at a ceiling tile, and say, “Yes, please, go ahead.” For most people, this sounds like a particular form of madness. But for those of us living with endometriosis, it’s just another Tuesday.

My dragon’s name is Endo. It’s an invisible, internal beast that has taken up residence in my body, twisting my organs into a landscape of scar tissue and fire. For over a decade, my life has been scheduled around its whims. Social events? “Maybe, if it’s a good pain day.” Spontaneous weekend trips? A logistical nightmare of packing heat pads and the strongest painkillers I can get. The pain isn't just a cramp; it’s a full-body takeover. A deep, grinding ache that radiates from my core down my legs and up my spine, often accompanied by nausea and a fatigue so profound it feels like my bones are filled with lead.

So, when my gynecologist sat down with me in early 2023 and suggested the Mirena IUD, my first reaction wasn’t fear of the insertion. It was skepticism. How could this tiny, T-shaped piece of plastic possibly tame the dragon that had tormented me for so long?

I’d heard the horror stories, of course. The internet is a treasure trove of them. Tales of searing pain, of being sent home without proper care, of fainting in the clinic. I spent weeks doom-scrolling, my anxiety mounting with every new testimonial. But then I’d have another endo flare-up—a day lost to the couch, canceling plans with a friend for the third time in a month, tears of frustration mingling with tears of pain—and I’d remember my *why*.

My why was a life not dictated by a pain calendar. My why was the hope of reclaiming my body as my own.

The day of the insertion, I was a bundle of nerves. I followed all the advice: I took 800mg of ibuprofen an hour before, I ate a light meal, and my wonderful partner came with me to hold my hand and drive me home. The waiting room felt like a crucible. But as I sat there, I had a sudden, profound realization. This single, concentrated moment of pain—this *procedure*—was a known quantity. It had a start time and an end time. It was, at most, a few minutes of my life.

My endo pain was different. It was an open-ended sentence. It could last for three days or three weeks. It was unpredictable, isolating, and emotionally corrosive. This Mirena insertion wasn't a random act of torture; it was a strategic battle in a long war. I was choosing a short, sharp skirmish in the hopes of winning back vast territories of my life.

When my name was called, I walked into the procedure room with that mindset. My doctor was fantastic, talking me through every step. “You’ll feel a pinch now,” she said, for the sounding of my uterus. It was a deep, intense cramp, the kind I’d rate as a solid 7 on my personal endo scale. I took a sharp breath in, focused on a poster of a sunflower on the wall, and breathed out slowly, just as I’ve done a thousand times during my worst flares.

“Okay, the big one is next, for the actual insertion. Just like a bad cramp, and then it’s done,” she said.

I squeezed my partner’s hand, closed my eyes, and thought, *“You are not as bad as a kidney stone. You are not as bad as that flare-up that sent me to the ER. You are a few moments, and then you are over.”*

There was a more intense, profound cramp—a solid 8—that made me see stars for a second. It was sharp and deep, a feeling of being profoundly *poked* in a place you never normally feel. And then, just like that, it was over.

“All done,” the doctor said, her voice cheerful. “You did great.”

I lay there for a moment, waiting for the other shoe to drop. But it didn’t. The intense pain was gone, replaced by a dull, period-like ache. I sat up, a little dizzy, but overwhelmingly… fine. More than fine. I felt triumphant.

The real magic, however, didn’t happen in that procedure room. It happened in the months that followed.

The first few weeks were an adjustment, with spotting and sporadic cramping. But something was different. These weren’t my dragon’s fiery roars; they were the grumblings of a beast being slowly sedated. By the third month, I noticed the silence. The background hum of pain that had been my life’s soundtrack for years was just… gone.

I started saying “yes” to things. A last-minute hike on a Saturday? Yes. A dinner party that would run late? Yes. I stopped mentally mapping out every public space for the nearest bathroom or soft chair to collapse into. The energy I had spent just *managing* my pain was suddenly freed up. I started a new creative project. I reconnected with friends I’d been neglecting.

The Mirena didn’t cure my endometriosis. There is no cure. But it gave me the single most valuable thing I had lost: agency. It gave me back the ability to plan a future that isn’t entirely contingent on the state of my uterus.

My story isn’t universal. I know I was lucky with my insertion experience and that my body responded well. But for anyone with endo considering this path, I want to offer this reframe: Don’t compare the insertion pain to a standard period. Compare it to *your* pain. For us, a few minutes of controlled, purposeful discomfort in a safe environment can be a worthy trade for the chaotic, life-stealing agony of endometriosis.

It was the day I stopped just surviving the dragon, and started fighting back. And for the first time in a long time, I feel like I’m winning.
