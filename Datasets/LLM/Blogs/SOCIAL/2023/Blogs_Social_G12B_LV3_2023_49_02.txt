## That Feeling When a Game Just…Breaks You

Okay, fellow gamers, let's talk frustration. I'm deep into my second playthrough of *Baldur's Gate 3* – absolutely loving it, obsessed even – and I’ve hit a wall. A *weird* wall. The Art Cullagh quest? Stuck. Apparently, a crucial note vanished into the digital ether, and I’m stuck in an endless loop of dialogue with the Fists.

It’s infuriating, sure. But it’s also oddly… relatable? Like, how many times in life have we been stuck in a pattern, repeating conversations, chasing something that just isn’t there? I’m seriously contemplating reloading, sacrificing hours of progress. Anyone else ever have a game (or a situation!) completely derail them like this? Send help (and maybe some troubleshooting tips!). 2023 is proving to be full of unexpected glitches, both virtual and real.
