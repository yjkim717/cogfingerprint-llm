## The Disconnect: When Tech Fights Your Instincts

Okay, so I've been diving back into No Man's Sky in VR lately – it's genuinely breathtaking, exploring alien landscapes like that. But something’s been *really* bugging me, and it’s got me thinking about how we interact with technology in general.

They recently changed the VR controls, linking your orientation to your right hand. Sounds innocuous, right? Wrong. It completely messes with the sense of presence. Before, I could use my whole body to subtly adjust and get my bearings. Now, I'm constantly fighting the game, my brain telling me to shift slightly, but my right hand dictating where I’m facing. 

It’s a small change, but it’s fractured the immersion. It feels… unnatural. It’s a potent reminder that even the most dazzling tech can feel jarring if it clashes with our ingrained instincts.  We’re so used to intuitive movement, to feeling grounded, and sometimes, the cleverest algorithms just miss the mark. 

It makes you wonder: how much are we sacrificing in the pursuit of "optimized" experiences? Are we designing for efficiency, or for genuine connection and feeling? It’s a question that feels relevant far beyond a space exploration game.
