The first time I scored a goal in Rocket League, the eruption of sound from my speakers was electric—the roar of the crowd, the satisfying *thwump* of the ball hitting the net. It felt like a victory lap for my thumbs. But there’s one sound in the game that has slowly become my personal kryptonite: the TP Boost.

It’s a high-pitched, grating whir that slices through all the other audio chaos. To most players, it’s just background noise. To me, as someone with autism and ADHD, it’s a sensory assault. My brain doesn’t filter sounds like a neat filing cabinet; it’s more like a overflowing inbox where every notification is marked “URGENT.” The TP Boost isn’t just loud—it’s overwhelming. It hijacks my focus, sending my heart racing and making my skin feel too tight. In the middle of a high-stakes match, that sound can completely unravel my concentration.

I’ve loved Rocket League since I first started playing. It’s one of the few spaces where I feel a genuine sense of community and flow. But lately, I find myself hesitating before clicking “Play.” I’ve turned down the master volume, I’ve tried different headphones, but the shrill pitch of that boost cuts through everything. It’s a constant, anxious anticipation: *When will it trigger next? How long can I last?*

This isn’t just about one sound in one game. It’s about accessibility in its broadest sense. In 2023, we’re having more conversations about making digital spaces inclusive—better colorblind modes, customizable controls, and readable fonts. But what about auditory accessibility? For millions of players with sensory processing differences, sound isn’t just atmosphere; it’s a barrier.

So, I’m adding my voice to the quiet chorus of players hoping for a simple fix: a volume slider specifically for boost sounds, or an option to swap it for a less piercing alternative. It’s a small change that could make a world of difference. Because the truth is, I don’t want to quit. I just want to play without wincing. I want to stay in the game I love, without my own boost feeling like a threat. Isn’t that what every player deserves?
