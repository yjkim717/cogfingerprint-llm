### The Spark That Flickered

I’ll be honest, 2020 nearly broke my love for engineering. Staring at a grainy video lecture on thermodynamics from my childhood bedroom, the passion that had once felt so electric just… faded. Engineering became a series of abstract equations to solve, not problems to build my way out of. The hands-on magic was gone.

Coming back to campus in 2023 was a lifeline. Finally, I was back in the lab, getting my hands dirty with my team on our capstone project—designing a simple water filtration system. The smell of solder, the frustration of a misaligned part, the triumphant cheer when it finally worked… this was why I’d signed up.

But if I’m being real, the flame hasn’t roared back to its old self. That pure, unshakable passion now feels more like a deliberate choice. It’s a commitment I renew every time I pick up a tool, grateful for the in-person connection that the screen stole. The spark is definitely back, but it’s a quieter, more resilient fire now.
