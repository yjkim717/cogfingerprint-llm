There I was, deep into my 2023 digital art project, when my trusty shift key in Clip Studio Paint betrayed me. That simple modifier for a quick straight line with my brush tool just… stopped. It’s funny how such a tiny setting hiccup can halt your entire creative flow, making you feel oddly disconnected. It reminded me that sometimes the smallest tools we take for granted are the very ones that connect our vision to reality. A good reminder to check our own personal 'modifier settings' every now and then.
