**The Ghost of a ‘FWB’**

Okay, real talk. Scrolling through Instagram last night, I saw a photo of an old friend – someone I’d had a ‘friend with benefits’ situation with years ago. And suddenly, *bam*, a weird little current of attraction hit me. It’s so strange, right? 

I’m in a solid relationship now, and the thought of even entertaining it felt…wrong. Like a betrayal of everything I’ve built. It’s a tiny, nagging ghost from the past, reminding me of a different kind of pull. It made me think about how easily we can get caught up in fleeting feelings, and how important it is to actively choose where our attention goes.  Anyone else ever wrestle with these echoes?

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps generate a post focused on a slightly different angle (e.g., exploring the societal pressure around ‘FWB’ relationships)?
