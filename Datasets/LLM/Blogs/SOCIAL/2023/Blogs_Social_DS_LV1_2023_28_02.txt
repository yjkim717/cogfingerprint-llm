**When Home Isn't a Safe Space to Mess Up**

I did something stupid last week. Senioritis hit hard, and I skipped school with some friends. I knew I’d get in trouble, but I expected the usual lecture from my parents. What I didn’t expect was my older brother’s reaction.

When he found out, he didn’t just get angry—he got scary. He cornered me in the kitchen, his voice a low growl as he threatened to “teach me a lesson” if I ever embarrassed the family like that again. The look in his eyes wasn’t the annoyance of a sibling; it was pure, cold rage.

It’s 2023—we talk so much about mental health and safe spaces, but what do you do when the threat is inside your own home? I’m stuck between the guilt of my mistake and the fear of his temper. How do you navigate a family conflict when a simple argument can turn into a genuine threat?
