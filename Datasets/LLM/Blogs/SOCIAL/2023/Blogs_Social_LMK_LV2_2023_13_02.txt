"As I navigated the ups and downs of pregnancy in 2023, I found myself faced with a daunting decision: genetic carrier screening. On one hand, I wanted to be prepared for any potential genetic disorders. On the other, my health anxiety threatened to spiral out of control. I couldn't shake the fear of receiving a positive result. I wondered, was the uncertainty worth the anxiety? I shared my concerns with loved ones and my healthcare provider, and slowly, I began to feel more empowered to make an informed decision that was right for me and my growing family."
