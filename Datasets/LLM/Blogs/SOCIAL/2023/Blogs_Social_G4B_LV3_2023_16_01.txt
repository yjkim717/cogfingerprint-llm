**The Tug-of-War with My Favorite Game**

Let’s be honest, 2023 felt like a constant battle for me and *Overwatch 2*. I genuinely loved the core idea – the team-based hero shooter – but I kept running into this frustrating cycle. Beautiful gameplay would quickly sour when the balancing felt completely off, and then… the community. Let’s just say, some corners of the online world weren’t exactly brimming with positivity. 

It led to a lot of avoidance. I’d log in, get immediately annoyed, and then shut it down. It’s a weird feeling, wanting to enjoy something so much while simultaneously needing to protect your peace.  I’m still figuring out how to find that balance – how to appreciate the fun without letting the negativity steal the joy.  Anyone else feel this pull?
