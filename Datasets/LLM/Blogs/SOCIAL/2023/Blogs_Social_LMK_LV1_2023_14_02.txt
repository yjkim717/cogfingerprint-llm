"Living with PCOS: When Your Period Takes Over Your Life"

I'm not gonna sugarcoat it - my periods are a mess. As a 26-year-old with PCOS, I've grown accustomed to the unpredictability, but it's getting to the point where it's disrupting my daily life. The heavy bleeding can last up to two weeks, and the pain is debilitating. I've had to cancel plans with friends, miss work, and even avoid social media because I just can't be bothered. The cramping is so bad that I've been known to double over in public, mortified. To make matters worse, I've also been experiencing weird symptoms like visual snow syndrome, which is making me wonder if there's more going on under the surface. On top of that, my ADHD brain is already a jumbled mess, and the pain and discomfort aren't helping. Has anyone else with PCOS had to deal with this level of chaos? Should I be worried, or is this just my new normal?
