As I sweated through my gym routine in 2023, I couldn't shake off the nagging feeling that something was off. On Roaccutane for acne, I was determined to stay on track with my fitness goals. But every time I pushed myself, I'd feel lightheaded and anxious. Was it dehydration or a side effect of my medication? I began to wonder if I was listening to my body or just being stubborn. As I navigated this uncertainty, I realized that health isn't just about routine - it's about tuning in to our unique needs and being kind to ourselves.
