As I sipped coffee on my second date in 2023, I couldn't help but wonder: should I reach for the check? In today's dating landscape, navigating the rules around paying can be a minefield. I wanted to respect my date's boundaries, but also show my appreciation for the evening. We'd been chatting effortlessly, and I decided to follow their lead - if they offered to split or grab the check, I'd let them. Open communication is key; a simple "May I get this?" can go a long way in avoiding awkwardness and showing genuine interest.
