It’s 2023, and I’m sitting at my piano, realizing there are gaps in my music theory knowledge. I’ve played for years, but diving into beginner books feels humbling. Self-study is my path for now, though the dream of conservatory lingers. Sharing this journey online, I’ve connected with others in the same boat—strangers turned friends, all harmonizing through shared vulnerability. Sometimes, the music we make together off the keys is just as beautiful.
