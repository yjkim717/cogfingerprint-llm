### The Invisible Wall

It’s 2023, and we talk a lot about being “authentic.” But what happens when your most authentic reality is something you have to hide?

For 15 years, my life has been dictated by my gut. I have IBS-D, and for me, a simple meal can trigger an immediate, explosive reaction. My phone’s maps app isn't for finding new restaurants; it's for memorizing every single public restroom in a five-mile radius. I’ve had the colonoscopies, the stool samples—the works. Everything comes back “normal.”

The hardest part isn't the physical pain; it's the social isolation. I’ve had to leave dinners mid-sentence, cancel plans at the last minute, and invent excuses for why I can’t join that road trip. Friends see a healthy 39-year-old man. They don't see the internal chaos, the constant, low-grade panic.

Living with an invisible illness builds an invisible wall between you and the world. My journey has been about trying to dismantle that wall, brick by brick, by being a little more open, a little more honest. Because the most debilitating symptom of all is the loneliness.
