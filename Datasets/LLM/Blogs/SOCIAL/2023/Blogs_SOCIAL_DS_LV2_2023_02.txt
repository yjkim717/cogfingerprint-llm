It’s 2023, and I’ve noticed how social media has turned into this hawkishly watched space. Every post, every comment—it feels like we’re under intense observation, not just by algorithms but by each other. We’re aggressively watching for missteps, ready to pounce. It’s exhausting, this strict monitoring of our digital lives. I miss when connection felt lighter, less like a disciplinary oversight. Are we building community, or just policing it?
