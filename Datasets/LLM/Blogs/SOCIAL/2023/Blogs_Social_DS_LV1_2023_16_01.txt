There’s a moment in every Overwatch 2 match where hope flickers—right before the enemy team’s perfectly balanced composition steamrolls us, or a teammate starts flaming in chat. I keep coming back, lured by the thrill of teamwork and strategy, but 2023 has been a rough ride. The smurf accounts in competitive feel endless, and matchmaking often pairs new players with veterans, sparking frustration all around.

It’s more than just losing; it’s the erosion of fun in a space meant for connection. I’ve muted more players than I can count, and each toxic exchange chips away at why I log in. I wonder—can a game so brilliant in concept survive its own community?
