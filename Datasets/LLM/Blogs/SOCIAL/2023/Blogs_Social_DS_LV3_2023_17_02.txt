The thrill of ordering my first Subaru Crosstrek was electric—I could already picture weekend road trips and snowy drives handled with ease. But as my mid-February move looms, that excitement is tinged with anxiety. With the chip shortage still causing delays in 2023, I’m refreshing my email constantly, hoping for that VIN and delivery date. It’s a shared modern dilemma: waiting on a machine, wondering when life’s next chapter can truly begin.
