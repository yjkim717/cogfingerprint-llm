## The Ghosts of "What If?" in Hearts of Iron IV

Okay, fellow strategy gamers, let’s talk about those late-night Hearts of Iron IV sessions, right? I was wrestling with a particularly tricky GGR run last night. You know, the Greater German Reich dream. I’d gone all-in, establishing collaboration governments in both France and Russia – a risky move, to say the least. 

But the question lingered: could I *still* pull off the GGR formation? Could I wrestle back territory from those stubborn Reich Commissariats? It’s a fascinating thought experiment, really, about how choices ripple through a historical simulation. Sometimes, even in a game, you're left wondering about the roads not taken. Anyone else been down this rabbit hole?
