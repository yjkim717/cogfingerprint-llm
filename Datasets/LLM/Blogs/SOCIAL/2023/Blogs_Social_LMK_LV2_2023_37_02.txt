As I reflect on my favorite fantasy series, I'm struck by the allure of alternate histories set in the Late Modern period. The Temeraire series, with its dragons and Napoleonic Wars, and Carnival Row, with its mythical creatures and steampunk world, transport me to a world of wonder. These stories not only entertain but also offer a commentary on our own world, making me appreciate the power of fantasy to shape our understanding of society today, in 2023.
