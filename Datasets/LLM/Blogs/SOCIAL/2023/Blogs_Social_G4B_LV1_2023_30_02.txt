**The Unexpected Price Tag & a Social Media Vent**

Okay, so last week was… frustrating. I needed a CV axle replaced on my Jeep, and the quote came back way higher than I expected. Seriously, like, a *huge* jump. I immediately started scrolling through RockAuto, comparing prices and labor estimates – you know, doing my due diligence. 

Then, I posted a little rant on my local Facebook group. Just a quick, honest question about the shop’s communication. It spiraled a bit, honestly. Suddenly, I was fielding opinions, accusations, and even some pretty harsh critiques. 

It made me think about how quickly things can get amplified online. While it felt good to voice my concern, it also highlighted how easily frustration can turn into a public spectacle. It reminded me that even a small repair can trigger a surprisingly large social reaction in 2023.  Sometimes, a quiet conversation is better, right?
