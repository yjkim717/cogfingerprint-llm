"Opera San Jose's 'Marriage of Figaro' is a game-changer! Set in 1890s India under British Raj, this non-traditional production breathes new life into Beaumarchais' classic. The result is a clever commentary on class and power dynamics that feels eerily relevant in 2023, making this opera a must-see for anyone looking for a fresh take on a timeless tale."
