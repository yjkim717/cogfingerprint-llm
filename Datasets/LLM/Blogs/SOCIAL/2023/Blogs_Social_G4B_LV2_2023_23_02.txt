**The Tightness in My Chest – And Why Work Can Be Brutal**

Okay, real talk. As a trans man, 2023 feels…complicated. I’m out at work, mostly, but there’s this constant low-level anxiety, a tightness in my chest when I’m around new people. It’s not about *them*, I know, but about the effort it takes to maintain this carefully constructed ‘him’ – the one I’m still figuring out how to truly embody. 

Recently, I’ve been leaning heavily on online communities, just searching for others who get it. The feeling of being perpetually “in progress” after top surgery and starting my transition is exhausting. It’s a weird mix of relief and profound insecurity. 

Anyone else wrestle with this social tightrope? It’s a struggle to be authentic while navigating the everyday, and honestly, I just crave a little space to breathe.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
