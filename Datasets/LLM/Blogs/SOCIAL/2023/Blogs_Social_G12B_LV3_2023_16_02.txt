## The Unexpected Annoyance of Reddit Bots (and How I Finally Got Peace)

Okay, can we talk about something a little weird? Lately, my Reddit experience has been… punctuated. By follower requests. And not from people I recognize. Turns out, there's a whole ecosystem of porn bots swarming the platform, automatically sending follow requests to anyone and everyone. Seriously!

It was starting to feel overwhelming, a constant stream of digital noise. Then I stumbled upon a clever tip – adjusting my account settings to disable automatic following. It sounds simple, right? But it's made a world of difference. Suddenly, Reddit feels a little less chaotic, a little more… mine. Just a small tweak, a little digital decluttering, and I've reclaimed a bit of online sanity in 2023. Anyone else dealing with this?
