"Stuck in Faer√ªn! I'm on my second playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3 and I'm loving the journey, but I've hit a roadblock - the Art Cullagh quest has got me stumped. I've tried every possible solution, but I'm still stuck. Has anyone else encountered this issue? I've scoured online forums and watched walkthroughs, but I'm still no closer to resolving the problem. If you're a fellow BG3 enthusiast, I'd love to hear your tips on how to progress. Let's get this quest back on track!" #BaldursGate3 #GamingCommunity
