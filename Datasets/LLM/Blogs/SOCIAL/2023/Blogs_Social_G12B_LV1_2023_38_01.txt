## The Shifting Sands of Online Lore: Why Documentation Matters

Anyone who's spent any real time online knows the feeling: you get invested in a story, a creator's world, and then… the goalposts move. Suddenly, previously established facts are retconned, explanations vanish, and it feels like you’re chasing a phantom. I’ve been seeing it *everywhere* lately, particularly in some of the larger online lore communities.

It got me thinking – we need better documentation. Not just for massive projects, but for *everything*. Think about it: a clear, accessible record of decisions, timelines, and character backstories. It’s not about stifling creativity, it's about providing a foundation.

I’ve seen the frustrations play out firsthand, echoes of what people experience with creators like Doomcock. When narratives shift without explanation, it breeds mistrust and fuels endless speculation.  Good documentation provides accountability and allows fans to engage in a more informed and constructive way. It’s a small change that could make a big difference in how we navigate the increasingly complex landscape of online storytelling.
