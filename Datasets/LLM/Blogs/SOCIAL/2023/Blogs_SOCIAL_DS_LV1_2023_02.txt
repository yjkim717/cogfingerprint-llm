It’s 2023, and I’ve noticed a shift in how we connect. Lately, it feels like every post, every comment is under hawkish observation—not just by algorithms, but by each other. We’re all aggressively watching, quick to judge or call out. It’s like living in a digital fishbowl where every move is scrutinized. I miss the days when social media felt like a casual chat, not a stage under such intense, disciplinary oversight. Are we building community or just keeping score?
