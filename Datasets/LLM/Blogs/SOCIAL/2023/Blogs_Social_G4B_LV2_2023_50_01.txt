**The Quiet Rebellion of "Am I the Only One?"**

Okay, be honest – how many times have you posted “Am I the only one who feels this way?” on Reddit or social media? It feels… familiar, right? Lately, I've been thinking about it differently. I realized it’s not really a plea for validation, but more of a gentle starting point. It’s a little figure of speech, a way of saying, "Hey, I'm noticing something, and I want to explore it with others."  It’s a quiet rebellion against feeling utterly alone, a nudge toward connection.  What do you think? #socialmedia #unpopularopinion
