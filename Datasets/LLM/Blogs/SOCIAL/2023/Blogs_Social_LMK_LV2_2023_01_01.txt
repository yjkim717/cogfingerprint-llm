**The Rocket League Conundrum: A Call to Action for Gaming Community**

As I sat down to play my favorite game, Rocket League, I couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration. The news that Epic Games had acquired Psyonix, the game's developer, had been lingering in the back of my mind. While I was initially excited about the prospect of new possibilities, I've come to realize that the game's fate might be sealed.

Under Epic Games' umbrella, Rocket League's development has slowed down significantly. The lack of new content and updates has left the community feeling stagnant. It's as if the game's potential for growth has been put on the backburner, overshadowed by other more lucrative titles. This got me thinking - what's the point of having a great game if it's not being nurtured?

The issue at hand is not just about Rocket League; it's about game monetization and the priorities of large gaming corporations. The pursuit of profit often takes precedence over community engagement and game longevity. It's a vicious cycle where games are released, exploited for their monetary potential, and then left to wither away.

So, what's the solution? Some fans, including myself, are advocating for a boycott. By refusing to play and purchase Rocket League, we're making a statement: we care about this game, and we want to see it thrive. Our hope is that Epic Games will take notice and consider selling the game to a smaller developer who might be more invested in its permanent growth.

It's not about being anti-Epic Games or anti-big corporations; it's about standing up for a game that has brought us so much joy. By taking a stand, we're not only fighting for Rocket League's future but also for the kind of gaming experience we want to see more of.

As I reflect on this situation, I'm reminded that our actions as gamers have the power to shape the industry. So, what will you do? Will you join the boycott, or will you continue to support Rocket League under Epic Games? The fate of this beloved game is in our hands.
