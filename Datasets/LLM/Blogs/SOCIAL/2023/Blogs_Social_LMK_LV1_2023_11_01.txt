"I still chuckle thinking about the time my kid got in trouble for snacking in class. To lighten the mood, he quipped, 'I don't have enough boogers to share anyway!' The humor was lost on his teacher, but it cracked me up. It's moments like these that remind me to appreciate the silly humor kids bring to the table - and the importance of not picking their noses in class!"
