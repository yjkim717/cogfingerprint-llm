## That One Night, and the Ghosts It Leaves Behind

It's weird how memories surface, isn't it? I was scrolling through TikTok last night – the usual doomscroll – and suddenly *bam*, I was back in 2018, remembering a specific night. Not a big, life-altering event, just… a really good hook-up. It happened while I was casually dating, definitely not in a serious relationship. 

It wasn't about anything deep; pure, uncomplicated attraction. And honestly, it was fun. Really fun. Now, I’m happily settled with my boyfriend – we’re solid, you know? – and the thought doesn't threaten anything. But there's this faint echo of it, this little "what if?" that pops up sometimes. 

It makes you think about the different kinds of connection we crave, doesn't it? The easy, fleeting kind versus the slow-burn, committed kind.  Just a random thought, swirling around in my head. Anyone else ever have those unexpected memory flashes?
