## Costco Pizza Blues: A Little Slice of Disappointment

Okay, friends, let's talk Costco. Specifically, their pizza. I was *so* excited about the new Motor City Garlic Pizza hitting Costco Canada. I genuinely thought it would be a worthy successor to the beloved Pizza Delight – the one that honestly tasted like a giant, cheesy, garlicky Domino's breadstick. Sadly? It's just... not the same. The flavor is muted, a little bland. It's a reminder that sometimes, change isn’t always an improvement, and a good thing really can be missed. Anyone else feeling this pizza pang?
