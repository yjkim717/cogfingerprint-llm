>## The Great 'A' Debate of 2023

Okay, I need to share something that happened this week because I’m still processing it. My kiddo started preschool, which is, as most parents know, a *lot*. Beyond the potty training and naptime logistics, there's a whole social landscape to navigate. And apparently, a surprisingly heated debate about… lowercase letters.

Seriously.

I witnessed a full-blown parental meltdown at pickup time because a teacher had written my child's name with a capital ‘A’ on their cubby. A capital ‘A’! The mom was *not* happy. Apparently, the argument is that children should learn lowercase letters first, and capitals are confusing. I get the logic, really. 

But watching the scene unfold felt… intense. Like, a little much for a letter. It got me thinking about the pressure we put on ourselves (and our kids!) to do everything "right." Are we so focused on the "correct" way to do things that we miss the bigger picture – a happy, learning child? 

Maybe I'm just feeling philosophical after a week of glitter and tiny chairs. But I'm choosing to let the capital ‘A’ slide.
