## The Weight of Unseen Things

It's been a rough few months, honestly. Like, really rough. I'm 26, and I feel like my body has decided to throw a full-blown party, and nobody was invited. It started back in October, and it just… hasn’t stopped. We’re talking heavy periods, the kind that feel like a constant drain, both physically and emotionally. And the pain? Let’s just say mobility isn't always a guarantee.

I've been juggling a lot already – PCOS, visual snow syndrome (which is a whole other story of seeing static all the time!), and ADHD. It's a complicated cocktail, and adding this bleeding on top has just amplified everything.

What’s been hitting me the hardest, though, isn’t just the physical discomfort. It's the *social* piece. Cancelling plans becomes the norm. Explaining to friends why you can’t make it out, *again*, feels exhausting.  There's a weird guilt too, like I'm letting people down.  It's tough when you’re used to being the "go-to" person, the one who’s always up for anything.

I’ve found myself retreating, which isn’t really *me*.  Social media feels performative when I’m just trying to survive the day.  But I’m trying to remind myself that it's okay to need space, to prioritize my health, and to lean on the people who truly understand. It’s a slow process, learning to navigate life with this constant undercurrent of… well, a lot.  Anyone else ever feel like they're carrying a weight nobody else can see?
