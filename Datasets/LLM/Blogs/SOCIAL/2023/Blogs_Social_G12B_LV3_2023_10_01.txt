>## The Frustrating Dance of Python Imports (and Why It Feels So Personal)

Okay, let's be honest, we’ve all been there. You’re wrestling with Python, specifically Flask, and suddenly you’re staring down a dreaded `ModuleNotFoundError`. It’s happened to me *again* this week, and the frustration is real. 

It's particularly maddening when your code *works* perfectly fine when you run it directly from the command line. But deploy it within your Flask application, and *poof* – import errors! It feels like the universe is actively conspiring against you.

This time, it was a tricky dance with project structure and how Flask was resolving module paths. After a good hour of head-scratching and debugging, the solution was surprisingly simple: adjusting the way I structured my project.  Anyone else experienced this? It's a reminder that even experienced developers face these little hurdles, and sometimes, the problem isn’t your code, but how it's *being* run.
