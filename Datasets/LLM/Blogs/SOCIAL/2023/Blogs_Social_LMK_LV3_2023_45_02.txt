"Sailing into a Charging Conundrum: A Royal Caribbean Adventure

As I boarded Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas in 2023, I was thrilled to embark on a relaxing cruise. But, as I settled into my cabin, I realized I'd packed a crucial item - a pass-through plug adapter. With multiple devices to keep charged throughout the day, I was determined to stay powered up. The question was, would my trusty adapter work in the ship's power outlets? After some research, I discovered that using a pass-through plug adapter in the Voyager's cabins was a viable solution. I was relieved to be able to charge my phone, camera, and other essentials without hassle. For fellow cruisers, I'd recommend packing a reliable adapter to avoid a similar conundrum. With the right gear, you can focus on enjoying the journey, not worrying about a dead battery."
