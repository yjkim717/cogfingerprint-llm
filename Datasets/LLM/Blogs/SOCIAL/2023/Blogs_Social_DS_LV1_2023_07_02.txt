There’s something bittersweet about the way a favorite food can vanish from store shelves, isn’t there? It happened to me last week at Costco Canada. I was searching for that Mediterranean pasta salad—the one with the perfect tangy dressing—and the Balderson cheddar slices I always grabbed from the deli. Gone. An employee told me they’d been discontinued, and I felt a little pang of loss.

It’s funny how these small things connect us. I posted about it online, and suddenly, strangers were sharing their own "food obituaries." In 2023, with so much division, it was a gentle reminder of our shared, simple joys. We weren’t just mourning pasta salad; we were reminiscing together, finding common ground one discontinued item at a time.
