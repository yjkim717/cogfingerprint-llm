**The Weight of "Almost"**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Scrolling through social media and seeing everyone’s seemingly effortless success, while you’re just… *almost* there. I had a really unsettling conversation last week. A manager gently suggested I might need to look for a new role – basically, I wasn’t meeting deadlines, and my ADHD was making it incredibly hard to keep up. The thought of being replaced hit hard. It’s not about being lazy, but about a brain that works differently.  It made me realize how much pressure we put on ourselves to fit a neurotypical mold.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a post focused on a slightly different angle related to the initial summary?
