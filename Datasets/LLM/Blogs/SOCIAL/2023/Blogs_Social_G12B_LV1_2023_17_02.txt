>## The Waiting Game & a February Move

Okay, so I bit the bullet. I finally got myself a Subaru Crosstrek! It’s been a long time coming – I’ve always wanted that rugged little adventurer. But here’s the kicker: the estimated delivery date is January. And I'm moving in February. 

Cue the mild panic, right? Apparently, the dreaded chip shortage is still throwing a wrench into everything, even Subaru’s production. I keep refreshing the email, checking the VIN tracker like it's the lottery. It’s a strange feeling, anticipating a big purchase that *should* be here, but is hanging in the balance. Hoping this little SUV arrives before my boxes do! Anyone else experiencing similar delays these days? Let me know – misery loves company!
