There’s something magical about finding fantasy worlds that feel just a breath away from our own reality. In 2023, with so much division, diving into series like *Temeraire* or *Carnival Row*—where history and myth collide—reminds me how stories can bridge gaps. They reflect our struggles, but with a hopeful, imaginative twist. It’s comforting to think that even in turbulent times, we can still dream up worlds where understanding triumphs.
