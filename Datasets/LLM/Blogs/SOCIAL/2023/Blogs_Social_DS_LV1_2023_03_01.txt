It’s 2023, and I never thought I’d witness a grammar showdown at preschool drop-off. A mom—let’s call her Sarah—was fuming because the teachers had the audacity to capitalize the first letter of her daughter’s name, “emma,” on a classroom display.

“It’s lowercase! It’s intentional!” she insisted, her voice trembling with frustration. I get it—names are personal, and creative spellings matter. But watching her unravel over a capital ‘E’ made me reflect: in our quest for individuality, are we losing sight of what truly nurtures our kids? Connection, not capitalization, builds community.

Sometimes, the biggest lessons at preschool aren’t for the children, but for us parents learning to let go.
