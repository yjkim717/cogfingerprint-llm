"Am I the Only One?" - Unpacking the Power of a Simple Phrase. 
In 2023, social media has conditioned us to crave validation for our thoughts. When sharing an unpopular opinion, it's instinctive to preface it with a hesitant "am I the only one?" But is this phrase a sign of weakness or a clever social tool? I argue it's the latter.

So, the next time you have an unpopular opinion, try owning it with a cheeky "am I the only one?" - you might just spark a meaningful connection.
