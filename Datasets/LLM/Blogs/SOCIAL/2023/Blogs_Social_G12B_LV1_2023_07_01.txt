## The Pizza Wars of 2023 (and a Costco Letdown)

Okay, confession time: I’m deeply invested in the Costco pizza saga. Remember when they had Pizza Delight? *Chef's kiss*. The Motor City garlic pizza just isn't the same. Scrolling Reddit last night, I found someone else feeling the same pang of disappointment. It got me thinking – are we all chasing nostalgic food memories? Even Domino's cheesy garlic bread felt better back then, somehow. Pizza perfection is a tricky thing to recapture!
