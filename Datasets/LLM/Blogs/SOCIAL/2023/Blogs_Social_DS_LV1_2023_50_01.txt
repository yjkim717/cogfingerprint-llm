It’s 2023, and I’ve noticed a trend: people are quick to call out the phrase “Am I the only one?” online. They say, “Obviously you’re not the only one!” But I think we’re missing the point. It’s not a literal question; it’s a plea for connection. It’s a conversational hand reaching out, saying, “Does anyone else feel this way?” In a world of curated feeds, this little figure of speech is just a humble attempt to find our tribe in the digital noise.
