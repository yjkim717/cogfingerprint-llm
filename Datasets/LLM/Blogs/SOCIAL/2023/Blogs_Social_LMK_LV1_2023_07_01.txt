"As I unwrapped the Motor City garlic pizza from Costco Canada in 2023, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment. The flavor just didn't compare to my go-to Pizza Delight 2-pack. The garlic bread was a letdown too - it lacked that perfect balance of savory and spice. I'm sticking to Pizza Delight for my pizza fix. Has anyone else had a similar experience with Motor City pizza? I'm curious to know - what's your favorite pizza spot?"
