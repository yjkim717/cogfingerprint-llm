There’s something about a really good funk track that just pulls you in, doesn’t it? I was digging through music last week, trying to recapture a feeling – a specific song with a driving sequencer, a soulful male voice, and this incredible female choir chanting “Come on Come on.” It’s like a collective energy, a joyful insistence.  It reminded me how powerful shared experiences, even just a repeating phrase, can be in building connection. 2023 feels like a year of seeking that feeling.
