**The Overload: When Rocket League Gets Too Loud**

Okay, real talk. I’ve been spending a *lot* of time in Rocket League lately – it’s my go-to for a quick win, a silly laugh, and honestly, sometimes just a way to zone out. But recently, something’s been… grating. And it’s not just my skills (or lack thereof!). 

I’ve been reading about other players, specifically those with sensory sensitivities like autism or ADHD, and a lot of them are experiencing the same thing. It’s the TP Boost. That little shimmering pulse that zips you across the arena? It’s *loud*. Really, really loud. 

I get it. As someone who sometimes finds sudden noises incredibly overwhelming, that sharp, electronic ping can be genuinely distressing. It’s a small thing, a simple game mechanic, but for some of us, it’s a massive sensory overload. 

I reached out to Psyonix – just a small request, really – to ask if there was any way to adjust the volume. It’s a reminder that even in a virtual world, accessibility matters.  It’s about creating a space where everyone can enjoy the game, regardless of how their brains process sound.  Maybe it’s a conversation we all need to be having more, about making digital spaces a little more inclusive.

Would you like me to:

*   Adjust the length?
*   Focus on a specific aspect (e.g., the importance of player feedback)?
*   Change the tone?
