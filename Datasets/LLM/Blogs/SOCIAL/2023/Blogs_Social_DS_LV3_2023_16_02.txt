It’s 2023, and I thought I’d seen it all online—until the follower notifications started blowing up my phone. At first, it was exciting: new followers! But then came the wave of spammy porn bots, one after another. I’d click to report them, only to find there was no option to do so. It felt like shouting into the void.

Frustrated and tired of the digital noise, I finally dug into my account settings. With one simple toggle—disabling the ability for people to follow me—the chaos stopped. It’s a small change, but it gave me back a sense of control over my space. Sometimes, peace is just a setting away.
