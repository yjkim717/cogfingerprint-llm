"Embracing My True Self: Three Months on HRT"

As I sit here reflecting on the past three months, I'm struck by the profound impact hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has had on my life. The physical changes have been remarkable - my skin is softer, my features more feminine, and my body is slowly aligning with my true self. But it's not just the external transformations that have been life-changing; it's the confidence that's grown from within. I feel more at peace in my own skin, more comfortable in social situations, and more empowered to take on the world. Transitioning isn't just about physical feminization; it's about becoming the best version of myself. HRT has been a game-changer, allowing me to connect with others more authentically and live a more authentic life. I'm excited to see what the future holds, and I'm grateful for the journey so far.
