There I was, floating in the vastness of space, multitool in hand, ready to explore another uncharted planet in No Man's Sky VR. It was 2023, and I'd been eagerly awaiting this session all week—my little escape from the daily grind. But something felt off from the moment I moved.

The new control scheme had decoupled my movement and orientation between hands. Instead of the intuitive flow I'd mastered, my brain now felt like it was doing mental gymnastics just to walk straight. Trying to aim my multitool while navigating became an awkward dance of disconnected motions. Within minutes, that familiar wave of nausea began creeping in—the kind that makes you want to rip the headset off.

It's funny how a small change can disrupt what felt like second nature. What was once a seamless extension of myself now felt like trying to write with my non-dominant hand. That magical sense of being truly "in" the game? Gone, replaced by constant frustration. Sometimes progress means knowing when a good thing doesn't need "fixing."
