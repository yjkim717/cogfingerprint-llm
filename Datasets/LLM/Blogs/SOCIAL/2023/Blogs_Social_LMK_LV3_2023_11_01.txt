"My kid got in trouble at school for sneaking a snack - and I couldn't help but laugh. As we chatted about it over dinner, he quipped, 'Dad, I was just fueling my brain!' It's moments like these that remind me to not take school life too seriously. In 2023, it's refreshing to see kids finding humor in everyday mishaps. Perhaps we're teaching them that laughter is the best way to learn."
