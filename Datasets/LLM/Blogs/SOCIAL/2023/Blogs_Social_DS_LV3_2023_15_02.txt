It’s 2023, and everywhere I turn, there’s another subscription. My latest dilemma? The podcast I’ve loved for years just switched to a premium model. For a monthly fee, I get access to all the new episodes and, thankfully, the entire back catalog.

But here’s what keeps me up at night: what happens if I hit pause on that payment? Does my connection to those past episodes—the laughs, the insights, the comfort during my daily commute—just vanish? It feels like we're renting our memories and communities now, not owning them. This new model makes me wonder if we're building our digital lives on shifting sand, where access is a privilege you can lose with one missed payment. It’s a strange, uncertain trade-off for convenience.
