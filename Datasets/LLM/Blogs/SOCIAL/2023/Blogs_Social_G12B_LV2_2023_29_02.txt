## The Metabolism Question: Curves & HRT

Okay, so here’s a slightly anxious thought swirling around my brain lately. I'm starting HRT, which I'm incredibly excited about, but I’m also…a naturally skinny person. Like, *really* skinny. My metabolism is a well-oiled machine, and gaining weight feels like an Olympic sport.

The big question? How will HRT affect all of this? Will my body even *allow* for that coveted feminine curve development? It’s a mix of hope and worry, honestly. I want to embrace the changes, but also a little scared of battling my own biology. Anyone else experienced this? Sharing is caring! Let’s chat in the comments. ✨
