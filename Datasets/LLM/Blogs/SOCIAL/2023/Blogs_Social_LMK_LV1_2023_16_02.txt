As I scrolled through Reddit in 2023, I couldn't help but feel frustrated with the constant follower messages from porn bots. It was like they were everywhere! But then I stumbled upon a simple solution: disabling the "follow" feature in my account settings. It was a game-changer. No more spam, no more awkward messages. I'm sharing this PSA with you - take control of your online space and block those bots for good. Trust me, your sanity will thank you. It's a small tweak that makes a big difference in your online experience.
