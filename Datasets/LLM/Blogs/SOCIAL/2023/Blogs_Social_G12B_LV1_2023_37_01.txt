## The Odd Comfort of Imaginary Powers

Scrolling through Reddit last night, I stumbled upon the most delightfully bizarre “Would You Rather” thread. It wasn't about flight or invisibility, oh no. This was about *pest-related* superpowers. Like, would you rather instantly repel mosquitos or have the ability to perfectly clean crumbs from any surface? Seriously.

It got me thinking. In a world saturated with anxieties, maybe there's a weird comfort in fantasizing about such mundane superpowers. We're all struggling with the little things – the sticky floors, the relentless bugs, the never-ending cycle of chores. 

Wouldn't it be amazing to just *poof* away dust bunnies? Or instantly grow your hair an inch every time you feel stressed? It’s a silly escape, a momentary reprieve from the weight of, well, everything. Maybe the best superpowers aren't the ones that conquer the world, but the ones that make life just a little bit tidier, a little bit less itchy. Anyone else find joy in these weird, everyday power fantasies?
