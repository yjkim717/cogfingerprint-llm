It’s 2023, and we’re all curating our lives through our phone cameras. But my Oppo Find X3 Lite’s front camera? It’s betraying me. Every selfie is a grainy, washed-out mess, especially on Snapchat. I try to capture a genuine moment, and it serves up a noisy, overexposed ghost. It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, the tech we rely on to connect can ironically create a barrier, filtering our reality into something barely recognizable. Anyone else feel this disconnect?
