**Shiny Apps & Scattered Data: A Mobile Frustration**

Okay, so 2023 has been a wild ride of building things in RStudio. I’ve been wrestling with a Shiny app – a little budgeting tool, actually – and I’m obsessed with getting it to run smoothly on my phone. I’ve been experimenting with Shinyapps.io for deployment, but their data storage limits are seriously cramping my style.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different style of post?
