## The Red Tide & The Waiting Game (PCOS Life Lately)

Okay, real talk. This past few months have been…rough. I'm 26, navigating PCOS, Visual Snow Syndrome, *and* ADHD, and lately, my periods have been absolutely brutal. We're talking near-constant bleeding, seriously heavy with big clots, and period pain that genuinely knocks me flat. It started back in October and hasn't really let up. 

It’s hard to explain the exhaustion and frustration of just *existing* with this level of discomfort. I’m trying to figure out how urgently I need to push for answers and treatment. Anyone else been through something similar with PCOS? Sharing experiences would mean the world right now. #PCOS #PeriodPain #HealthJourney
