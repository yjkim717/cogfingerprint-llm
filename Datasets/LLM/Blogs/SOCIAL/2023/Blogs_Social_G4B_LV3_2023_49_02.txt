**The Weight of a Stuck Quest**

There’s something deeply unsettling about hitting a wall in a game, right? I was completely lost in Baldur’s Gate 3, wrestling with the Art Cullagh quest. Hours spent, meticulously following the prompts, and then… a frustrating standstill.

Sometimes, the best solution isn’t pushing harder, but accepting you need to reload and try a different path.  Anyone else feel this pull?
