## When the Dice Feel *Too* Heavy: Cyberpunk Red and the D&D Hangover

So, we started running Cyberpunk Red last month, and honestly? It's been… interesting. My group’s super into D&D – we’ve been rolling dragons and saving kingdoms for years. But Cyberpunk Red? It’s hitting different.

The combat feels *brutal*. Like, genuinely brutal. We’re used to a certain level of resilience, a feeling that even a near-miss can be recovered from. Cyberpunk Red doesn't really offer that.  A single well-placed shot can really wreck your character.

It's a fantastic design choice, reflecting the gritty reality of the setting, but it’s creating a bit of a learning curve for us. We're adjusting to the higher stakes, the need for tactical thinking, and the sobering realization that chrome and skill aren’t always enough.  Anyone else experiencing the "D&D hangover" with Cyberpunk Red?



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
