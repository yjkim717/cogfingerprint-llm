"I'm still getting used to Clip Studio Paint v2 in 2023. I was trying to draw a straight line with the Brush Tool, but holding Shift wasn't working like it used to. After some trial and error, I discovered that the modifier key had changed. Now, you need to hold Shift + another key to draw a straight line. It was a simple fix, but it took me a while to figure it out. Has anyone else had a similar issue?"
