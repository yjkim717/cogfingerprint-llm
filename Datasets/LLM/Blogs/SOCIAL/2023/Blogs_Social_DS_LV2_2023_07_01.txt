Thereâ€™s something about that Motor City Garlic Pizza from Costco Canada that takes me back to late-night study sessions in 2023. It wasn't just a frozen pizza; it was a shared ritual, a greasy, glorious centerpiece for our laughter and debates. Funny how a simple flavor can anchor so many memories.
