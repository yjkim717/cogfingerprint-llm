### The Sound That Almost Broke My Love for the Game

I have a complicated relationship with sound. It’s not just something I hear; it’s something I *feel*. A car alarm isn’t an annoyance; it’s a physical jolt. A crowded restaurant isn’t buzzing with conversation; it’s a chaotic wall of noise that presses in from all sides. As someone with autism and ADHD, my brain doesn’t have a simple volume knob—it has a mixing board with a few faders stuck on max.

I never thought my biggest sensory battle in 2023 would be fought in the virtual arena of Rocket League.

For the uninitiated, Rocket League is soccer with rocket-powered cars. It’s fast, frantic, and fantastic. For me, it’s also a sanctuary—a place of predictable physics and pure skill. But there’s one feature that has become my personal kryptonite: the Turbo Boost.

To most, it’s just a triumphant *VVRRRROOOOOM!* signifying a burst of speed. To my ears, it’s a toxic, grating shriek. It’s the sound of nails on a chalkboard layered over a dentist’s drill. In the heat of a close match, with boosts firing constantly, it doesn’t just get loud—it triggers a full-scale sensory overload. My focus shatters. My chest tightens. What was once an escape becomes a source of genuine distress.

I’ve scoured the settings, desperately looking for a solution. We have sliders for master volume, for music, for announcers… but not for this one, specific, agonizing sound effect. It feels like a door has been locked from the other side. The game I love is actively pushing me away.

This isn’t just about me or Rocket League. It’s about the quiet ways we exclude people. In an era where accessibility features are rightfully celebrated—colorblind modes, text-to-speech, remappable controls—we often forget about auditory accessibility. For millions, it’s not a luxury; it’s a necessity to participate.

So this is my plea, not just as a player, but as someone who just wants to keep enjoying the game: Please, give us granular volume controls. Let me turn down the "toxic sounds." It’s a small change in a line of code that would make a world of difference, ensuring your game is a welcome home for every kind of brain.
