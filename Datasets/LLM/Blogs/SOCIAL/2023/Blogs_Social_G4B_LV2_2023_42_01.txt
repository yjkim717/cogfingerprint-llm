**Still Building Castles, One “Sir” at a Time**

Okay, let’s be real – sometimes I feel like I’m fighting a battle from *Star Trek* all over again. Not with Klingons, but with the stubbornly ingrained idea of who “belongs” where. I was reading a piece the other day about how casually people still use “Sir” and “Madam” – and it just…frustrated me. 

It’s not that formality is *bad*, but the automatic assumption that everyone is a man in a position of power? It’s a relic of a time when leadership was so clearly defined by a very narrow set of roles. 

I think about Captain Kirk, a complex, flawed leader who defied expectations. And I think about the countless women, both in history and today, who’ve had to build their own “castles” – earning respect and authority, one step at a time. Let's ditch the outdated titles and celebrate genuine leadership, regardless of gender. What do you think?
