You know what’s exhausting? Watching people like Doomcock and TFM constantly shift the goalposts. I used to rely on screenshots and secondhand summaries to keep up—it felt safer, easier. But in 2023, I realized something: that’s exactly what they want.

By not engaging directly, we let them spin narratives without accountability. So I started watching their content myself, taking notes, documenting the contradictions. It’s frustrating, even draining at times, but it’s necessary. How else can we call out the bullshit when they’ve already moved on to the next outrage?

It’s not about giving them views—it’s about refusing to let misinformation slide. When we document clearly, we hold a mirror to their tactics. And honestly? There’s power in that. It’s tiring work, but someone’s got to do it.
