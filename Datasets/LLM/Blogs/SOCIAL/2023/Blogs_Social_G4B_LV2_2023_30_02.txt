**The Unexpected Bite of a Broken Axle (and a Feeling of Being Blindfolded)**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve been feeling a little… rattled. It’s not some grand, dramatic thing, but a slow-burn frustration that’s been bubbling under the surface. It started with a simple car repair – a CV axle replacement, actually. Nothing fancy, right? 

Then came the bill. A *lot* more than I’d anticipated. And honestly, it wasn’t just the number, it was the feeling that I hadn’t been fully in the loop. The auto repair shop seemed… opaque. Questions about the work, the added costs, felt met with a vague, “it’s standard procedure.” 

It’s weird, isn’t it? We live in a world of instant information, yet sometimes, important decisions about our lives – and our wallets – feel shrouded in secrecy.  It’s made me think about transparency in all areas, from business to relationships.  We all deserve to understand *why* something is happening, not just *that* it is.  Anyone else experienced this kind of creeping unease lately? Let’s talk about it. #transparency #carrepair #customerexperience
