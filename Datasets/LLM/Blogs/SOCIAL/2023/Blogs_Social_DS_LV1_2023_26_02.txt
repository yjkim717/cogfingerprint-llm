Lately, my gym sessions have been a real head-scratcher—literally. I’m on Roaccutane for my skin, and as someone who already battles anxiety, every new symptom sends my mind racing. This week, it’s pounding headaches and a weird throat tightness mid-workout. Is it just dehydration, or am I coming down with something? In 2023, it’s tough not to spiral into Dr. Google mode, but I’m trying to listen to my body instead of my fears. Anyone else overthinking their health like this?
