It’s 2023, and I’ve noticed a strange shift in how we watch each other online. It’s not just casual scrolling anymore—it feels hawkish. Like a digital supervisor tracking every click, every pause. We’ve become a society of intense observers, quick to judge and call out. It’s exhausting, this constant, aggressive monitoring disguised as staying informed. I miss the days of genuine connection, not this performative vigilance. Are we building community, or just a stricter panopticon?
