>## The Package Hustle: Thinking Beyond the Brown Truck

Okay, so, confession time. This year's peak season crunch at UPS has been… a lot. The on-call schedule is brutal, and honestly, the pay isn't always reflecting the hours I’m putting in. I've started seriously looking at other options. 

A few of us part-timers have been quietly chatting about FedEx Ground contracting. It's a big leap, definitely, with the upfront investment and responsibility, but the potential for more consistent income is tempting. It's wild to think about potentially running your own little delivery business! 

It's a whole different social media vibe too, right? UPS is all about the brand, FedEx feels… more entrepreneurial. Just putting it out there - maybe 2024 will look a little different around here. Thoughts?
