## The Quiet Hum of Almost-Home

There’s a specific kind of stillness you find in an office building after everyone’s gone. Last night, I was it – the last one clicking off lights at 8 pm. Just as I was locking up, I saw Miguel, the custodian, starting his shift, a quiet "goodnight" passing between us. It felt… poignant. 

Then came the long drive. Four hours to see my family. Thinking about Miguel, about the hours he puts in while everyone else sleeps, made the miles feel different. It’s a reminder that connection, however fleeting, exists in unexpected places. And sometimes, the journey home is just as important as the destination. #reflection #worklife #family
