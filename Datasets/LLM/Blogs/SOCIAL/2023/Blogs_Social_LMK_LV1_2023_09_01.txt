The Rise and Fall of a Convenience Store Icon: My Stripes Story

I'll never forget the good old days when Stripes convenience store was the go-to spot for a quick Slurpee and a Laredo Taco. As a regular customer, I watched with excitement as the chain expanded across the South, its bright colors and friendly service a staple in every neighborhood. But, as the years went by, I started to notice a change. The once-thriving stores began to show signs of neglect, and the service? Forget about it.

The turning point came when 7-11 Corporation acquired Stripes in 2018. At first, I thought, "Hey, maybe this is a good thing! More resources, more expertise – it'll be a win-win!" But, boy, was I wrong. The stores started to lose their personality, and the cleanliness standards took a nosedive. I've walked into multiple locations in 2023, and more often than not, the floors are sticky, the shelves are disorganized, and the bathrooms? Let's just say they're not exactly inviting.

The final straw was when I stopped by a Stripes location recently and was greeted by a cashier who seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else. I asked her how her day was going, and the response was a monotone "It's fine, I guess." No smile, no enthusiasm – just a bland, robotic reply. It broke my heart, because I remembered when the staff at Stripes actually cared. They knew their customers by name, and the store was always bustling with a warm, welcoming atmosphere.

Now, I'm not one to complain without offering solutions, but it seems like 7-11 has dropped the ball on maintaining the Stripes brand. The Laredo Tacos still taste great, I'll give them that. But, is that enough to keep me coming back? Unfortunately, it's not. As a consumer, I want to support businesses that prioritize customer service and store cleanliness. It's not too much to ask, right? I hope 7-11 takes a hard look at its Stripes locations and makes some changes. Until then, I'll be taking my convenience (and my Laredo Taco cravings) elsewhere.
