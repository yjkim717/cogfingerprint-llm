## The Unexpected Lesson from a Floor Mattress

So, my bed decided to stage a dramatic collapse last week. Seriously, a leg just *gave*. Now I'm sleeping on the floor with my usual mattress – not exactly ideal. Funny thing is, it's making me really think about comfort. We chase bigger houses, fancier things… but maybe true contentment isn’t about what we *have*, but how we adapt and find peace, even when life throws you a broken bed (and a floor!). It's a weird, humbling perspective, honestly.
