## The Lonely Summoner and the Unexpected Fishing Rod

Okay, so I’m doing something *wild* in Terraria right now – a summoner-only playthrough. Sounds cool, right? It’s not. At least, not at the beginning. Suddenly, no trusty sword, no easy-to-get bow… just a bunch of bouncing minions and a whole lot of panic. 

It really hit me though, how much we rely on established paths in games, and in life, I guess. I spent a solid hour just *fishing*. Seriously! Turns out, it's surprisingly viable early game. And you know what? It was kind of peaceful. A moment of quiet amidst the chaos of trying to survive with spectral butterflies. It’s a weird, unexpected lesson in adapting, and a reminder that sometimes, the best strategies are the ones you stumble upon when you're forced to think outside the box. Anyone else ever had a playthrough completely derail in a delightful way?
