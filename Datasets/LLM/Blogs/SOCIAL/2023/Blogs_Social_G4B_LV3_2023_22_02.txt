**The Quiet Differences We Miss**

It’s funny how sometimes we overlook the subtle signals around us. Recently, I was learning a bit about Slavic languages – specifically, how distinct they are through sound. It made me think about our own social interactions. Just like tonal variations reveal a lot about a language, little shifts in how we address people, or the way we frame a request, can speak volumes. 

We often assume everyone understands our “code,” but truly listening – noticing those tonal differences – is key to authentic connection. It’s a reminder that even within our own communities, there's a beautiful complexity we can easily miss if we aren’t paying attention. 2023 has taught me the value of mindful observation.
