## The Ghost of Physicality

It’s funny, isn't it? How certain memories just…linger. I’m in a good relationship, a committed one. But every now and then, a flicker of something else surfaces. A past encounter, purely physical, no strings attached. It wasn't a *thing*, just a moment – a raw, uncomplicated connection.

And I find myself occasionally circling back to it, not with longing for *that person*, but for the feeling itself. That absence of emotional weight, that pure, instinctual desire. It’s a strange conflict, wanting that freedom while valuing the depth of what I have. Maybe it’s just a 2023 thing – a reaction to the constant pressure of curated online relationships, a craving for something real, even if fleeting. Just a thought. Anyone else ever feel this pull?
