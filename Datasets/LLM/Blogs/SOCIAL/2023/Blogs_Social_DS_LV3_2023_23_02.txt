The fluorescent lights hum overhead as I adjust my tie—a small, daily ritual that feels both grounding and deceptive. After top surgery last year, I made the choice to go stealth at work. It was supposed to be about safety, about avoiding the invasive questions and judgmental stares. And in many ways, it’s worked. No one questions my pronouns; they just see me as another guy in the office.

But some days, this cloak of invisibility weighs heavy. I catch myself carefully editing stories from my past, omitting details that might “out” me. It’s a strange kind of fraud, trading authenticity for peace. In 2023, when visibility feels more important than ever, I’m left wondering: at what cost does this safety come?
