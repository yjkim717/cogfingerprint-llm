"Skipping School, Not the Problem"

As a high school senior in 2023, I thought I had it all figured out. But, to be honest, my home life is a mess. My brother's violent outbursts have become the norm, and I'm constantly walking on eggshells. Recently, I got caught skipping school, and while I expected my parents to be furious, I wasn't prepared for the explosion that followed. It wasn't just about the truancy; it was about the underlying tension that's been building for years. My brother's threats and abusive behavior have created a toxic environment, and I'm not sure how much more I can take. I'm seeking advice on how to navigate this potentially explosive situation. How can I prioritize my safety and well-being without abandoning my family? I'm desperate for guidance on how to handle this complex and emotionally draining situation.
