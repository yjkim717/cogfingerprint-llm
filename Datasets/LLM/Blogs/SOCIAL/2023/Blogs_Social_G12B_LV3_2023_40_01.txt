>## The Exhaustion of the Cycle

Scrolling through Reddit last night, I stumbled upon a post that hit me hard. Someone, bravely sharing their struggle, described the relentless cycle of purging after every meal. The sheer exhaustion radiating from their words was palpable. It's a stark reminder that behind the curated perfection we often see online, real people are battling incredibly difficult struggles with bulimia and eating disorders. 

It’s 2023, and the pressure to conform to unrealistic beauty standards is still immense. If you're feeling trapped in a similar cycle, please know you're not alone. Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Your mental health matters. ❤️
