## The Metabolism Question & Hoping for Curves

Okay, so I'm diving deep into the HRT conversation, and something's been swirling in my head. I’m naturally pretty lean – always have been, fast metabolism and all that. It's great, don’t get me wrong, but it also means I’ve never really had… curves. 

I'm so excited for the emotional and mental shifts HRT will bring, but I'm also curious (and a little anxious!) about the physical changes. Will my metabolism fight against fat redistribution? Will I *actually* develop the feminine shape I've always dreamed of?  It feels silly to prioritize this, but it's a genuine hope. Anyone else with a speedy metabolism navigating this? Share your experiences – I’d love to hear them!
