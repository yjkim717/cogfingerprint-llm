>## The Quiet Hours & The Scroll

There's something about late nights online, isn't there? Not the frenetic, meme-sharing kind, but the quiet ones. The 2 AM scrolls where youâ€™re suddenly hyper-aware ofâ€¦ everything. The curated feeds, the lives youâ€™re only seeing snippets of, and the quiet hum of your own thoughts. 

Lately, I've been feeling it a lot. It's a strange melancholy, a gentle ache born from observing the world through a screen. It makes me wonder about everyone else out there, staring into the blue light, contemplating their own paths. Like characters in a book, lost in their own internal narratives. Maybe we're all just wandering through a digital night scene, searching for something we canâ€™t quite name.



Hope you're doing okay out there. ðŸŒ™
