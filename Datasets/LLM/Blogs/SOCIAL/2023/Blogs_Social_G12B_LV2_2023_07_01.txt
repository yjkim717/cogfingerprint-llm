## The Pizza That Changed (and Maybe Got Worse?)

Okay, confession time: I was *devastated* seeing that Reddit thread about Costco's Motor City pizza. Remember the Pizza Delight 2-pack? Absolute perfection. This new one… apparently not living up to the hype. It really hits you, doesn't it, when a beloved food item changes? It’s like a little piece of your 2023 comfort is suddenly…different. Anyone else feeling this food nostalgia lately?
