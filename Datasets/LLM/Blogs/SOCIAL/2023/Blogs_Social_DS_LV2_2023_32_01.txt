### The Diagnosis I'm Scared to Ask For

I sat in my car outside the clinic for twenty minutes, my hand frozen on the door handle. The question that had been looping in my head for months was deafening: *Is it even worth it?*

I’d finally mustered the courage to talk to my PCP, armed with a mental list of my symptoms. The constant heaviness, the neglected laundry piling up, the crushing self-doubt that screams "impostor" after every minor success. But what would a label change? A depression diagnosis wouldn’t magically erase the hard days or rewind the years of self-care I’d ignored.

It’s 2023—we talk about mental health more than ever, yet taking that formal step still feels like admitting a permanent flaw. What if I get the referral, sit in a new office, and they tell me I’m just… bad at handling life? Or worse, what if they confirm it, and the "depression" identity becomes a cage instead of a key?

I drove away that day, the question unanswered. The pursuit of a diagnosis feels like a paradox: a search for validation for the very thing that convinces you you’re not valid. Maybe the first step isn’t about the label, but about giving myself permission to want one.
