**The Poof and the Pivot: Finding My Curl Confidence**

Okay, friends, let’s be real – sometimes social media feels like a highlight reel of *perfect* hair. And when you’re in the middle of a big hair transition, like I was with my curls after switching to overnight twisting, it’s easy to get discouraged. I was *struggling*. My hair was just… poofy. Seriously, a cloud of frizz and a complete lack of definition. 

It felt like a failure, honestly. I’d spent weeks researching the right products, trying to mimic the tutorials I saw online, and it just wasn’t working. I was starting to question if my curls were even *capable* of looking good. 

But then I realized something: chasing someone else's idea of ‘good’ isn’t the answer. It’s about understanding *my* hair – my porosity, my texture, what *actually* works. It’s a slow, iterative process, a little bit of trial and error, and a LOT of self-compassion.  This week’s been about embracing the poof, learning to love the process, and rediscovering my curl confidence.  How about you? What’s a recent social media struggle you’ve overcome?
