As I clocked into my job in 2023, I couldn't shake off the feeling of being an imposter. After top surgery, I'd finally achieved a sense of bodily alignment with my identity. But being "stealth" - passing as non-trans in the workplace - felt disingenuous. Despite my colleagues using the right pronouns, I felt like I was hiding a part of myself. It was a strange dichotomy - feeling more confident in my presentation, yet more anxious about being perceived as 'authentic'. Was I truly being myself, or just a more polished version?
