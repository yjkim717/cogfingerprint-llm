Isn't it amazing how a simple story can be transformed? I was reading about a recent opera production of ‘Marriage of Figaro’ – reimagined in the opulent backdrop of the British Raj in the 1890s. Suddenly, Mozart’s themes of class and rebellion felt utterly fresh. It really got me thinking about how context shapes our understanding of social dynamics. Just like a stunning visual setting, the era completely shifted the lens through which we viewed the characters’ struggles.  It’s a powerful reminder of the stories we tell and the worlds we build around them.
