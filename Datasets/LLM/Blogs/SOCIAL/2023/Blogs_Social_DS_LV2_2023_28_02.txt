**The Day I Chose My Peace**

I always thought the biggest fight of my senior year would be over college applications. Turns out, it was in my own kitchen.

Last Tuesday, I skipped school. Not for some wild adventure, but because the weight of everything felt like a physical thing. I just needed a day. But when my older brother found out, his anger was terrifying. The yelling escalated into shoving, and then a threat that froze me to my core. The worst part? My parents’ reaction was a muddled mess of “he didn’t mean it” and “you shouldn’t have skipped.”

That day, the real conflict wasn't just about a missed class. It was about the silent permission we give to “family drama” that crosses the line into something darker. I’m learning, painfully, that seeking peace isn’t a betrayal. It’s an act of survival. And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is say, “This isn’t okay,” even if your voice shakes.
