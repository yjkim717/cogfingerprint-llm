**Lost in the Echoes of Brass & Dragons**

Anyone else feel like we’re living in a strange, beautiful echo of the past lately? I’ve been completely absorbed in these new fantasy novels – *Temeraire* and *Carnival Row* – that just *nail* the feel of late modern fantasy. It’s like imagining dragons soaring over a Napoleonic-era London, or a glittering, dangerous seaside city filled with mythical creatures. 

It makes you think about how we build communities, especially when things feel… fractured. Are we creating our own little ‘Carnival Rows’ in 2023, trying to find beauty and connection amidst the noise?
