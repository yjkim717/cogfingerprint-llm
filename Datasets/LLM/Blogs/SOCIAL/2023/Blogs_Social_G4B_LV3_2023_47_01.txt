**The Strange Case of the Perfect Broth**

I’ve been utterly stuck on something small lately – making broth. Seriously! Everyone says a smaller pot is better for evaporation, but my inner physics nerd is screaming. It feels…wrong. Like I’m fighting against some fundamental principle. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? How these little kitchen dilemmas can pull you into a spiral of questioning.  I’m realizing it’s not *just* about the broth, but about wanting to understand *why* things are the way they are.  Maybe a bit of extra evaporation is the secret, or maybe I just need a bigger pot and a fresh perspective.  Anyone else find themselves lost in the details?
