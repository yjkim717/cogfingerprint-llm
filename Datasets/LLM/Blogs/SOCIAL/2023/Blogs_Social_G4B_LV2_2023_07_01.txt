**That Costco Pizza Debate… It’s More Than Just Pizza**

Okay, you guys, I just got sucked into a *serious* online debate about Costco pizza. Apparently, there’s a divide between the Motor City Garlic and the Pizza Delight. A recent Reddit thread had someone admitting they just prefer the 2-pack – and honestly, I get it. It’s funny how these little things can spark such passionate opinions, isn’t it? It reminded me that social media can be a weird place for nostalgia and simple preferences.  Anyone else feel this way?
