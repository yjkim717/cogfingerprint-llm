**The Echo in the Mirror**

Okay, so… top surgery was amazing. Truly. But lately, I’ve been feeling this weird echo in the mirror. It’s not *bad*, exactly, but it’s… off. Like I’m presenting, and then I look closer, and there’s still this ghost of the person I was. 

I started a new job too, and that’s added to it. It’s a constant tightrope walk – trying to be visible as a trans man, using my preferred pronouns, but also maintaining a level of “stealth” to avoid unwanted attention.  

I’m grappling with this feeling of inauthenticity, like I’m still performing a role. I’m reaching out to my community for advice. How do you reconcile the visible changes with the internal work of truly *being*?  Anyone else feeling this after major transitions? Let’s talk. #transgender #genderexpression #top surgery #genderdysphoria

Would you like me to revise this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
