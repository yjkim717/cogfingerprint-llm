## Unexpected Beauty: When Mozart Meets the Raj

I just saw the most incredible production of *The Marriage of Figaro* – seriously, go see it if Opera San Jose is still running it! What struck me wasn’t just the gorgeous costumes and set design (seriously, 1890s India under the British Raj was brought to life beautifully), but the way it made you *think*. 

Placing Mozart’s classic within that historical context highlighted the power dynamics and social hierarchies in a way I hadn't anticipated. It wasn't a jarring shift, but a surprisingly insightful lens. It made me consider how stories, even centuries-old ones, can still resonate with our conversations about colonialism and class today.  Pretty powerful stuff!
