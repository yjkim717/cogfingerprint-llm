**The Algorithm Almost Killed My Engineering Dream**

Okay, real talk. 2023 feels…weirdly nostalgic for a dark period. I poured my heart into engineering at university, truly believed it was *my* thing. Then the pandemic hit, and suddenly, everything shifted. Online lectures felt sterile, collaboration was a string of awkward Zoom calls, and my passion just…faded. 

It wasn’t a dramatic, overnight collapse, more like a slow leak. The social element vanished – the late-night study sessions, the shared frustrations, the feeling of being part of a team. I started questioning everything. Was this really for me? 

But this semester? This semester has been *amazing*. Getting back to campus, actually *seeing* my classmates, bouncing ideas off people in person… it’s reignited that spark. It’s proving that sometimes, the most valuable parts of learning aren't found on a screen.  Anyone else feel like the digital world almost stole their joy?
