The thought first crept in during a Tuesday afternoon in late 2023, while I was staring at a spreadsheet that had long since blurred into meaningless numbers. It was more than just a bad week; it was a heavy, gray fog that had settled in, making even the simplest decisions feel impossible. I’d list the classic symptoms in my head—low energy, zero interest in my old hobbies—but then the self-doubt would whisper, *Are you sure you’re not just being lazy? Maybe you’re just seeking attention.*

Making an appointment with my PCP felt like admitting defeat. Sitting in the exam room, I almost backed out, rehearsing how to say, “Never mind, I’m fine.” But when I finally stammered out the truth about the constant weight on my chest, something shifted. My doctor didn’t dismiss me. She listened, asked thoughtful questions, and validated what I was feeling.

That conversation wasn’t a magic cure, but it was the first step out of the isolation. It was the moment I realized that seeking a diagnosis for depression isn’t a sign of weakness, but an act of profound self-compassion. The journey is messy and full of uncertainty, but it begins with a single, brave decision to stop doubting your own pain.
