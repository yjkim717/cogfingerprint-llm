### The Price of a Final Goodbye

It’s in life’s most difficult moments that bureaucracy can feel the most cruel. Last month, my family learned this the hard way.

My grandmother passed away peacefully, leaving us heartbroken but ready to honour her memory. The practical matter, of course, was the funeral. We knew my grandparents had a joint bank account, a sensible thing they’d set up decades ago for a seamless partnership. The money for her send-off was right there.

But there was a catch, one we hadn't anticipated. My grandfather, the other name on the account, is living with advanced dementia. He doesn’t recognise us most days, let alone possess the legal capacity to authorize a transaction. The very system designed to make things easy for a couple was now an impenetrable vault.

Suddenly, the straightforward act of paying a funeral director became a labyrinth of legal questions. Could we use the funds? Were we overstepping? The bank, bound by strict rules to protect him from financial abuse, was hesitant. We were presented with a chilling term we’d never heard before: a "public health funeral." The thought of our beloved nana, who had filled our lives with so much warmth, becoming a statistic in a council-led service was devastating.

This is more than a personal story; it’s a social wake-up call for 2023. As our population ages and dementia cases rise, how many more families will face this cruel clash between compassion and compliance? We need clearer pathways and more compassionate financial safeguards. No one should have to fight for the dignity of a loved one’s final farewell while simultaneously grieving. We were fortunate to find a solution, but the stress it added was a burden we shouldn’t have had to carry. It’s a conversation about ageing, finance, and dignity that we need to have, before more families are left navigating this painful grey area.
