As I binge-watched Carnival Row, I couldn't help but think of the Temeraire series. Both fantasy worlds are set against the backdrop of war and social upheaval, echoing our own world's struggles. The late modern fantasy genre lets us explore complex issues like power and identity through a unique lens. In 2023, it's clear that these themes are just as relevant, making me wonder: what can we learn from the dragons and faeries about our own world's challenges?
