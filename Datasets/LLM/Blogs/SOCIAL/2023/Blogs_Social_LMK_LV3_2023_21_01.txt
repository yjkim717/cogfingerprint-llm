"The 8 pm Office Solace":  In today's fast-paced workplace, it's not uncommon to find oneself burning the midnight oil. I recently found myself alone at the office at 8 pm, fueled by coffee, preparing for a 4-hour drive to visit family. This scenario got me thinking - are we glorifying late hours and commuting just to keep up with productivity? Is it time to reevaluate our work-life balance and challenge the coffee culture that's keeping us chained to our desks?
