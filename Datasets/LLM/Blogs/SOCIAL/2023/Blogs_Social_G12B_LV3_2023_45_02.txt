## The Quest for Charging Bliss on the High Seas (and a Little Tech Anxiety!)

Okay, so I'm officially a Royal Caribbean newbie! My first cruise is coming up on the Voyager of the Seas, and I’m already diving deep into the details – because let’s be honest, a vacation isn't a *true* vacation without fully charged devices, right? 

I’ve always used a pass-through plug adapter on Carnival to keep my phone buzzing happily beside the bed. It’s a total game-changer! But I'm wondering, will it work the same on Royal Caribbean? It feels silly to be this focused on outlets, but in 2023, staying connected (even a little!) is kind of essential. Anyone else have experience with power outlets on Voyager? Send help (and charging tips!) my way!
