## The Power of Connection (and Exodia!)

Okay, confession time: I finally snagged an Exodia card! It’s wild how a single card from my childhood Yu-Gi-Oh! days can still spark so much joy. Celebrating with my new Bandai Figure Rise Amplified Exodia figure – a little makeshift display, but it feels good to connect with that nostalgic passion. Anyone else still collecting?
