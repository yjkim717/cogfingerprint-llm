"As a seasoned DND player, I recently dove into Cyberpunk Red with my party, but we quickly hit a snag - the fighting system. Security guards, in particular, were absolute beasts! We found ourselves struggling to take them down, and it got me thinking: are we just not used to the rules, or is there a balance issue? Either way, it's sparked an interesting conversation about the state of combat in modern RPGs."
