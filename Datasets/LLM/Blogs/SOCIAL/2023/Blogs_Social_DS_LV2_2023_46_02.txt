### The Over-the-Top Emoji and Other Modern Death Scenes

It’s wild, isn’t it? I was down a rabbit hole last night, watching clips from silent westerns. The heroes would get shot and instead of just falling, they’d perform this dramatic, leg-kicking ballet. It was pure, unapologetic theater—a way to scream “I’M DYING!” without a single sound.

And it hit me: we do the exact same thing today, just digitally.

Think about the last time you got some genuinely bad news over a text. Did you just reply “Okay”? Probably not. You might have sent the skull emoji 💀, the exploding head 🤯, or a GIF of a cartoon character dramatically clutching their chest and collapsing.

That leg kick in 1923 is our “I am DECEASED” tweet in 2023. It’s our way of emphasizing a feeling, of making sure the emotional weight isn’t lost in translation across our own silent, text-based medium. We’re still those same performers, just on a different stage, using new tools to connect and make sure our audience—our friends—truly gets it. Some human instincts, it seems, are timeless.
