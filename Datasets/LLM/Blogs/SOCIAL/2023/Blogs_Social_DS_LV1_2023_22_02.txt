**The Sound of a Stranger**

It hit me on the train yesterday, listening to a group of tourists. I couldn't tell if they were speaking Polish, Czech, or Russian, and I felt a pang of frustration. It’s 2023—we’re more connected than ever, yet these beautiful linguistic borders still feel so solid.

It made me think about how we categorize people by sound. We can often distinguish the tonal flow of Chinese from the structured politeness of Japanese or the crisp syllables of Korean. But with Slavic languages, to my untrained ear, they blend into a single, mysterious melody. It’s a humbling reminder that for all our global chatter, true understanding requires us to lean in and listen more carefully to the distinct music within the noise.
