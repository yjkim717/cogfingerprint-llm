## When Family Feels Like a Battleground

It's 2023, and honestly, sometimes adulting feels hard enough without the added pressure of… family. Lately, I’ve been grappling with something a lot of us probably experience at some point: intense family conflict. 

It all started with a simple thing – my younger brother skipping school. Sounds minor, right? But it spiraled. A quick check-in turned into a shouting match, and then… well, things escalated. There was a real threat of violence, a palpable tension that left me shaken.

It's unsettling to realize how quickly emotions can spiral, especially within the safety of your own home. I'm trying to process what happened and figure out healthy coping mechanisms. Should I involve the police? Is that an overreaction? It feels like a massive breach of trust, but also, my safety matters. 

I'm reaching out because I know sibling rivalry is a universal struggle, and navigating these situations – especially when they become volatile – is incredibly difficult. What do you do when family feels like a battleground? I'm genuinely seeking advice and hoping to hear from anyone who's been through something similar.
