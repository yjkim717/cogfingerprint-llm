 Hugely enjoyed reading a Reddit thread about a truly unique opera production! Someone spotlighted Opera San Jose’s *Marriage of Figaro*, reimagined in 1890s India under the British Raj. Talk about a bold choice! It got me thinking about how opera, often seen as stuffy and traditional, can be utterly transformed. What a brilliant way to amplify the themes of power and social dynamics – visually stunning *and* thought-provoking. It’s inspiring to see artists push boundaries!
