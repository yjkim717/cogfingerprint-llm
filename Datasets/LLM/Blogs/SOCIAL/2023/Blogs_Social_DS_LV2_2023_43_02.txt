### The Invisible Wall: 15 Years in a Body I Don't Understand

It’s 2023, and in a world more connected than ever, I’ve never felt more isolated by my own body.

For fifteen years, my life has been dictated by a medical mystery. The official term is “IBS-like symptoms,” but for me, it’s a constant, low-grade panic. It’s the chronic diarrhea that turns a simple commute into a strategic operation, mapping every potential rest stop. It’s the digestive issues that make a dinner invitation feel like a high-stakes gamble.

I’ve seen more specialists than I can count, my medical file is a novel of dead ends, and the answer is always the same: “We don’t know.” The hardest part isn’t the physical discomfort; it’s the life restrictions. It’s saying “no” to spontaneous trips, leaving parties early, and the quiet shame of an invisible illness.

My world has slowly shrunk, bounded by the proximity to a bathroom. I’m not asking for a miracle cure, just for a day where my body feels like my ally, not my jailer. If you’re reading this and nodding along, know that you are not alone in this frustrating, lonely fight.
