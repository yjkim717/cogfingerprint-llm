## The Quiet Hum of Imposter Syndrome

It's been six months since my top surgery, and honestly? The physical healing was the *easy* part. I landed a great new job a few months ago, and so far, so good. I’m passing. People see me, a woman, and they treat me like one. It's… surreal.

But lately, this low-level hum of anxiety has been constant. Imposter syndrome, I guess. It’s not the usual career-related kind. It's deeper. It's this nagging voice whispering, "They don't *know*." They don't know the work it took to get here, the years of dysphoria, the surgery, the constant vigilance. 

I'm terrified of being "found out," even though logically, I know there’s nothing to find. I’m just… existing. A cis woman.  It’s a strange, quiet battle, this feeling of being a carefully constructed performance, even when I know it’s just *me*.  Anyone else ever feel like this?
