As I navigated my new workplace in 2023, I felt like I was living a stealthy existence - my true self finally visible after top surgery, yet I couldn't shake the feeling of being a fraud. The transition was still fresh, and my new identity was taking time to sink in. But as I connected with coworkers who saw me for who I truly was, I began to let go of self-doubt. Embracing my authentic self was a journey, and it was okay to take my time. Self-acceptance was the key to silencing the imposter within.
