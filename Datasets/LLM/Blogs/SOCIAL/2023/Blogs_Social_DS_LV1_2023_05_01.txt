It’s funny how quickly we adapt to new norms. In 2023, I started a fully remote role in the mortgage industry, thrilled to leave my old commute behind. But a recent trip planning session brought a surprising hiccup: my new company doesn’t provide laptops for interstate travel, citing a strict travel policy.

My last role, in the same field, handed out gear without a second thought. It made me realize how much our "work-from-anywhere" culture is still shaped by invisible company rules. We talk a big game about flexibility, but sometimes the tools—or lack thereof—tell a different story. It’s a small thing, but it speaks volumes about trust and the evolving social contract of remote work.
