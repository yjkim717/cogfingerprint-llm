In 2023, we’re flooded with information, and sometimes knowledge feels like a burden. My health anxiety whispered, "What if?" But then I thought about the community of moms online, sharing stories of courage, not just caution. I took a deep breath. This test isn’t about fear; it’s about stepping forward, informed and hopeful, into the unknown.
