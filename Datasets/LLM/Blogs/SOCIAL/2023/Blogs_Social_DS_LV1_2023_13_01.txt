Moving to Dallas last year, I craved more than just Sunday sermons—I wanted a church that felt like family. After visiting a few spots, I found a non-denominational community where grandparents and college students mingle easily. Their small groups became my anchor, and even the nursery volunteers knew my toddler by name. In a world that often feels disconnected, this intergenerational warmth has been a gentle reminder that we’re all searching for the same thing: belonging.
