It’s funny how a quirky Terraria seed like “Not the Bees” can mirror real life. I spent hours fishing for a summoner weapon, feeling stuck with that flimsy starter gear. It reminded me of trying to find my footing in a new city last year—everyone else seemed to have their “armor” sorted, their bestiaries full of achievements. But just like finally snagging that rare drop after endless casts, I found my people slowly: a coffee-shop regular, a coworker who shared memes. Sometimes the grind—whether in-game or socially—pays off in unexpected connections.
