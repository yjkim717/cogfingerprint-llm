## Lost in the Stars (and Confused by the Controls!)

Okay, fellow explorers, let's talk about something that’s been seriously messing with my No Man's Sky VR immersion lately. They tweaked the default controls – separating movement and orientation – and honestly, it’s felt like navigating a black hole of frustration. 

I *love* the feeling of really *being* in that universe, soaring through space, landing on alien worlds. But now, just getting from point A to point B feels clunky. I keep bumping into things, losing my sense of direction, and generally feeling less like a brave explorer and more like a bewildered tourist. 

Has anyone else noticed this shift? It’s a small change, but it’s significantly impacting how I experience the game. Hoping they reconsider! Anyone got any brilliant workaround suggestions? Let's share tips in the comments!
