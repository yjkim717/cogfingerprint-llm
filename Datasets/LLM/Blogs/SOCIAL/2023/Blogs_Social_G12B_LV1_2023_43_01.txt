>## The Unexpected Joy of a Digital Reflection

Okay, confession time: I’m building my wife a smart mirror. Seriously! It’s a Raspberry Pi project, and I’m a *total* noob at this tech stuff. But I saw how much she loves gadgets and the idea just sparked. It's surprisingly addictive, wrestling with code and hardware. Beyond the tech, though, it's about the thought. Hoping she loves waking up to news and weather displayed on a personalized reflection – a little bit of tech, a whole lot of love. Wish me luck!
