## From Zoom Fatigue to Chicken Coops: Finding My Engineering Spark Again

Remember 2020? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? The world shrunk to the size of my laptop screen, and suddenly, complex equations and circuit diagrams just… blurred. I was an engineering student, theoretically passionate, but the endless Zoom lectures and virtual labs during pandemic lockdowns chipped away at that enthusiasm. It felt like learning to build a bridge from a photograph – you get the theory, but something vital is missing.

Honestly, I started to question everything. Was this really *me*? Was engineering even *for* me? The joy, the tangible feeling of creation, was gone, replaced by a dull ache of disconnection. I felt adrift.

Then, things started to shift. In-person classes returned, and with them, a glimmer of hope. But the real turning point? A quirky summer project – helping a local chicken rancher build a new coop. 

Suddenly, I was measuring, cutting, hammering, problem-solving in the real world. Seeing the chickens happily settling into the structure *I* helped create? That was a feeling no simulation could ever replicate. It wasn't glamorous, it wasn't textbook perfect, but it re-ignited something within me. 

Now, in 2023, I’m back in the lab, but with a renewed perspective. The abstract concepts feel more grounded, the challenges more exciting. Turns out, sometimes you need to build a chicken coop to remember why you wanted to build bridges in the first place.
