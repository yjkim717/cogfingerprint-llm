"Revisiting the Klingon Empire: A Shift in Portrayal" 

As I binge-watched Strange New Worlds Season 2, I noticed a jarring change in the Klingons - they seemed shorter and less intimidating. Their mannerisms, too, had softened. I pondered: was this a deliberate creative choice or a reflection of our evolving societal values? The Klingon portrayal, once a symbol of unyielding strength, now seemed more nuanced. Does this shift resonate with our growing appreciation for diversity and complexity in storytelling?
