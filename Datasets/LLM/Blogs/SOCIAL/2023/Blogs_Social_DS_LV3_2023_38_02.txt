It’s 2023, and I can’t help but notice how often conversations about capitalism and socialism turn into shouting matches online or at family dinners. I’ve been there myself—getting worked up, only to realize halfway through that my friend and I were using the same words to describe entirely different things.

For me, capitalism meant innovation and opportunity, while for them, it was greed and inequality. Socialism, in their eyes, was about community and fairness, but in my mind, it conjured images of an overbearing state. We were ships passing in the night, arguing fiercely but never truly connecting.

It hit me then: without shared definitions, we’re not debating ideas—we’re just talking past each other. What if, before diving into the heat of the debate, we paused to ask, “What does this word mean to you?” That simple act could transform a divisive argument into a meaningful dialogue, one where we actually listen and learn from one another. After all, understanding is the first step toward progress.
