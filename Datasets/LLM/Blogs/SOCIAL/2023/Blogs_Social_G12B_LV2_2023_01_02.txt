## The Tiny Sound That Silences the Joy: When Gaming Accessibility Feels Like a Big Ask

I love Rocket League. Seriously. The chaotic ballet of cars, the frantic scramble for the ball, the sheer, ridiculous *fun* of it all… it’s a stress reliever, a social outlet, and a surprisingly competitive arena. I've sunk countless hours into it, cheered with friends, and even had a few moments of genuinely impressive plays.

But lately, something’s been chipping away at that joy. It's a tiny thing, really. The sound of the TP boost.

For those unfamiliar, the TP boost is a mechanic in Rocket League that allows players to quickly teleport across the field. It's cool, it's strategic, and it’s a core part of the game. But the *sound* it makes? It’s deafening. An ear-splitting, jarring blast that feels disproportionate to the action.

I recently stumbled across a post online from a fellow Rocket League player, someone who identifies as autistic and with ADHD. They were pleading with Psyonix, the game developers, to offer a way to lower the volume of this particular sound effect. It wasn’t a demand for a massive overhaul or a complete re-design. Just… a volume slider.

And reading their words, I felt a wave of recognition. While I don't share the same neurodiversity, I *get* it. I've been there. We’ve all been there, in some form or another, wrestling with sensory overload. The sudden, unexpected blast of the TP boost – it’s not just *loud*; it’s disruptive. It pulls you out of the flow, throws off your focus, and frankly, just makes the game less enjoyable.

It got me thinking about accessibility in gaming as a whole. We rightly celebrate games that offer customizable controls, difficulty settings, and visual options. But what about the often-overlooked realm of audio? Shouldn’t everyone have the ability to adjust the volume of specific sound effects, to tailor the auditory experience to their own sensitivities?

It feels like a surprisingly big ask.  A simple volume slider shouldn’t be a monumental undertaking for a studio like Psyonix. Yet, the fact that it's even *needed* highlights a gap in how we often approach accessibility. We tend to focus on the obvious, the visual and the mechanical, and sometimes miss the subtle but significant impact of sound.

This isn’t about demanding special treatment. It’s about creating a more inclusive gaming environment, one where more people can participate and enjoy the experience without sensory discomfort. It’s about recognizing that "fun" looks different for everyone. And sometimes, the smallest adjustments can make the biggest difference. Let's hope Psyonix, and other developers, are listening.
