## The Disconnect: Why My Online Self Feels…Separate

It’s weird, isn’t it? How we curate these online personas. I’ve been thinking a lot about my Instagram lately, and how it feels increasingly detached from, well, *me*. Like a module that’s been imported correctly in theory, but just isn't quite running as expected within the larger application – my life.

I remember when it felt natural, documenting little moments. Now, it's more like a performance. I find myself thinking, "Will this get likes? Is this 'aesthetic' enough?" It's exhausting! 

I’m seeing so many people feeling the same way. The pressure to project a perfect image, the constant comparison… it's a lot.  It’s almost like there’s a "ModuleNotFoundError" in the connection between my online self and my offline reality. I need to find a way to reconcile them, to import the realness back in. Maybe a little less curated content, and a bit more…just being. Anyone else feeling this disconnect?

**Note:** I've tried to weave in the keywords metaphorically, using the "module" and "error" concepts to represent the feeling of disconnect.  The conversational tone aims to feel relatable and personal.
