**Neon Grit & Too Much Steel: My Cyberpunk Red Struggle**

Okay, so I dove headfirst into *Cyberpunk Red* this year, hyped for the gritty future. And honestly? The combat is *intense*. Like, brutally so. Coming from D&D, where a well-timed roll could swing a fight, it felt… relentless.  

I’ve been tweaking the difficulty settings, experimenting with the armor system, and really trying to lean into a more strategic fighting style. It’s a huge shift, and I’m starting to appreciate the depth, but it’s definitely reminding me that not every game needs to feel like a desperate scramble.  Anyone else feeling this?
