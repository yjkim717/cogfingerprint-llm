There’s a reason I keep coming back to this game—the core idea is brilliant, and when it clicks, there’s nothing like it. But let’s be real: 2023 has been a rough year for actually enjoying it.

The balancing feels all over the place, and the competitive scene? It’s been flooded with smurfs. You pour your heart into a match, only to get completely rolled by someone who clearly doesn’t belong in your skill bracket. It’s beyond frustrating.

What stings more is the community’s response—the immediate toxicity in chat just sucks the fun right out. That combination of poor matchmaking and hostile players has driven me to uninstall more than once. I’ll be gone for months, missing the game I wanted it to be, only to cautiously return, hoping something has changed. It’s a cycle I know many of you recognize all too well.
