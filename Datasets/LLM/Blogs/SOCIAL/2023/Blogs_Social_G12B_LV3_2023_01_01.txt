>## When Passion Projects Get Lost in the Pursuit of Profit: A Rocket League Reflection

Okay, let's be honest. How many of us have watched a beloved game slowly change, morphing into something… different? Something that feels less like the thing we fell in love with and more like a corporate cash grab? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with that feeling, specifically around *Rocket League*.

I remember when *Rocket League* was *the* game. Simple, addictive, endlessly replayable, and brimming with a vibrant community. It felt like a passion project, lovingly crafted by Psyonix. Then Epic Games bought them. And while acquisitions happen, and sometimes they're genuinely beneficial, I've seen a shift that’s hard to ignore. 

There's a thread on Reddit right now, gaining serious traction, suggesting a boycott. The core argument? Epic's focus on monetization, pushing battle passes and cosmetics, is actively detracting from the core gameplay and community experience. It's a bold move, proposing a boycott, but it reflects a growing frustration I've witnessed firsthand. The constant feeling that *every* update is geared towards squeezing more money out rather than improving the game itself.

It makes you think about the broader landscape of gaming. We're increasingly seeing companies prioritize shareholder value over the passion that initially fueled these games. Are we, as players, just collateral damage in this push for profit? 

I get it – companies need to make money. But there’s a line, isn’t there? A point where the relentless pursuit of revenue overshadows the joy of the game itself. Maybe this Reddit user’s call to action, the idea of forcing a sale to a developer who prioritizes the community, isn't so far-fetched after all. It’s a painful thought, but it’s a conversation worth having. What do you think?
