**Breaking Free From the Scroll**

It feels like 2023 has been a wild ride of endless scrolling – a constant pull into other people’s highlight reels. But last week, I made a conscious decision to *break free*. It wasn’t about quitting social media entirely, but about reclaiming my time and energy.  It’s been a journey of self-empowerment, fueled by determination to prioritize my own peace.  Small steps, big victories – feeling more present and grounded, one less notification at a time.
