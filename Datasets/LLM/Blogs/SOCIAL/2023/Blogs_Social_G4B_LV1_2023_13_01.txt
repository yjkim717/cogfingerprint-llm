**Finding My People (and a Good Nursery!)**

This fall, I found myself seriously thinking about church. Not in a ‘Sunday obligation’ way, but a ‘where do I *belong*’ way. Dallas has so many options, it felt overwhelming! I was craving a place that felt genuinely intergenerational – somewhere my kids could play and my grandparents could feel welcome.  I'm leaning towards exploring some of the Baptist churches, and definitely intrigued by the non-denominational ones with a really good nursery. It’s about more than just worship, isn't it? It’s about community.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different length?
