**Chasing the Light (Without the Drama)**

Okay, real talk – scrolling through Instagram lately feels like a constant battle against “perfect.” Everyone’s got that effortlessly gorgeous hair, and I’ve been feeling the pressure to keep up, especially when it comes to color. I’ve been *obsessed* with this level 6.5 platinum blonde – it’s just so bright and airy. 

But I'm realizing chasing that picture-perfect look can be exhausting, and honestly, damaging. I’m rethinking my approach. I just had a really good chat with my stylist about less harsh lightening methods, and exploring a strategic haircut to really *make* the color pop. 

It’s about embracing my natural hair texture and working *with* it, instead of fighting against it.  It’s a shift, for sure, but a much more peaceful one. What about you? Are you feeling the social media hair pressure too?
