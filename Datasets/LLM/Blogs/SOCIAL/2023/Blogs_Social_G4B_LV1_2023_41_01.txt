**The Scunch Factor & My Twisted Hair Journey**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve been obsessing over a phenomenon I’m pretty sure only Black hair people understand: “scunching.” It’s this satisfying, almost unsettling, feeling when your curls clump together after applying product – and let’s be honest, it’s *addictive*. 

I’ve spent the last few months experimenting with overnight twisting, a total game-changer for my 2c-3a hair. But I’m ready to level up. I’ve been lurking on Reddit (don’t judge!) seeing folks talk about transitioning to product-based styling, specifically with Curlsmith. 

There’s something so vulnerable about sharing your hair journey online, right? Seeing someone else’s struggles – or successes – with a technique like diffusing or even just finding the right curl pattern – it just…connects you. It's a reminder you're not alone in this curly chaos. 

This week, I’m diving into a new routine, hoping for less scunching stress and more defined curls. Wish me luck!  What are your biggest hair struggles right now?
