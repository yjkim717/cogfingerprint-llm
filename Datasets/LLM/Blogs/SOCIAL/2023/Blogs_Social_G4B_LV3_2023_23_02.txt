**The Quiet Echo of "Almost"**

It’s funny, isn’t it? After top surgery, a fantastic new job, and a whole heap of affirming comments – “You look amazing!” “So happy for you!” – I still sometimes feel… almost. Like I’m wearing a really good costume, and the zipper’s a little loose. 

I’m a trans man, and I think a lot of us grapple with this, especially when we’re trying to build a new, visible self.  It’s called stealth authenticity, I think – presenting outwardly as the person we’re becoming, while that inner voice whispers doubts about whether it’s *really* us.  

This feeling of inauthenticity is hitting hard lately, and I’m realizing it’s deeply connected to my gender dysphoria. It’s a reminder that true belonging comes from within.  Anyone else feel this echo? Let’s talk about it. #transgender #gendery dysphoria #authenticity #mentalhealth

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
