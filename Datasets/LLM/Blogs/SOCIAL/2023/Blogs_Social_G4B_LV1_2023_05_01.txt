**The Unexpected Fight Over a Laptop**

Okay, so this happened to a friend recently, and it’s got me thinking about how weird things can get with work these days. He’s been working from home full-time for years, practically glued to his laptop, and when he requested one for a short business trip, he was denied! Apparently, it’s a new policy, and his past WFH status doesn’t seem to count. 

It’s a frustrating reminder that even when you’ve built a solid routine – like a remote life – companies can suddenly change the rules. Makes you wonder about the value they place on experience versus rigid procedures, doesn’t it?  It also made me think about how much we rely on social media to *show* our work lives, and how much is actually real.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a post with a different focus or length?
