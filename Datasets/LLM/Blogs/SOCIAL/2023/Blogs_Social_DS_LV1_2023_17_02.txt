It’s 2023, and I’m caught in the chip shortage saga—just ordered a Subaru Crosstrek in November, but my VIN still hasn’t shown up. The irony? I’m moving in February, and I can’t help but laugh at the timing. It’s a weirdly shared experience; so many of us are waiting on things beyond our control, from cars to careers. But there’s comfort in knowing we’re all navigating these delays together, finding patience we didn’t know we had. Here’s to hoping my Crosstrek arrives before the moving truck does!
