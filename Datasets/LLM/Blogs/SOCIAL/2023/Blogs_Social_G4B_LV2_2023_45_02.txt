**The Strange Comfort of Familiar Chargers**

There’s something a little unsettling about stepping onto a brand-new ship, right? Like, everything’s shiny and exciting, but also…foreign. I felt it on my recent Royal Caribbean cruise. Specifically, I was desperately trying to recreate my charging routine from past trips – a simple plea for a few USB ports and a reliable outlet. 

It sounds silly, I know, but that little pass-through adapter felt like a lifeline. It’s not about the tech; it’s about the small, grounding rituals that make a space feel *mine*.  It reminded me that even in a completely new environment, a little bit of familiarity can bring a surprising amount of calm.  Anyone else find comfort in those tiny, personal touches?
