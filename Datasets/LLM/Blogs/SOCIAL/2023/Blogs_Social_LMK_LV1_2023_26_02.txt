"Been on Accutane for a few months now, and I'm still figuring out my body's new norms. Yesterday, I hit the gym hard and afterwards, I felt awful - lightheaded, nauseous, the whole nine yards. Was it dehydration or was I coming down with something? I've been reading about others having similar experiences on social media, and it's got me wondering: is this a side effect of the meds, or am I just not drinking enough water? Anyone else out there having Accutane-induced anxiety about their health?"
