**Scrolling & Soul-Searching**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2023 feels like a year of looking *out* at everyone’s highlight reels on social media, and feeling… a little lost. I caught myself endlessly scrolling, comparing my “real life” to perfectly curated feeds.  It’s exhausting, honestly.  I’m trying to remember that genuine connection happens offline, in real moments.  Maybe it’s time to put the phone down and actually *see* the people around me.
