## The Quiet Hours & Our Inner Worlds

There's something about night, isn't there? The world quiets, and suddenly, *we* quiet too. It’s prime time for reflection, for those long, slow sips of thought. Lately, I've been craving stories that capture that feeling – those books where characters wander through dimly lit spaces, wrestling with their choices and the weight of their lives. Banana Yoshimoto and Donna Tartt do it so well. Anyone else find themselves drawn to these introspective, nighttime narratives? What are you reading when the world goes dark?
