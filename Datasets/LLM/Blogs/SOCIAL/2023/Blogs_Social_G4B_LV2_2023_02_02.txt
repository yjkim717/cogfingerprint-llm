**Lost in the Stars (and a Little Disoriented)**

Okay, real talk – I’ve been feeling a bit… adrift lately. It’s funny, right? We’re supposed to be *connected* in 2023, constantly scrolling, liking, sharing. But sometimes, it feels like we’re just shouting into the void. 

I was completely sucked into No Man’s Sky VR the other day, and a frustrating update completely threw me. Suddenly, my movement felt *wrong*, disorienting. It mirrored that feeling of being lost online – a shift in the controls, a sudden disconnect from what felt comfortable. 

It made me think about how much we crave a sense of grounding, of control, even in virtual spaces. Maybe we need to be more mindful of *how* we’re engaging, not just *where* we’re scrolling.  Anyone else feeling this a little lately? Let's talk about it.
