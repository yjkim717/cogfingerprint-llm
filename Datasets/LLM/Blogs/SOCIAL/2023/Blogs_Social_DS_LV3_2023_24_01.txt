It’s funny how the mind works. Last week, I was scrolling through the news—something about a newly discovered microbe, zoonosis risks, the usual 2023 buzz—and my first thought wasn’t fear. It was of the little ecosystem in my grandmother’s garden.

She used to call certain insects “terrormorphs” because, to an aphid, a ladybug must seem like a monster. But that predator-prey dance? It’s what kept her roses thriving. We’re so quick to imagine microscopic invaders leaping to humans, forgetting we live in a world already rich with disease and medical marvels. We’ve survived worse.

What struck me, though, was the realization that disruption is natural. Not always comfortable, but natural. When a storm clears deadwood from a forest, it’s not a tragedy—it’s renewal. Maybe our fear isn’t really about microbes; it’s about losing control, about ecosystems shifting in ways we didn’t plan.

So next time anxiety whispers about the next big scare, I’ll remember: we’re part of this world, not separate from its logic. And sometimes, the most profound changes begin with the tiniest shifts—in nature, and in us.
