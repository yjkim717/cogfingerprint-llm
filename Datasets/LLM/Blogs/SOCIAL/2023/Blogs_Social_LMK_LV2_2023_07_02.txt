The nostalgia that comes with scouring Costco aisles! A Reddit user's recent post about their favourite discontinued items resonated with me. Who else remembers the Mediterranean Pasta Salad or Balderson Cheddar that once delighted our taste buds? As I scrolled through comments, I was transported back to memories of family gatherings and lazy Sundays. It's funny how a simple product can evoke such strong emotions. What are your own lost favourites? Share your stories, and let's commiserate about the good old days â€“ and maybe even convince Costco to bring back a classic or two!
