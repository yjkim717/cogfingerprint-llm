**Title: Will the Good Times *Really* Last? Thinking About Access & Content**

Hey everyone,

Something’s been on my mind lately, and I wanted to chat about it. Remember back when season passes were a thing? That feeling of knowing you’d have access to *everything* – past episodes, bonus content – forever? It felt… reassuring, you know? Like a digital library you could always return to.

Now, with so many creators moving towards subscription models, I’ve been wondering if that same promise will stick around. Will subscribing to a new season automatically grant you access to the older ones? Or will things change?

It's not just about the content itself, but the *feeling* of ownership and connection it creates.  It feels a bit unsettling to think that access could become… temporary. I know models evolve, and supporting creators is vital, but I do miss that sense of permanence. Anyone else feeling this shift? I'd love to hear your thoughts!
