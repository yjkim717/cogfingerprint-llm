In the chaotic "Not the Bees" world of Terraria, my summoner journey began with a desperate search for a starter weapon. With none in sight, I turned to unconventional advice: fishing and catching critters. It felt like a social lesson from 2023—when traditional paths fail, creativity and community tips become your greatest assets. Embracing this unexpected route not only saved my game but reminded me that sometimes, the best solutions come from stepping off the beaten path and connecting with others’ ingenuity.
