**My Sleep Crisis (and a Mattress on the Floor?)**

Okay, real talk – 2023 has been…rough. I’ve been obsessing over sleep lately, and it completely spiraled when I decided to “reset” my sleep setup. I swapped my comfy bed for a mattress directly on the floor. Huge mistake. Seriously, my sleep quality tanked. It was like my brain just refused to switch off.  It made me realize how much my bed *actually* means to me – it’s more than just a place to sleep, it's a sanctuary.
