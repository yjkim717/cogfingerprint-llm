Of all the things I expected to bond with my coworkers over, it wasn’t my dog’s chew toy. But there I was last Tuesday, on a crucial video call with our biggest client, when my colleague Sarah’s five-year-old son marched into her home office and proudly presented me with a slobber-covered rubber bone. Sarah just laughed. “Oh, isn’t he adorable? He just loves your dog from our last call!” I managed a tight smile, my professional facade cracking as I tried to steer the conversation back to quarterly projections.

This wasn’t an isolated incident. It was the latest in a string of moments that have me thinking a lot about a particular kind of modern social friction: the expectation that the world must always accommodate children, often at the expense of everyone else’s boundaries.

Let me be clear from the start. I like kids. I truly do. My issue isn't with children being children; it's with a certain brand of parental entitlement that seems to have flourished in our post-pandemic, hybrid-work world. It’s the assumption that because *their* world revolves around their child, *my* world should, too.

This plays out in two key arenas for me: the virtual workplace and my local park.

In the professional sphere, the line between home and office has blurred into a gray, chaotic mess. I’ve lost count of the meetings derailed by a toddler’s tantrum broadcast on full volume, with the parent making no move to mute themselves. There’s an unspoken rule that we must all nod understandingly, as if a deadline is less important than a dropped sippy cup. My dog, Barley, is well-trained and sleeps peacefully during my work hours. If he ever did bark during a call, I’d be mortified and immediately apologize. Yet, child-related interruptions are often met with a chorus of “It’s okay!” and “We don’t mind!” But I do mind. I mind because it feels like my time and focus are being devalued.

The same dynamic unfolds in my personal life. I take Barley to the designated, fenced-in dog park. It’s our one place to let off steam safely. Yet, increasingly, parents treat it as a free-range playground, letting their kids run unsupervised among large, excited dogs. Last weekend, a child started pulling Barley’s tail. When I politely asked him to stop, his mother swooped in, not to correct her son, but to chastise *me*. “He’s just curious! You can’t expect to bring a dog to a public space and not have kids be interested.”

And there it was—the core of the issue. A fenced dog park is not a generic “public space”; it’s a specific zone with a specific purpose. My responsibility is to my dog and other dog owners. Theirs should be to their child. The entitlement lies in redefining the purpose of a space to suit their needs, while dismissing the needs and safety of others already there.

I’m not asking for a child-free world. I’m asking for a world with clearer social contracts. One where workspaces are respected as places of business, and specialized spaces, like dog parks, are used for their intended purpose. It’s about mutual respect. I respect your choice to have a family; please respect my choice to have a career and a pet, without expecting my boundaries to be negotiable. It’s not a war between parents and the childfree; it’s a simple plea for everyone to be more considerate of the shared spaces we all inhabit.
