**Ten Days & a Whole Lot of “No”**

Scrolling through Reddit last week, I stumbled on a post that just *hit* different. A guy, ten days smoke-free, completely ditching a book he’d tried before and, honestly, just staring down cigarettes with a fierce “no.” It reminded me of my own battles. Sometimes, it’s not about the perfect plan, but the stubborn refusal to let addiction win.  That little spark of defiance? That’s what keeps me going. ❤️ #quitsmoking #addictionrecovery
