"I'm thrilled to share my recovery update on my patella hairline fracture! On day 4, I'm delighted to have regained almost full range of motion in my knee. While there's still some minor pain, I'm managing it effectively. It's a relief to be back on the road to recovery. I'm grateful for the support of loved ones and online communities, who've been instrumental in my healing journey. Bring on the progress! #kneeinjury #recoveryjourney"
