## The Suit Fits, But Does *I*?

It’s surreal, honestly. I finally had top surgery last year, and the physical changes? Life-altering in the best way. I feel… aligned. But lately, a weird feeling has been creeping in, especially at work. It’s a quiet hum of anxiety, a constant questioning: am I pulling this off? 

I’m navigating “stealth” – presenting as cisgender – in my professional life, and while it allows me a level of ease I hadn’t anticipated, it’s also stirred up this insidious imposter syndrome. It's 2023, and shouldn't I be able to just *be*? 

I find myself overthinking everything – my posture, my voice, even the way I respond in meetings. Is this “me,” or am I performing a role? It's exhausting. 

Has anyone else experienced this after transitioning? That feeling of being a carefully constructed facade, even when you’re genuinely happy with who you are? I’d love to hear your stories, your advice, anything to help quiet this little voice of doubt.
