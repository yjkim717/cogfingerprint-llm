**The Overload of a Boost**

Okay, let’s be real – sometimes the internet feels…loud. Not just the memes and the arguments, but the *everything*. And lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how overwhelming that can be, particularly for people who already experience sensory sensitivities. 

I stumbled across a story recently about a Rocket League player who’s navigating the game with autism and ADHD, and it really hit me hard. They’re battling the usual challenges of competitive gaming – the fast pace, the strategic thinking – but also dealing with something incredibly specific: the TP Boost. 

Now, for those unfamiliar, the TP Boost in Rocket League is that satisfying little sound effect when you’re instantly teleported across the field. It’s a classic, a visual cue, a little dopamine hit. But for this player, it’s an *overload*. The sudden, sharp sound, combined with the visual flash, triggers intense sensory distress. 

It made me think about how easily we, as a society, can miss the fact that “normal” isn’t a universal experience. We build systems – games, social interactions, even just daily routines – that assume everyone processes information the same way. 

I’ve definitely felt that “loudness” myself, that moment when a room suddenly feels too bright, or a conversation becomes too intense. It’s exhausting, and it’s often invisible to the people around you. 

This player’s plea for Psyonix to adjust the TP Boost isn’t just about a game; it’s about recognizing the need for accessibility and understanding. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the smallest changes can make a huge difference.

Would you like me to revise this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
