## The Theory Behind the Keys: A New Chapter

So, I’m at a bit of a crossroads, and it’s honestly exciting! I’ve been tinkling the ivories (okay, *playing* the piano, really) for about eight years now, mostly self-taught, just enjoying the process. But lately, a little voice has been whispering… what if I took it further? What if I actually aimed for a conservatory?

The thought is both thrilling and terrifying. I can *play*, but understanding *why* I’m playing, the underlying architecture of music… that's where I feel a little shaky. I’ve started diving into music theory, and wow, it's a whole new world!

Right now, I’m on the hunt for some really beginner-friendly resources. Something that won’t make my brain explode. Any recommendations from fellow musicians out there? I’m prepping for a potential big leap, and a solid foundation in theory feels like the first crucial step. Wish me luck! #pianolife #musicTheory #conservatoryDreams #2023Goals #musicEducation
