**Remembering the Good Old Stripes Days?**

Okay, real talk. I was driving through Laredo last week, desperate for gas and a quick bite, and it hit me – Stripes. Specifically, a particular Stripes station I used to practically *live* near back in the day. It brought back a seriously weird wave of nostalgia. 

I’m talking about the *good* Stripes – you know, the ones with the surprisingly decent Laredo Tacos, the reliably stocked Slurpees, and a general vibe that felt…well, normal.  I’ve been noticing a shift lately, though. I stopped at a Stripes just last month and it felt…different. The floors weren’t quite as clean, there was a definite lack of energy from the employees, and it just felt like the standards had dropped a little. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? We take these little things for granted. That quick, friendly service at the pump, a clean bathroom – it’s almost invisible until it’s gone. It made me think about how a small, consistent effort can build a really positive experience, and how easily that can fade. 

I saw a few people complaining online about the same thing – a noticeable decline in customer service and overall upkeep.  Maybe it's a tough economy, maybe it’s just a shift, but it’s a reminder to appreciate the little comforts, and to maybe, just maybe, give a little extra thanks to the people who keep those 7-Eleven-adjacent stations running.  Anyone else feeling this nostalgic Stripes slump?
