## The Unexpected Joy of a Slightly-Used Strike

Last night, I bowled. It was…fun! Like, genuinely, unexpectedly fun. It reminded me of childhood birthday parties and the satisfying *thump* of a house ball hitting the pins. Now, I’m officially bitten by the bowling bug, but my budget isn’t exactly screaming “custom pro shop ball.” So, I'm on the hunt for a good, used ball – something reliable in the West Houston area. Anyone have tips for finding a quality budget ball? Maybe we can all share the joy of a good strike!
