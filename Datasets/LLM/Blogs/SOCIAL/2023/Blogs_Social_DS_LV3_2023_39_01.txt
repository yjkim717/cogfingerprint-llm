Have you ever wondered why we’re drawn to certain leaders, almost instinctively? It reminds me of something I read about *Pikmin*—those tiny, plant-like creatures who faithfully follow Captain Olimar. The theory goes that they see a resemblance to their own king in him, which explains their unwavering loyalty.

It got me thinking about our own social circles, especially in a year like 2023, when so much of our interaction happens online. We gravitate toward people who reflect qualities we admire or need—confidence, empathy, vision—almost like they fill a role we’re missing. In friendships, work, or even online communities, we “follow” those who make us feel secure and purposeful, much like the Pikmin do.

But here’s the twist: unlike in the game, we aren’t just one species relying on a single figure. Our strength lies in diversity and mutual support. So, while it’s natural to seek out leaders, let’s also remember to nurture the connections that help us grow together, not just follow blindly. After all, the real magic happens when we all feel like kings and queens in our own right.
