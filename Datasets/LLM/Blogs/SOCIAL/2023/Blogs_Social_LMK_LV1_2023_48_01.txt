The Entitlement Epidemic: When Parenting Goes Too Far

As I navigated through the crowded streets on a sunny Saturday afternoon, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration wash over me. It wasn't the traffic or the noise that got to me, but the utter lack of consideration displayed by some parents around me. It seemed like they were oblivious to the world beyond their little ones.

Everywhere I looked, I saw parents letting their kids run wild, screaming and shouting without so much as a second glance at the people around them. On public transport, I witnessed kids kicking the back of my seat, and their parents either didn't notice or didn't care. It was as if they believed they were entitled to disrupt everyone's peace simply because they had children in tow.

This phenomenon isn't new, but it feels like it's getting worse. The 'childfree' community has been vocal about the lack of consideration from parents, and it's not hard to see why. When you're out and about, it's not uncommon to be subjected to tantrums, loud conversations, and general chaos courtesy of someone else's offspring.

The comparison between kids and dogs is often made, and while it's not a perfect analogy, it's hard not to notice that dog owners generally have more control over their pets than parents do over their children. Dogs are usually on leashes, trained to behave in public, and their owners clean up after them. It's a far cry from the laissez-faire attitude some parents display.

The Return to Office (RTO) mandate has also brought to light the entitled attitude some parents have towards their work-life balance. While it's understandable that parents want to balance work and family life, it's becoming increasingly common to see them expect special treatment simply because they're parents. The assumption that they're automatically entitled to flexible working hours or extra perks is not only unfair but also unrealistic.

The issue here isn't the kids themselves; it's the parenting. It's the lack of discipline, the absence of teaching children about boundaries and respect for others. As a society, we've somehow arrived at a place where being a parent is synonymous with being entitled. Newsflash: having kids doesn't give you a free pass to disrupt everyone else's life.

As we move through 2023, it's time to rethink our approach to parenting. It's not about being permissive or strict; it's about teaching children to be respectful members of society. It's about being considerate of others and recognizing that our actions have consequences. So, to all the parents out there, let's make a conscious effort to raise our kids with some old-fashioned values like empathy and self-control. The world would be a more pleasant place for everyone, childfree or not.
