There I was, scrolling through my camera roll in early 2023, staring at photos from my Curlsmith era. My hair looked like a fluffy cloud—full of volume, yes, but definition? Not so much. I’d switched from my trusty overnight styling method, thinking these cult-favorite products would be my holy grail. Instead, my curls felt lost in translation.

It’s funny—curly hair is so much more than just hair. For me, it’s a statement. A daily conversation between me and the mirror. But lately, that conversation had turned into a debate. Why were my curls so puffy? Was I applying the products wrong? Was it the humidity, or just me?

I remember posting a desperate selfie in a curly hair community, captioning it, “Help a curly girl out!” The responses flooded in. Someone suggested scrunching more water into my hair before applying the Curlsmith gel. Another swore by the “praying hands” method for better clumping. It wasn’t just about the technique—it was about connection. Strangers turned into curl-confidants, sharing their own triumphs and fails.

Now, I’m learning to embrace the journey. Some days, my curls are perfectly defined; other days, they’re wild and free. And honestly? Both are beautiful. Because in a world that often asks us to conform, my curls remind me that authenticity doesn’t always come with a manual—it comes with patience, community, and a little bit of faith in the process.
