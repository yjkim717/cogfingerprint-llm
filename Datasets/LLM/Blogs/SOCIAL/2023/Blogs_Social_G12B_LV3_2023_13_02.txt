>## The Weight of Knowing: Carrier Screening and My Anxious Heart

So, here I am, pregnant and buzzing with a mix of joy and… well, anxiety. It's always been a part of me, this anxious hum, and pregnancy has definitely amplified it. We’re considering carrier screening – that thing where they test you and your partner to see if you carry genes for certain genetic disorders. Logically, it makes sense. Knowledge is power, right? 

But what if knowing *more* just adds to the worry? My husband and I are healthy, no family history to speak of. Still, that little voice whispers, "What if…?" It's a tough decision, balancing the potential peace of mind against the possibility of fueling my anxiety. Anyone else grappling with this kind of internal debate?
