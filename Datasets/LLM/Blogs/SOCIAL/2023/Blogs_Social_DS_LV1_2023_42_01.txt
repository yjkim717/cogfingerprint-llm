Of course, here is an original blog post inspired by your summary.

I was rewatching an old *Star Trek: The Next Generation* episode the other night, the one where Captain Picard is famously called "Sir." It got me thinking about Commander Riker’s line to a female superior: "With all due respect, Sir." It’s a small moment, but it hit me differently in 2023.

Why "Sir"? The show presents a utopian, egalitarian future, yet it still defaults to a male-gendered title for a position of command. It’s a subtle cue, a whisper from our own world that says authority has a default setting, and it isn't female. We see women in leadership everywhere now, but these tiny, ingrained habits can still undermine their presence, making their authority feel like an exception to the rule rather than a given.

It makes me wonder about the power of our own everyday language. Are we, in our own ways, still accidentally saying "Sir" when a simple, powerful "Captain" would do just fine?
