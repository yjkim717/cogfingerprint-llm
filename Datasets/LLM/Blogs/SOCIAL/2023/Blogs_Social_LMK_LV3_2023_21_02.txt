As I reflect on my engineering journey, I realize that my motivation has been a rollercoaster ride. From being excited about hands-on projects to feeling lost during the pandemic, my passion for the field has fluctuated. The shift to online learning was a significant challenge, but it also taught me to be resourceful and adaptable. When I finally returned to campus, I was reinvigorated by collaborative projects and in-person interactions. My experiences have shown me that a successful engineering career is not just about technical skills, but also about resilience and creativity. As I look to the future, I'm committed to staying curious and embracing the ever-changing landscape of my field. For students navigating their own educational paths, I encourage you to stay open to new experiences and to find what truly drives you - it's a journey worth exploring.
