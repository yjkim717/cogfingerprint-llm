**The Echo in the Empty Chair**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How silence can feel so…loud? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a really persistent ache – a loneliness that’s not about being *alone*, but about feeling unseen. It started subtly, a few declined invitations from friends and family. Everyone’s dealing with something, you know? Grief, job stress, a tricky kid… and honestly, I get it. 

But the pattern kept repeating. Each “maybe next time” felt like another brick in a wall around me. It’s not that I expected a constant stream of parties and catch-ups – life is busy! – but the consistent unavailability started to chip away at me. 

I felt like an echo in the empty chair, a well-intentioned offer bouncing off a carefully constructed shield of “I’m fine.” It’s a particularly painful feeling when you're navigating your own grief and challenges, and you crave just a little connection, a little acknowledgement that you exist. 

This year, 2023, I’m trying to be kinder to myself. Recognizing that people *are* struggling, and that sometimes, a simple “thinking of you” can mean more than a grand gesture.  It’s about shifting my focus from *receiving* connection to *offering* it, even in small ways.  It's a slow process, but I'm hoping to build bridges instead of reinforcing walls.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
