It’s 2023, and I’m thinking about what it means to truly see someone—especially when the world often refuses to. A friend recently asked me for advice about their homeless friend, who they suspect is trans and still in the closet. How do you offer support when something as simple as clothing isn’t just about warmth, but about identity and dignity?

We talked about finding affirming clothes—garments that might help their friend feel a little more like themselves in a world that can feel relentlessly hostile. But then came the hard part: safety. For a trans person without stable housing, the wrong outfit could mean the difference between being ignored or becoming a target. It’s a heartbreaking reality.

So, what’s the answer? Maybe it’s not one grand gesture, but small, consistent acts of care—listening without judgment, offering choices, and standing beside them as they navigate these impossible choices. Because everyone deserves to feel seen, safe, and whole—no exceptions.
