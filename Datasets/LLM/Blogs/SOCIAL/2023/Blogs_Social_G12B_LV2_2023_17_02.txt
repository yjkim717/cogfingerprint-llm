## The Waiting Game & Moving Mayhem 

Anyone else feeling the year-end stress? I just got a delivery date for my new Subaru Crosstrek – January! Huge win, right? Except… my lease is up in February. Talk about a logistical dance.  It's a classic 2023 story, isn’t it?  Supply chain hiccups (still battling that chip shortage!) meeting the chaos of life changes.  I’m nervously tracking that VIN, hoping everything lines up.  It’s a good reminder that even exciting purchases come with a dose of uncertainty.  Wish me luck with the move!



Hope this captures the vibe you were going for! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
