As a GM, I’ve felt the sting when my party groans, “Combat’s too hard.” In 2023, we’re all armored up—not in plate mail, but emotional defenses. Fudging a dice roll isn’t cheating; it’s adapting. Like navigating real-world social friction, it’s about connection, not just difficulty. Are we playing to win, or to share a story? Sometimes, bending the rules builds the trust that gets us through the real battles, together.
