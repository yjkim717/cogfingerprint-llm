## The Weight of Watching: Why We Need to Document Our Digital Debates

Okay, let’s be real. We've all seen it happen. Someone throws out a claim, a narrative takes hold, and suddenly, a whole online community is grappling with its validity. Especially within spaces like TFM, where dedicated individuals pour incredible effort into content creation, the stakes feel higher. 

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the responsibility we have to *document* these moments. Not just the flashy videos or the big reveals, but the subtle shifts in narratives, the questionable sources, the claims that need rigorous scrutiny. Right now, a lot of that falls on a few individuals, relying on others to catch inconsistencies. Isn't it time we shifted that burden?

It's easy to feel overwhelmed, to just scroll past and hope someone else will flag it. But in 2023, with misinformation swirling everywhere, a little extra documentation – a saved screenshot, a linked source, a detailed observation – can make a huge difference. It’s about building a collective record, so we can all better understand the landscape and hold narratives accountable. What do you think?
