It’s 2023, and I’ve noticed something strange happening in online chats. I’ll post something like, “Am I the only one who still loves rainy afternoons?” and instead of shared nostalgia, someone replies, “Actually, statistically, no.” It makes me pause. Since when did we start taking every turn of phrase so literally? To me, it’s just a way to connect, a gentle nudge saying, “Hey, does this resonate with you, too?” It feels like we're losing the art of reading between the lines for the sake of pointless correction.
