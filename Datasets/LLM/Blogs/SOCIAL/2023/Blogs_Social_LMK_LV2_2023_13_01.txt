"Finding Community in the City: My Church Search in Dallas. As I navigated the vibrant city of Dallas in 2023, I yearned for a church home that felt like family. I craved an intergenerational community where I could grow alongside others. My search led me to a non-denominational, evangelical church with thriving small groups. It was there that I discovered a sense of belonging and connection, and I'm excited to share my journey with you."
