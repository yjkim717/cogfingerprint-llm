There’s a hawkish intensity to how we watch each other online now. In 2023, it feels like we’re all under a microscope, our every post and like observed with a strange, aggressive discipline. It reminds me of a cat stalking its prey—only here, we’re both the hunter and the hunted. This constant scrutiny is reshaping our social landscape, making us second-guess our authenticity. Are we connecting, or just performing for an unseen, judging audience? It’s a question I find myself asking more and more.
