It’s funny how small changes in our favorite sci-fi worlds can spark such big conversations. Watching *Strange New Worlds* this year, I couldn’t help but notice the Klingons felt different—less towering, their voices smoother, without that iconic growl. It got me thinking about how even the most established parts of our shared stories evolve. It’s a reminder that our connections to these fictional cultures are deeply personal, and seeing them change feels like catching up with an old friend who’s picked up some new habits.
