Ever since starting HRT this year, I’ve been wondering: will my skinny frame finally change? My metabolism has always been fast, keeping me lean no matter what I eat. But now, I’m hoping for that promised fat redistribution—softer curves, a more *me* shape. It’s not about weight gain, really; it’s about alignment. Will my body catch up to my heart? Every day feels like waiting for a new map to settle onto familiar bones.
