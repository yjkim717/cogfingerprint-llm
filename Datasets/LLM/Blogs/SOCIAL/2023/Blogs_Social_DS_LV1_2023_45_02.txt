Sitting here in my tiny cabin on Voyager of the Seas, I’m struck by a simple truth: we’re all just trying to stay connected. Last night, I fumbled with my USB pass-through adapter, hoping it would click into the bedside lamp outlet. It wasn’t just about charging my phone—it was about preserving a lifeline to photos, messages, and the world beyond this ship.

In 2023, this small act feels symbolic. Even surrounded by endless ocean, our instinct is to plug in, to share, to remain digitally present. It’s funny how a simple adapter can remind you that no matter how far you voyage, the heart of the journey is in the connections we carry with us.
