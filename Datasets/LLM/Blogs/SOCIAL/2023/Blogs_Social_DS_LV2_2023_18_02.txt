It’s funny how we build our little worlds, isn’t it? I was running a Cyberpunk Red game last night, watching my D&D-loving friends struggle. They’re used to heroic fudge rolls and forgiving armor. Here, every combat decision felt like life or death. It hit me: isn't that just like 2023? We're all navigating systems—social, professional—that feel brutally high-stakes, where a single misstep has real consequences. We're all just trying to find a little more grace in the rules.
