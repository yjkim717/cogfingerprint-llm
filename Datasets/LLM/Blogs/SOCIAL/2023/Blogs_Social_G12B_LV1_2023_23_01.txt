## That Feeling When a Character Just…Doesn't?

Okay, revisiting old favorites can be tricky. I recently dove back into *The L Word*, and honestly, Max’s storyline felt…off. Like, *really* off. It’s not just that the plot was questionable, but the way Kit handled things felt so out of character. It's a weird sadness, realizing a beloved character's arc just didn't quite land. Anyone else ever get that cringe-worthy disconnect with a show they used to adore? It makes you question everything!
