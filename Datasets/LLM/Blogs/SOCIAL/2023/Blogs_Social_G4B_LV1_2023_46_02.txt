**The Echo of a Flail**

Okay, so I was watching an old Western the other day – a real silent film, mind you – and it hit me with a weird feeling. All these actors getting ‘shot,’ and they’d just… *flail*. Like, really dramatically wave their legs around. It’s baffling, right? 

It makes you realize how much of the storytelling relied on suggestion, on the audience *filling in* the gaps. Back then, you couldn’t show a bullet wound realistically. So, a big, theatrical leg-wave was basically a visual shorthand for “dead.” 

It got me thinking about how we communicate now. We’re so used to instant gratification, hyper-realistic visuals. But sometimes, a little bit of implied emotion – a subtle gesture, a lingering look – can be just as powerful. It’s like the ghost of that flailing leg, a reminder that sometimes, less is truly more.  #silentfilm #communication #reflection
