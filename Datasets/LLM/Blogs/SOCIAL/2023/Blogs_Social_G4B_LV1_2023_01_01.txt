**Is Rocket League Selling Out? A Little Reflection on Gaming & Loyalty**

Okay, so I’ve been chewing on something lately, and it’s about Rocket League. You probably remember it – that ridiculously addictive, chaotic soccer with cars. It was *the* game for a while, a genuine indie success story turned into a massive Epic Games phenomenon. But lately, it feels…different. 

I saw a lot of chatter online about a potential boycott, fueled by worries about Epic’s profit margins and a feeling that the game is losing its soul. Honestly, it resonated with me. It’s not just about the money, is it? It’s about the community that built this game, the players who poured hours into it, the developers who poured their hearts into the updates.

I remember when Rocket League felt special. It wasn't about chasing the highest leaderboard rank; it was about the shared joy of pulling off an insane aerial goal with your friends. Now, it feels like a product, a cog in Epic’s ever-expanding machine. 

It makes you think about how much power we, as consumers, really have. We can choose to support companies that prioritize profit over passion, or we can push back and say, “Hey, we remember what made this game great, and we want it back.”  

I’m not saying everyone needs to jump on the boycott bandwagon, but it’s a conversation worth having.  It’s a reminder that in the digital world, our loyalty still matters, and that sometimes, the best way to get a company’s attention is to simply stop buying.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way – perhaps adjust the tone, focus on a specific aspect, or aim for a slightly different length?
