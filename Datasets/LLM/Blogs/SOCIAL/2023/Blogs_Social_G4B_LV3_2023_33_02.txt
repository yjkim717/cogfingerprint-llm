**The Weight of Trying Too Hard**

There’s this weird feeling, isn’t there? Like you’re constantly scrambling, pushing yourself to achieve something – whether it’s a shiny trophy in *GTA Online* or just… feeling “enough.” I was stuck on that bounty trophy, desperately hiding, hampered by my low level. It felt like every strategy was failing because I wasn’t *ready*.
