**The Quiet Struggle of Scrolling**

It's 2023, and let’s be honest – scrolling feels…exhausting. We’re bombarded with perfectly curated lives, witty captions, and endless opinions. I find myself noticing how much time I spend passively absorbing, rarely truly *connecting*. 

Recently, I took a break from Instagram, just a few days. And you know what? I felt lighter, more present. It made me realize that social media, while offering connection, can also be a quiet drain. Maybe it’s time to be a little more intentional about who and what I let into my feed.
