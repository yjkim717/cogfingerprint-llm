### The Year My Brain Broke (And Started to Heal)

2023 was supposed to be my year. Instead, I found myself at 3 AM, scrolling through photos of a "situationship" that felt more like a hostage crisis, my chest so tight I couldn't breathe. That gray area of not quite being together but being entirely consumed was the final thread to snap.

My existing anxiety skyrocketed into a full-blown depressive episode. Getting out of bed felt like a Herculean task. I finally admitted I couldn't "positive-thought" my way out of this and found a therapist. Sitting in that virtual waiting room, I was terrified.

She suggested Effexor. Starting medication felt like a defeat, a public admission that my own mind was my enemy. But slowly, the fog began to lift. The constant, screaming static in my head quieted to a manageable hum.

Iâ€™m not "fixed." Healing isn't linear. But for the first time in a long time, I can imagine a future where my happiness isn't tied to someone else's ambivalence. If you're in that 3 AM spiral, please know it can get better. You just have to ask for the help.
