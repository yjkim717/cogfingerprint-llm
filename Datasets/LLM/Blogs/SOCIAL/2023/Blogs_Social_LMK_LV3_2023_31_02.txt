As I sat on my couch, scrolling through old photos, a particular night resurfaced - a hookup that still lingers in my mind. Being in a committed relationship, I couldn't help but wonder: is it normal to fantasize about someone else? The desire was intense, and I felt torn. Monogamy is a cornerstone of my relationship, yet attraction to others still simmers beneath the surface. In today's world, where relationships are complex, I'm left questioning whether my desires are a threat to my partnership or just a natural human instinct.
