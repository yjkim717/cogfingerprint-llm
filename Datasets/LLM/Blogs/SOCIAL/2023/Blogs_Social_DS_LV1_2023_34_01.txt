### My Hair, My Rules: A 2023 Reality Check

I’ll admit it—I’ve spent more hours than I care to count scrolling through hair inspo on social media. Lately, I’m obsessed with this soft, warm brown shade the internet calls “peek-a-boo platinum.” It’s not a full head of bleach, just subtle, lightened pieces that frame the face. The goal? A gentle lift from my natural level 6.5 hair.

But here’s the 2023 twist: the conversation has changed. We’re not just talking about the final look anymore; we’re talking about the journey there. My feed is now filled with honest conversations about hair integrity. I see posts celebrating natural texture right alongside those stunning color transformations, and it’s made me pause.

I want the change, but I don’t want the straw-like damage. So, I’m doing something I’ve never done before: I’ve booked a consultation with a stylist. My first question won’t be “Can I get this color?” but “What is the least damaging way to lighten my hair to achieve it?” It feels less like a simple salon visit and more like a collaborative project for my well-being. This time, the health of my hair is the main character in the story.
