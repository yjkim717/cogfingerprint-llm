**The Quiet Fade and the Return to the Workshop**

It’s funny how easily our passions can shift, isn’t it? 2023 felt… muted for a long time. Like a beautiful color slowly draining away. As an engineer, I’d always thrived on the challenge of building, of problem-solving, of *creating*. But the pandemic hit, and suddenly, the intricate logic of circuits and the thrill of design felt distant, overshadowed by endless video calls and a strange sense of isolation. 

My passion just… faded. It wasn’t a dramatic explosion, more like a quiet, persistent dimming. I lost my motivation, the joy in the work replaced with a feeling of dragging myself through it. 

Then, something shifted. The return to in-person labs, the messy, tactile experience of hands-on projects – it was like a spark had been reignited.  It reminded me why I fell in love with engineering in the first place.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, stepping away is the only way to truly appreciate the return.  What about you?  Has something similar impacted your passions this year?
