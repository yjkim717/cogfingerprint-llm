**The Echo of Empty Labs**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2023 feels…complicated, right? Like we’re all still figuring things out. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about how passions shift and change, and it led me back to a really strange period during the pandemic. 

I’m an engineering student, and for years, I genuinely *loved* it. Building things, solving problems – it felt like a puzzle I was born to solve. Then, lockdown hit, and suddenly, all the hands-on projects disappeared. The labs were empty, the workshops silent. It felt like a part of me just… faded. 

There was a definite low point, a feeling that maybe this wasn’t for me. But lately, something’s been stirring. A quiet, insistent pull back towards that initial passion. It’s tentative, fragile even, but it’s there.  Like an echo in an empty lab, reminding me why I started down this path in the first place.  Anyone else feeling a similar flicker?
