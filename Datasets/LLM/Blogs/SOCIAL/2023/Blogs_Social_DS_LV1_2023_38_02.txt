It’s 2023, and I keep seeing the same arguments play out online and at family dinners: capitalism versus socialism. But honestly, I’ve started to wonder—are we even talking about the same things?

I remember a recent chat where one person described socialism as state control of everything, while another saw it as worker-owned co-ops. Capitalism, for some, meant innovation and freedom; for others, exploitation and inequality. We were using the same words but holding entirely different ideas in our heads.

It hit me then: maybe the problem isn’t the systems themselves, but our fuzzy definitions. We shout past each other, defending or attacking concepts that don’t quite match up. What if we paused to ask, “What do you mean by that?” We might find more common ground—or at least understand where the real disagreements lie.
