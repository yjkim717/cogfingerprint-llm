**Finding My Flock in the Big D**

Moving to a new city is a wild thing, isn’t it? Dallas felt like a whirlwind of concrete and energy when I first arrived in 2023. But beneath the bustle, I realized I was craving something deeper – a sense of community, a place of connection. As a new resident, I’ve been actively searching for a church that feels like ‘home.’ 

More than just a building, I’m hoping to find a place where generations can gather, where stories overlap, and where faith feels vibrant and real.  I’m really prioritizing those intergenerational connections – a place where a toddler’s giggle can brighten an older adult’s day. It’s about building something lasting, rooted in shared values.  Anyone have recommendations for welcoming churches in the Dallas area? Let’s help each other find our flocks!
