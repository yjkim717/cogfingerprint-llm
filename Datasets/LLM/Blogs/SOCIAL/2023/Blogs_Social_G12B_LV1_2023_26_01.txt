## The Unexpected Email & a Whole Lot of Feelings

Okay, so… things have been a bit rough lately. I got an email last week that pretty much blindsided me. My employer gently let me know they're looking for someone to replace me. Apparently, my ADHD – specifically the challenges with deadlines and, yeah, the occasional brain-blank – were impacting things. 

It stung, honestly. A lot. It’s hard to hear that something you’re actively working on is perceived as a deficit. 2023 feels like it *should* be more understanding, but it's a reminder that neurodiversity isn't always easily accommodated. I'm taking some time to process, to grieve the loss of a job, and to figure out what I need – and what kind of environment *truly* lets me thrive.  Anyone else been through something similar? Sharing helps. ❤️
