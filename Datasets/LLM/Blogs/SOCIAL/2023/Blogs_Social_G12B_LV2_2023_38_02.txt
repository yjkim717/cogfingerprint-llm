## Lost in Translation: Why Are We Arguing About Capitalism and Socialism?

It’s 2023, and it feels like every online conversation about economics devolves into a shouting match about capitalism and socialism. But lately, I’ve been wondering… are we even talking about the same things? 

I've noticed a frustrating pattern: someone praises the innovation spurred by free markets, and another person immediately jumps in with criticisms of wealth inequality, labeling it “capitalism.” Meanwhile, a defense of social safety nets gets countered with fears of government overreach, dismissed as "socialism."

It's like we’re using words as weapons, not tools for understanding. The definitions themselves seem to have become incredibly fluid, molded to fit a pre-existing viewpoint. 

Maybe the problem isn’t that there’s a right or wrong answer, but that we’ve lost the ability to actually *discuss* the nuances. What if we all took a breath, clarified what we *mean* when we use these loaded terms, and actually listened to each other? It’s a thought, right? Maybe then, we could start building something better, together.
