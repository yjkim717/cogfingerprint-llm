It’s 2023, and I’m deep into a new Terraria playthrough, determined to master the summoner class. But right away, I’m stuck. Where’s a decent starter weapon? I’ve spent hours fishing for armor and chasing bestiary entries, feeling more lost than accomplished. It reminds me of trying to find my footing in a new job or social circle—everyone else seems to have a plan, and I’m just fumbling with the basics. Sometimes, the hardest quests are the ones that teach us patience, not just skill.
