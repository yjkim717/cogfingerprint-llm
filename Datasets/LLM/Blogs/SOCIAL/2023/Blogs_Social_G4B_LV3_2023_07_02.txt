**The Ghosts of My Favorite Facebook Groups**

It’s funny how certain online spaces can feel… intensely nostalgic. I’ve been revisiting some older Facebook groups lately – mostly ones dedicated to obscure hobbies and, oddly enough, specific brands. And I’ve been encountering a recurring theme: the bittersweet ache of things that are gone. 

Recently, a friend shared a post about a discontinued brand of artisanal tea she used to obsess over. It sparked a flood of memories, mirroring that Reddit thread about Costco’s lost treasures. Suddenly, I was thinking about the shared recommendations and inside jokes from those old groups – the collective joy of discovering a great product, a funny meme, or just a friendly voice. 

It makes you wonder if these digital echoes are just ghosts of past communities, reminding us of simpler times and the comfort of shared passions.  Anyone else feel this way about their old online haunts?
