You know that moment when you’re watching *The Shawshank Redemption* for the third time, and you think, “Am I the only one who finds new meaning in Andy’s escape every single viewing?” Of course you’re not—but that’s the whole point.

It’s 2023, and we’re all craving connection. That little phrase isn’t a literal question; it’s a quiet plea for camaraderie. It says, “I feel this deeply—does anyone else?” In a world buzzing with hot takes and unpopular opinions, it’s a humble way to share a piece of your soul without shouting. So next time you type those words, remember: you’re not asking if you’re alone. You’re inviting others to stand with you.
