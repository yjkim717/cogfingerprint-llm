As I navigated my way through the Dallas church scene in 2023, I realized that finding a community that felt like home was key. I'm drawn to non-denominational, evangelical churches that prioritize intergenerational connections and small groups. A nursery-friendly environment is also a must for my little ones! I'm on the hunt for a church that fosters meaningful relationships and a sense of belonging - where can I find that in Dallas?
