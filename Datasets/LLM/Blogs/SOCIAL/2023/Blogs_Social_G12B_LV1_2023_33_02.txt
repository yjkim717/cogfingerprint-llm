## The Relentless Pursuit & My Digital Existential Crisis

Okay, so I’m officially admitting defeat. I’m trying to unlock a trophy in GTA Online – the one that requires surviving a 48-minute bounty. Sounds simple enough, right? Wrong. It's become a surprisingly profound meditation on online persistence.

The thing is, other players *know* you’re a target. They track you. Relentlessly. It’s like a digital pack of wolves, and I'm a low-level, slightly panicked rabbit. I've tried everything: hiding in tunnels, desperately hoarding health packs, even attempting elaborate decoy maneuvers. Nothing works for long. 

It’s made me think about how online spaces often amplify this kind of… persistence. We’re all perpetually visible, perpetually tracked, in some way. It’s a bizarre feeling, being hunted for a digital badge. Maybe this isn't about the trophy anymore. Maybe it's about accepting the inevitable and appreciating the absurdity of it all. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going back to hiding. Wish me luck.
