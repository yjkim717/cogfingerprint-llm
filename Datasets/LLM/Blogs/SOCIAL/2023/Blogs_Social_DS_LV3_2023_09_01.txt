There’s a certain kind of disappointment that comes with watching a familiar place change, and not for the better. For me, that place is the Stripes gas station just off the highway. I stopped by there the other day, and the difference from just a couple of years ago was stark. It felt like running into an old friend who’d lost their spark.

I remember when Stripes was a genuine pit-stop haven. The floors were clean, the coffee was always fresh, and the staff would actually smile and ask about your day. It was a small but reliable comfort, especially on long drives. And the Laredo Taco Company inside? It was a destination in itself—a legit reason to pull over, not just a convenience.

Then 7-Eleven took over in 2021, and the slow decline began. My visit in 2023 cemented it. The first thing I noticed was the grime—sticky floors, smudged windows, and a faint, unwelcoming odor. The person behind the counter was buried in their phone, the interaction reduced to a robotic total and a nod. It was just another transaction.

But the real heartbreaker was the Laredo Taco. What was once a flavorful, generously stuffed breakfast taco now tasted bland and hastily assembled. It wasn’t just food; it was a symbol of how a brand’s soul can be hollowed out by corporate standardization.

It makes me think about how these small, everyday places are woven into the fabric of our communities. They’re not just points on a map; they’re backdrops to our lives. When they lose their character and care, we feel it. It’s a quiet loss of a small, reliable joy. I didn’t just get a subpar taco that morning; I got a lesson in how the pursuit of scale can sometimes erase the very things that made a place special. I drove away wondering if any corner of daily life is safe from the erosion of genuine service.
