**Collecting Moments, Not Just Figures**

I spent a ridiculous amount of time this weekend admiring my new Bandai Exodia figure – part of the Figure Rise Amplified line. It’s seriously impressive how detailed these things are! I was trying to find the *perfect* spot to display it, and ended up staging a little ‘machine nest’ scene with a makeshift Egyptian backdrop. It’s funny how much we crave a beautiful setting for even the smallest treasures, isn’t it? #collection #figures #display 2023
