**The Quiet Shift in My Social Life**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How things change, even when you’re not actively trying to change them? Lately, I’ve noticed a shift in my social circle. Gone are the frantic nights of endless scrolling and comparing myself to highlight reels. 

Instead, I’m gravitating towards deeper conversations – the kind that actually *listen* instead of just waiting for a turn to speak. It feels… calmer. Like I’m building connections rooted in genuine interest, not just fleeting likes. 

Honestly, it’s a welcome change. It reminds me that sometimes, the most rewarding social experiences are the quiet ones, the ones built on shared understanding, much like mastering a challenging piece of music – slow and steady wins the game.
