## The Rollercoaster of Engineering Dreams (and a Pandemic Detour)

Okay, let's be real. Remember that feeling when you first chose your path? For me, it was engineering. Pure, unadulterated passion. I envisioned myself building incredible things, solving complex problems – a true innovator! University felt like the launchpad to that dream.

Then 2020 happened. 

The pandemic hit, and suddenly, “launchpad” felt more like a stalled rocket. Online classes, social isolation, the general uncertainty… it chipped away at that initial enthusiasm. The intricate equations and demanding projects just felt… overwhelming. My motivation plummeted. I started questioning everything. Was engineering really *me*? Did I even *like* it anymore?

It's 2023 now, and I'm realizing that those feelings weren’t a sign of failure, but a really tough, unexpected detour. I've started reconnecting with the core reasons I was drawn to engineering in the first place – the problem-solving aspect, the creativity, the potential to make a real difference. 

It’s not the same fiery passion I felt at the beginning, maybe. But it's something stronger, something tempered by experience. It's a quieter, more resilient motivation. And honestly? That feels pretty good. Anyone else relate to a passion having its ups and downs? Let me know in the comments!
