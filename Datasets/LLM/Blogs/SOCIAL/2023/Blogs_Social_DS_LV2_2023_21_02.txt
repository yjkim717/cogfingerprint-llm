There’s a strange irony in studying engineering during a pandemic. Before 2020, my passion was a roaring 9/10—I lived for the hum of machinery and the smell of solder. Then, lockdowns hit, and my world shrank to a pixelated screen. My passion plummeted to a 3/10. How could you feel the thrill of creation through a Zoom call? The hands-on projects that defined my university program felt distant, replaced by a gnawing career uncertainty.

Now, in 2023, it’s stabilizing around a 5/10. The return to labs and collaborative work has been a balm, a reminder of why I started. I’m cautiously hopeful that stepping into the workforce—getting my hands dirty on real-world problems—will rekindle that original spark. To any student who’s felt their passion waver, you’re not alone. Sometimes, the journey isn’t a straight line, but a circuit waiting to be completed.
