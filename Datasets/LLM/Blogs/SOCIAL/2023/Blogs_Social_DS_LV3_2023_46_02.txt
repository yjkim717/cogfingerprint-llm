There’s a moment in old silent Westerns I can’t get out of my head lately. You know the one: the villain gets shot, and instead of just falling, he throws his legs up in this wild, theatrical flail before collapsing. It’s so over-the-top, so dramatic. My first instinct was to laugh—it felt so unnatural. But then I got it.

In a world without sound or special effects, those actors had to make us feel the finality of death with nothing but their bodies. That exaggerated movement wasn’t just acting; it was communication. It screamed, “This is it. The end.” And in our noisy, hyper-stimulated world of 2023, I wonder if we’ve lost something of that raw, physical honesty.

Think about it. Today, we express so much through screens—emojis, quick texts, perfectly curated photos. But how often do we use our bodies to truly convey what we feel? A friend texts “I’m fine,” but their slumped shoulders in the coffee shop tell a different story. We’ve become masters of subtlety, sometimes to the point of invisibility.

Maybe those silent film actors were onto something. In their exaggerated gestures, there was no room for misunderstanding. There was a vulnerable, almost brave theatricality to it—a willingness to be seen, fully and dramatically, in a moment of high emotion.

So next time you’re trying to connect, maybe put the phone down. Use your hands when you talk. Give that hug a little extra sincerity. Let’s bring back a little of that unapologetic expression—not for the camera, but for each other. Because sometimes, being understood doesn’t need words. It just needs us to show up, fully and visibly, in all our flawed, human glory.
