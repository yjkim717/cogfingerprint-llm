"Will I Ever Really Own Those Podcasts?" 

As I browsed through my favorite podcasting platform in 2023, I stumbled upon a new subscription model that caught my eye. It promised access to exclusive content with a season pass, which sounded great at first. But as I dug deeper, a nagging question arose: what happens to the episodes I've already listened to if I decide to cancel my subscription? Will I still be able to listen to them? The model seemed to imply that my access to past episodes was tied to my ongoing subscription. I thought back to the good old days of RSS feeds, where I could download and keep episodes forever. Now, it seems that 'access' is a more fluid concept. I'm left wondering, am I just renting my favorite podcasts? If so, what's the point of building a library if it can be taken away? I'm not alone in questioning this shift towards subscription-based services â€“ is permanent access a thing of the past?
