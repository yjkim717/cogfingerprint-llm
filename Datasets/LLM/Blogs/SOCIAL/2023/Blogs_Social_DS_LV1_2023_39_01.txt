### The King in the Spacesuit: A Thought on Leadership

It’s funny where you find life lessons. For me, it was watching my son play *Pikmin 4*. He was commanding his little plant-like creatures, and it hit me: why do they follow Captain Olimar so unquestioningly?

The theory goes that he resembles their "king," a biological imperative hardwired into their species for survival. Before he crashed into their world, they had a purpose, a structure. He just fit perfectly into a pre-existing role.

It makes me think about our own social dynamics, especially in our hyper-connected, often leaderless 2023. We’re all looking for a little direction, for someone or something that resonates with a truth we already feel. The best "leaders" I’ve encountered—in community groups or even at work—aren’t necessarily the loudest. They’re the ones who authentically embody a value or a vision we already share, making us feel less like followers and more like a crew that’s found its captain. Maybe we all have an internal "Onion" waiting for the right person to help us bloom.
