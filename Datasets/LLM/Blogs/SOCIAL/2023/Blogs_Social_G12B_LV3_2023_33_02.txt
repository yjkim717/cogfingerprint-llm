## The Grind is Real (and So is That Bounty Timer)

Okay, real talk. Anyone else ever feel completely outmatched in GTA Online? I just spent 48 agonizing minutes trapped in a bounty, desperately trying to survive with a low-level character and basically pocket change. It's a humbling experience, to say the least! It really highlights how the social aspect of the game can be both exhilarating and intensely frustrating when you're not quite ready for it. Anyone got tips for a struggling newbie?
