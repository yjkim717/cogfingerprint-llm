There’s a certain kind of magic in engineering—the kind that makes you feel like you can build anything, solve any problem. Before the pandemic, my passion for it was a solid 9 out of 10. I thrived in university labs, hands deep in circuits and prototypes, feeding off that tangible sense of creation.

Then, 2020 hit, and everything shifted online. My enthusiasm plummeted to a 3. Staring at screens, isolated from collaborative energy and real-world tinkering, made engineering feel abstract and distant. The spark that once drove me dimmed under the weight of virtual lectures and solo projects.

Now, in 2023, I’d rate my passion at a 5—a cautious, hopeful middle ground. University is behind me, and I’m stepping into the professional world, eager to rediscover that hands-on thrill. I’m optimistic that real challenges, teamwork, and seeing my ideas come to life will reignite the fire. Engineering isn’t just a subject to me; it’s a calling, and I’m ready to answer it again.
