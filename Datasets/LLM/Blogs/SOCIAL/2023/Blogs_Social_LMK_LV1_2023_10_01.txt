"Lost in the Code: My Flask App Frustration"

As I sat in a crowded caf√© in 2023, sipping on a lukewarm coffee, I couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration. I was trying to build a simple Flask app, but my code just wouldn't cooperate. The issue? A stubborn ModuleNotFoundError that refused to budge. I'd double-checked my directory structure, made sure the `__init__.py` files were in place, and even tried rearranging my imports. Still, the error persisted.

As I scrolled through online forums, I realized I wasn't alone in this struggle. Many developers had faced similar issues with relative imports in Python. It was a humbling moment, reminding me that even with experience, coding can be a humbling experience. In the end, it was a simple tweak to my import statements that resolved the issue. As I watched my app come to life, I felt a sense of accomplishment - and a newfound appreciation for the quirks of Python.
