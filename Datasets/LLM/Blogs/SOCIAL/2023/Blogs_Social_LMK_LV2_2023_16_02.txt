As I scrolled through Reddit in 2023, I couldn't help but feel frustrated with the constant follower spam from porn bots. It was like they were everywhere! But then I stumbled upon a simple solution - adjusting my account settings. By tweaking a few preferences, I was able to filter out the noise and enjoy a more curated feed. It's a small change, but it's made a big difference. If you're tired of unwanted followers on Reddit, take a minute to review your settings - your sanity will thank you!
