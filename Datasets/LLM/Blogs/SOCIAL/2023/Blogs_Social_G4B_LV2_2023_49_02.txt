**Lost in the Woods (and a Dice Roll)**

Okay, let’s be honest – sometimes it feels like we’re all just wandering around, trying to find our way, right? I was completely swallowed up this weekend by *Baldurs Gate 3*, and I hit a wall. Seriously, the Art Cullagh quest is a beast! I’m currently stuck, desperately scrolling through Reddit for clues, contemplating a second playthrough just to figure it out. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? We crave connection, but sometimes the most rewarding part is getting a little lost, seeking help, and realizing we're not alone in the struggle.  Anyone else battling this particular goblin?
