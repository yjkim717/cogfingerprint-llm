It’s funny how a simple question about power outlets on the Voyager of the Seas can make you pause and reflect. As I packed my USB adapters for my first Royal Caribbean cruise, I realized it wasn’t just about charging devices—it was about staying connected in a world that never stops. In 2023, we’re so tethered to our screens, even while sailing the vast, serene ocean.

I thought about the irony: seeking digital connection amid such natural beauty. Would my method work? Maybe, but the real charge came from unplugging, even briefly, and sharing those sunset selfies later. It’s a small reminder that in our hyper-connected lives, sometimes the best moments are the ones we power down to experience fully.
