Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for that engaging, reflective, and relatable tone. I've aimed for around 123 words and set it in a 2023 context:

## The Weirdness of Online Connection (and How to Protect Your Peace)

Anyone else feel like the internet’s gotten… a little *off* lately? I’ve been on Reddit for years, genuinely enjoying the community, but recently the follower requests have been… unsettling. Like, *really* unsettling. Turns out, a lot of us are getting hit with automated spam – bots pushing, well, let’s just say *unwanted* content.

It’s a stark reminder that even in spaces built for connection, there’s a darker side. Thankfully, Reddit’s made it pretty easy to disable those follower requests. Seriously, go do it! It’s a small step, but reclaiming a little control over your online experience feels surprisingly good.  Just a little tip to protect your digital peace in 2023. You deserve it.

**Notes on this draft and potential adjustments:**

*   **Tone:** I tried to strike a balance between slightly humorous ("a little *off* lately?") and genuinely relatable ("unsettling").
*   **Storytelling:**  It starts with a personal observation to draw the reader in.
*   **Call to Action:**  Includes a clear, practical suggestion (disabling follower requests).
*   **Year Context:** The phrase "in 2023" subtly grounds it in the current year.
*   **Flexibility:**  Feel free to adjust the level of directness regarding the "unwanted content" – you could soften it further or be more explicit depending on your audience.
