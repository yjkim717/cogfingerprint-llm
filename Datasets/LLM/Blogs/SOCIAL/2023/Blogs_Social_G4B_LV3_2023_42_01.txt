**The Little Echoes of the Past**

I was thinking about something the other day – something small, almost invisible – that really struck me as profoundly unsettling. It was hearing a colleague, a brilliant and respected CEO, addressed as “Sir” in a meeting. And it wasn’t a once-off thing. It’s a habit, a tiny, ingrained echo of a past where women’s voices weren’t automatically valued with the same deference.

It made me think about ‘tradition’ – how easily we cling to outdated ways, even when they actively perpetuate ‘inequality.’  We talk about progress in 2023, about shattering glass ceilings, but sometimes those ceilings are still built with unconscious habits like using gendered titles. 

Honestly, it felt… disrespectful. Not in a grand, dramatic way, but in a way that subtly undermines ‘respect’ for the person and their accomplishments.  It’s a reminder that dismantling systemic barriers isn't just about policy; it’s about shifting our everyday language and behavior.  It’s about recognizing that leadership isn’t defined by gender, but by capability. What little echoes are you noticing in your own life?
