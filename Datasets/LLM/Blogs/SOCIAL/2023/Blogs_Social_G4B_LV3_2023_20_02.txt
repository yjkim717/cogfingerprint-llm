**The Quiet Hum of Connection (and Disconnection)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2023 feels…loud.  Scrolling through feeds, bombarded with carefully curated highlight reels, it’s easy to feel a strange kind of melancholy. Like you’re observing life through a frosted window. 

I’ve been finding solace lately in deliberately stepping *away* from the constant digital hum.  Late night walks, punctuated by the glow of streetlights and the rustle of leaves – those night scenes feel like a necessary antidote.  I’ve been revisiting old favorites, books filled with characters wrestling with quiet despair and introspective moments. 

There’s a comfort in recognizing that feeling, that pull towards something deeper.  Maybe it's a yearning for genuine connection, or a reminder that even in a hyper-connected world, finding a strange, solitary place for contemplation is vital.  What’s helping *you* find stillness this year?
