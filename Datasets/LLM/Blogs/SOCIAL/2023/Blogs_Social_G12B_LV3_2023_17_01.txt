>## When the Scroll Feels Darker Than My Mood

Okay, real talk. 2023 has been… a lot. And I’m betting I’m not alone in feeling that. Lately, I've been battling a particularly rough patch of depression, the kind that makes getting out of bed feel like climbing a mountain. It hit me hard, triggered by a messy end to a “situationship” – you know, that limbo zone where it *feels* like a relationship but lacks the definition and commitment? Yeah, that. 

Adding fuel to the fire, life has been throwing a bunch of transitions my way. New job, shifting friendships, the usual quarter-life chaos. It's overwhelming.

Scrolling through social media, seeing everyone's highlight reels, just makes it worse sometimes. It’s a constant reminder of what I *feel* I’m missing. But I'm trying to remember that everyone faces their own struggles, even if they don't post about them. 

Right now, I’m reaching out, hoping to connect with anyone who's navigated similar waters. Has anyone else felt swallowed by anxiety and depression during a period of change? What helped you find your footing and hold onto hope? Send good vibes, and maybe some advice – I could really use it. ❤️
