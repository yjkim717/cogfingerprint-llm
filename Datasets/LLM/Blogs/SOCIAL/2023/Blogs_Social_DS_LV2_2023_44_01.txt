Of all the places to have a minor existential crisis, I didn’t expect it to be in the plush red velvet seat of a California theatre, watching a Figaro sing his heart out. But there I was.

It was a random Thursday. My phone was a vortex of bad news and bickering, and I felt that familiar, low-grade hum of social anxiety—the feeling of being hyper-connected, yet utterly alone in a digital crowd. A friend, sensing my funk, had practically dragged me to Opera San José’s production of *The Barber of Seville*. “It’s Rossini,” she’d said, as if that explained everything.

And as the overture began, a funny thing happened. The buzz of my phone in my pocket faded away, replaced by the live, unamplified swell of the orchestra. There were no screens, no notifications, just several hundred of us breathing the same air, all focused on one single, shared story unfolding on stage.

The production was wonderfully traditional, but it was the performance of Nikola Printz that truly snapped me into the present moment. Here was a performer, pouring an immense, tangible energy into the room. Every gesture, every nuanced vocal run, was a gift offered directly to us, the audience. It was a transaction of pure, unmediated human expression. There was no algorithm curating it for me, no option to pause or scroll past. It was happening *now*, and if I blinked, I’d miss it.

Sitting there, I realized my social life had become largely asynchronous. A text message replied to hours later. A meme shared into the void. A reaction emoji to a friend’s major life event. We’ve built these incredible bridges to reach each other across any distance, but I fear we sometimes forget how to simply sit together in the same room and experience something *together*.

The collective gasp at a high note, the shared, rumbling laughter at a comedic bit, the synchronized silence during a tender aria—this was a different kind of social network. It was analog. It was real-time. It was built on a foundation of collective attention, a resource that feels scarcer than ever in 2023.

Walking out of the theatre, my ears ringing with the final, joyous chords, I felt a sense of calm I hadn’t experienced in weeks. I hadn’t just been entertained; I’d been re-calibrated. The barber of Seville, in his quest to unite lovers, had inadvertently reconnected me to the simple, profound power of a shared space. I didn’t open my phone to check what I’d missed. Instead, I turned to my friend and started talking, face-to-face, about the magic we had just witnessed, together.
