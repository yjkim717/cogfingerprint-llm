**The Awkward Dance of the Second Date Bill**

Okay, real talk. 2023 has been a weird year for dating, hasn’t it? I recently found myself in a slightly sticky situation – a second date, and a lingering feeling of… awkwardness. It started with a clear boundary set early on: “Don’t spend money on me.” 

Now, a second date! My brain immediately went into overdrive, wanting to do *something* nice. But then it hit me – remembering that initial request. It felt wrong to just steam ahead, ignoring her comfort level. 

I ended up asking for permission to treat her to coffee, and it felt *so* much better. A simple “Would you like me to get this?” – a respectful gesture – completely shifted the dynamic. Turns out, good dating etiquette isn’t about grand gestures, but about honoring where someone else is coming from. What about you? Have you navigated similar tricky situations lately?
