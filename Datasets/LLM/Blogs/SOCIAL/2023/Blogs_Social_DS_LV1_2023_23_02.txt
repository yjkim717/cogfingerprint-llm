It’s been six months since top surgery, and at my new job, no one knows I’m trans. On paper, it’s perfect—I’m just another guy. But this “stealth” life is messing with my head. Every “he” and “man” feels like I’ve pulled off some elaborate trick. I thought blending in would bring peace, but instead, I feel like a fraud hiding in plain sight. In 2023, when visibility is celebrated, choosing invisibility leaves me wondering: am I protecting myself, or just erasing a part of who I am?
