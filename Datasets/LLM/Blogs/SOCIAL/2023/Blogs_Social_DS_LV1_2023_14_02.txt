### The Unspoken Marathon of a "Bad Period"

It’s 2023, and we’re supposed to be talking about everything, right? But here I am, five months into a marathon I never signed up for, feeling completely alone.

My PCOS has always made my cycle unpredictable, but this is different. This is a constant, heavy flow that dictates my life. I’m talking about severe cramping that makes me miss work meetings, and clots that are frankly terrifying. My bathroom looks like a crime scene, and my energy is just… gone.

I finally got a prescription for Ritalin to help with my focus, but how can I focus when my own body is staging a rebellion? I’m stuck in this awful loop: Is this just my new normal, or is this a five-alarm fire? When do you stop downplaying the pain and start demanding answers?

I’m sharing this because I know I can’t be the only one. If you’re also navigating this silent, exhausting struggle, you’re not alone. And we deserve to be heard.
