**Lost in the Scroll, Found in a Connection**

Itâ€™s funny, isnâ€™t it? How we spend so much time scrolling, chasing likes and comments â€“ feeling this strange pressure to *be* seen.  I was just staring at a picture of a green, striped dragonfly in Florida (someoneâ€™s bug sighting!), and it made me pause.  Sometimes, the most rewarding connection isnâ€™t about broadcasting, but about noticing the beauty in a shared moment, like that little insectâ€™s iridescent wings. ðŸ’š #socialreflection #findingconnection 2023
