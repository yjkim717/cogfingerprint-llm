**The Ghost of a Touch**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a single touch, a shared glance from years ago, can suddenly shimmer back into focus. I was scrolling through Instagram the other day – you know how it is – and a photo popped up of an old friend from college. And for a split second, a really strange feeling washed over me. Not sadness, exactly, but this…nostalgia for a desire I hadn’t really acknowledged. 

It’s bizarre, especially when you’re deeply invested in a relationship now. You *know* it’s different, that the connection with your partner is built on something far deeper – intimacy, trust, shared history. But the ghost of a touch, the echo of a past encounter, can still trigger a surprising, unsettling awareness. It’s a reminder that human connection is messy, and sometimes, the past holds a pull we don't quite understand.
