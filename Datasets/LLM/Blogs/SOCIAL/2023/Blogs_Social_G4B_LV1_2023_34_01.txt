**Chasing the Light (Without the Drama)**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve been obsessed with the *idea* of platinum blonde. Like, seriously scrolling through Pinterest, drooling over those ethereal, icy shades. But, you know me – I’m trying to be a little kinder to my hair these days. 

Recently, a friend was talking about achieving a level 6.5 blonde, and it sparked something. It's not about a drastic, damaging transformation, but a slow, careful build. I'm chatting with my stylist about gentler lightening techniques, focusing on minimizing breakage and maximizing that cool, ashy tone – aiming for a really sophisticated, ‘platinum-adjacent’ look. 

Social media can make you feel like you *need* to chase the trend, but honestly, the most beautiful changes are the ones that feel good for *you*.  It’s about respecting your hair’s journey, right? ✨ #hairgoals #slowandsteady #hairtransformation
