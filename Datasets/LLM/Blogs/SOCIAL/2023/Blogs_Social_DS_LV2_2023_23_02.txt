Walking into the office post-top surgery, I felt a new kind of quiet. No one knew my history, and part of me celebrated that hard-won anonymity. But another part whispered: you’re hiding. Even in 2023, with more visibility than ever, I grappled with feeling like a fraud in my own skin—like I’d built this version of myself on a secret. It’s a strange tension, knowing your truth internally while navigating a world that only sees the surface. I’m learning that being stealth doesn’t erase my journey; it just means I’m choosing, for now, where my story gets told.
