**The Tightrope of Online Feedback**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Scrolling through social media and seeing someone try to “fix” a problem, especially when *they’re* part of the group that created it. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about this, particularly when it comes to documenting tricky situations – like, say, feedback on a TFM (that’s a long acronym, I know!). 

There's a real tension there. Wanting to improve, absolutely. But if the person doing the documenting also has a stake in the outcome, how do you get truly honest scrutiny? It feels a bit like shifting the goalposts – suddenly, what was unacceptable is now “fixable” because someone’s stepped in to refine it. 

I'm battling a healthy dose of skepticism myself. It’s easy to get caught up in the desire for consensus, but sometimes, a critical eye – even if it’s uncomfortable – is exactly what’s needed.  What are your thoughts on this? #socialmedia #feedback #community

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps explore a different angle based on these keywords?
