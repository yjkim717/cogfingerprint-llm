**The Weight of Silence (and a Really Bad Argument)**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve been noticing a tension simmering beneath the surface of my own family life, and it’s honestly mirroring something I read about online – a high school senior feeling completely crushed. It hit a little too close to home. 

My brother – a brilliant, usually easygoing guy – has been pulling all-nighters, skipping classes, and just… shutting down.  It finally exploded last week in a really messy argument with my parents, fueled by frustration and a whole lot of unspoken pressure. 

Honestly, it was terrifying to witness.  It reminded me how quickly things can spiral when people bottle up their struggles.  I found myself desperately seeking advice – not just for *him*, but for myself too.  It’s easy to get lost in the race to “do” everything, but what happens when we forget to just *be*?  

Anyone else experiencing this feeling of silent pressure? Let’s talk about it. #familyconflict #highschool #angermanagement
