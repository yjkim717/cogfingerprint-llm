### The Unseen Calendar

It’s 2023, and my life is scheduled in clots. Not in meetings or social plans, but by the relentless, heavy bleeding that has been my constant companion for five straight months. This is the hidden reality of my PCOS that no one talks about.

I was told it was "just a bad period." But this? This is a flood. It’s planning my day around proximity to a bathroom, canciting on friends last minute, and the exhausting, severe pain that makes my pelvis feel like a warzone. The passing of large, dark clots is a grotesque reminder that my body feels utterly out of my control.

I’m not just tired; I’m depleted. The chronic pelvic pain is a low, constant hum of distress beneath the sharper, crippling waves. I’m putting on a brave face for the world, but inside, I’m screaming for someone to see this invisible struggle and to understand that this isn't normal. This is a silent battle, and I am so, so tired of fighting it alone.
