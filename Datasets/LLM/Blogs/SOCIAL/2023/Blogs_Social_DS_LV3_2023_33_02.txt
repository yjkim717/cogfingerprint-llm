There I was, hunkered down in some grimy GTA Online alleyway, heart pounding as the 48-minute bounty timer slowly ticked down. My virtual life had become a cycle of hiding, being found, and respawning. As a low-level player, my resources were slim, making me an easy trophy for seasoned hunters. It felt strangely reflective of 2023's social climateâ€”constantly feeling pursued, trying to survive in a world where everyone else seems better equipped. Sometimes, just staying off the radar is the real victory.
