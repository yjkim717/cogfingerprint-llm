### Remembering When the Pump Was Polished

I pulled into my local Stripes the other day, the one over on 5th Street. It used to be my go-to spot. You know the one—the one that always had that gleaming floor and the guy behind the counter who’d give a genuine nod when you walked in. This time, I had to sidestep a sticky puddle of spilled soda to get to the coffee machine, and the only greeting I got was the weary sigh of the overworked cashier.

It got me thinking. This wasn't just a bad day; it feels like a new normal ever since the 7-11 signs started going up. It’s more than just a corporate acquisition; it’s the slow erosion of a local character. I remember when this place was the heart of the early morning rush. The Laredo Taco counter wasn't just a service island; it was a social hub where you’d chat with the same cook who remembered you liked extra salsa. The floors were so clean you could almost see your reflection, a point of pride that seemed to say, "We care that you're here."

Now, the trash cans are perpetually overflowing, and that sense of community has been replaced by a sterile, corporate efficiency. It’s a small thing, I know. In the grand scheme of 2023’s chaos, a dirty gas station is a minor grievance. But it’s a microcosm of something bigger, isn’t it? It’s about what we lose when local flavor gets swallowed by a giant. The soul of a place isn't in its branding; it's in the polished pump, the familiar face, and the simple dignity of a clean floor. I’d pay an extra ten cents a gallon to get that feeling back.
