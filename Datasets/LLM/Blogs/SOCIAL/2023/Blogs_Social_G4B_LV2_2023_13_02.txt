**The Weight of “What If?”**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple word – *pregnancy* – can suddenly feel like the biggest, most complicated question mark. I’ve been talking to a friend lately who’s facing carrier screening – genetic testing to see if she carries genes for certain disorders. 

She’s battling a hefty dose of health anxiety, and the thought of those potential results is honestly terrifying. It’s not about *if* something could go wrong, but the *what if* that swirls around in her head.  It’s a really vulnerable space to be in, and I realized how easy it is to get caught up in worrying about things outside of our control.  Sending her all the strength! ❤️ #pregnancysupport #genetictesting #healthanxiety
