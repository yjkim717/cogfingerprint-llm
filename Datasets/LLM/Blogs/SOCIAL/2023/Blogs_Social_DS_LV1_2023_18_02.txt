It’s funny how we build invisible armor in our daily lives—not the kind from Cyberpunk Red or D&D, but the emotional kind. In 2023, I realized my own "security guard" instincts were kicking in whenever conversations turned tense online. I’d brace for conflict, just like in a game’s fighting system. But what if we dropped the armor? What if, instead of defending, we just listened? Maybe the real hack isn’t tougher stats, but softer hearts.
