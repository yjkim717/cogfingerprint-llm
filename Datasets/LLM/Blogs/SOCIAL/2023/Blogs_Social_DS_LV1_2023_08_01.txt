It’s funny—in 2023, I noticed Steam’s secondary download options: computer or phone. It made me reflect on how we’re always choosing between screens, yet craving real connection. We toggle between devices, but the best moments happen offline, face-to-face. Maybe that little download button is a reminder to power down and just be present with each other.
