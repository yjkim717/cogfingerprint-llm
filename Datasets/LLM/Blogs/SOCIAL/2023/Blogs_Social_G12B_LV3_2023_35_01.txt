## The Rust Never Sleeps (and Neither Does a Brother's Plea!)

Okay, so my brother's in a pickle. His beloved, well-loved (read: *very* old) Toyota pickup is fighting back – specifically, its bolts are staging a full-blown rust rebellion. Stripped heads, the works. He’s not keen on resorting to a cutting torch, understandably. 

It got me thinking about those stubborn battles we face, doesn’t it? Sometimes, even the most familiar things require a little extra effort, a little ingenuity, to overcome. Reddit’s mechanic community is stepping up, and I’m hoping they save the day!
