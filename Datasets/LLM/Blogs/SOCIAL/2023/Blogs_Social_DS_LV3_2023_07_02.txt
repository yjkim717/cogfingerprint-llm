There’s something bittersweet about nostalgia, isn’t there? I was scrolling through social media the other day when a post about discontinued Costco items stopped me in my tracks. Suddenly, I was back in my 2023 lunch routine, savoring that tangy Mediterranean pasta salad and those rich Balderson cheddar slices. They weren’t just products—they were little daily comforts that made hectic weeks feel manageable.

Now, they’re gone, and I’m left wondering what other treasures have quietly disappeared from those warehouse shelves. It’s funny how something as simple as a pasta salad can anchor so many memories. What’s your favorite discontinued item? Let’s share our stories—because sometimes, it’s the small losses that remind us how much the little things matter.
