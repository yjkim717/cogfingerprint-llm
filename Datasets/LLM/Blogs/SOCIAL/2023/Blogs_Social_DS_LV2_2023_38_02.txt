It’s 2023, and I’ve noticed something strange about our political conversations lately. We throw around words like “capitalism” and “socialism” as if they’re weapons, but I’m not sure we even agree on what they mean. One person’s socialism is another’s “common-sense regulation,” while capitalism can mean anything from innovation to greed, depending on who you ask.

I caught myself in one of these debates recently, and halfway through, I realized we were just talking past each other. We were so passionate, yet our foundations were shaky. It felt like trying to build a house on sand.

Maybe before we can fix the world, we need to fix our language. What if we paused, defined our terms, and truly listened? Perhaps then, our disagreements could become conversations—and those conversations might actually lead somewhere.
