## That Pink Dress… and a Collective Memory

Doesn't it happen to you? A snippet of a scene, vivid yet nameless, swirls in your mind. I recently saw a Reddit thread – someone desperately trying to identify a movie with a striking scene: a Black woman in a hot pink dress confronting a white woman in a restaurant. It’s fascinating how a shared cultural experience, even a small one, can spark such a search. It’s a reminder that memories are often communal, and the internet can be a powerful tool for unlocking them.
