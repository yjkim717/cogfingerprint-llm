The text message from my brother glowed on my phone screen, a stark threat in the middle of my skipped-school Tuesday. My heart hammered against my ribs. It was the same old script: another fight, another slammed door, another eruption in our house. This time, though, I’d snapped. After years of the constant tension, I’d finally told my dad to go to hell.

Sitting alone in the park, the adrenaline faded, leaving a hollow ache. Was I the problem? Had I crossed a line from standing up for myself into becoming part of the very conflict I hated? In 2023, we’re told to set boundaries and speak our truth, but what happens when that truth feels ugly and sharp? The threat of violence from my brother felt real, but the quiet threat of our family completely fracturing felt even heavier. I was a high school senior staring into an abyss, wondering if there was any way back to solid ground.
