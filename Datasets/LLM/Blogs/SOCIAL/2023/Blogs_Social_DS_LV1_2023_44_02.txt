It’s 2023, and I’m still thinking about Opera San Jose’s bold choice: setting *The Marriage of Figaro* in colonial India. By shifting the era, they didn't just create a visual spectacle—they sharpened the story’s critique of power and class. It made me reflect: art doesn't need to be traditional to feel true. Sometimes, the most resonant stories are the ones reimagined for our time.
