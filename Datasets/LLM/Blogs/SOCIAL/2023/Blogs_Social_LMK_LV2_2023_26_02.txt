"Gym Anxiety: Is it Dehydration or Am I Coming Down with Something?" I'd been on Accutane for a few months, and suddenly, my post-gym anxiety spiked. Was it the medication or was I getting sick? As I sweated it out on the treadmill, I couldn't shake off the feeling of dread. Dehydration was a real concern, but what if it was the flu? I took a deep breath and reminded myself to drink more water. As I navigated this new normal, I realized it's okay to slow down and prioritize my health - anxiety and all.
