Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone and a 2023 context.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: The Ghost of a Spark – And Why Some Memories Are Best Kept That Way**

It’s weird, isn’t it, how certain memories just…linger? I was thinking about someone the other day – a brief, purely physical connection from a couple of years back. A “hookup,” if we’re being honest. Nothing serious, definitely not a contender for "relationship" material, more of a "friends with benefits" situation that fizzled out quickly.

And yet, a flash of the attraction, the sheer *chemistry*, popped into my head. It wasn’t a longing, not really. More like a nostalgic appreciation for a moment of uncomplicated physical connection. It threw me for a loop, especially considering how content I am now.

It made me realize that acknowledging those past sparks, those fleeting moments of intensity, doesn’t diminish what I have *now*. It just shows that humans are complex, capable of feeling multiple things at once. Some memories are best kept as just that – memories. A reminder of a spark, not a call to action.

**Notes on this draft and potential adjustments:**

*   **Relatability:** I tried to use language that feels like a genuine, personal reflection.
*   **Tone:** Conversational, honest, and slightly wistful.
*   **2023 Context:**  The language and the focus on contentment in a current relationship feel relevant to modern relationship dynamics.
*   **Emotional Conflict:** The internal conflict is subtle – the surprise of the memory and the slight questioning it provokes, but ultimately the decision to let it be.



Let me know if you'd like me to revise it, explore a different angle, or adjust the length/tone!
