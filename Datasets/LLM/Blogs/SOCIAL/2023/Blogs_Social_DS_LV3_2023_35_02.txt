Of all the things I’d built up in my head, the Mirena IUD was a monster. For years, it lived in my mind not as a tiny, T-shaped piece of plastic, but as a specter of ultimate pain. My social media feeds and anonymous online forums were a curated gallery of horror stories: tales of fainting, of searing agony, of procedures gone wrong. I’d scroll, my heart pounding, each story layering another brick onto the wall of fear I’d constructed. It was a decision I’d put off for nearly a decade, letting the terrifying, collective voice of the internet dictate my healthcare. My body, it seemed, was a battleground I was too scared to even approach.

You see, the backdrop to this fear was a pain I knew intimately. I have endometriosis. For me, and for millions of others, pain isn't an occasional visitor; it's a permanent, unwelcome tenant. My calendar wasn't marked by birthdays or holidays, but by the cyclical, brutal cramping that would leave me curled on the bathroom floor, bargaining with a universe that seemed to have wired me incorrectly. This pain was a thief. It stole days from my work, laughter from my friendships, and spontaneity from my life. A simple coffee date could be derailed by a sudden, gripping ache. The constant, low-grade hum of discomfort was the soundtrack to my existence. In 2023, a year that promised a "return to normal," my normal was still defined by this internal chaos.

The turning point came on a Tuesday in October. I was in the middle of a work video call, trying to look engaged while a familiar, deep cramp began to twist its way through my lower abdomen. My smile was a mask, my contributions to the conversation a robotic performance. In that moment, I had a stark realization: I was more afraid of a ten-minute procedure than I was of a lifetime of this. The potential, temporary pain of insertion couldn't possibly outweigh the guaranteed, grinding agony I faced every single month. The monster under the bed was less frightening than the one already in the room.

So, I booked the appointment. The weeks leading up to it were a masterclass in anxiety. I consumed every "positive IUD experience" video I could find, a desperate attempt to counterbalance the years of horror. I talked to my doctor, a wonderfully patient woman who didn't dismiss my fears but talked me through every step. "It’s different for everyone," she said, "but we will go at your pace." Her reassurance was a life raft.

The day arrived. The clinic was calm, bathed in soft, artificial light. As I lay on the examination table, the paper crinkling beneath me with every nervous shift, I focused on my breathing. My doctor talked me through each step. "Little pinch now," she said. And yes, there was a pinch. A sharp, intense cramp that made me gasp and grip the table. It was a "whoa" moment, a solid 8 on my personal pain scale. But then, something incredible happened. It started to fade. Within a minute, the sharp peak had subsided into a dull, period-like ache.

And that was it.

I remember lying there, waiting for the other shoe to drop, for the searing, life-altering pain I’d been promised by
