As I rummaged through my closet, I stumbled upon a few sports bras and some gently used clothing that I knew my homeless friend could really use. Seeing them struggle to get by every day breaks my heart, and I wanted to do something to help. But as I looked through my donations, I realized that it's not just about the physical items - it's about showing up for someone who feels invisible. My friend is closeted trans, and I know how hard it can be to navigate the world without support. So, I put together a care package with some thoughtful touches, like a warm hat and a few toiletries. It's a small act, but it felt like a big step towards being a better ally. As I handed them the bag, I knew that this was just the start of a bigger conversation about how to support trans folks in our community, and I'm committed to learning more.
