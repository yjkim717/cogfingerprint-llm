**The Day the World Stopped**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2023 has felt like a lot sometimes, hasn’t it? Like everyone’s running on fumes. I saw something last week that just…stopped me cold. A mom at my son’s preschool had a full-blown meltdown over a simple spelling correction. Publicly. 

It wasn’t some grand injustice, just a little ‘b’ instead of a ‘B’ in a worksheet. And the reaction? Stunning. It really made me pause and wonder about our collective patience, and maybe even our faith in humanity. 

I think we’re all carrying so much – stress, exhaustion, the weight of the world – and sometimes, it just spills over. It’s a reminder that we’re *all* just trying to navigate this messy, beautiful thing called life.  It’s okay to stumble. It’s okay to need a moment.  Let’s be a little kinder to ourselves, and each other.
