Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone and fitting the 2023 context. I've included a title suggestion too.

**Title: "Sir, Yes Sir? Why Even Fictional Female Leaders Still Face a Weird Hangup"**

Okay, I need to rant for a minute. I was rewatching *Star Trek: The Next Generation* the other day, and it struck me – even in a future supposedly beyond our current societal norms, characters sometimes address Captain Picard's first officer, Counselor Troi, as "Sir." *Sir*. 

It’s a small thing, right? But it’s not. It's a lingering echo of centuries where women weren't considered capable of authority, where leadership was automatically assumed to be a male domain. I saw a similar thing in *Castle* too, and it got me thinking.

Even in our stories, we sometimes perpetuate this ingrained habit. It’s not malicious, I don’t think. It’s just…automatic. But consciously addressing women in positions of power with respect – using "Ma'am," or even just their title – feels like a small but vital step towards dismantling those old, ingrained biases. It’s 2023, people. Let's get it right, even in our fictional worlds.

**Notes on the draft and potential adjustments:**

*   **Relatability:** I tried to start with a relatable "rant" hook and use everyday language.
*   **Storytelling:** I used specific examples (*Star Trek*, *Castle*) to illustrate the point.
*   **Reflectiveness:** The post includes a moment of introspection ("It’s not malicious, I don’t think...") and a call to action.
*   **2023 Context:** The closing line ("It’s 2023, people...") grounds the piece in the present.
*   **Word Count:** It's close to your requested length.
