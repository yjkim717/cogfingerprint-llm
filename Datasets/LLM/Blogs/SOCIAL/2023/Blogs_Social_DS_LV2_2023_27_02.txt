Remember that second date I was nervous about? Well, we went for coffee—simple, low-pressure. When the bill came, I smiled and said gently, “I’d love to treat you, but I also want to respect how you feel about this.”

She looked relieved. “Thank you for remembering,” she said, pulling out her card. “How about we split it?”

That small moment taught me so much. It wasn’t about the money; it was about listening and valuing her comfort. Real connection blossoms when we honor each other’s boundaries, making space for trust to grow naturally.
