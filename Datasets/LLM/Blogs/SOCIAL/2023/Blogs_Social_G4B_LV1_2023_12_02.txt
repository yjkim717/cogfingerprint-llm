**The Filtered Reality**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Scrolling through Instagram in 2023, everyone looks *perfect*. But lately, I’ve been questioning how much of that is real. I was testing out a new phone – the Oppo X3 Lite – and the front camera was just…awful. Grainy, blurry, like looking through a dirty window. It made me think about how we curate our online lives, and how easily we rely on filters to smooth out the imperfections. Maybe the goal shouldn’t be flawless, but authentic.
