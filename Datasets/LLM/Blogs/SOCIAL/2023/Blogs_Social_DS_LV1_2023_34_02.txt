### The Care Package That Taught Me More Than I Gave

It started with a sports bra and a pair of leggings. My friend, who I’ll call Alex, had been couch-surfing for months. Life on the streets is brutal for anyone, but for Alex, a closeted trans person, it was a special kind of hell. The wrong clothes weren't just a discomfort; they were a layer of dysphoria on top of survival.

So, when I put together a care package last week, I didn't just throw in socks and granola bars. I carefully chose that sports bra—something that could offer both comfort and a sense of gender affirmation. The leggings were a dark, practical color. It felt like such a small gesture, but Alex’s text later said it all: “You see me.”

In 2023, we talk a lot about allyship. I’ve learned it’s not about grand speeches. It’s in the quiet, practical acts of love. It’s about asking, “What do you need to feel safe and like yourself today?” Sometimes, support isn’t a rainbow flag; it’s a simple, black sports bra that says, “I’m here, and you are who you say you are.”
