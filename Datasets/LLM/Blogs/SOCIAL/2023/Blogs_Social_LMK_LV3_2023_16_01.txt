"I'm Not Giving Up on Overwatch 2... Yet." As I reflect on my gaming experience in 2023, I'm reminded of the highs and lows of playing Overwatch 2. While I'm drawn to its fast-paced action and innovative gameplay, the constant balance changes and toxic community are taking a toll. I've lost count of how many times a new patch has nerfed my favorite hero or a teammate's toxic behavior has ruined a match. I'm torn between loving the game and frustration with its flaws. Will I stick around or move on? Only time will tell.
