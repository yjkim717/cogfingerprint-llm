It’s 2023, and I keep thinking about that poll: if you could have one everyday superpower, would it be instant hygiene or controlling bodily functions? Honestly, I’d pick the hygiene one—imagine never worrying about bad breath or messy hair on a video call. But it got me reflecting: in a world so focused on curated perfection, maybe the real superpower is accepting our human messiness. We’re all just trying to connect, even with morning breath and bedhead. Maybe that’s the social glue we’re missing.
