Moving to Dallas last year, I craved more than just Sunday sermons—I wanted a church that felt like family. After visiting countless spots, I found one where retirees and young parents share coffee, and the nursery buzzes with laughter while small groups dive deep into life’s messy questions. It’s a non-denominational space where generations weave together, reminding me that faith isn’t a solo journey, but a tapestry of shared stories.
