As a queer individual, I used to dread scrolling through Twitter, overwhelmed by the constant stream of politics and online negativity. In 2023, I'm not alone in seeking a digital haven. I've started curating my online spaces, muting toxic accounts, and exploring alternative platforms. It's been liberating to reclaim my social media experience, focusing on connections that uplift rather than drain me.
