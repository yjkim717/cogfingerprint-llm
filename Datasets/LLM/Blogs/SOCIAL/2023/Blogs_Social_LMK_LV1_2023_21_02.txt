"Finding My Way Back to Engineering" 

I'll be the first to admit, my passion for engineering was a rollercoaster ride throughout my university years. When the pandemic lockdown hit, I found myself questioning my decision to pursue engineering. The lack of hands-on experience and isolation from my peers took a toll on my motivation. I felt like I was just going through the motions, completing assignments without any real sense of purpose. But everything changed when I was able to return to campus and dive back into hands-on projects. Working on real-world problems with my team reignited the spark that had driven me to study engineering in the first place. As I look back, I realize that it's okay to have doubts, but it's the experiences that make or break our passion. In 2023, I'm grateful for the journey that has made me a more resilient and dedicated engineering student.
