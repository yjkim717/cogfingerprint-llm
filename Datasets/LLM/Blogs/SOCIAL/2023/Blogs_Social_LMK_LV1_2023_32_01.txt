As I navigated the complex world of mental health in 2023, I couldn't help but reflect on my own journey. Growing up, I always felt like something was off, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. It wasn't until I experienced a series of overwhelming episodes that I realized I needed to seek help. The road to getting diagnosed with depression was not an easy one - it took multiple visits to my primary care physician, countless questionnaires, and a willingness to confront the childhood trauma that had been lurking beneath the surface. The stigma surrounding mental health still lingers, but I'm grateful to be living in a time where resources are more accessible than ever. If you're struggling, know that you're not alone. Reaching out for support is the first step towards healing, and it's okay to take that step.
