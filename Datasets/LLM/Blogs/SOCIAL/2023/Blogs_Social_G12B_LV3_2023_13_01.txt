## Finding Our People in Dallas: A Church Search

So, we’ve landed in Dallas! It’s exciting, a little overwhelming, and the biggest piece of settling in? Finding our church home. We’re really craving a place where our young kids feel welcomed and can grow alongside all ages – that intergenerational vibe is key. 

Honestly, building community is everything, especially when you're new. We’re hoping for a church with thriving small groups, a place where real connection happens. We’re leaning towards an evangelical or Baptist theological perspective, but above all, we’re searching for a genuine, welcoming spirit. Any Dallas church recommendations from folks who feel the same? Send them our way – we’d love to hear!
