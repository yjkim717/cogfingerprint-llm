Last night at the lanes in West Houston, I realized something: relying on house balls is like trying to build a friendship on small talk—it’s inconsistent and lacks depth. Every throw felt like a gamble. So, I’m on a mission in 2023 to find my own used or budget ball, something that fits just right. It’s not just about bowling better; it’s about investing in a hobby that truly connects me to the game and the community.
