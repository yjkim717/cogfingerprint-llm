It’s 2023, and I’ve been thinking a lot about the superpowers we already have—the small, everyday ones. Like the way a friend’s text can teleport me out of a bad mood, or how a shared laugh instantly cleanses the stress of the day. We hold this quiet magic in our connections, the ability to lift each other up and grow through kindness. Maybe we don’t need teleportation when we have the power to be there for one another, in heart and spirit.
