**The Ghosts in My Follower Count**

It’s weird, right? How easily we get caught up in numbers on social media. I spent a good chunk of 2023 obsessing over my Reddit follower count, convinced a sudden drop meant I was losing relevance. Turns out, a lot of it was just…bots.  Spam accounts, following and unfollowing in a relentless cycle. 

It really made me think about what *actually* matters.  Scrolling through a curated feed, chasing vanity metrics – it felt so hollow.  I’ve since tightened up my account settings and realized genuine engagement is a far better measure of connection than a big, ghost-populated follower list.
