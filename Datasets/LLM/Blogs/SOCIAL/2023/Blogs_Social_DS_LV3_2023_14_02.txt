It’s 2023, and I’m sitting here wondering how many other young women feel like their bodies are working against them. At 26, I’ve got PCOS, ADHD, and Visual Snow Syndrome—three conditions that often feel like they’re in a constant, exhausting tug-of-war. But nothing prepared me for this.

Since October, I’ve been dealing with relentless heavy bleeding and pain that’s taken over my life. Simple things—like focusing on work or even just leaving the house—have become monumental tasks. My ADHD meds, including Ritalin, help me stay on track mentally, but what good is mental clarity when your body is screaming in protest?

I’m sharing this because I know I’m not alone. So many of us are navigating invisible battles, trying to balance health, work, and just being human. My biggest concern right now isn’t just the physical toll—it’s the emotional weight of not knowing how worried I should be. If you’re reading this and nodding along, I see you. Let’s remind each other that it’s okay to ask for help, and it’s okay to demand answers when something doesn’t feel right.
