"Flailing Legs and Forgotten Acting Techniques: A Trip Down Memory Lane"

As I was scrolling through some old silent films on YouTube the other day, I stumbled upon a scene that left me giggling. A cowboy, shot by his nemesis, falls to the ground - and his legs just won't stop flailing. It got me thinking, why did actors in silent cinema, particularly in westerns, react this way to death scenes? Was it a holdover from theatrical acting techniques, where over-the-top gestures were the norm? Or was it simply a case of actors not knowing how to "die" convincingly on camera? Whatever the reason, it's a quirk that's become endearing to modern audiences. As we continue to evolve in our filmmaking techniques, it's nice to look back and appreciate the humor and charm of early cinema. In 2023, we're still laughing at the mistakes of the past - and learning from them.
