## The Quiet Battle: When Your Neighbor's Dog Steals Your Sleep (and Your Sanity)

It's 2023, and we’re all chasing that elusive eight hours. But what happens when something *outside* your control is sabotaging your sleep? Lately, I've been wrestling with exactly that – the relentless barking of my neighbor's dog. 

It started subtly, a few barks here and there. Now? It's a nightly symphony of woofs that leaves me exhausted and frayed. I’ve tried everything – earplugs, white noise, even politely chatting with my neighbor. Nothing seems to fully silence the disruption. 

It's more than just the lack of sleep; it's the simmering frustration, the feeling of losing control over my own home. Anyone else battling similar noise pollution woes? I’m genuinely seeking sleep solutions and a little solidarity in this quiet battle.
