The Importance of Documenting Problematic Content in 2023

As I scroll through my social media feeds, I'm constantly reminded of the importance of holding individuals accountable for their online actions. In today's digital age, it's easy for people to curate a perfect online persona, hiding their true selves behind a veil of carefully crafted posts and stories. But what happens when their true nature is revealed? That's where documentation comes in. By watching, documenting, and sharing problematic content, we can prevent individuals from changing their narrative and escaping accountability. This isn't about shaming or canceling; it's about creating a paper trail that showcases their true character. As we navigate online discourse, it's crucial that we prioritize community accountability and transparency. By doing so, we can create a safer, more honest online environment where individuals are held to a higher standard.
