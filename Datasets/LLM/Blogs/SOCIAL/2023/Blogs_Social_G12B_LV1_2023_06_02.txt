## Nostalgia & Neon: Building Exodia

Something about building this Figure Rise Amplified Exodia kit just hit different. Bandai really nailed the Egyptian aesthetic, and seeing it alongside the actual Exodia card…pure childhood joy. It’s wild how a plastic model can unlock such a flood of 2003 memories. Anyone else finding comfort in revisiting those old passions? #FigureRiseAmplified #YuGiOh #Nostalgia
