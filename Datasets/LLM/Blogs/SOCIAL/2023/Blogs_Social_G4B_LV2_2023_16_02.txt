**The Quiet Revolt Against the Bots**

Let’s be honest, scrolling through social media in 2023 can feel a little… overwhelming, right? It’s a constant barrage of perfectly filtered lives and, increasingly, a tidal wave of follower bots. I’ve been battling them myself – those accounts suddenly boasting hundreds (or thousands!) of followers with no real engagement. 

It’s easy to feel like you’re losing control. That’s why I recently took a deep breath and dove into my account settings, specifically to disable those pesky follower requests. Small steps, but it feels like a quiet revolt against the spam.  What about you? How are you reclaiming your space online? #socialmedia #onlineharassment #followerbots

Would you like me to refine this further, or perhaps adjust the tone or length?
