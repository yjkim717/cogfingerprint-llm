## The Ghosts of Costco Past: Anyone Else Miss These?

Okay, I need to confess something. I was scrolling through Reddit the other day and stumbled upon a thread about discontinued Costco Canada items, and suddenly I was *hit* with a wave of nostalgia. Someone was mourning the loss of the Mediterranean Pasta Salad – that tangy, herby, perfectly portioned goodness – and it unlocked a serious memory for me.

I’m talking about the 1-year aged Balderson cheddar. Seriously, *where* did it go? It was the perfect cheese for snacking, for grilled cheese, for… well, everything! It’s strange how a grocery store item can become so intertwined with memories. Anyone else feel like Costco rotates through a graveyard of amazing things? Let’s reminisce – what Costco treasures have you lost along the way? Share your memories in the comments!
