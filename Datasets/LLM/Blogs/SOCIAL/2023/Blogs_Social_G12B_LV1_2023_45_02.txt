## The Quest for Midnight Charging on the High Seas

Okay, so I’m officially a cruise newbie. My first time sailing with Royal Caribbean – the *Voyager of the Seas*, no less! – and I’m already wrestling with a surprisingly modern problem: charging my phone and tablet in bed. 

See, I'm used to Carnival cruises where they have these amazing pass-through adapters built into the walls near the bed. Game-changer! You plug your adapter in, run the cord under the bedspread, and boom – convenient nighttime charging. Pure bliss.

I assumed Royal Caribbean would be the same. I was wrong. 

Now, I’m researching pass-through adapters online, feeling like I’m solving a particularly niche puzzle. It's funny, isn’t it? We're floating in the middle of the ocean, enjoying incredible views and activities, but my biggest stressor is ensuring my Instagram stays powered up. 2023, folks. Even on a cruise, we're tethered to our devices. Wish me luck in my quest for a good night’s charge!
