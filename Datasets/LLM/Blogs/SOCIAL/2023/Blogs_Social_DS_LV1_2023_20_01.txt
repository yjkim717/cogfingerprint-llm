It’s 2023, and I’ve officially entered the era of the Great Neighborly Divide. My next-door neighbor’s dog is a sweetheart, I’m sure, but its 3 a.m. barking sessions feel like a personal vendetta against my REM cycle.

I’ve tried it all: squishy earplugs that make my own heartbeat sound like a drum solo, a white noise machine that just added a new layer of sound, and noise-cancelling headphones that left me tangled in cords. The irony isn’t lost on me—we’re more digitally connected than ever, yet I feel completely isolated by this very analog problem. It’s a strange, modern kind of loneliness, lying awake and wondering if anyone else is out there, silently battling the same barking beast.
