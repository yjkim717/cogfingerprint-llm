"Breaking the Silence: My Journey with PCOS and Menstrual Mayhem"

As I sit here in 2023, I'm still trying to wrap my head around the chaos that is my menstrual cycle. At 26, I've been dealing with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) for a while now, but it's the recent surge in symptoms that's left me feeling helpless. The heavy bleeding, the debilitating cramps, and the emotional rollercoaster that comes with it all - it's a battle I'm fighting every month. I'm not alone, I know. Millions of women worldwide are silently suffering, brushing off their symptoms as 'normal.' But it's not normal. Prolonged and severe menstrual bleeding is not normal. Excruciating period pain is not normal. It's time we start talking about it. Let's break the stigma surrounding PCOS and menstrual health. Let's support each other in our struggles and demand better from our healthcare systems. It's time to take control of our reproductive health. #PCOSawareness #MenstrualHealthMatters"
