The glow of my laptop screen was the last thing I shut off before heading out. It was nearly 9 PM, and the office was a ghost townâ€”except for Carlos, the night custodian. We exchanged tired smiles as I passed him, my thermos of coffee already in hand for the long drive ahead. It struck me then, in 2023's relentless hustle, how our paths cross in the oddest ways. Two different journeys, one quiet, shared space in the late hours, both just trying to get where we need to be.
