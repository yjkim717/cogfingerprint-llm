Okay, here’s a reflective blog post inspired by the *No Man’s Sky* VR control frustration, aiming for a conversational tone and around 147 words, set in 2023:

**The Unexpected Jolt**

Okay, so I was completely lost in a virtual museum last week – exploring this incredible digital reconstruction of Victorian London. It was *amazing*, genuinely. And then, a tiny, almost imperceptible shift. The controls felt…wrong. Suddenly, every movement felt like I was battling a phantom right-hand, forcing me to awkwardly compensate. 

It hit me then, a weird parallel to something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately – how easily our experiences can be subtly altered, and how that can throw us off balance. Like those *No Man’s Sky* VR changes, sometimes it’s not the grand overhaul, but the little adjustments that feel fundamentally off. 

It reminded me that social engagement too can feel that way. A slight change in communication style, a shift in expectations – and suddenly, the familiar space feels unfamiliar.  Anyone else ever experience that unexpected jolt?
