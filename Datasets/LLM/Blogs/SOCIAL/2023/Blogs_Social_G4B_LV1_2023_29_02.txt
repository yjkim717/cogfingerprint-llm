**The Hrt Puzzle & My Curves**

Okay, so 2023 feels like a year of big shifts, and honestly, my body is doing its own version of a major update. Starting HRT has been amazing, but I’m wrestling with a weird question: my metabolism is *bonkers* – I burn things like they’re going out of style. 

I’m also noticing a slight… curviness I hadn’t anticipated. It’s making me wonder how this whole hormone cocktail will play with my metabolism. Is it just me, or is this a common concern for trans folks navigating HRT?  It’s a mix of excitement and a little anxiety, and I’m trying to embrace the journey, one curve at a time.
