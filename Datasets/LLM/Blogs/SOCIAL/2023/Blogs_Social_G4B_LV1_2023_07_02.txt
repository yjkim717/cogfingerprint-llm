**The Ghosts of Costco Aisles**

Anyone else feel a little pang of sadness when a beloved store item disappears? I was scrolling Reddit the other day and stumbled upon a massive thread about discontinued Costco treasures – people were practically mourning the loss of the Mediterranean pasta salad! It got me thinking about how much we rely on those little rituals, those specific finds that just *make* a trip worthwhile. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? Like a tiny, shared nostalgia with strangers.  Maybe it’s about the hunt, or the value, or just the comfort of the familiar.  What’s one thing you miss from your favorite store?
