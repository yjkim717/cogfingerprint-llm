## The Curve Question: HRT and My Speedy Metabolism

Okay, so here's something that's been swirling around in my head a lot lately. As many of you know, I'm starting HRT, and I'm *thrilled* about it. But alongside the excitement, there's this…question. I've always had a naturally fast metabolism – food disappears quickly, and curves have been elusive. Now, with estrogen entering the picture, I’m wondering about fat redistribution. 

Will I *actually* develop those feminine curves I’ve dreamed of? Or will my speedy metabolism throw a wrench in the works? It’s a surprisingly vulnerable thing to consider, wanting to align my body with my identity, and feeling a little anxious about the “how” of it all. I know everyone's journey is different, and I’m trying to embrace the unknown. Anyone else navigating this with a naturally fast metabolism?
