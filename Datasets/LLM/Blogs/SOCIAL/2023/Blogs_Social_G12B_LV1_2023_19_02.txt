## The Hunt for Burning Barbershop (and a Little Fragrance Frustration)

Anyone else obsessed with niche fragrances? I'm currently on a mission! Specifically, I'm desperately seeking a 50ml bottle of Burning Barbershop. Apparently, a lot of retailers dropped that size, and now it’s proving *impossible* to find. It’s a total desi fragrance addict problem – you discover something amazing, and then…gone! Feeling a little boycotted by the fragrance gods, honestly. Wish me luck!
