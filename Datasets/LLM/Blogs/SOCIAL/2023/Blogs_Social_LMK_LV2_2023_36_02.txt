The "tip of tongue" phenomenon got me thinking - what triggers our brain to recall fragmented memories? For me, it's often a vivid image, like a tall Black person in a hot pink dress arguing with a white woman in a restaurant scene. As I scour the internet to identify the movie, I'm reminded of the power of representation in media. In 2023, it's striking how certain images stick with us, shaping our cultural conversations and sparking our curiosity.
