**The Noise That Almost Shut Down My Game (and My Joy)**

Let’s be honest, sometimes the world feels…loud. Not just physically, but emotionally. I’ve been noticing it a lot lately, and it’s surprisingly connected to how I experience social situations. It’s like a constant, low-level hum of input – the quick judgments, the unspoken expectations, the subtle shifts in body language. 

Recently, I was completely absorbed in Rocket League, something I genuinely love, when a particular sound – the TP Boost – started to feel utterly overwhelming. It wasn’t just annoying; it was genuinely distressing. It mirrored that feeling of being overloaded, like my system was hitting a wall. 

It made me realize how easily social interactions can trigger a similar response. A sharp comment, a dismissive glance… they can feel just as jarring and disruptive as that insistent sound.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, we all need a "volume control" – a way to manage the input and protect our own well-being.  What helps *you* quiet the noise?
