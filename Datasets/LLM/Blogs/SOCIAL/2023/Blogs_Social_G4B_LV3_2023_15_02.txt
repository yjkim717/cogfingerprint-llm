**The Worry About Losing Our Digital Echoes**

There’s a little knot of anxiety I’ve been feeling lately, and I think a lot of us are grappling with it. It’s about social media – specifically, the way platforms are changing. Lately, I’ve been reading about new subscription models, and it’s sparked a real fear: the idea that our past posts, our digital echoes, might not be… permanent. 

It’s a weird thing to worry about, isn’t it? We pour so much of ourselves into these feeds, sharing moments, thoughts, and connections. The thought of losing access to all of that, of it disappearing behind a paywall, feels unsettling.  It taps into a deeper fear – the fear of change, of things slipping away. I’m trying to remind myself that memories live in *us*, not just online, but it's hard not to feel a little protective of the spaces we’ve built.  What about you? Are you feeling this too?
