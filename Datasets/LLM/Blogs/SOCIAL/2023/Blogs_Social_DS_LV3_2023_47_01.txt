There’s something meditative about watching a pot of broth simmer—the gentle bubbles rising, the steam carrying rich scents through the kitchen. Last winter, I was determined to perfect my recipe, but no matter how long it cooked, the flavor fell flat. Then I stumbled on an unexpected truth: the diameter of the pot matters. A wider surface area means more evaporation, concentrating flavors, but it also risks losing too much liquid.

It struck me how much this mirrors our social connections in 2023. We spread ourselves wide across social media, sharing bits of our lives with hundreds. But are we evaporating the depth? True richness, like a well-made broth, comes from simmering slowly—focusing on fewer, meaningful relationships that deepen over time. Sometimes, less surface area is exactly what we need.
