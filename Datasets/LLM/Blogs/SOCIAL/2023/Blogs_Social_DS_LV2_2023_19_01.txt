It’s funny how a tiny change in software can throw your whole creative flow off balance. When Clip Studio Paint 2 dropped, I didn’t expect to miss that little brush outline preview when holding shift for a straight line. It was a silent partner in my process. Now, its absence feels like a friend who suddenly stopped showing up. It’s a small reminder of how deeply our tools shape our habits and how we notice the void only when something familiar is gone.
