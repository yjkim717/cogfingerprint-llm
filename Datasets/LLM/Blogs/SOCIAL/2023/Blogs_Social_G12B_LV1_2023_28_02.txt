## When Walking Away Feels Like Walking Into a Storm

Okay, so things have been… a lot lately. High school senior life is already a pressure cooker, right? College apps, grades, the whole "what am I doing with my life?" existential crisis. But add a layer of family drama on top, and suddenly it feels like you're juggling flaming chainsaws.

Last week, I just… snapped. I needed a break. So, I skipped school. Just a few hours, honestly, to clear my head. Bad idea, apparently. My brother, who's usually pretty chill, completely lost it. It escalated quickly – yelling, accusations, and then… a threat. Nothing physical, thankfully, but the words were heavy and genuinely scared me.

I’m not going to go into all the details, but it stemmed from a long history of tension, and honestly, a lot of verbal sparring we’ve been having. It’s made me realize how unhealthy some of our interactions have become. I'm trying to figure out how to navigate this. How do you address a situation where walking away feels like the only option sometimes, but that option triggers a bigger problem?  I'm definitely exploring some resources and thinking about how to set some serious boundaries. It's exhausting, and I just want things to feel… calmer.
