## The Unexpected Power of Shared Feels (and Reddit!)

Isn't it wild how a simple question online can unlock so much? Recently, I posted in the INFP subreddit, just looking for songs that *really* hit you in the feels. I was in that processing-emotions phase, you know? The response was incredible! So many amazing recommendations poured in – across genres I wouldn’t normally explore. It’s a beautiful reminder that we’re all navigating similar emotional landscapes, and sometimes, all it takes is a shared space to discover something truly resonant. Music, and connection, are powerful healers.
