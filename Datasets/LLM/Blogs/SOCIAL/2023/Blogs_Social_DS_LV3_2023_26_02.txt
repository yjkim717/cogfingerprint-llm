Ever since my anxiety diagnosis last year, I’ve been trying to take better care of myself—hitting the gym, sticking to my medication, the works. But lately, after every workout, I’m hit with this wave of dizziness and a racing heart. My first thought was, “Is my anxiety flaring up again?” Then it hit me: I’d barely had any water all day. Could it really be that simple? Maybe my body’s just desperately thirsty, not spiraling into panic. It’s a humbling, hopeful thought in 2023’s hustle culture.
