My 1990 Toyota pickup is a trusty old friend, but its bolts are not. I'm no mechanic, just a determined owner facing a classic challenge: seized, rusted, and stripped bolts. A cutting torch is out of the question—way too intimidating. This is a quest for the everyday person, a puzzle of penetrating oil, breaker bars, and maybe a well-placed whack with a hammer. It’s about outsmarting rust, not overpowering it with fire. Wish me luck
