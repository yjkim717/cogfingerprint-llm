**The Quiet Disconnect**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we can feel utterly *alone* in a room full of people. Lately, I’ve been noticing it – a quiet disconnect, especially on social media. Scrolling through perfectly curated lives, it’s easy to feel like you’re missing something, like everyone else has cracked the code to effortless connection.  I’ve been battling my own ADHD, and sometimes the constant stimulation just leaves me drained. It’s a reminder that genuine connection takes effort, not just a like.  Anyone else feeling this way this year? #adhd #socialanxiety #mentalhealth

Would you like me to tweak this draft, or perhaps create a different version with a slightly altered focus?
