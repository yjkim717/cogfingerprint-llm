The morning sun hits my face, and for a fleeting moment, everything feels normal. Then the familiar cramping begins—a cruel alarm clock that’s dictated my life for 15 years. I’m 39, and I’ve spent over a third of my life in a battle with my own body.

Doctors called it IBS, but no test ever showed why. I’ve tried everything: elimination diets, meditation, endless supplements. I even had a colonoscopy last year—waking up from the fentanyl haze hoping for answers, only to be told everything looked “normal.” Normal? There’s nothing normal about planning your day around bathroom access.

In 2023, we talk a lot about invisible illnesses. Mine is one of them. To friends, I look healthy. But inside, it’s a constant storm of diarrhea and anxiety. I’ve had to detox—not from substances, but from the shame and isolation. From pretending I’m fine when I’m not.

Some days, the only victory is getting out of bed. But I’m learning to celebrate those small wins. Because this journey isn’t just about managing symptoms—it’s about reclaiming my life, one difficult morning at a time.
