## The Scroll & The Stillness: Finding My Way Back

Okay, real talk. 2023 has been… a lot. Like, a *lot* a lot. I’m 21, which feels like I should have this whole “adulting” thing figured out, but honestly? I’m just trying to keep my head above water some days.

It started with a relationship that, looking back, was a slow burn of toxicity. I clung to it, hoping it would magically transform, and it just… drained me. Then, layering on top of that, were all the usual post-grad life transitions – figuring out my career, feeling disconnected from friends, just generally adrift.  It all culminated in a pretty brutal depressive episode.  I'm not gonna lie, getting out of bed was a Herculean effort.

Scrolling through Instagram definitely didn’t help. Everyone else seemed to be thriving, traveling, landing dream jobs. It felt like a constant reminder of what I *wasn’t* doing.  But I'm starting to realize the curated highlight reel isn't reality. And more importantly, it doesn't have to define *my* reality.

I’m finally prioritizing therapy (seriously, everyone should!) and, honestly, even small steps feel like victories.  I’m also trying to find stillness – putting the phone down, focusing on my breath, just *being*.  It’s a process, a messy one, but I’m committed to finding my way back to myself.  Sending hope to anyone else feeling lost in the scroll. You’re not alone.
