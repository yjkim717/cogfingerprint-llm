It’s funny, isn’t it? As a trans person starting HRT, I’m simultaneously thrilled and… anxious. I’ve always had a ridiculously high metabolism – it’s a well-known thing. And the idea of shifting towards more feminine curves, of that fat redistributing in a way that feels authentically *me*, is exciting. 

But there’s a little voice whispering about potential weight gain, a worry about battling my body’s natural tendencies. It’s a uniquely trans experience, this constant negotiation with our own biology.  I’m trying to focus on the possibilities, the joy of finally aligning my body with my gender identity, but these questions are definitely part of the journey too.
