It was just another Tuesday morning at our local preschool drop-off when I witnessed something that made me pause. A mom was having a full-blown meltdown because her son’s name—Liam—was written in all lowercase letters on his cubby. “It’s a proper noun!” she insisted, her voice trembling with frustration.

As I watched the scene unfold, I couldn’t help but reflect on how easily we let small things shake our faith in humanity. In a world grappling with real challenges in 2023, was this capitalization crusade really worth the emotional energy? Sometimes, it’s the simplest oversights that remind us to step back, breathe, and focus on what truly matters—like the little boy who just wanted to hang up his backpack and play.
