## The Ghosts in the Jukebox

Lately, I've been utterly captivated by the bizarre corners of American history. Not the textbook stuff, but the forgotten freak shows, the dance marathons stretching for days, the self-proclaimed Emperor Norton ruling San Francisco with charm and delusion. There's a strange comfort in knowing that even amidst the "normal" timeline, these utterly wild stories unfolded.

It makes you think, doesn’t it? How much of the truly *remarkable* just gets lost to time? How many eccentric characters, fueled by passion or madness, left their mark on a small patch of the country? Scrolling through old photos, I feel like I'm eavesdropping on ghosts – echoes of a vibrant, wonderfully weird past.



Hope you enjoyed!
