>## The Quiet Joy of Seeing Them Fly: Reflections on Baldur's Gate 3's Endings

Okay, I'm still processing. I just finished my first proper playthrough of *Baldur's Gate 3*, and wow. It’s been a long journey, filled with perilous dungeons, morally grey choices, and a *lot* of dice rolls. But it's the ending, and the fates of my companions, that are really sticking with me.

We've all heard the hype, right? The incredible depth of choice, the sprawling world, the intricate combat. And it's all true. But for me, the real magic of *Baldur's Gate 3* lies in the relationships you forge with your party. These aren’t just NPCs; they're individuals with their own baggage, their own hopes, and their own journeys.

My playthrough wasn't about saving the world in the most heroic, flawless way. It was about making the best of a messy situation, and ensuring the people I traveled with found *some* measure of peace. Some faced ongoing struggles – the scars of their pasts don't magically vanish, and that felt incredibly realistic. But seeing Astarion finally confront his trauma, witnessing Karlach embrace a chance at a future, and watching Shadowheart find a genuine connection… that was the genuinely fulfilling part.

It's a beautiful reminder that life, like a good RPG, isn't about achieving a perfect victory. It’s about navigating the complexities, supporting those around you, and celebrating the small victories along the way. And sometimes, the quiet joy comes from simply seeing them fly. Seriously, watching Karlach soar? Tears. Just… tears. 

Anyone else feeling emotionally drained (in the best way possible) after their BG3 ending? Let’s chat!
