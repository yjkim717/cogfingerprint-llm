It’s funny how a simple question can spiral into a full-blown kitchen experiment. Last week, I stood in my own kitchen, staring at two pots—one tall and slim, the other wide and shallow—and wondered which was truly better for making broth. I’d read all the advice: simmer for hours, keep it gentle, don’t let it boil away. But my mind drifted to high school physics: evaporation depends on surface area. A wider pot means more liquid exposed to air, right? So why do so many recipes insist on a tall pot?

In 2023, we’re all seeking efficiency, even in traditions like broth-making. I realized it’s not just about the science; it’s about patience and purpose. Sometimes, slowing down—opting for the tall pot and letting flavors meld slowly—feels like a quiet rebellion against our rushed lives. And honestly, the rich, deep broth was worth every extra minute.
