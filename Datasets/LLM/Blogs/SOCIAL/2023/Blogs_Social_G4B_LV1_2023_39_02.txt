**Lost in the Scroll, Found in a Laugh**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2023 feels like a constant scroll. We’re connected to everyone, yet sometimes…isolated. I spent last week obsessing over optimizing a Terraria summoner build, completely ignoring my roommate. Then, he tripped over the cat, sending a cascade of books tumbling. We both burst out laughing.  That tiny, shared moment felt *real*.  Maybe disconnecting from the digital feeds for a while is the best way to reconnect with the people right in front of us.
