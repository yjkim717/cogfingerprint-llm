After eight years of tickling the ivories, I’ve hit a wall. My fingers know their way around the keys, but my mind struggles to grasp the language behind the melodies. With dreams of conservatory auditions in 2024, I realize it’s time to go back to the basics. I’m on the hunt for the perfect beginner-friendly music theory book—one that feels less like a textbook and more like a friendly guide, unlocking the secrets I’ve been playing by ear all these years. Any recommendations from fellow musicians on this journey?
