As I look back on my journey as an engineering student, I realize that my love for engineering was put to the test in ways I never expected. The pandemic lockdown was a challenging time - it was hard to stay motivated without the structure of in-person classes and hands-on projects. There were times when I felt like giving up, but the thought of contributing to innovative solutions kept me going. When I finally got to work on hands-on projects as part of my university program, my passion for engineering was reignited. It was exhilarating to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems. In 2023, as I reflect on my journey, I'm grateful for the ups and downs that have shaped me into a resilient engineer. My story is a reminder that with perseverance and the right opportunities, we can overcome obstacles and stay true to our passions.
