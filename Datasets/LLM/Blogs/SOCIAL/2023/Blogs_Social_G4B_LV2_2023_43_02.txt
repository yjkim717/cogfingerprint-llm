**The Gut Feeling I Couldn’t Explain**

Let's be honest, how many times have you felt like something was…off? Like a tiny, insistent hum beneath the surface of your everyday life? I’ve been wrestling with that feeling lately, and it’s surprisingly linked to a story I stumbled across about a guy named Mark. 

Mark was 39, and he was battling relentless diarrhea. It wasn’t a casual tummy rumble; it was a persistent, worsening problem that had him desperately seeking answers.  Doctors ran tests, tests, *tests*, and found nothing concrete.  Adding to the confusion was a recent fentanyl withdrawal – a tough experience that left him feeling utterly destabilized. 

It struck me how profoundly our bodies can hold onto the past, how a physical symptom can become a mirror reflecting deeper anxieties and unresolved struggles.  I’ve noticed it myself – a sudden wave of sadness, a persistent tightness in my chest – sometimes linked to old insecurities or missed connections. 

It’s easy to dismiss these feelings, to tell ourselves it’s “just stress.” But maybe it’s more than that. Maybe it’s a signal, a gentle nudge to really connect with ourselves and understand what’s beneath the surface.  Mark’s story reminded me that sometimes, the most important healing starts not with a diagnosis, but with a willingness to listen to that quiet, insistent gut feeling.
