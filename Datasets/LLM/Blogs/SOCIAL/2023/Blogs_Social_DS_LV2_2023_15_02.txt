It’s funny how the smallest changes in our digital routines can feel so personal. Just last week, I noticed my favorite podcast switched to a subscription model, and my first thought wasn’t about the cost—it was, “Will I still own these episodes like I did with the old season pass?”

It reminded me of collecting mixtapes as a kid; there was comfort in permanence. Now, with RSS feeds and shifting access, that sense of ownership feels fragile. Are we building digital libraries or just renting moments?

In 2023, as platforms pivot and policies shift, I’m reflecting on what we truly keep in this streaming age. Maybe it’s not about access, but trust—trust that the stories we love won’t just vanish one day.
