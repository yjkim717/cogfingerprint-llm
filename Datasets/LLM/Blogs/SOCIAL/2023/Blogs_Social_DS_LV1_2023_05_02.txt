It’s 2023, and I’m realizing how much we take simple movements for granted. After a hairline fracture in my patella, I’ve been told to limit my knee bend, even though I can almost move it fully. It’s frustrating—social plans sidelined, independence paused. But this quiet time has me reflecting: life’s pace isn’t just about pushing through pain. Sometimes healing means honoring our limits, not just our range of motion. A gentle lesson in self-care.
