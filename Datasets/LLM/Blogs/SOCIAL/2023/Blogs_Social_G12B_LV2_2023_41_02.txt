## The Quiet Hum of Support (and Theory Books!)

It's funny, isn't it? How a simple question – "What are some good music theory books for beginners?" – can unlock a whole flood of feelings. I posted that on a piano forum the other day, prepping for a potential conservatory application down the line. Eight years of playing, and suddenly I'm back at square one with the *theory*!

But the responses… wow. So many helpful suggestions, genuine encouragement. It reminded me that even in our hyper-connected world, there's still so much warmth in shared passions. It's 2023, and sometimes, a little online community is exactly what you need to feel brave enough to chase a big dream. Now, to tackle those scales *and* learn about inversions! Wish me luck!
