It’s funny how a tiny change in software can make you reflect on bigger things. When Clip Studio Paint updated and my trusty Shift key stopped letting me draw free straight lines, I felt a little lost—like a familiar conversation had been cut short. It reminded me of how we all adapt to shifts in our social worlds, too. We find new ways to connect, new tools to express ourselves, because even when old comforts fade, creativity finds a path forward.
