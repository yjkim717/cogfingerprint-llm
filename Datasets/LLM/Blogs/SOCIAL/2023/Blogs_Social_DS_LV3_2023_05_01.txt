It’s 2023, and I’m sitting in a café in Lisbon, trying to make sense of my company’s latest policy. When I accepted this job, I imagined a flexible, modern workplace—one where WFH and travel could coexist. But here’s the catch: they won’t give me a laptop for remote work, even during PTO trips like this one.

My last role trusted us with company-issued tech, no questions asked. Now, I’m left wondering—is it me? Did I ask at the wrong time, or is this just how things are done here? It feels like we’re clinging to the corporate office of the past, while the world has already moved on.
