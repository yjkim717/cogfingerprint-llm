It’s 2023, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how we talk past each other online. I used to share screenshots of wild TFM content to mock it, thinking I was helping. But then a friend asked, “Have you actually watched the full videos you’re criticizing?” I hadn’t.

That hit me. By relying on fragments, I was moving the goalposts without even realizing it. I wasn’t engaging—I was just echoing outrage. It’s like the Knights of Melvin or critics like DoomCock: context matters. You can’t debunk what you haven’t fully witnessed.

Now, I try to watch things firsthand before forming an opinion. It’s harder, slower work, but it’s honest. And in a digital world full of hot takes, maybe that’s the most rebellious act of all: to listen before we react.
