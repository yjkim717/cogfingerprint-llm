**Lost in the Echo Chamber: Why "Capitalism" and "Socialism" Feel Like Opposite Sides of a Coin**

Let’s be honest, how many times have you scrolled through social media and found yourself completely baffled by the arguments raging about “Capitalism” versus “Socialism”? It feels like people are shouting at each other from completely different planets, right? 

I’ve realized it's not always about the *definitions* themselves – though those are definitely muddy – but how we’re using them.  So often, it’s not a genuine *debate* about economic systems, but a way to signal allegiance, to build an ‘us vs. them’ narrative.

It’s easy to fall into a cycle of *misunderstanding* and entrenched *perspective*.  But maybe, just maybe, finding common ground – a shared desire for fairness and opportunity – would be a better starting point.  Isn’t *agreement* on core values more productive than endless division?
