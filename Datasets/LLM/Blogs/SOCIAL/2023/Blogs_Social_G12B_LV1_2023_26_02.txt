## Is it the Flu, or Just Me & This Dry Spell?

Okay, real talk. I’m feeling…off. Headachy, scratchy throat, the whole shebang. And my brain is immediately jumping to two possibilities: the dreaded flu, or, you know, *me* failing at hydration *again*. It's a familiar pattern. I'm on Accutane right now (a journey!), and one of the side effects is seriously dry skin…and apparently, a dry everything else.

It's honestly frustrating. I *know* I need to drink more water. Everyone says it. Social media is flooded with fancy water bottles and hydration reminders. Yet, actually doing it? Hard.  I’m wondering if this feeling is just my body screaming for moisture, amplified by the Accutane.  Or is it actually the flu making its rounds?  Guess I'll be resting up and chugging water – lots and lots of water – and hoping for the best. Wish me luck!
