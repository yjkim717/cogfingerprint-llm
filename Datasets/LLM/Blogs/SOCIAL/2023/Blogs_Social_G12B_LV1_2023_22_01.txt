## The Playlist as a Therapist (and Why I Need So Many)

Okay, real talk. 2023 has been… a lot. I've found myself leaning *hard* into music lately, not just for background noise, but as an actual emotional processing tool. One minute I'm sobbing along to a power ballad, the next I'm needing the raw catharsis of screamo. It’s a weird, sprawling collection – pop, indie, everything – but it’s honestly helping me navigate it all. Anyone else using their playlists like therapy sessions?
