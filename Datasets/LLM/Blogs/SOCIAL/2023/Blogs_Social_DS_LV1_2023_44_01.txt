### The Night We Rediscovered Joy: A Lesson from The Barber of Seville

It was my friend Clara’s idea. “We’re getting dressed up,” she announced over the phone, her voice leaving no room for argument. “We’re going to the opera. A real one.” It was late 2023, and if I’m honest, I was running on fumes. The world felt like a constant scroll of bad news, and my social life had dwindled to group chats and doomscrolling. The idea of sitting still for three hours felt like a chore.

But Clara was right. We needed it.

The opera was Rossini’s *The Barber of Seville*, and from the moment the curtain went up on Opera San Jose’s traditional production, I felt something in me unlock. It wasn’t just the lavish sets or the familiar, frothy plot. It was the sheer, unadulterated *joy* of it all. In a world that often feels aggressively serious, here was a centuries-old art form that was, at its heart, a brilliantly crafted comedy.

The true magic, however, didn’t happen on stage first—it happened in the audience. I watched a couple in their seventies a few rows ahead, their shoulders shaking with silent laughter during Figaro’s rapid-fire scheming. A group of college students, who I’d pegged as being there for a class requirement, were by the second act fully invested, gasping and cheering. We were all sharing this. Not through a screen, but in real time, in a dark room, breathing the same air.

The standout performance came from Nikola Printz, whose coloratura soprano was so effortless and precise it felt like watching a vocal acrobat perform a perfect, gravity-defying routine. But it was their comic timing that truly sealed the deal. A raised eyebrow, a perfectly timed pause, a flustered flutter—it was a masterclass in connection. They weren’t just singing to us; they were including us in the joke.

Driving home, Clara and I couldn’t stop talking, replaying our favorite scenes. The conversation wasn’t about the news or our anxieties. It was about art, and laughter, and the shared experience of being delightfully surprised.

That night was a powerful reminder of something we’d lost in the shuffle of modern life: the profound social nourishment of collective joy. Laughing with a room full of strangers is a kind of therapy. It’s a thread that connects us, reminding us that beneath everything, we all respond to the same human fundamentals—a clever joke, a beautiful voice, a happy ending.

We didn’t just see an opera that night. We participated in a centuries-old ritual of coming together to feel something good. And in 2023, that felt like the most radical act of all. I’m already looking at the next season’s program. My treat this time.
