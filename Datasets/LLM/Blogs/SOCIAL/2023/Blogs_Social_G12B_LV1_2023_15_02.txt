## Will My Podcast Subscription *Really* Last?

It's 2023, and we're all drowning in subscriptions. Netflix, Spotify, even my favorite artisanal coffee delivery – it feels like everything wants a recurring fee. Lately, I've been pondering something specific about podcasting.

I loved the old “season pass” model some podcasts used to offer. You’d buy it, and boom, access to *everything* from that season, forever. Now, most are leaning into subscription models.  But does subscribing to "The Daily Brew" podcast, for example, actually guarantee I'll be able to listen back to last year’s deep dive on Ethiopian coffee beans in, say, 2025?

It's a nagging question. Will these platforms eventually decide to pull older episodes, leaving subscribers high and dry?  Or will the RSS feed become a relic, and we’ll *only* access content through their walled gardens? I guess we'll see. It makes me wonder if a digital library – a permanent, accessible archive – is something we should be demanding more of.
