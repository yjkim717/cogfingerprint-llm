**The Weight of a Friday Afternoon**

Okay, so this happened last Friday, and honestly, I’m still processing it. I totally skipped school. I know, huge no-no. I needed the money, desperately, and I landed a shift at the local diner. But then… a massive argument erupted with my brother, Liam. It spiraled so fast. Hurtful things were said, accusations flew, and I actually blurted out a really desperate plea for him to just *understand*. 

It’s weird, because I felt this overwhelming guilt immediately after, layered with the relief of having earned some cash.  It made me think about how easily things can escalate, and how much we push away the people who could actually help.  Social media makes it feel like everyone has it figured out, but real life is messy, and sometimes you just need to swallow your pride and talk it through.  Anyone else ever felt that pressure to just *do* instead of *feel*?
