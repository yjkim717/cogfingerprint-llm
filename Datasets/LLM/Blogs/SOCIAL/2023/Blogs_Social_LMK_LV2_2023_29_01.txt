"Three Months on HRT: My Journey to Embracing Myself

As I sit here in 2023, reflecting on the past three months, I'm overwhelmed with emotion. Starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been a game-changer for me. The physical changes have been remarkable - softer skin, curvier hips, and a more feminine shape. But what's truly transformative is the confidence that's grown within me. I feel more like myself than ever before.

Transitioning isn't just about physical changes; it's about becoming the person I've always felt inside. With HRT, I'm finally aligning my body with my identity. The little things, like being perceived as 'she' in public, have boosted my self-esteem. It's surreal to think that just a few months ago, I was hesitant to start this journey. Now, I'm excited to see what the future holds. I'm embracing this new chapter, and I'm grateful for the courage to be me."
