There I was, packing for my first-ever Royal Caribbean cruise on the Voyager of the Seas, a mix of excitement and a very modern anxiety swirling inside me. In 2023, we’re more connected to our devices than ever, and the thought of my phone or e-reader dying mid-adventure felt like a genuine crisis. I’d heard the rumors about sparse power outlets in cruise cabins.

So, I did what any savvy traveler would do: I turned to the collective wisdom of online forums. My trusty pass-through plug adapter and USB hub had been heroes on other lines, but would they work here? It’s funny how such a small thing—the simple need to charge our tools for connection—can feel so pivotal. It’s a shared, almost unspoken understanding among travelers now. That little adapter wasn’t just about electricity; it was about maintaining my link to the world, and to the memories I was about to make.
