The preschool drama that went viral in 2023 still resonates with me. A mom's frustration boiled over when teachers "incorrectly" capitalized her child's name. But beneath the surface-level argument over etiquette lay a deeper issue: the spread of misinformation and the pressure to be a "perfect" parent. As we navigate the complexities of parenting, let's acknowledge that our reactions often stem from our own stress and anxiety. By taking a step back and reevaluating our responses, we can model better behavior for our kids and create a more supportive community for all.
