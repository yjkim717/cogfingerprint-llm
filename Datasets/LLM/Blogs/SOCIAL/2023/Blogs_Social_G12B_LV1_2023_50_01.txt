## "Am I the Only One...?" – Let's Talk About Saying What We Don't Mean

Okay, I need to get this off my chest. I saw *The Shawshank Redemption* last week (yes, I’m late to the party!), and everyone was *raving*. And I… wasn't blown away. Don't @ me! It was good, sure, but "greatest movie of all time" good? I felt a pang of that familiar feeling: "Am I the only one who thinks this?"

Then it hit me. We *all* say that, right? It's a rhetorical flourish. It’s not a genuine plea for validation that you're uniquely experiencing a thought. It’s a way to signal a feeling – surprise, mild dissent, a desire to spark conversation. It’s just a figure of speech!

It made me think about how often we use these kinds of phrases online too. Maybe it's time we all acknowledge it’s more about the feeling than the literal truth. Thoughts?
