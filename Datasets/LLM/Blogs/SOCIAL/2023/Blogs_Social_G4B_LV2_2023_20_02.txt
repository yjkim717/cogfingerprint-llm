**Lost in the Gloom of the Scroll**

There’s something about a rainy night, isn’t there? A certain kind of quiet that pulls you inward. Lately, I’ve been feeling a lot of that – a quiet melancholy, amplified by endless scrolling. It’s like we’re all inhabiting these strange, dimly-lit digital spaces, lost in contemplation of other people’s lives.
