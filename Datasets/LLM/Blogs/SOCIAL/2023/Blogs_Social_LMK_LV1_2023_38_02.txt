The Great Misunderstanding: When Capitalism and Socialism Collide

As I scrolled through my social media feed in 2023, I was struck by the intensity of the debate between capitalists and socialists. It seemed like each side was speaking a different language, with neither able to truly hear the other. The more I read, the more I realized that the issue wasn't that they disagreed - it was that they were often arguing over different concepts altogether. The word "capitalism" meant one thing to one person, and something entirely different to another. The same went for "socialism." It's no wonder that the conversation quickly devolved into shouting matches and name-calling. To truly move forward, we need to take a step back and define our terms. Only then can we have a genuine discussion about the merits of each ideology. By doing so, we might just find that we're not as far apart as we thought.
