## Three Months In: More Than Just Physical Changes

It’s hard to believe it’s already been three months since I started HRT. Honestly, the first month felt… weird. A lot of waiting, a lot of hoping, and a fair bit of anxiety. But now? Now I’m starting to *feel* it. And it's so much more than I anticipated.

Of course, there are the physical shifts. My face is softening, which is a really lovely surprise - I’ve always felt a bit too angular. And the beginnings of breast budding… well, that’s just surreal and exciting all at once. I’m also seriously considering laser hair removal; tackling years of unwanted growth feels like a really empowering next step.

But beyond the visible stuff, the biggest change has been in my confidence. It’s subtle, a quiet hum beneath the surface, but it’s *there*. I feel… more aligned. More *me*. I’m taking up more space, both literally and figuratively. I’m saying what I want to say, and I’m not apologizing for it. 

My libido has also shifted in interesting ways – a topic I’m still exploring, honestly. It's a journey, and 2023 feels like a year where more and more of us are openly talking about these transitions. It’s validating to know I’m not alone, and I’m excited to see what the next three months bring.
