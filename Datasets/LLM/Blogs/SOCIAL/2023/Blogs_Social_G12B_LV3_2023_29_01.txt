## Three Months In: Finding Myself Through HRT

It’s wild to think it’s only been three months. Three months since I started Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT), and honestly, it feels like a lifetime of change packed into a blink. I’ve been wanting to share this journey, because I know so many others are considering it, or are early on like I was.

The physical changes are, of course, the most visible. Seeing my body soften, noticing a more feminine shape – it’s surreal and incredibly affirming. My hormone levels are stabilizing, and with each passing week, I feel more aligned with who I've always known I was. It’s not just about looks, though. The emotional shift has been profound. 

There’s a quiet confidence blooming within me, a sense of peace I haven't felt before. It’s allowed me to connect with friends and family on a deeper level, and to finally start living authentically. This year, more than any other, feels like a genuine beginning. It’s a journey of self-discovery, and I'm so grateful to be on it.
