**Leveling Up My Digital Life (and Maybe My Social Game Too)**

It’s funny how we get so attached to our tech, right? I’ve been staring at my old PC lately, realizing it’s struggling to keep up with the games I actually *want* to play – Borderlands 3 is calling my name!  It’s made me think about upgrading, specifically a new graphics card and more memory. 

But it’s also made me reflect on something bigger: connection.  Sometimes, our digital spaces can feel isolating, even when we’re ‘online’.  Maybe a fresh start, like upgrading my PC, is a metaphor for wanting to level up my social game too – connect more genuinely, and really *play* with the people in my life.  Anyone else feel that pull?
