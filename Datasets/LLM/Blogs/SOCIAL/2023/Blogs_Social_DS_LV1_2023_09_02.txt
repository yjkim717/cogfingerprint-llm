Walking through the convention hall last weekend, I couldn’t help but notice the Klingon cosplayers towering over me in their platform boots. It got me thinking—how often do we stretch ourselves to meet expectations, even in everyday life? In 2023, with social media amplifying every difference, it’s easy to feel we need to deepen our voices or stand taller to be heard. But maybe, like the Klingons in Strange New Worlds, there’s power in embracing our authentic, unexaggerated selves.
