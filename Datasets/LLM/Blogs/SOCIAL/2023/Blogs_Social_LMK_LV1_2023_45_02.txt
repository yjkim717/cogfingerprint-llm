As I settled into my cabin on Royal Caribbean's Voyager of the Seas, I realized I was about to face a familiar challenge: keeping my devices charged while navigating the limited power outlets near my nightstand. In 2023, it's crazy to think how much we rely on our phones and tablets, even on vacation! I started wondering, is it safe to use a pass-through plug adapter to charge multiple devices at once? I took to social media to see if fellow cruisers had any tips. The responses were enlightening - some swore by their trusty adapters, while others warned of the risks.
