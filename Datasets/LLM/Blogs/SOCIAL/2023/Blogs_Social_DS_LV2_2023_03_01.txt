It’s 2023, and I thought I’d seen it all—until a preschool mom’s meltdown over capitalization made headlines. Yes, you read that right. Teachers followed standard grammar rules, capitalizing the first letter of her child’s name, and it sparked a full-blown tantrum.

In a world buzzing with real crises, this moment felt surreal. But here’s the twist: it reminded me that faith in humanity often hides in small gestures. The teachers didn’t engage in the drama; they upheld respect and consistency. Sometimes, it’s these quiet acts of principle—not the loud outbursts—that quietly restore our belief in each other. Let’s celebrate the unsung heroes keeping things grounded, one capitalized letter at a time.
