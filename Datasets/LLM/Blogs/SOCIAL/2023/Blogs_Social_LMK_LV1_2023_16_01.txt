"I'm still trying to wrap my head around why Overwatch 2 has been such a letdown for me. I loved the original game's concept - the diverse heroes, the strategic teamplay, and the fast-paced action. But the sequel has been a different story altogether. The game balancing is a mess, with some heroes feeling overpowered and others feeling like they're carrying the team on their back. And don't even get me started on the toxic community. As someone who's played competitive games for years, I've seen my fair share of salty teammates and opponents, but Overwatch 2 takes the cake. It's a shame, because I think the game's got potential. But until Blizzard addresses these issues, I'll be taking a break. Maybe in 2023, they'll get it together."
