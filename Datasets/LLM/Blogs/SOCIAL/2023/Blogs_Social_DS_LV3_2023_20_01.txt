The 3 a.m. serenades began in late spring. A lone, persistent bark slicing through the quiet of our suburban street. At first, it was a minor nuisance, a blip in the night. But as the weeks turned into months, that dog’s nocturnal concerts became the soundtrack of my exhaustion.

I tried everything—earplugs that felt like rocks, a white noise machine that just added a different kind of static. My frustration was a low hum, mirroring the noise itself. I wasn’t just mad at the dog; I felt a strange, isolating loneliness, lying awake while the rest of the world slept. In 2023, with so many ways to connect, I’d never felt more disconnected from the person on the other side of the fence, both of us trapped in a cycle of noise and silence.
