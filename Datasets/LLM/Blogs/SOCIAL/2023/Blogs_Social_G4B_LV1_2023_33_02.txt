**The Weight of Being Seen**

It’s weird, isn’t it? I’ve been obsessing over a ridiculously specific GTA Online trophy – surviving a bounty while hiding. It’s become this frustrating little puzzle, and honestly, it’s made me think about how much we *want* to be seen, versus how much we crave anonymity.  I keep trying different tactics, desperate to disappear, but it feels like the game, and maybe life, is just constantly tracking us.  Maybe the real challenge isn’t the bounty, but accepting that sometimes, you just want to fade into the background. 2023 feels like everyone’s shouting, doesn’t it?
