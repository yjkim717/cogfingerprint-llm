"The Bittersweet Taste of a Season Pass: Will I Lose My Favorite Shows Forever?

As I signed up for the new subscription model, I couldn't help but wonder: will I still be able to enjoy my favorite TV shows after I cancel? The promise of a season pass sounds enticing, but what happens to the content I've grown to love once I decide to opt-out? Will I be left with nothing but memories, or will I retain permanent access to past episodes? The lack of clarity is unsettling. I rely on the RSS feed to stay updated, but will it still be available to me after cancellation? I hope the service doesn't revoke access to episodes I've already watched. It's 2023, and with the rise of streaming services, it's surprising that this question remains unanswered. As a loyal viewer, I crave the reassurance that my favorite shows will remain accessible, even if I choose to cancel my subscription."
