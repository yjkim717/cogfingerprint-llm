## Have the Klingons…Shrunk? A Strange New Worlds Observation

Okay, Star Trek fans, has anyone else noticed something a little…off with the Klingons in *Strange New Worlds* Season 2? I saw a Reddit thread pointing out they seem shorter, and their vocal delivery feels different. It's a tiny detail, but it got me thinking about how character design subtly shifts across reboots. Are we noticing because we're hyper-aware, or is it genuinely a change? Discuss!
