### When a Game Stops Feeling Like a Game

I remember the first time I truly felt the thrill of Rocket League. It wasn't a perfectly timed aerial goal or a last-second save; it was the sheer, unadulterated chaos of eight friends crammed into a living room, laughing as our cars flailed across the screen. It was pure, uncomplicated fun.

Fast forward to 2023, and that feeling has become… complicated. The game is still there, the core physics are a marvel, but the world around it has changed. It’s hard to ignore the growing sentiment in the community, the quiet grumbles that have turned into a collective roar. The conversation has shifted from "Did you see that shot?" to "Did you see what Epic did now?"

When Epic Games acquired Psyonix, many of us held a cautious hope. Maybe this would mean more resources, bigger tournaments, a new golden age. Instead, for a vocal part of our community, it has felt like watching a beloved local pub get bought out by a massive corporation. The soul feels like it’s being slowly commodified. The focus seems to have pivoted sharply from passionate development to pure profit optimization—item shop rotations, blueprint economies, and a sense that the players' joy is secondary to their revenue.

This has led to a difficult, almost painful question: What is our power as players? For some, the answer is a boycott. The logic is stark but simple: if the game’s financial performance tanks, the corporate parent might just cut its losses and sell it to someone who sees it not as a spreadsheet asset, but as a community, a sport, a legacy.

It’s a drastic move, born of frustration. I haven’t uninstalled the game—those memories are too potent. But I’ve stopped buying from the item shop. It’s my small, quiet protest. It’s not really about the cosmetics; it’s about sending a message. We’re not just wallets; we’re a community that fell in love with rocket-powered cars playing soccer. We just want the stewards of this incredible game to love it as recklessly and as illogically as we do. Because at its heart, that’s what this was always about. Not profit, but passion.
