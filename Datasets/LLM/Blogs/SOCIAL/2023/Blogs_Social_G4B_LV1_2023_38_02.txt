**The Endless ‘Capitalism vs. Socialism’ Loop**

Okay, let’s be honest, how many times have you scrolled through social media and stumbled into the same argument: “Capitalism is evil! Socialism is the answer!”? It’s exhausting, right? I was thinking about it the other day, and I realized a huge part of why it’s so unproductive is that *nobody really agrees on what either term actually means*. 

We’re debating about the *state’s* role, not really about fundamentally different economic systems.  Capitalism gets painted as purely greedy, while socialism gets demonized as stifling innovation.  But what if we actually took the time to define these things properly, acknowledging the spectrum of possibilities within each? 

Maybe a little less shouting and a little more thoughtful discussion would actually help us build something better.  Just a thought for 2023!
