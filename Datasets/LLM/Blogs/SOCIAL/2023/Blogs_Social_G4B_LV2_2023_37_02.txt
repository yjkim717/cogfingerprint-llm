**Lost in the Echoes of ‘What If?’**

There’s something really captivating about late modern fantasy, isn’t there? Like, stumbling across a world that feels both utterly familiar – maybe even echoing a past we know – and completely, wonderfully strange. Lately, I’ve been obsessed with books like *Temeraire* and *Carnival Row*, which brilliantly weave dragons and Napoleonic battles into their stories. 

It makes you think, doesn’t it? About the roads not taken, the “what ifs” of history.  We’re all living in 2023, shaped by choices made before us, and imagining those alternate realities is a surprisingly grounding – and hopeful – exercise.  What historical moment would *you* want to see reimagined with a little magic?
