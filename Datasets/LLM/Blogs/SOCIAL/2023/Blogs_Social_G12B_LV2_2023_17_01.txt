Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational, relatable tone and a 2023 context. I've focused on the themes of navigating difficult relationships and mental health, particularly relevant given the summary.  I've included a suggested title and a couple of ideas for visuals at the end.

**Title: When "Maybe" Feels Like Too Much: Navigating Uncertainty & My Mental Health**

Okay, real talk. 2023 has been…a lot. I’m 21, supposedly on the cusp of adulthood, and instead, I feel like I’m constantly teetering. A big part of that has been untangling myself from a situation I can only describe as a “situationship.” You know, the one where things feel good sometimes, but mostly just leave you feeling confused and drained?

It was a slow burn, but it ultimately pushed me into a pretty rough depressive episode. Suddenly, everything felt heavy. Getting out of bed felt like climbing a mountain. And honestly, the uncertainty of it all – not knowing where things stood – really amplified everything.

I'm working through it, though. Therapy has been a lifeline, and honestly, medication (Effexor, in my case) is helping me find a bit more stability. It’s a reminder that it's okay to not be okay, and to reach out for help when you need it. If you're feeling lost in the "maybe" zone, you're not alone. We'll get through this.

**Possible Visual Ideas:**

*   **Image:** A slightly blurred photo of someone looking out a window, conveying a sense of introspection and uncertainty.
*   **Graphic:** A simple illustration depicting a tangled string, symbolizing a complicated relationship.
