That second date invite popped up on my phone, and my mind immediately flashed back to our first coffee. I’d offered to pay, and she’d gently said, “I appreciate it, but it makes me uncomfortable.” I respected that. But now, planning dinner, the old script of “I’ll get it” felt wrong. So, I took a breath and texted: “Just to be on the same page, how would you like to handle the bill tomorrow?” Her quick “Thanks for asking! Let’s split it” was a relief. Clear communication isn’t awkward; it’s the foundation of respect.
