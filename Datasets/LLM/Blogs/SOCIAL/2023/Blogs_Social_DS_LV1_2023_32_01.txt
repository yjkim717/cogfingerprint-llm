### The Diagnosis on My To-Do List

It’s 2023, and my phone is a hub of relentless optimization. It tells me to stand up, to hydrate, to meditate. Yet, the most critical notification—the one that whispers “check your mental health”—has been on silent for years.

I finally mustered the courage to tell my primary care physician I thought I might be depressed. Her response was kind, a pamphlet and a referral to a therapist. But as I walked out, a familiar doubt crept in. Was I just bad at being a person? Was this really a clinical issue, or just a profound failure of self-care?

The feeling is a lot like the impostor syndrome I battle at work, but magnified. I can logic my way through a project deadline, but I can’t seem to “logic” myself into basic wellness. The thought of calling the referred therapist sits on my to-do list, right between “buy groceries” and “file taxes,” feeling equally daunting.

What if I get a diagnosis and I’m still just… me? What if the label doesn’t fix the fundamental exhaustion of pretending I’m okay? I’m caught between hoping for a clear answer and being terrified that it won’t change a thing. For now, the referral number remains unsaved, a tiny symbol of the gap between knowing you need help and feeling worthy of receiving it.
