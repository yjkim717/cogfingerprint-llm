The other day, I dropped my car off for what I thought was a simple CV axle replacement. The quote was manageable, and I trusted the shop. But when I got the call, my stomach dropped—the final bill had nearly tripled. No warning, no explanation until I asked.

It wasn’t just the cost that stung; it was the lack of communication. In a world where we can track a pizza delivery in real-time, why does auto repair still feel like a black hole? That moment of frustration made me realize how much we crave transparency, especially when we’re putting our trust—and hard-earned money—in someone else’s hands.

It’s a reminder that clear, honest dialogue isn’t just good service; it’s the foundation of trust. And in 2023, that’s something we should expect in every interaction.
