It’s 8 p.m., and I’m the last one in the office. The quiet hum of the building is broken only by the custodian starting their rounds. I’m grabbing one last coffee for the long drive ahead to see family. In that moment, I realized something: we’re all just people pushing through our own late nights, connected by these small, shared spaces. It’s in these quiet office hours that you feel the invisible threads of community, even when you think you’re alone.
