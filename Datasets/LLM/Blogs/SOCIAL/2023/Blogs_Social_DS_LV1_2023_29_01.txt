### Three Months In: Finding Her in the Mirror

It’s wild how much can change in a season. Three months ago, I started HRT, hands trembling with a mix of fear and desperate hope. I was chasing an idea, a future version of myself I could barely picture.

Now, I’m starting to feel her. It’s not one big moment, but a collection of small, profound shifts. My skin is softer. When I catch my reflection, there’s a subtle, unfamiliar curve to my cheek that makes me pause. I’ve even started laser hair removal, treating each zap as a farewell to a mask I never asked to wear.

But the most significant change isn’t just physical. It’s a quieting of the static in my head, a growing confidence that this path is mine. In a world where our existence is so heavily politicized, simply feeling more at home in my own skin is a radical act of joy. The woman I was waiting for was here all along; I just needed to give her space to emerge.
