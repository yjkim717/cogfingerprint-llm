## Did Anyone Else Notice Something… Off? Klingons in *Strange New Worlds*

Okay, I need to get this off my chest. I’m loving *Star Trek: Strange New Worlds*, seriously! But something’s been nagging at me. The Klingons. They just… don’t *feel* the same.

I rewatched some classic *TNG* and *DS9* the other day, and the difference was striking. These new Klingons seem shorter, less imposing. And the *growl*! It’s… muted. Where’s the guttural ferocity? It's like they’ve swapped their battle cries for polite requests.

Maybe it’s a deliberate design choice, a subtle shift in the franchise. Or maybe I'm just getting old and nostalgic for those glorious, towering, booming Klingons of the past! Either way, it’s a detail that’s stuck with me. Anyone else notice?



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
