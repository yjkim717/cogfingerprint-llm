**The Silent Plea in “Am I the Only One?”**

Remember that feeling? Scrolling through social media, seeing everyone seemingly *fine*, and then blurting out “Am I the only one?” It’s a reflex, isn’t it? But I’ve been thinking a lot about it lately. It’s not really a question of validity, seeking a mirror reflection of our own emotions. 

More often, it’s a tiny, vulnerable plea for communication. A way of saying, "Hey, I'm feeling this, and I need to acknowledge it, even if it feels a little… silly."  We’re so quick to judge these phrases, dismissing them as attention-seeking. But maybe, just maybe, it's a gentle signal that we need connection, a reminder that we’re not alone in our experiences.  It’s a beautiful, if slightly awkward, way to start a conversation.
