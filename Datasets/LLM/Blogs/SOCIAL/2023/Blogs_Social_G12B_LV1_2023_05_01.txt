## The Laptop Boundary & My Growing Remote Work Question Mark

So, I’ve been thinking a lot about remote work policies lately. A colleague recently had a frustrating experience – wanting a laptop to comfortably work while traveling between states, only to be told to use PTO or head back to the office. Seriously?

It got me questioning things. We’re in 2023! The world has shifted. We’ve proven we can be productive *outside* the traditional 9-to-5, four-walled space. Why are some companies still clinging to these rigid rules? 

It feels like a disconnect - a reluctance to truly embrace the flexibility everyone touted during the pandemic. It makes you wonder: are they worried about control, or genuinely believe in-office presence is the *only* way to guarantee output? Food for thought, right? #remotework #wfh #policythoughts #worklife
