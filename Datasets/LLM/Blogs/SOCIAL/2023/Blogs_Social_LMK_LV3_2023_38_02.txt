The Great Divide: When Capitalism and Socialism Speak Different Languages. 
In today's polarized world, debates between capitalism and socialism often feel like ships passing in the night. Why? Because the terms are used differently by each side, leading to confusion and gridlock. 
For instance, when a capitalist says "freedom," they might mean the ability to start a business without red tape. Meanwhile, a socialist might interpret "freedom" as access to healthcare and education, regardless of income. 
These differing definitions stem from fundamentally distinct ideologies. To bridge this gap, we must first understand where the other side is coming from. By listening to and acknowledging the underlying values of both perspectives, we can begin to have more productive discussions. Only then can we work towards a more nuanced understanding of what it means to create a fair and prosperous society for all.
