## Dragons, Corsets, and the Weight of "What If?"

Lately, I've been *obsessed* with fantasy that isn't your typical medieval quest. Give me a Victorian street brawl with fae, or Napoleonic battles with dragons – yes, please! I stumbled across a thread asking for recommendations in that late modern/early 20th century fantasy space (think *Temeraire* and *Carnival Row*), and it really sparked something.

It's fascinating, isn't it, how these stories use familiar historical frameworks to explore social anxieties? *Carnival Row*, for instance, uses the tension between humans and fae to reflect immigration and prejudice. *Temeraire* flips the script on empire with these intelligent, sentient dragons.

It makes you think: what if history had taken a different turn? What if magic existed alongside industrialization? It’s more than just escapism; it’s a way to examine our own present through a speculative lens. Anyone else finding themselves drawn to this kind of "alternative history" fantasy? Let me know your favorites!
