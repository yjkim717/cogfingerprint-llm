Remember that time I tried organizing that quirky community potluck last year? I asked everyone to bring their most unique dish, hoping for a creative feast. We ended up with some truly bizarre combinations that only a few people appreciated. It made me think of A24 and Beau is Afraid—sometimes, you greenlight a project not for universal appeal, but to celebrate the strange, beautiful niche. It’s about art, not just the numbers, and I love that.
