It’s 2023, and I’m staring at my slightly-bent knee, wondering if I’m cheating recovery. The doctor said “hairline fracture,” but my range of motion is almost back. Do I really need to keep it locked straight when it barely hurts to bend? It’s a strange limbo—feeling capable but knowing the invisible crack demands patience. My body and the rules are having a quiet, confusing argument.
