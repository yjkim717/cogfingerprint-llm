### The Sound That Almost Broke My Rocket League

I have a love-hate relationship with Rocket League. Most of the time, it’s pure, unadulterated love. The physics-defying cars, the thrill of a last-second aerial goal, the silent communication with random teammates—it’s my happy place. But there’s one thing that threatens to shatter that entire world for me: the TP Boost.

If you’re not a player, let me set the scene. Boosts are the roaring jets that propel your car. They’re loud, they’re proud, and they’re essential. But the TP Boost, a cosmetic item you can equip, is in a league of its own. It doesn’t roar; it screams. It’s a high-pitched, piercing, metallic shriek that feels like it’s drilling directly into my brain.

You see, I’m autistic and have ADHD. My nervous system doesn’t have a reliable volume knob; it’s more like a broken amplifier that sometimes turns a whisper into a shout and a shout into a physical blow. The TP Boost is that shout, every single time. In the chaotic heat of a match, when four or five cars are all using it at once, the sensory overload is immediate and overwhelming. My focus shatters, my hands tense up, and the fun just… evaporates. It’s not a skill issue; it’s an accessibility issue.

In 2023, we talk a lot about inclusivity in gaming. We have colour-blind modes, text-to-speech, and remappable controls. These are fantastic, life-changing additions. But I’m sitting here, literally begging developers to consider the audio landscape as part of that inclusivity. A simple, global volume slider for specific boost sounds, or even the ability to mute certain cosmetic audio effects client-side, would be a game-changer. It wouldn’t affect anyone else’s experience, but it would allow players like me to stay in the game we love.

I don’t want to quit Rocket League. I want to be able to enjoy its beautiful, chaotic symphony without one instrument causing genuine distress. Because everyone, regardless of how their brain is wired, deserves a chance to score that epic, game-winning goal.
