It was supposed to be a simple fix. My car had that tell-tale clicking on turns, a classic sign of a failing CV axle. I’d even done my homework, looking up the part on RockAuto to get a sense of the cost. So when the mechanic gave me the initial estimate, I felt prepared.

Then the call came. The price had somehow ballooned to $700. No warning, no consultation—just a new total that felt like a gut punch. It wasn't just the money; it was the feeling of powerlessness. In a world where transparency is everything, from food labels to app permissions, this old-school lack of communication felt like a betrayal. It’s a stark reminder that in 2023, trust isn't just about the quality of the work—it's about respecting the customer enough to have an honest conversation before the bill doubles.
