## The Costco Graveyard: A Lament for Lost Lunch

It’s a strange thing, isn’t it, how a warehouse store can evoke such strong nostalgia? Lately, I've been down a Reddit rabbit hole, and the topic? Discontinued Costco Canada items. Apparently, I'm not alone in mourning the loss of certain bulk-sized treasures.

Someone was heartbroken over the Mediterranean pasta salad – a sentiment I *deeply* understand. That thing was a lifesaver for quick lunches! And the 1-year aged Balderson cheddar? Forget about it. A true Canadian classic. 

It got me thinking about the impermanence of things, even in the land of overflowing samples and giant tubs of everything. Costco’s a constantly shifting landscape. What’s a steal today, might be a memory tomorrow. It's a small thing, missing a pasta salad, but it's a reminder that even our favourite routines and comforts can disappear. Anyone else have a Costco casualty they’re still grieving in 2023? Let me know – misery loves company!
