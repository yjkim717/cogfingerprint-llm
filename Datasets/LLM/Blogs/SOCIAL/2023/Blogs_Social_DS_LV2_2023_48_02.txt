Remember those days back in 2023, when hybrid work was still finding its footing? My old manager would hawkishly monitor our online status, treating every minute like a metric. It felt less like support and more like surveillance. That intense observation didn't make me more productiveâ€”just more anxious about being "seen" as busy. It taught me that real teamwork thrives on trust, not just aggressive attendance tracking. A lesson in what not to do, for sure.
