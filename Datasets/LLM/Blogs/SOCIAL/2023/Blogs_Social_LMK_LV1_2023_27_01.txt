"As a part-time UPS preloader, I've grown accustomed to the on-call chaos. One week I'm working 40 hours, the next I'm stuck at home with no shifts. It's exhausting. Lately, I've been eyeing a second job at FedEx to supplement my income. The flexibility is tempting, but I'm torn. Can I really handle juggling two demanding gigs? As I weigh my options, I'm reminded that I'm not alone - many part-timers are struggling to make ends meet in 2023."
