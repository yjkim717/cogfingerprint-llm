## The Filtered Reality & My Frustrated Selfie Game

Anyone else feel like Snapchat filters are basically a requirement for existing in 2023? Lately, though, my attempts at flawless selfies have been… failing. My Oppo Find X3 Lite’s front camera is just *not* cooperating – constant noise, weird lighting. It's a stark reminder that even with all the tech, chasing that 'perfect' online image can be a real struggle. Makes you wonder, right? Are we all just hiding behind a carefully curated facade? 



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
