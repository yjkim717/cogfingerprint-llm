It’s 2023, and I should be logging into Overwatch 2 excited for a few good matches. Instead, I find myself hesitating. I love the heroes, the strategy, the thrill of a close game—but lately, that’s not what I’m signing up for.

I’m bracing for another lopsided match, likely decided by a smurf account on the other team. I’m steeling myself for the chorus of toxic chat that erupts at the first misplay. The core game is a blast, but the ecosystem around it—the poor balancing and punishing matchmaking—feels like it’s actively working against my fun.

It’s a strange feeling when something you enjoy starts to feel like a chore. I wonder how many others are sitting in the same menu, feeling the same frustration, and just… clicking exit instead.
