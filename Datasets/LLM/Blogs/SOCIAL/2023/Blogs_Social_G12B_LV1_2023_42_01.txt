## "Captain" or "Director"? Why Do Women Still Need a Title Upgrade?

It's 2023, and we're supposedly making strides. Yet, I was scrolling through Twitter the other day and it hit me: how often do we see female characters – and even real-world women – feel the need to *add* something to their title to be taken seriously? Like, “Director Anya Sharma” versus just “Anya Sharma.” Or seeing a female captain in *Star Trek: The Next Generation* constantly emphasizing her rank.

It’s weird, right? We rarely hear a male CEO described as “Mr. CEO.” It's just "the CEO." But for women, there's this subconscious pressure to over-emphasize authority, to layer on the title like armor. I even noticed it in *Castle*, a show I love – Kate Beckett constantly having to prove she’s *Detective Beckett*, not just “Beckett.”

I wonder if it's a lingering echo of ingrained societal expectations. Do we, consciously or not, need that extra reinforcement to accept a woman in a leadership role? It's a thought that sticks with you, and a reminder that dismantling these ingrained biases is a constant, ongoing process. What are your thoughts? Have you noticed this pattern too?
