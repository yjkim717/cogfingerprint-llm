## Do You *Really* Think You're the Only One?

Okay, let's be honest. We’ve all been there. You see a movie everyone raves about, a book everyone calls a masterpiece, and… you just *don't* connect. Then comes the inevitable internal questioning: "Am I the only one who feels this way?"

Recently, I was reading about *The Shawshank Redemption* (yes, the classic!), and someone pointed out something fascinating. That question itself – "Am I the only one?" – is often just a figure of speech! A way of emphasizing a feeling of being different, not a literal declaration of unique dislike.

It struck a chord. How often do we get caught up in feeling like outliers, when really, lots of people might share our unconventional opinions? It’s a comforting thought, isn't it? Maybe being a little different isn't so bad after all.
