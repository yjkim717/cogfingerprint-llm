Scrolling through Twitter lately feels like wading through a political minefield. As a queer person, I just want a digital corner to share my thoughts without the constant arguments and negativity. I’m craving a kinder platform where my identity isn’t a debate topic. Maybe it’s time to log off and find a space that feels less like a battleground and more like a community.
