## The Unexpected Power of Sharing (and a Very Literal Kid)

Remember those awkward "sharing time" moments in school? They still pop into my head sometimes. Just the other day, my niece shared a story about her teacher asking the class to share their favorite things. Little Leo, bless his heart, stood up and presented… a single, perfectly ripe strawberry. Dead serious. It was hilarious, and a surprisingly poignant reminder: sometimes, sharing isn't about grand gestures, but about offering exactly what you have, however small. It’s a lesson we could all use in 2023.
