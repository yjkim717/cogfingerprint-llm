## The Unexpected Barrier: When Gaming Accessibility Isn't Obvious

I’ve been hitting Rocket League a *lot* lately. It’s my go-to for de-stressing after a long day, a chaotic ballet of cars and goals that just… clicks. But recently, something’s been really throwing me off my game. It's not my skills (though those are always a work in progress!), it's a sound. Specifically, the *TP Boost* sound.

Now, for most people, it's probably just a quick "whoosh" when you teleport across the field. But for me, someone with Autism and ADHD, it’s a jarring, almost physically painful blast. Seriously. It’s loud, sudden, and completely overpowers everything else happening in the game.

I stumbled across a thread on Reddit the other day where someone else – also autistic – was making a similar plea to Psyonix, the game developers. They were politely, passionately, asking for a volume control option for individual sounds, specifically the TP Boost. It hit me hard. It wasn’t about *me* being overly sensitive; it was about a design choice that unintentionally creates a significant barrier for a segment of players.

It's a really sobering thought. We often talk about accessibility in gaming in terms of visual impairments, control schemes, and things that are immediately apparent. But sensory sensitivities? Those are often overlooked. It’s easy to assume everyone experiences audio the same way.

I’ve started thinking about how many other seemingly minor design choices across games, and even apps, might be creating unintentional roadblocks for people with sensory processing differences. It's not about demanding special treatment, but about recognizing that "standard" isn't universal. 

I'm hoping Psyonix sees this feedback and considers adding that volume control. It would be a small change with a potentially huge impact on the enjoyment of countless players. And it’s a reminder that accessibility isn’t just about making games playable; it’s about making them *enjoyable* for everyone.
