**The Tiny Device That Changed My Perspective (and Maybe My Pain)**

Okay, let’s be real. Social media can be a *lot*. Scrolling through endless feeds of perfectly curated lives, filtered sunsets, and everyone seemingly effortlessly crushing it – it can leave you feeling… a little bit inadequate, right? I’ve definitely been there. Lately, I’ve been trying to be more mindful of what I’m consuming, and honestly, it’s been a process. 

I’ve always been a bit of a people-pleaser, you know?  I tend to measure my worth – and my happiness – by how others perceive me.  Likes, comments, shares… they felt like little validation hits, a desperate attempt to feel seen and heard in a world that can sometimes feel overwhelmingly loud.  But it was exhausting. And, if I'm being truly honest, it wasn't actually *filling* me up. 

Recently, I read a really interesting story about a woman who’d been battling endometriosis and was considering a Mirena IUD. She was sharing her anxieties about the procedure, the recovery, and honestly, the whole thing.  What really struck me wasn’t the medical details – though those were reassuring – but her raw honesty about feeling vulnerable and uncertain. 

It reminded me of a similar feeling I'd been carrying around for a while.  I’ve struggled with chronic pain for years, and a lot of my energy has been spent trying to *look* okay, to hide the discomfort, to project an image of strength when, really, I was just trying to survive each month.  It’s a weird kind of performance, isn’t it? 

The woman’s story, and her eventual surprisingly manageable recovery after getting the IUD, gave me a little bit of hope.  It wasn't about chasing external validation. It was about taking a proactive step for *herself*. 

I’m still working on it, of course.  Unfollowing accounts that make me feel bad about myself, focusing on connections that genuinely lift me up, and reminding myself that my worth isn't tied to a number on a screen.  It’s about shifting my focus inward, towards my own well-being and recognizing that my experiences, even the difficult ones, are valid. 

Maybe social media doesn't have to be this constant competition. Maybe it can be a space for connection, for sharing, and for celebrating the messy, beautiful reality of being human.  And maybe, just maybe, it’s okay to not be ‘perfect’ – or even to show up with a little bit of pain. 

What about you? How are you navigating the social landscape in 2023?  Let’s chat in the comments.
