You know, it’s funny—I was making broth last week, staring into that wide pot, when it hit me. We’re all a little like that simmering liquid, aren’t we? In 2023, with so much pressure to be “productive,” it’s easy to shrink ourselves into tall, slim containers—focused, efficient, but closed off.

But growth, like evaporation, needs space. A wider surface lets more steam rise, more flavor develop. Maybe that’s why we crave real connection: sharing stories over coffee, laughing in a crowded room. We need the open, simmering moments, not just the boiling hustle. So here’s to choosing wider circles, deeper talks, and letting ourselves breathe. After all, the richest broth—and the richest lives—need room to bloom.
