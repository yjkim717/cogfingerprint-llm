Navigating the maze of Czech syllables felt like trying to solve a puzzle without the picture on the box. In 2023, as I sat in a Prague café, my language app flashed words like "prosím" and "krk"—where do you even split those clustered consonants? Each attempt was a humbling reminder that learning isn't linear. But with every halting syllable, I wasn't just dividing words; I was connecting more deeply with the rhythm of a culture, one consonant at a time.
