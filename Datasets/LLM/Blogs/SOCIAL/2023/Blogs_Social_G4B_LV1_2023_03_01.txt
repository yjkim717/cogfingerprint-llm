**The Day My Toddler Went Nuclear (and Social Media Amplified It)**

Okay, deep breaths everyone. Last week was… intense. My little Leo had a full-blown preschool meltdown – and it happened in the middle of the playground. It started with a simple thing: a teacher capitalizing his name on the whiteboard. Seriously? It felt like a tiny, personal affront. 

I lost it. A *lot*. Loud voices, frustrated tears, the whole shebang. And, of course, someone filmed it and posted it to social media. Suddenly, I was the “crazy mom.” 

It’s so easy to judge from behind a screen, isn't it? I realize now I reacted completely out of control.  I’m still unpacking it. It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, a tiny misunderstanding can snowball into a huge, public spectacle.  I’m working on better strategies for *my* behavior, and hoping for a little more empathy online.
