**The Ghost of "FWB"**

Scrolling through Instagram last night, I saw a picture of an old friend – someone I’d had a “friend with benefits” situation with years ago. It instantly hit me with a weird wave of… nostalgia? It’s a bizarre feeling, right? 

I’m currently in a solid, happy relationship, but the memory sparked this unsettling flicker of attraction. It’s a little shameful to admit, but the ghost of that past connection lingered.  

It made me think about how easily we can get caught up in the *what ifs* of past experiences, especially in the age of constant social media glimpses into other people's lives.  Are we truly over someone, or are we just keeping a tiny part of them alive?  What do you guys think? #relationships #reflection #FOMO
