>## The Great Desk Hunt of '23

Okay, confession time: I'm obsessed with those sleek IKEA Alex desks. But the price tag? Ouch. This year, I decided to DIY a workspace on a budget. My mission: Menards. Seriously, wandering those aisles felt like a treasure hunt! Mixing and matching shelving units and a solid-core door for the tabletop proved surprisingly satisfying. It's not *quite* an Alex, but itâ€™s functional, affordable, and feels uniquely *mine*. Plus, bragging rights for building it myself? Priceless. #DIYdesk #budgetdecor #menardsfinds
