It’s 2023, and I just finished watching a popular sci-fi series. The world-building was incredible—flying cars, holograms, you name it. But one thing stuck with me, and not in a good way: the female commander, powerful and brilliant, was still addressed as “Sir.”

It’s a small detail, but it speaks volumes. Why must a woman in a position of authority adopt a male title to command respect? It’s a subtle reinforcement of the idea that leadership and gender are still inexplicably linked, that the default image of a leader is male.

It’s frustrating. We’re crafting futures with unimaginable technology, yet we’re recycling outdated gender norms. True progress isn’t just about the gadgets; it’s about ensuring that representation and identity aren’t left behind. A woman’s authority should be enough, just as she is.
