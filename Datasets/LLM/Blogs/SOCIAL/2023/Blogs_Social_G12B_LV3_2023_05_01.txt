## The Laptop Dilemma: Remote Work Realities in 2023

So, I made the leap. Joined a bigger company in the mortgage world, fully remote, and feeling pretty fantastic about it. The freedom of working from anywhere? Amazing. But then I hit a snag. I’d gotten used to having a company laptop for travel at my previous, smaller job – a huge convenience for hopping between coffee shops and, let’s be honest, occasionally working from a scenic vista. 

Now, my current employer says no. Just a desktop. 

Is it me? Did I ask for this benefit too soon? It’s a small thing, really, but it’s got me thinking about the evolving landscape of remote work. Are we all expected to just… adapt? Or is there room to advocate for what makes our WFH lives truly sustainable? Still pondering that one.
