## That *L Word* Scene Still Bothering Me...

Okay, fellow Gen X/Millennial TV watchers, let's talk. I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day dissecting a specific scene between Kit and Max in the original *L Word*, and it really struck a chord. Something about it just feltâ€¦off. Like it didn't quite land with Kit's established personality. 

It got me thinking about how shows can occasionally miss the mark, even with beloved characters. Do you ever feel that way about a storyline? It's a reminder that even the shows we adore aren't always perfect, and sometimes, those inconsistencies stick with us. Anyone else relate?
