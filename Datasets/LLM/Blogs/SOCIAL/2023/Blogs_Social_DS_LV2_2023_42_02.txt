It was just $60. That’s what I kept telling myself last Tuesday, standing in a grocery line with a declined NetSpend card. My face burned with a mix of panic and humiliation. That tiny amount was my buffer, my last shred of financial dignity before a cascade of late bills and the very real threat of losing my apartment.

In 2023, we’re told everything is at our fingertips, yet here I was, completely locked out of my own money. A labyrinth of automated customer service menus and vague policies had built a wall between me and survival. It wasn't about a luxury; it was about toilet paper and bread.

The experience was a brutal reminder of how fragile our footing can be. We place our trust in systems, in little plastic cards, believing they’ll work. When they don’t, the ground doesn't just shift—it falls away, leaving you staring into an abyss you never thought you’d see from the checkout aisle.
