**The Strange Language of Limbs**

There’s something deeply unsettling, yet fascinating, about watching old silent films. You’re bombarded with emotion, a whole world communicated without a single word, and then you see it – the actor, after a gunshot, violently flailing their legs. It’s a bizarre, almost frantic gesture. 

I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately, and it feels like a visual representation of how we communicate vulnerability in the pre-digital age. Before instant reactions and carefully crafted social media posts, actors had to *show* you how someone felt. That leg-flailing wasn’t just a visual trick; it was a desperate plea for empathy, a raw, physical embodiment of shock and pain. 

It makes me wonder about our own online interactions. Do we truly *see* each other, or are we just projecting carefully curated versions of ourselves?  Maybe there’s a lesson in that silent film – a reminder to meet others with genuine presence, to let our “limbs” speak honestly, even when it’s uncomfortable. 2023 feels like a time we desperately need that.
