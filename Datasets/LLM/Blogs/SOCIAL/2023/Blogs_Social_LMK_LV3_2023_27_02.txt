Navigating modern dating can be tricky, especially when it comes to something as simple as paying the bill. When a coworker turned date expressed discomfort with me covering expenses, I was taken aback. As we plan our second outing, I'm left wondering: should I insist on splitting the bill or find another way to show my interest without overspending? Clear communication and respecting boundaries are key in 2023 dating etiquette. Perhaps it's time to redefine what it means to be a gentleman and prioritize mutual comfort over traditional norms.
