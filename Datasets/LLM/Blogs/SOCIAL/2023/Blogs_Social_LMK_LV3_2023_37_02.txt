"Stepping into the world of late modern fantasy is like uncovering a hidden gem. As I dive into stories set between 1800 and WWII, I'm captivated by the blend of historical fiction and alternate history, often with a dash of mythology, like dragons. These tales transport me to a bygone era, reimagined with magic and wonder. In 2023, revisiting these narratives makes me reflect on how our understanding of history shapes our present."
