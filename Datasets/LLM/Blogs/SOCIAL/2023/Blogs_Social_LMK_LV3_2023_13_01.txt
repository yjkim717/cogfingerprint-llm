"Finding a church home in a new city can be daunting, especially in a vibrant community like Dallas. As I navigated this journey, I sought a non-denominational church that felt like family. I discovered that an evangelical church with intergenerational small groups was the perfect fit. It was a place where my family could grow together, fostering meaningful connections and a deeper faith."
