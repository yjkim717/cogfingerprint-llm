It’s funny how a simple GTA Online bounty turned into a real-life lesson for me. There I was, a low-level player with barely any gear, trying to survive 48 minutes with a target on my back. I spent the whole time ducking into alleyways, hiding on rooftops, and nervously watching the mini-map.

But it got me thinking—isn’t that just like dealing with anxiety in 2023? Always feeling watched, scrambling for safe spaces, and just trying to make it through the day. That virtual chase mirrored how so many of us are just trying to survive, unseen and overwhelmed. Sometimes, games reflect more reality than we realize.
