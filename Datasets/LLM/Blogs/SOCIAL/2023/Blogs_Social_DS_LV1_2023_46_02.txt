### Why We Over-React in a World of Noise

It’s funny what you notice when you fall down a YouTube rabbit hole. Last night, I ended up watching clips from 1920s silent westerns. The thing that struck me wasn’t the sepia tones or the title cards—it was the death scenes. A cowboy gets shot and immediately launches into a spectacular, leg-kicking ballet before dramatically collapsing.

Back then, without sound or gore, actors had to *show* death. That theatrical, almost exaggerated performance was essential for the audience to understand the moment’s gravity.

It got me thinking about 2023. We’re drowning in information and content. To be heard, to be seen, to make our point, don’t we all feel a little pressure to “kick our legs”? To amplify our reactions online, to perform our outrage or our joy just to ensure the message lands in a crowded digital theater.

Maybe we haven’t evolved that much from the silent film era. We’re just using different tools to shout, “Pay attention to this! This is important!” Sometimes, I wonder what we’re losing in all that noise, and if a little more subtlety might actually help us connect better.
