## Are We Even Talking About the Same Thing?

It's been swirling around my social media lately – passionate debates about capitalism and socialism. And honestly, it feels… messy. I noticed a Reddit thread the other day pointing out something crucial: people on both sides seem to be operating with completely different definitions. 

It’s frustrating, isn't it? When we’re not clear on what we *mean*, how can we possibly have a productive conversation? Maybe in 2023, a little less shouting and a lot more clarifying our terms is exactly what we need to actually move forward. Just a thought!
