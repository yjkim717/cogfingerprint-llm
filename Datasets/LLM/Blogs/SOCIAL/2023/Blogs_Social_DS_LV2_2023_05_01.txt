It’s 2023, and I’m still wrapping my head around this one: my company champions remote work, but when I asked for a laptop to stay productive while traveling between states, I got a hard no. How does that square with our flexible "work from anywhere" culture?

It feels like we’re caught between old policies and new realities. If we truly value output over location, shouldn’t our tools reflect that? Here’s to hoping for a little more trust—and maybe a lighter carry-on someday soon.
