**The Echo in the Scroll**

Scrolling through Instagram lately feels…heavy.  Everyone’s highlight reel is shining so bright, and it’s easy to feel like you’re drowning in a sea of perfectly curated happiness. I’ve been there, desperately searching for that little spark of hope when I’m battling my own shadows – a particularly dark period colored by a really difficult relationship and the usual anxieties of being 21 in 2023. 

It’s tempting to compare yourself, isn’t it? To feel a pang of depression when you see someone jet-setting across Europe or celebrating a seemingly flawless engagement. But I’m learning that those images aren’t the whole story.  

Recovery isn’t about erasing the hard stuff; it’s about finding the quiet strength to acknowledge it, to seek support, and to gently remind yourself that *your* journey, *your* hope, is valid. Maybe it’s just unfollowing a few accounts and filling your feed with things that genuinely lift you up.  It’s a start.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
