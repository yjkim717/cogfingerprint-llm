**The Scroll & The Shame**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Scrolling through Instagram and seeing everyone’s ‘perfect’ lives, then feeling this awful, creeping shame about my own. Lately, I’ve been battling a really dark cycle – a pull to restrict, then a frantic purge. It’s exhausting, and honestly, terrifying. I’m trying to step away from the highlight reel and focus on my own messy, real recovery.  Sending love to anyone else fighting this too. ❤️ #eatingdisorder #recovery #mentalhealth 2023
