**The Night I Lost Sleep (and Found a New Perspective)**

Okay, real talk – 2023 has been… a lot. Last month, my bed broke, and I impulsively bought a floor mattress. Sounds crazy, right? It was a disaster at first. Seriously awful sleep difficulty.

Anyone else find resilience in the weirdest places? #sleepproblems #bedtransition #selfreflection
