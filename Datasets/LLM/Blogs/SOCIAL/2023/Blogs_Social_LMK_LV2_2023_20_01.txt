As I lay in bed, the incessant dog barking outside my window felt like a never-ending nightmare. I'd tried earplugs, white noise machines, and even noise-cancelling headphones, but nothing seemed to drown out the noise. It's 2023, and you'd think we'd have a solution for noise pollution, but it remains a pervasive issue. I'm not alone in my struggle - many of us are desperate for a good night's sleep. Has anyone found a reliable sleep solution that actually works? I'm still on the hunt.
