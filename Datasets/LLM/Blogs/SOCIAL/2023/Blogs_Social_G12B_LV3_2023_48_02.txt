## The Scroll and the Second Guess

It's 2023, and social media feels…intense. We’re all, to some degree, *scrutinizing* each other's highlight reels. Sometimes, I catch myself being *vigilant*, almost *obsessively* checking for typos or questionable captions. It’s exhausting! I wonder if we've become too *intent* on policing online behavior, *zealously* pointing out minor flaws. Maybe a little less judgment and a little more grace is what we all need.
