## The Weight of "What If?" & That Carrier Screening Test

So, I’m pregnant. Officially, wonderfully, *terrifyingly* pregnant. And alongside the joy and excitement, there’s this low hum of anxiety that’s become a constant companion. We’ve been talking a lot about genetic carrier screening, even though there’s no family history of any disorders. It feels… strange, right? Like poking around for potential problems where there aren't any obvious signs. 

But the more I read, the more I understand the peace of mind it *could* offer. It's a deeply personal decision, balancing potential worry with the chance to prepare. Anyone else grappling with this in 2023? It's a lot to process!
