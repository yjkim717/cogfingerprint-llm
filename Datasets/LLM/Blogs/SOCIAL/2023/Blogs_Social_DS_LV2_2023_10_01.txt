It’s funny how a single error message in my code—ModuleNotFoundError—can feel so much like those moments in life when you’re trying to connect but just can’t find the way in.

I was building a Flask app last week, convinced my directory structure was perfect. Yet, Python kept telling me something was missing. It reminded me of trying to fit into a new social circle: you show up, you’re prepared, but the pieces just don’t align. The invisible walls between modules felt like the unspoken barriers between people.

In 2023, we’re more connected than ever, yet loneliness lingers. We have all the tools—social media, messaging apps—but sometimes, the import fails. The real magic happens not in having all the right files, but in understanding the paths that bring them together. Maybe it’s the same with us: it’s not about having more friends, but nurturing the connections that truly import joy into our lives.
