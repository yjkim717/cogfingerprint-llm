As I scrolled through YouTube in 2023, a Royal Caribbean cruise video sparked a debate in my mind - what's the right tip amount per bag? With inflation on the rise, I wondered if the standard $5-$10 per bag was still a common courtesy or had become outdated. I'd love to hear from fellow cruisers: are we expected to adjust our tipping habits to keep pace with the times, or is there a universal standard we're missing?
