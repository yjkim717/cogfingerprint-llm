### Finding Our Own Happy Ending in a World on Fire

Let’s be real, 2023 has felt a bit like being dropped into the Shadow-Cursed Lands. Between the constant news cycle, economic anxieties, and the general sense that things are teetering on the edge, it’s easy to feel like we’re just fending off one psychic blast after another. I’ve spent more time than I’d like to admit doomscrolling, feeling a collective dread that’s as pervasive as any Illithid tadpole.

That’s why my recent playthrough of *Baldur’s Gate 3* hit me so hard. After countless hours battling Absolute cultists and dodging Avernus’s devils, my ragtag group of companions finally got their happy ending. The tiefling found her family, the vampire spawn embraced the sun, and the wizard, well, he finally got some peace and quiet. It was deeply satisfying, not because we saved the world, but because we saved each other.

It got me thinking. We can’t slay the literal brain monster at the center of our real-world problems, but we can be someone’s Selûne temple—a small, defiant pocket of light in the darkness. It’s the friend who sends a “thinking of you” text, the coworker who covers for you when you’re overwhelmed, or the community group planting trees in a neglected park.

The big, world-ending threats will always be there, vying for our attention. But the real victory, the true “good ending,” is forged in these small, personal connections. It’s about ensuring our own little party of companions makes it through, not just intact, but happier and more supported. Maybe that’s the real quest all along.
