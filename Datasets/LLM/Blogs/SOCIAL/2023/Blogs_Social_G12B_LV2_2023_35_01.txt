## The Rust Never Sleeps (and Neither Does a Toyota Pickup)

Okay, real talk. Anyone who’s ever owned an older vehicle knows the feeling: that sinking dread when you realize a seemingly simple repair is being thwarted by…rust. This week, I was battling it firsthand. My buddy on Reddit was wrestling with stripped and rusted bolts on his 90s Toyota pickup – a common story, honestly. 

It's frustrating, right? You’re trying to be handy, save some money, and suddenly you’re staring down a bolt that refuses to budge.  He specifically *didn’t* want to use a cutting torch, which I totally get – safety first! 

It reminded me of that time I tried to fix a taillight myself. Let's just say, I learned a valuable lesson about patience (and maybe calling a mechanic sooner!).  Anyone else got tales of automotive woe? Share them in the comments – misery loves company! #ToyotaPickup #BoltRemoval #MechanicAdvice #DIY #RustBucket
