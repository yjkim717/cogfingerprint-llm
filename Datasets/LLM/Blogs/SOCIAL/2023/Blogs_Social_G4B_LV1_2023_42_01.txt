**Still Saying "Sir"? Seriously, 2023?**

Okay, let’s talk about something that still bugs me – and I suspect it should bug *you* too. I was rewatching *Star Trek* the other day, a show that was supposed to be about the future, and I heard someone address a brilliant, capable woman officer as “Sir.” Seriously? 

It felt like a tiny, frustrating punch to the gut. Like we haven't moved past this basic assumption that a woman’s worth is somehow tied to a male title.  

It’s not just about Star Trek, of course. It’s about the subtle, and not-so-subtle, ways ingrained gender roles still show up in our society. Leadership isn't a man’s domain, and addressing anyone with a title based on their gender feels reductive.  

Let’s be better. Let's just… *see* people.  What are your thoughts? Let’s discuss! #genderequality #StarTrek #socialcommentary

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
