**The Selfie Struggle is Real (and My Oppo’s Not Helping)**

Okay, friends, let’s be honest – 2023 has been a *lot* of selfies. Between TikTok trends and just wanting to share little moments with loved ones, my phone’s front camera has been getting a serious workout. Lately, though, I’ve been hitting a wall with my Oppo X3 Lite. The light is always off, the image noise is surprisingly high, and the camera app just feels… limited. It’s frustrating when a little thing like that can throw off the whole vibe, right?  Anyone else feeling this digital disconnect?
