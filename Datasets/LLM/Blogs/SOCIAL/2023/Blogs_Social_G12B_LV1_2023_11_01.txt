## The Unexpected Lesson in Sharing (and Boogers?)

My son came home from kindergarten today with a story that completely floored me. Apparently, when asked why he didn't share his cookies with the class, his explanation was, and I quote, "Because I didn't have enough boogers to trade!" 

Seriously. 

It's 2023, and kids are operating on a completely different social currency than I ever understood. It made me laugh, but also think. What *are* the arbitrary things kids value in social interactions? Is it truly about the cookies, or is it about something else entirely â€“ a quirky exchange, a silly inside joke? Maybe sharing isn't always about the tangible.
