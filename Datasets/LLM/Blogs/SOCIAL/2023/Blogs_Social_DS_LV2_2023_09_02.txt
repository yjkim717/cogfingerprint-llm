You know, it’s funny—I was watching *Strange New Worlds* and couldn’t help but notice the Klingons seem… different. A bit shorter, maybe less growly. It got me thinking: isn’t that just like real life? We all adjust our presence depending on the situation, softening our edges to fit in. Maybe the Klingons are just evolving, like we do. It’s a subtle reminder that even in a galaxy far away, change is the one constant we all share.
