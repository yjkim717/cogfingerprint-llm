Walking through the train station in Prague last summer, I was surrounded by a symphony of Slavic voices—some soft and melodic, others sharp and rhythmic. At first, they all blurred together, like a river of unfamiliar sounds. But as I lingered, I started noticing the subtle differences: the gentle lilt of Czech, the crisp consonants of Polish, the flowing cadence of Russian.

It reminded me that even without knowing the languages, our ears can pick up on those unique phonetic fingerprints. In a world where we often lump cultures together, there’s something deeply human about learning to distinguish, to appreciate the small details that make each voice distinct. It’s not about being an expert—it’s about listening closely, and finding connection in the diversity that surrounds us.
