There’s a special kind of exhaustion that comes from nights spent tossing and turning, thanks to the neighbor’s dog who seems to think 3 a.m. is prime barking hour. In 2023, with so many of us working from home and craving quiet, that relentless noise felt like a personal attack on my sanity.

I tried everything—from polite notes to earplugs—before landing on a humble white noise machine. It didn’t just drown out the barking; it taught me a lesson in modern coexistence. Sometimes, the solution isn’t about silencing the world, but finding your own peace within the chaos. And honestly, that’s a win worth sharing.
