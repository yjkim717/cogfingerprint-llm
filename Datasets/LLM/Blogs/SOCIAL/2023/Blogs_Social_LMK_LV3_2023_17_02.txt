The wait feels never-ending. Like many, I ordered my Subaru Crosstrek in November, but the chip shortage has delayed my car delivery. As I count down the days until mid-February, I'm anxious to get my VIN and finalize the details. With a move looming, I'm eager to have my new ride sorted. It's a reminder that some things are beyond our control. For now, I'll take a deep breath and focus on the excitement of starting fresh in a new place, behind the wheel of my trusty Crosstrek.
