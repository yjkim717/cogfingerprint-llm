**Scrolling & Soul-Searching**

Okay, let’s be real – 2023 has been a *lot* of scrolling. I’ve spent way too many evenings lost in the highlight reels of other people’s lives, and honestly, it’s left me feeling a little…empty.  It’s weird, isn’t it? We’re more connected than ever, yet sometimes it feels incredibly isolating. 

I started intentionally muting a few accounts that just consistently made me compare myself.  It’s surprisingly liberating!  Now, I’m trying to focus on the real connections I *do* have, and finding joy in my own little corner of the internet.  Maybe we all need a little less ‘gram and a little more genuine moments.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a blog post on a different topic?
