## The Unexpected Joy of Shared Laughter: Why Live Opera Still Matters

There's something almost quaint about it in 2023, isn't there? Going to the opera. Surrounded by… *people*. In person. No scrolling, no notifications, just a collective experience unfolding in real time. I'll admit, I was a little hesitant heading into a performance of Rossini’s *The Barber of Seville* at the San Jose Opera last weekend. My social media feed is a constant hum of perfectly curated content, and the thought of putting down my phone and truly *being* present felt… daunting.

But I’m so glad I did.

From the moment the curtain rose, I was swept away. The music, of course, was glorious – Rossini's wit and energy practically leap off the stage. But what really struck me was the *laughter*. Genuine, uninhibited laughter rippling through the audience. It wasn't polite chuckles; it was the kind of belly laughs that connect you to the people around you in a way that a screen simply can’t. 

And Nikola Printz? Phenomenal. His portrayal of Figaro was electric, a whirlwind of comedic timing and vocal brilliance. You could feel the energy radiating from him, and it was infectious. It wasn’t just *his* performance; it was *our* experience, amplified by his talent.

It made me think about how much we’ve lost in the digital age. We’re hyper-connected, yet often profoundly isolated. We share snippets of our lives online, but rarely experience the joy of shared moments, of reacting together, of feeling a collective pulse. 

Seeing *The Barber of Seville* wasn’t just about appreciating beautiful music and a clever story. It was about remembering the power of human connection. It was a reminder that sometimes, the best experiences aren’t about broadcasting yourself to the world, but about being fully present in a room with others, sharing a laugh, and creating a memory that lingers long after the final curtain falls. Maybe it’s time we all sought out a little more of that – a little more shared laughter, a little more real-world connection.
