>## The Great Scroll Detox of '23

Okay, real talk. Anyone else feeling… drained by social media lately? Specifically, Twitter? It’s become a relentless barrage of political shouting, outrage cycles, and just… negativity. I miss the days of sharing silly memes and random thoughts without feeling like I needed a news briefing afterwards. 

So, I’m on a quest. A quest for a gentler corner of the internet. Something where I can share pictures of my cat and vent about burnt toast without triggering an existential crisis. Maybe it’s a niche platform, maybe it’s just a drastic reduction in scrolling time - but I need a space to breathe and just *be* online, you know? Anyone else feeling this and finding alternatives? Let's chat!
