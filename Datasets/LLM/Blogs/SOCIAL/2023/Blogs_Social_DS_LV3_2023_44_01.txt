### The Night the Barber Reminded Me to Listen

You know that feeling when you’re trying to have a deep, meaningful conversation in a noisy coffee shop? The clattering of cups and the chatter of strangers constantly pulling at your attention? That’s exactly what I felt, in the most unexpected of places, during a recent performance of Rossini’s *The Barber of Seville*.

It was a crisp 2023 evening at the beautiful California Theatre in San Jose. I’d been looking forward to this for weeks—a proper night out, a dose of culture, a chance to disconnect from the endless scroll of my phone. The Opera San Jose production was, by all accounts, delightful. The sets were vibrant, the orchestra was crisp, and then… Nikola Printz as Rosina took the stage.

From their first note, something shifted. Printz’s voice wasn’t just technically brilliant; it was a force of personality, a masterclass in wit and defiance. In the famous aria "Una voce poco fa," where Rosina sings about the "voice" that has captured her heart, Printz imbued every phrase with such playful intelligence. They weren’t just singing a beautiful melody; they were letting us in on a secret, showing us a woman who was clever, determined, and utterly in control of her own destiny, even while playing the part of the demure ward.

And that’s when the distractions began. A phone screen lit up like a tiny supernova three rows down. A whispered, overly loud commentary from the couple behind me about what they’d have for dinner later. The crinkling of a candy wrapper, timed perfectly with a moment of hushed anticipation.

I felt my shoulders tense. Annoyance bubbled up. *Can’t people just be present?*

But then, as I watched Printz’s Rosina navigate her own gilded cage with grace and cunning, a strange parallel dawned on me. Here was a character, in an art form centuries old, singing about the universal human desire to be truly *heard*. And here we were, a modern audience, struggling with the exact same thing. We’re all shouting our stories into the void, desperate for connection, yet we’re surrounded by a constant, low-grade static that makes genuine listening a conscious effort.

The rest of the performance was a battle—not just Figaro’s against Don Bartolo, but my own. I fought to focus on the artistry, to tune out the digital and social noise, to truly listen to the story being woven through Rossini’s sublime music. It was hard. And that’s the point, isn’t it?

Leaving the theatre, the hum of Rosina’s voice stayed with me. The evening wasn’t just a review of an opera; it was a mirror. It reminded me that the most beautiful moments—in art, in conversation, in life—require us to quiet the distractions, both around us and within us, and simply listen. It’s a skill we’re rapidly forgetting, and one I’m now, more than ever, determined to practice.
