"When Gaming Becomes Overwhelming: My Plea for a Quieter Rocket League"

As I sit here with my controller in hand, I'm transported back to the countless hours I've spent playing Rocket League. The thrill of scoring a goal, the rush of adrenaline as I dodge opponents, and the satisfaction of a well-timed boost all come flooding back. But, for me, there's a catch. You see, I'm one of the millions of people living with autism and ADHD, and certain aspects of the game can be, quite frankly, overwhelming.

One particular feature that has become a source of distress for me is the TP Boost sound effect. Don't get me wrong, it's exhilarating at first â€“ the loud, piercing sound that screams "YOU'RE FLYING, BABY!" can be intoxicating. But, for someone like me, it's also a sensory trigger. The sheer volume can be jarring, making my heart skip a beat and my anxiety spike. It's like someone is screaming in my ear, and I just can't tune it out.

I've tried to adjust, to power through, but it's getting to the point where I dread playing with TP Boost enabled. That's why I'm turning to Psyonix, the developers behind Rocket League, with a heartfelt plea: please, consider giving players the option to adjust or disable the TP Boost sound volume. It's not just about me; I'm sure there are others out there who share my struggles.

Gaming is supposed to be a source of joy, not stress. By making this simple change, Psyonix can create a more inclusive environment for players like me, allowing us to enjoy the game without the overwhelming sensory baggage. I hope they'll listen.
