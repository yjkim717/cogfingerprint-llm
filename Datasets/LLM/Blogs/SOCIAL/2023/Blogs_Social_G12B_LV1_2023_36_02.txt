## That Scene Stuck With Me…

Something’s been circling in my mind ever since a friend mentioned a movie scene. A Black woman, radiant in a hot pink dress, facing off with a white woman across a restaurant table. The quiet tension, punctuated only by the clink of a glass of water offered by a supportive friend… it felt loaded. It got me thinking about how subtly power dynamics play out, even in everyday settings. Just a moment, but so much unspoken. Anyone else feel that resonance?
