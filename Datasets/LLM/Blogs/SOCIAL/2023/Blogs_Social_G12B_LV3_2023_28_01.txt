## Justice Delayed? A Thought on YNW Kelly and Our Rights

Something's been weighing on my mind lately. I saw a post on Reddit about YNW Kelly, and it really struck a nerve. The idea of someone being held for so long before even seeing a jury? It feels unsettling. We all know the legal process can be slow, but shouldn't the right to a speedy trial be a cornerstone of our constitutional rights? It makes you wonder about fairness and what "justice" truly means in 2023.
