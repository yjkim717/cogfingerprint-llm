As I sit here, reflecting on my gaming experiences, I'm reminded of the importance of inclusivity in the gaming community. For many players, like myself, gaming is more than just a hobby - it's a way to connect with others, relax, and express ourselves. However, for individuals with sensory sensitivities, such as those with Autism and ADHD, certain sounds or visuals can be overwhelming, making it difficult to fully enjoy their gaming experience.

For me, playing Rocket League can be a thrilling experience, but the TP Boost sound effect has become a source of distress. The loud, piercing noise is not only startling but also triggers anxiety, making it challenging to focus on the game. I've found myself avoiding playing with others, simply because I don't want to be subjected to that intense sound. It's not just me; I've come across others in the gaming community who share similar concerns.

It's heartening to see that some game developers are taking steps to address these issues. Psyonix, the creators of Rocket League, have the power to make a significant difference by adjusting the volume of the TP Boost sound or providing options for players to customize their audio settings. By doing so, they can create a more inclusive environment, allowing players with sensory sensitivities to fully participate and enjoy the game.

As we move forward in 2023, it's essential that we prioritize accessibility and inclusivity in gaming. By listening to the needs of players and making simple adjustments, game developers can create a more welcoming space for everyone. It's time for Psyonix to take the next step and make Rocket League a more enjoyable experience for all players, regardless of their neurological makeup.
