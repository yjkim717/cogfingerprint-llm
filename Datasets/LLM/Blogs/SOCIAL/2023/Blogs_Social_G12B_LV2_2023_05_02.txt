## The Unexpected Detour: My Knee & the Online Echo Chamber

Okay, so things got a little… unexpected. A hairline fracture in my patella – who knew that could happen? I'm slowly regaining my knee range of motion, which is fantastic, but I’m wrestling with this question: should I *really* be keeping it straight?

It's funny how quickly you turn to the internet for answers. Forums, Facebook groups… a chorus of opinions! It’s comforting to know others have been through it, but also a little overwhelming. I’m learning to trust my physical therapist, and to listen to my own body, even when the online echo chamber says otherwise. Anyone else ever feel that disconnect?
