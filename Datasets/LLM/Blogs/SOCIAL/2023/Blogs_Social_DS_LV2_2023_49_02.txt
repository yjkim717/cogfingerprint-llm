It’s 2023, and I’m stuck in a loop—not just in Baldur’s Gate 3, where Art Cullagh’s quest has me hearing the same guard lines on repeat, but in life too. How often do we circle the same conversations, the same frustrations, without moving forward? It’s a digital glitch mirroring my own reality. But here’s the thing: sometimes, breaking free starts with asking for help, in games and beyond. What loops are you caught in? Maybe it’s time we hit reset together.
