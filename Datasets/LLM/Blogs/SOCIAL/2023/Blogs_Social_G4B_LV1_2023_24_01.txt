**The Worry About Tiny Things**

Okay, so I’ve been thinking a *lot* about this weird fascination we have with potential disasters lately. You know, like in games like *Starfield* – the idea of unleashing a single microbe, seemingly insignificant, and watching an entire ecosystem change. It’s unsettling, right? 

It made me think about how we react to social shifts, too. Like, a small, seemingly harmless trend spreading online can completely reshape how we communicate, how we build relationships. It’s a kind of “zoonosis” of culture, isn’t it? 

Honestly, the thought of intentionally releasing something – a *terrormorph* in a game, or a viral meme – feels less scary than the slow, unpredictable ways society can shift. Maybe we’re better at fearing the unknown when it’s monstrous, than when it’s just… tiny and persistent.  What do you think?
