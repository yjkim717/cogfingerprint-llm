**The Worrying Glow of “What If?”**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily we jump to the worst-case scenario? I was reading about this new “terrormorph” microbe supposedly discovered in a sci-fi game – Starfield, of all things – and it sparked something in me. 

We’re constantly bombarded with headlines about potential disasters, new diseases, ecological collapses… it’s exhausting!  It feels like we’re perpetually bracing for the *big* thing.  But the article I read pointed out a really important detail: existing diseases already pose a huge risk. 

Maybe, just maybe, the idea of a dramatically disruptive new microbe is a distraction.  Perhaps our focus should be on understanding and mitigating the threats *already* present, rather than constantly fearing something hypothetical.  It's a reminder that sometimes, acknowledging the reality of today is more productive than chasing the shadows of tomorrow. What do you think?
