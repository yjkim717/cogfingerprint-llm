**Title: The Ghost in My Phone and the Pills in My System**

It’s 2023, and my biggest heartbreak isn’t from a boyfriend, but from a “situationship.” You know the one—the phantom relationship that lives and dies in your DMs. The constant anxiety of waiting for a text that might never come became the soundtrack to my life, and it sent me spiraling into the worst depressive episode I’ve ever known.

At 21, I thought I was supposed to be having the time of my life. Instead, I was crying on my therapist’s virtual couch, feeling like a cliché. Starting Effexor felt like a surrender, but also the first real, concrete step toward getting my head above water.

I’m learning that healing isn’t a straight line. Some days the gray fog still rolls in, but now I have tools. I’m untangling my self-worth from a notification on a screen, and for the first time in a long time, that feels like a victory.
