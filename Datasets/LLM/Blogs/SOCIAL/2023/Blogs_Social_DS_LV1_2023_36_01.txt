### My Mid-Tier Gaming Glow-Up: Was It Worth It?

So, my HP TG01 desktop and I had a good run. For years, it handled my casual gaming sessions just fine. But as 2023's games started to stutter, I knew it was time for an intervention. I wasn't ready for a whole new rig, so I took the plunge on a targeted upgrade: swapping in an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 and doubling the RAM.

The physical installation was a nerve-wracking hour of gentle pushing and cable management. But booting up? Pure magic. Games that once chugged now run buttery smooth on higher settings. It’s amazing what a strategic upgrade can do. It feels less like I bought a new machine and more like I unlocked its hidden potential. For any fellow casual gamers feeling the lag, I can’t recommend this path enough—it’s a total game-changer without the flagship price tag.
