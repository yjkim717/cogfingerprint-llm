**Following the Leader – And Why It Feels So Right**

Okay, so I’ve been thinking a lot lately about leadership, and it weirdly made me think of *Pikmin*. You know, that little game where you follow Olimar around? There’s this one character, the King – a massive, imposing figure – and he just *looks* like a scaled-up, slightly grumpy Olimar.
