Of all the days in the year, your birthday is supposed to be the one where you feel seen. It’s the one day the universe—or at least your corner of it—is meant to acknowledge your existence. But this year, on my birthday in 2023, I felt more invisible than ever.

The day started with hope. I’d cleared my schedule, sent out gentle reminders to friends about the small gathering I’d planned, and even baked a cake. My phone stayed quiet. By noon, the only notification was a calendar alert for a work meeting I’d forgotten to decline. One by one, texts trickled in—not “I’m on my way!” but “So sorry, swamped with work,” or “Can we rain-check?” Each message felt like a tiny paper cut. By evening, it was just me, a slightly lopsided chocolate cake, and the hollow silence of my apartment.

It wasn’t just about the friends, though. My family—scattered across time zones—had been radio silent all day. A part of me kept waiting for my sister to call, for my mom to remember. But life moves fast for everyone, it seems, except for the person waiting by the phone. I get it; people are busy. Work schedules are relentless, lives are complicated. But when did “busy” become the default excuse for emotional abandonment?

What hit me hardest wasn’t the canceled plans or the empty chairs around my table. It was the realization of how emotionally lonely I’ve become. In a world of hyper-connectivity, where we’re all just a DM away, genuine connection feels scarcer than ever. We’re all talking, but is anyone really listening?

I’ve been reflecting a lot on this since that day. My mental health has taken a hit—I won’t lie. There’s a sting in feeling like an afterthought to the people you consider your anchors. But this experience has also been a wake-up call. I’m learning to reprioritize. To invest in relationships that reciprocate energy and to voice my needs more clearly, even when it feels vulnerable.

If you’ve ever felt this way, you’re not alone. Maybe it’s time we all pause and ask ourselves: In the relentless hustle of 2023, are we nurturing the connections that truly matter? Because at the end of the day, it’s not about the birthday messages or the gifts—it’s about knowing someone cares enough to show up, in whatever way they can. And that’s a gift no schedule should ever conflict with.
