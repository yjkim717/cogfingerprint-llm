**A Little Unexpected Beauty**

There’s something so captivating about stepping outside your comfort zone, right? I was completely blown away recently by an opera production – *The Marriage of Figaro*, no less! – reimagined with a vibrant 1890s India setting. It was utterly unexpected, a beautiful collision of cultures and artistic vision. It really got me thinking about how powerful it is to see traditions challenged and stories told in new, non-traditional ways.  Let’s all embrace a little unexpected beauty this year, wouldn’t you agree?
