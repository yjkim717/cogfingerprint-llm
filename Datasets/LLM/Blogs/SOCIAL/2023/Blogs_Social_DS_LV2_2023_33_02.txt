There I was, a low-level GTA Online player with a massive bounty on my head, feeling like trophy prey. For 48 minutes, I tried everything—hiding on train cars, lurking in sewers, even blending into the Vinewood hills in 2023. Each near-miss was a heart-pounding lesson in survival. It wasn’t just about the virtual cash; it was a crash course in player tactics and resilience. In the end, I didn’t just survive the hunt—I learned to thrive under pressure, a small victory that felt incredibly personal.
