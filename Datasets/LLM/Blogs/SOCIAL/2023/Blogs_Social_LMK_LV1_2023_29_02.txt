As I prep for HRT, I'm curious - will I suddenly turn into a different person? Will the weight I've kept at bay for years start piling on? I've always been skinny, but I've heard HRT can redistribute fat to more... feminine areas. I'm excited for the changes, but a part of me is nervous about losing control. Will I still be me if I'm not as lean? I'm embracing the unknown and focusing on my mental health - after all, that's what this journey is really about.
