"I'm still fuming about my Oppo Find X3 Lite's front camera - it's a total letdown! In 2023, I expect better image quality, but mine is plagued by noise and poor low-light performance. The camera app's limited options don't help. I've tried tweaking settings, but it's still unusable. Has anyone else struggled with this? It's frustrating when a flagship device's camera can't keep up with social media demands."
