### The Day the Game Felt Like a Transaction

I remember the first time I pulled off an aerial goal in Rocket League. My heart was pounding, my hands were sweaty, and the ensuing chorus of “What a save!” chats from my teammates felt like a standing ovation. It wasn't just a point on a scoreboard; it was a moment of pure, unadulterated joy, shared with a community of people who loved this wonderfully absurd game of car-soccer as much as I did.

Lately, though, that feeling has been harder to find. Logging in has started to feel less like entering a digital stadium and more like walking through a mall. Every new update seems to bring another flashy, overpriced item shop rotation, another battle pass to grind, another reminder that we, the players, are seen first and foremost as wallets. The soul of the game, the reason we all fell in love with it, feels like it’s being slowly traded for metrics and quarterly earnings reports.

This is why the recent whispers of a boycott don’t surprise me. It’s not an act of petty rebellion; it’s a collective, desperate cry from a community that feels unheard. We’re not just customers trying to get a better deal. We’re custodians of a digital space we cherish. We’re the ones who have spent years perfecting our kickoffs, creating ridiculous custom tournaments, and sharing clips of our most glorious failures. This game is our shared hobby, our escape, and in many ways, a part of our social fabric.

The call to boycott isn’t really about tanking profits for the sake of it. It’s a drastic measure, born from the hope that if the bottom line is all that’s being listened to, then maybe speaking that language is the only way to be heard. The dream isn’t to see the game fail, but to see it thrive in the hands of stewards who see its value beyond the balance sheet—who understand that a game’ true legacy isn’t in its revenue, but in the community that calls it home.

I haven’t uninstalled yet. I still hop on for a match or two, chasing that old feeling. But now, there’s a new hope mixed with the nostalgia—a hope that we can somehow save the game we love, not from failure, but from forgetting what made it magical in the first place.
