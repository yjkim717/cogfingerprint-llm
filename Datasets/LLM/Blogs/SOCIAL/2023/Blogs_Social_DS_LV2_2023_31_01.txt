It’s funny—learning Czech syllable rules reminds me of navigating social connections these days. All those clustered consonants, like "strč," feel like trying to decode someone’s guarded emotions. You pause, unsure where to divide, just like when a friend’s text feels distant in 2023. But once you find the rhythm, the word—and the person—unfolds beautifully. Maybe language and life both ask us to listen closely, break things gently, and trust the spaces in between.
