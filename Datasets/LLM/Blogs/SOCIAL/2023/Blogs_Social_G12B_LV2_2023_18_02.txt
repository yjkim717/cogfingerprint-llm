>## That First Cyberpunk Red Combat... Woof.

Okay, real talk. I just ran my first Cyberpunk Red game, and let me tell you, that initial combat encounter was… intense. My players are seasoned D&D veterans, used to a certain flow, a certain *ease* in resolving conflict. Cyberpunk Red's system? It's different. Brutal, even.

Seeing their faces after a particularly rough exchange – a mix of shock and begrudging respect – was something else. It really hammered home how different genres demand different approaches. We're talking about a world where a single bullet can *really* hurt. It’s a learning curve, absolutely, but the gritty realism is already paying off in terms of player investment. Anyone else feel the same?
