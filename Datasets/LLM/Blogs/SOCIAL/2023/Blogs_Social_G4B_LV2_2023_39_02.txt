**The Weight of Wanting to Be "Good"**

Remember scrolling through Terraria forums last year, desperately hunting for a decent summoner weapon? It felt… isolating. Everyone else seemed to be breezing through the early game, while I was still wrestling with basic critters and fishing. It wasn’t just about the game, though. It was this nagging feeling of needing to *keep up*, to be “good” at everything. 

Honestly, it’s a surprisingly modern struggle. We’re bombarded with curated highlight reels online, and it's easy to forget that everyone’s journey is different.  Taking a breath, and remembering that struggle was *mine*, made all the difference.
