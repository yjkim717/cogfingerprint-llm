"As I geared up for a week of traveling and working remotely, I was shocked when my request for a laptop was denied by my new employer in the mortgage industry. It was 2023 and remote work was the norm, yet my corporate office seemed stuck in the past. I wondered, 'Don't they trust me to get the job done?' The lack of flexibility was a red flag, making me question whether this company was truly ready for the modern work landscape. It was a frustrating start to my new job."
