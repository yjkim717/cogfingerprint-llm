## That Cyberpunk Edge Can Be a Lot, Right?

So, I'm diving into Cyberpunk RED, and wow, the shift from D&D combat is *real*. My players are used to a certain flow, a gentler pace. Suddenly, we're juggling initiative dice, multiple actions, and a whole lot more crunch. It's exciting, definitely, but also a bit intimidating! Anyone else feel that initial learning curve can be steep? I'm actively seeking tips on easing players into the system â€“ gotta find that balance between gritty realism and keeping everyone engaged and having fun. It's a 2023 challenge, for sure!
