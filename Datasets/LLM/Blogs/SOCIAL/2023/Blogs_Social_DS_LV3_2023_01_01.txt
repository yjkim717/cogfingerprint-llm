It’s funny how something as simple as a video game can become a space for connection. For years, Rocket League was that for me—a digital soccer field where friends and strangers met, celebrated wild goals, and laughed off clumsy misses. But lately, that feeling has dimmed. It’s not just me; I hear it in Discord chats and see it in community threads. The soul of the game feels like it’s fading, and I can’t help but think about the reason: the relentless drive for **profit**.

In 2023, it often feels like every beloved corner of our digital lives is being reshaped not for us, the players, but for **shareholders**. Features that once felt built for community joy are now tweaked to maximize revenue. New content drops feel less like celebrations and more like transactions. I’ve watched player morale **decline**, not because the core game is broken, but because the trust is. We’ve become numbers in quarterly reports, and the magic of what made Rocket League special is paying the price.

That’s why I’ve started thinking seriously about a **boycott**. It’s not a decision I take lightly—I love this game. But what does it say if we stand by as something we cherish is hollowed out? A **boycott** isn’t about anger; it’s about love. It’s a collective plea to **Epic** and other giants: remember the people behind the screens. Remember why these worlds matter in the first place.

I dream of a day when Rocket League is stewarded by those who see it as more than an asset—who value late-night tournaments and in-game friendships as much as balance sheets. Maybe then, the **decline** in spirit could reverse. Maybe then, we could reclaim what’s been lost.

Because in the end, games are stories we build together. And I believe it’s worth fighting to keep those stories alive.
