Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a conversational, relatable, and reflective tone, suitable for 2023:

## When "It's Probably Just Hormones" Isn't Enough

Okay, real talk. I’m 26, and I'm finally feeling brave enough to actually *talk* about this. For years, I've been dealing with periods that feel less like a monthly visitor and more like a full-blown invasion. Heavy bleeding, debilitating pain… the whole shebang. And the standard response? "It's probably just hormones, sweetie. You've got PCOS, it's common."

Easy for them to say, right?

I also navigate ADHD and, more recently, a diagnosis of visual snow syndrome – basically, a constant visual static. It's a lot. And honestly, being told to just "deal with" the period pain felt like adding another layer of dismissal to an already overwhelming pile.

It got me thinking: how often do we, especially women, get brushed off? How often are we told our experiences aren't *that* bad, or that it’s just a symptom of *something else* without actually digging deeper? 

I'm still figuring things out, still advocating for myself, but I wanted to say this: you are not alone if you feel unheard. Your pain is valid, even if it's connected to a bigger picture.  Let’s keep sharing our stories and demanding better care.

**Notes on this draft & potential additions:**

*   **Relatability:** I tried to use phrases like "real talk" and "sweetie" to create a conversational feel.
*   **Vulnerability:** Sharing the feeling of being dismissed is a key element of the prompt.
*   **Call to Action:** The ending encourages connection and advocacy.
*   **Possible additions:** You could add a specific example of a dismissive interaction, or a sentence about the difficulty of advocating for yourself when already dealing with multiple conditions.
