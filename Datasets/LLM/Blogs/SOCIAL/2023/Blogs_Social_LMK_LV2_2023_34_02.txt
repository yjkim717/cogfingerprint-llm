"Supporting My Homeless Friend, One Care Package at a Time"

As I was getting ready for the day, I couldn't help but think about my homeless friend who I've been trying to support. Being trans can be tough, and being homeless on top of that can be overwhelming. I wanted to do something to help, so I put together a care package with some essentials and some trans-friendly clothing. Seeing them smile when they opened it was all the motivation I needed to keep going. It's not just about the physical items, though - it's about showing them that they're seen and cared for. I'm now thinking of other ways to support them, like helping them access local resources or just being a listening ear. It's moments like these that remind me of the power of small acts of kindness.
