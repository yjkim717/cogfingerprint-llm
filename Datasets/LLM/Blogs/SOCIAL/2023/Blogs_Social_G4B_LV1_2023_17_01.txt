**The Static & The Silence**

Okay, real talk. Lately, scrolling through social media feels… exhausting. Like everyone’s curated highlight reel is just amplifying this low-level anxiety I’ve been battling. It’s weird, right? We’re *connected* more than ever, but feeling so profoundly alone. 

I’ve been navigating a messy situation – a "situationship" that completely threw my mood for a loop. Add in the usual 21-year-old chaos of figuring things out, and it’s a recipe for a pretty brutal depressive episode. 

Honestly, reaching out for therapy has been a game changer. It’s not a magic fix, but just having a safe space to unpack everything and realize I’m not failing has made a huge difference.  I’m learning to step away from the constant comparison and just breathe.  Anyone else feeling this digital overload? Let’s be real and support each other.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps create a post focused on a specific aspect (e.g., the impact of "situationships," or the benefits of therapy)?
