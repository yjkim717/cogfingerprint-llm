## When Home Isn't a Safe Space: Navigating Family Conflict in Senior Year

Okay, deep breath. Let’s talk about something *real*. Something a lot of us probably experience, but don't always feel comfortable sharing. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a situation that’s left me feeling drained and, honestly, a little lost. 

Senior year is supposed to be exciting, right? College apps, prom, graduation… But it’s also been overshadowed by some serious family conflict. It boiled over the other day – a fight with my brother escalated, and things got… scary. I ended up skipping school, just needing to escape. 

It’s left me questioning everything. Was I overreacting? Should I have handled things differently? The worst part is the feeling of being trapped. Home should be a safe space, a place of comfort. But when it’s not, where do you turn? 

I’m still figuring it out. Talking to a trusted friend helped, and I’m trying to remember that I deserve respect and a peaceful environment. If you’re going through something similar, please know you're not alone. Let's normalize talking about the tough stuff, especially when it impacts our mental health.
