## The Superpower I'd *Actually* Want (and Why It's Not Flight)

Okay, so I stumbled across this Reddit thread the other day, the classic "Would You Rather?" but with superpowers. Forget flying – they were offering teleportation, instant hair growth, and even the ability to *never* need a shower. Seriously! 

It got me thinking. We always imagine these epic, world-saving abilities, right? But honestly, the low-key ones? Those are where it’s at.  The thought of skipping the morning shower routine? Pure bliss.  It's a tiny thing, but imagine the extra time! It just highlighted how much of our lives are consumed by the mundane. What seemingly small superpower would *you* choose to reclaim a little sanity in 2023?
