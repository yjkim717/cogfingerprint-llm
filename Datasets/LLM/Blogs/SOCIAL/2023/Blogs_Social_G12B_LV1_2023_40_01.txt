## This Week Felt…Heavy.

Honestly, this week's been rough. That familiar, awful cycle crept back in – the feeling of needing to "undo" every meal, the endless purging. It’s exhausting, both physically and mentally. Scrolling through Instagram this evening, seeing everyone’s seemingly perfect lives, just amplified it all. I know social media's a highlight reel, but it's hard sometimes. I'm reaching out – anyone else ever feel this way? Any small tips for breaking free? Really need to find a way to quiet this noise.
