**Scrolling Through a Filtered Life**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How much of our lives we curate for the internet? I was just mindlessly scrolling through Instagram last night, seeing everyone’s “perfect” summer vacations and brand-new gaming PCs – like, seriously, a whole wave of people upgrading their desktops to handle games like *Borderlands 3*. It made me feel a little… inadequate. 

But then I realized, it's all a highlight reel. Nobody posts about the messy takeout containers or the days they just want to curl up with a book.  I'm trying to be more mindful of that, of recognizing that genuine connection happens *offline*.  Maybe I’ll even build my own PC – a small, quiet upgrade to *my* reality, not chasing someone else’s digital dream.  What about you?
