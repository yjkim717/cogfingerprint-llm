As I clocked in for another day at the office, I couldn't shake off the feeling of inauthenticity. Having undergone top surgery and opting to be stealth in my workplace, I had expected a sense of liberation. Instead, I felt like I was living a double life. No one suspected my trans identity, and that's exactly what I had aimed for. Yet, the more I blended in, the more I felt like I was hiding a part of myself. It's 2023, and I'm left wondering: is being stealth a victory, or a reminder of the identity I'm still learning to reconcile?
