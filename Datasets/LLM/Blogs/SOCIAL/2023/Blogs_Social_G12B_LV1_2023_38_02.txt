## Are We Even Talking About the Same Thing?

I've been scrolling through social media lately, as one does, and the usual political debates are raging. Capitalism versus socialism, the usual suspects. But something struck me â€“ it feels like everyone is arguing from completely different starting points.

It's like trying to build a house when nobody agrees on what a "wall" *is*. One person envisions brick, another drywall, and another just a metaphorical barrier. Similarly, when we throw around terms like "capitalism" or "socialism," are we actually on the same page? 

I realized I've been guilty of it too. Assuming everyone understands my definition, my framework. But in 2023, with so much misinformation and differing perspectives swirling around, it's more crucial than ever to pause and ask: what do *you* mean by that? Maybe, just maybe, if we actually defined our terms, we could move beyond shouting and start understanding each other a little better. It's worth a shot, right?
