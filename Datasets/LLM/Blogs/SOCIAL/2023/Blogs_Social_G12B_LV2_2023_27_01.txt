## The Hustle is Real: Branching Out This Peak Season

Anyone else feeling the peak season pressure? I'm a UPS part-timer, loving the work, but still patiently waiting for that RPCD (Regular Package Car Driver) position. So, I'm exploring a side hustle – looking at FedEx Ground contractor roles. It's a bit daunting, honestly, learning a new system while already juggling UPS. But the extra income is a huge motivator, and hey, gaining experience is never a bad thing. It’s a reminder that sometimes, you gotta diversify to reach your goals! Anyone else navigating a similar situation this year?




Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
