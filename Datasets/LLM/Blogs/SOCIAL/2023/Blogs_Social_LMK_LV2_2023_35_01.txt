"Stripped Bolts and Frustrated Mechanics: A DIY Dilemma" 

As I tinkered with my 1987 Toyota pickup in my garage this weekend, I found myself wrestling with a stubborn stripped bolt. The rusted metal seemed to be laughing at me, refusing to budge. With no cutting torch at my disposal, I was forced to get creative. I turned to online forums and YouTube tutorials for guidance, joining a community of DIY mechanics who've faced similar struggles. Together, we shared removal strategies and triumphs, proving that sometimes, it's the collective know-how that gets the job done.
