## The Sweet Relief of a Good Ending (and the itch for chaos)

Okay, I need to gush. I just finished *Baldur's Gate 3*, and honestly? I'm a puddle of happy exhaustion. I’ve been completely consumed by it for weeks, and it was *worth every minute*.

I went in thinking I'd be a ruthless tactician, a master manipulator. Maybe even a little bit evil. But somewhere along the way, I fell for the companions. Astarion’s dry wit, Wyll's earnest struggle, Karlach’s fiery determination... it was impossible *not* to get invested.

This playthrough, I focused on finding them happiness. Seriously, navigating the politics of Faerun was stressful enough without worrying about Astarion's trauma or Karlach's infernal engine. But seeing them find moments of peace, genuine connection, and even a little joy? That was the real reward. It felt *good*. Like, genuinely emotionally satisfying.

And that’s kind of weird, right? Spending so much time battling mind flayers and demonic forces just to end up feeling... warm and fuzzy? 

Now that the credits have rolled, though, a strange restlessness has set in. A little voice keeps whispering, "What if...?" What if I *didn't* try to be the hero? What if I leaned into the chaos a bit more?  The possibilities feel endless, and honestly, the thought of starting a new campaign, embracing a darker path, is incredibly tempting.  Maybe I'll be a delightfully awful villain next time. Stay tuned...
