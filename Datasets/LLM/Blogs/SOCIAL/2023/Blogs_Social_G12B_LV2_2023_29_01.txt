## Three Months In: Seeing Myself, Feeling Myself

It’s wild how quickly three months can fly by, isn't it? Feels like just yesterday I was taking that first tentative step, and now… well, now things are *happening*. I've been wanting to share a bit about my journey with HRT, and honestly, it’s been a lot more profound than I initially anticipated.

Reading stories online helped so much in the beginning – seeing others navigate this, sharing their experiences. So, I wanted to add my voice to that chorus. Physically, the changes are undeniable. The budding of my breasts has been… surreal, beautiful, and a little bit overwhelming all at once. My face is softening, subtly, but noticeably. It’s like seeing a new version of myself slowly emerge.

Beyond the physical, the emotional shifts have been equally significant. There’s a quiet confidence blossoming within me, a sense of alignment I haven’t truly felt before. I'm even considering looking into laser hair removal – a practical step, sure, but also a symbolic one, shedding the past and embracing the future.

This isn't a fairytale, of course. There are days of doubt, of frustration, of feeling like I'm not "enough." But overall, I’m filled with a sense of hope and excitement. This is *my* journey, and I’m finally feeling like I'm truly living it.

**Possible Visuals:**

*   A photo of a hand gently touching a breast. (Could be artistic and not overly explicit)
*   A "before and after" style photo, subtly showing facial changes.
*   An image representing self-confidence (e.g., someone smiling genuinely).
*   A simple graphic showing a timeline of HRT progress.
