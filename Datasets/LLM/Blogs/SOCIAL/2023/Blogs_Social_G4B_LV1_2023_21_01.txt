**Late Night Coffee & Unexpected Drives**

Anyone else ever find themselves pulled into a spontaneous weekend trip? I was just scrolling Reddit and saw this crazy poll about people drinking coffee at 8 pm – apparently, it was all because one user was driving hours to see family. It made me think about those moments where logic goes out the window, and you just *have* to go. Like last month, fueled by lukewarm coffee and a desperate need to see my niece. It’s a beautiful, slightly chaotic kind of connection, isn’t it?
