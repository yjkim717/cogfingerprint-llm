There are days when the weight of it all feels like too much. Last year, amid the haze of a deep depression, I found myself tangled in a "situationship" that only amplified my anxiety. I was navigating a major life transition, and this undefined, toxic dynamic became the backdrop to my lowest moments. The constant uncertainty and emotional whiplash fed a profound sense of hopelessness, making it hard to even get out of bed.

I felt completely isolated, convinced I had to figure it out alone. But the turning point came when I admitted I couldn't. Starting therapy was terrifying, and the decision to try medication felt like a surrender. But it wasn't. It was the beginning of reclaiming my life. Therapy gave me the tools to untangle my thoughts, and medication provided the stable ground to stand on while I did the work.

Healing isn't linear, and some days are still a struggle. But for the first time in a long time, I can see a path forward. If you're in a similar place, know that seeking support isn't a sign of weaknessâ€”it's the bravest step you can take.
