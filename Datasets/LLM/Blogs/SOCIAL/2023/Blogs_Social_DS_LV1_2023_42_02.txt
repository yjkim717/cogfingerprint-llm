It’s 2023, and I’m sitting here thinking about how fragile financial stability can be. A few weeks ago, I read a story online that stuck with me—someone’s entire $60 balance was frozen on a NetSpend card because of some past account hiccup. Sixty dollars. For many, that’s just a quick grocery run, but for them, it meant the difference between having a roof over their head or not.

It’s heartbreaking how a simple activation delay or a withheld check can spiral into real hardship. In a world where we’re told digital payments make life easier, it’s a stark reminder that behind every transaction is a person, a story, a struggle.

Maybe it’s time we rethink how financial systems treat the most vulnerable. Because no one should have to choose between a bureaucratic glitch and their basic needs.
