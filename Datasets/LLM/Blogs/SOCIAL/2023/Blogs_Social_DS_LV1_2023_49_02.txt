It’s 2023, and I’m stuck in a Baldur’s Gate 3 side quest—guards won’t hand over a note for Art Cullagh. I’ve tried talking, bribing, even intimidating them. Nothing.

It reminds me of real life: how often we hit invisible walls in conversations or bureaucracy, unable to move forward despite our best efforts. Sometimes, the solution isn’t force but patience, or finding another path entirely. Maybe I need to step back, rethink my approach—both in-game and out. After all, progress isn’t always about pushing harder.
