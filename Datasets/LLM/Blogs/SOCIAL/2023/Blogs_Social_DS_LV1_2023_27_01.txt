This past peak season, I was stretched thin—preloading packages for UPS before sunrise, then hustling as a FedEx Ground driver all day. Juggling two contractor gigs was exhausting, but it taught me something about our economy. So many of us are piecing together work just to get by, chasing that elusive full-time stability. It’s a hustle culture that’s both exhausting and, in a strange way, unifying. We’re all in this grind together.
