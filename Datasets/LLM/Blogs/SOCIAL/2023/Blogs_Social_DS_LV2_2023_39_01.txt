It’s funny how often we follow someone just because they feel familiar, isn’t it? I was reading this wild fan theory about *Pikmin*—you know, the little plant-like creatures who trail after Captain Olimar without question. The idea is that they don’t follow him out of logic, but because he looks like their natural leader. It’s pure instinct, a survival mechanism baked into their tiny roots.

And honestly? It hit home. In 2023, with algorithms feeding us echo chambers and social media tribes, how often do we fall in line behind voices that just *feel* right, without stopping to ask why? We’re drawn to leaders, influencers, or ideas that mirror what we already trust—sometimes for better, often for worse.

Maybe we’re not so different from the Pikmin. Our loyalty isn’t always earned; sometimes it’s inherited, shaped by unseen forces and the comfort of the familiar. Makes you wonder: who—or what—are we really following?
