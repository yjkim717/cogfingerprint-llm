### The Hashtables of Our Lives

It hit me the other day, scrolling through the endless stream of 2023 life online, that we’re all just walking, talking hashtables.

Think about it. We meet someone new, and our brain instantly runs them through a kind of social hash function. We take the complex data of their face, their job, their vibe, and we assign them a simple "bucket"—a category. The "work friend," the "gym buddy," the "person I knew in college." It’s how we manage the overwhelming data of our social worlds.

But what happens when there’s a collision? When someone doesn’t fit neatly into one bucket? That’s where the real magic is.

I used to be a "separate chaining" person, creating a new, separate list for every new facet of a person. My friend from the pottery class could only exist in that studio; I never let them collide with my Friday night crew.

Lately, I’m trying "open addressing." When a collision happens—when a friend shows a new side or defies my initial category—I don’t build a new chain. I find a new, open space for them in my understanding. I let the categories blend and overlap. It’s messier, for sure. But it’s also how a "colleague" becomes a "confidant," and how we find space for the beautiful, complex, and unexpected connections that make life rich.

Our social circles aren't just data structures, but perhaps we could all manage them a little more gracefully.
