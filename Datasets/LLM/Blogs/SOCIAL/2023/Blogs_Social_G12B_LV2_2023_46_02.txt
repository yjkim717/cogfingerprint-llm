>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and a 2023 context. I've tried to weave in a relatable element and a thoughtful conclusion.  I've included a potential title suggestion too.

**Title: The Leg Kick of Understanding: Why We All Do It Online**

Remember those old Westerns? The ones from the silent era? You'd see a cowboy get shot, and then… a dramatic, theatrical kicking of the legs. It always struck me as a bit odd, even as a kid. Turns out, it wasn't just for show. They were compensating for something we take for granted today: sound. Without audio, actors had to *show* us the impact, the pain, the shock. Those leg kicks were a visual exclamation point.

And it got me thinking about our online lives. How often do we over-explain, over-react, or use excessive emojis just to convey a feeling? A simple "sad" might become a string of crying emojis and a lengthy explanation. Are we, in a way, digitally flailing our legs? 

Social media, for all its connections, can be a surprisingly silent space. We lack the nuances of tone, body language, and immediate reaction. So, maybe that extra effort, that sometimes-performative emotional display, isn't about being dramatic. Maybe it's just our modern version of a silent film actor, trying to make sure we're *really* understood.
