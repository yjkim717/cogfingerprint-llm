## The Digital Nudge and the Quiet Annoyance

Anyone else feeling a *little* overwhelmed by the constant digital buzz? Lately, I've been noticing it more – the endless stream of follower requests on Reddit, most clearly from bots pushing… well, let's just say *content* I’m not interested in. It’s not rage-inducing, just… mildly infuriating. 

It's a tiny thing, honestly. But it's a reminder that even spaces meant for connection are constantly being infiltrated by automated attempts to grab attention. I finally dove into Reddit's account settings and disabled those follower requests.  A small victory, maybe, but it feels good to reclaim a little bit of quiet in the online noise. Anyone else doing the same?
