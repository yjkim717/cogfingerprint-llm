## That Dress, That Scene, That Feeling...

Something recently popped up on Reddit that really stuck with me. Someone was trying to identify a movie â€“ a scene featuring a striking image: a tall Black woman in a hot pink dress confronting a white woman in a restaurant, a quiet offer of water from a bystander. It got me thinking about how powerfully movies can capture complex social dynamics. Do you ever notice a single image, a moment, and it just *resonates* with a deeper truth about relationships and power? It's fascinating.
