There’s something bittersweet about scrolling through old photos from 2023 and stumbling upon a snapshot of my favorite Mediterranean pasta salad from Costco Canada. That salad, with its tangy olives and creamy Balderson cheddar, was more than just a quick lunch—it was a little ritual. I’d grab a tub every Friday, and it felt like the perfect start to the weekend.

When I heard it was discontinued, it hit me harder than I’d like to admit. It’s funny how a simple product can hold so many memories. I know I’m not alone in this—we’ve all had that one beloved item that’s vanished from the shelves. What’s yours? Let’s share our stories and keep those tasty memories alive.
