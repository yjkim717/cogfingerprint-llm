## The Platinum Pursuit & The Patience Game

Okay, real talk: anyone else ever get a hair color idea and then immediately panic about the damage? I'm currently in that headspace. I’m aiming for a level 6.5 ash brown – a gorgeous, muted tone – but my hair already has some existing color, and the thought of bleach terrifies me. 

I've been lurking on Reddit (as you do!) and it’s reassuring to know I’m not alone in this quest for less-damaging lightening. The suggestion of just *waiting* for growth feels surprisingly smart, and honestly, maybe a new stylist is in order if my current one isn't on board with a gentle approach. It's 2023, shouldn't healthy hair be a priority?!
