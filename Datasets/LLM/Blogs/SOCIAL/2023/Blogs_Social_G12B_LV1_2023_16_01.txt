## The Cycle of Frustration: Why I Keep Coming Back (and Leaving) Overwatch 2

It's happening again. I'm taking a break from Overwatch 2. Not a dramatic, "I'm done forever!" kind of break, but the familiar, weary kind. It’s a pattern, really. I dive in, excited by the new season, the promise of a fresh meta, and then… the frustration sets in. 

The balancing feels perpetually off, some heroes wildly overpowered, others practically invisible. And honestly, the online atmosphere can be brutal. It's not every match, of course, but enough to leave you feeling drained. Then there are the smurfs – players intentionally creating lower-level accounts to stomp on unsuspecting players. It’s a disheartening experience.

Yet, here's the thing: I always come back. The core gameplay is still so compelling. That teamwork, the satisfying ultimates… it’s a powerful pull. Maybe Blizzard will address some of these issues. Maybe I'll just adjust my expectations. For now, though, it's time for a breather.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
