## The Unexpected Joy of Shared Laughter: Barber of Seville and the California Theatre

Okay, confession time: I'm not *always* the first in line for opera. I appreciate the artistry, I know it’s historically significant, but sometimes, it feels a little… distant. A bit too formal. But my friend, a true opera aficionado, practically dragged me to see Rossini’s “The Barber of Seville” at the California Theatre in San Jose last weekend, and I'm so unbelievably glad she did.

It wasn't just the music – though, let's be clear, the music *was* phenomenal. Nikola Printz as Rosina was captivating, Joshua Sanders brought a playful charm to Almaviva, and Ricardo José Rivera *owned* the stage as Figaro. Seriously, Rivera's Figaro was a whirlwind of energy, and the audience was completely eating it up. The production itself was beautifully traditional, embracing the inherent comedy of the story.

But what really surprised me, what stuck with me long after the final curtain call, was the *social* aspect of it all. I mean, we're so used to consuming entertainment through screens these days – alone, in our pajamas, pausing every five minutes to check our phones.  Going to a live performance, especially something like opera, felt like stepping back into a different era.

There was this palpable energy in the theatre.  The collective intake of breath during a particularly dramatic moment. The genuine, booming laughter that erupted during Figaro’s antics. It was infectious! I found myself laughing *with* the people around me, strangers united by a shared experience.  We were all reacting to the same story, the same music, in real time.

It’s a feeling you just don’t get scrolling through TikTok.  You don't get it from binge-watching a show. There’s something powerful about being present, sharing a space, and reacting collectively to art. In a world increasingly dominated by digital isolation, it was a refreshing reminder of the joy of human connection.

Honestly, I walked out of the California Theatre feeling lighter, more connected, and surprisingly…inspired. Who knew a night at the opera could be so genuinely *fun*? I'm already thinking about what to see next. Maybe I’ll even drag a few more friends along.
