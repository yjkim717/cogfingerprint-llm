"I'm baffled by my own sleep preferences. In 2023, I'm still figuring out what works for me. I've been experimenting with sleeping on the floor with my mattress, a trend I've seen on social media. Surprisingly, it hasn't worked out. I sleep better in my bed with the same mattress. It's made me realize that sometimes, the perfect setup isn't about following the latest trends, but about what feels right for you."
