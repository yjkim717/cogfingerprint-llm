There’s a strange honesty in admitting that a fleeting moment from years ago still holds a flicker of attraction—no strings, no what-ifs, just a memory. It’s like a song you loved once but don’t need to replay. In 2023, with endless digital reminders, it’s easy to romanticize the past. But loyalty isn’t about forgetting; it’s about choosing your present. My partner’s trust is the anchor, and that old hookup? Just a chapter that taught me what real connection feels like.
