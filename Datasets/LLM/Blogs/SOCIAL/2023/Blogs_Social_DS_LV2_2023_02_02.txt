### Lost in the Stars: When a Virtual Update Feels Too Real

It’s 2023, and my favorite escape is my VR headset, specifically the infinite universe of *No Man's Sky*. But a recent update has turned my peaceful cosmic exploration into a queasy struggle.

The developers changed the VR controls. Now, the direction I move is permanently tied to where I’m aiming my multitool. It sounds like a small tweak, but in practice, it’s deeply disorienting. I tried to mine some copper the other day while sidestepping a predator, and my brain short-circuited. My body lurched one way while the world spun another. The mild nausea was bad, but the real blow was the frustration. A game that once felt like a second skin now feels awkward and foreign.

It’s a strange, modern problem, isn’t it? A digital patch can dismantle the muscle memory and comfort we’ve built, making a familiar world feel alien. It’s a sharp reminder of how fragile our digital sanctuaries can be.
