## My Tiny Retro Problem

Okay, confession time. I'm hopelessly addicted to my GBA SP. Seriously, it's been a comfort object lately. But there's a *slight* issue: adult hands and tiny retro consoles don't always play nice. I've been down a rabbit hole of mods – bigger shells, wider screens – just to make it feel…right. It’s a weirdly specific, but relatable, quest for ergonomic joy in a nostalgic world. Anyone else battling this tiny-tech struggle?
