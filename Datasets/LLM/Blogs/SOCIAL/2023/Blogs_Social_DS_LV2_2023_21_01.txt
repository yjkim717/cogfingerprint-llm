The office was silent except for the hum of the vacuum—just me and Rosa, the custodian, sharing a nod as she emptied the trash. I poured the last of my coffee, bitter and cold, gearing up for a solo road trip under the stars. It’s funny how the quietest moments, like a shared smile with someone who sees you when the world’s asleep, remind us that we’re all just travelers on our own long drives home.
