**Stuck in the Loop**

Anyone else feel like sometimes life throws you a loop? I was utterly stuck this weekend, wrestling with Baldur’s Gate 3. Specifically, the Art Cullagh quest – endlessly repeating dialogue and facing the same frustratingly guarded fists. It’s a ridiculous amount of effort just to *try* to move forward. 

It made me think about how easily we can get caught in social loops too – same conversations, same reactions, feeling like we're just going through the motions.  Maybe the key isn’t brute force, but finding a new angle, a fresh approach.  Anyone else battling a personal loop lately?
