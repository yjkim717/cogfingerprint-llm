"Three Months on HRT: A Journey of Self-Discovery and Transformation. As I sit here in 2023, reflecting on my journey, I'm amazed at the progress I've made in just three months on hormone replacement therapy. The physical changes have been nothing short of remarkable - my skin is softer, my body is more curved, and my hair is growing longer and thicker. But it's not just about the physical transformation; it's about the confidence that's come with it. I'm more comfortable in my own skin, and I'm finally starting to feel like the woman I've always known myself to be. The feminization process has been a journey of self-discovery, and I'm grateful for the sense of authenticity that comes with it. As I look back, I'm proud of the person I'm becoming, and I'm excited to see what the future holds."
