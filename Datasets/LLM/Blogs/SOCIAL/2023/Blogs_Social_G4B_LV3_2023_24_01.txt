**The Unexpected Comfort of Shared Anxiety**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we build these little digital worlds – like that Starfield game – and then start worrying about the *potential* dangers within them. Lately, I’ve been noticing a similar feeling creeping into my own social circles. There’s this low-hum of anxiety about everything, you know? The news, the economy, even just… people. 

Reading about Starfield, this idea of a new microbe sparking panic felt oddly familiar.  It’s like we're instinctively bracing for the worst, even when the system – the existing social fabric – already has mechanisms for dealing with it.  Maybe the real comfort lies in recognizing that shared anxieties, even unsettling ones, can actually connect us.  It’s a reminder that we’re not alone in feeling a little… vulnerable.
