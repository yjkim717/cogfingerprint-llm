## The Unspoken Rules of Public Spaces (and My Very Patient Dog)

It's 2023, and I think we can all agree the world feels… a little tense. Between the news cycle and the general anxieties of modern life, navigating everyday interactions can feel like a low-level obstacle course. And lately, I've been thinking a lot about a specific kind of interaction that consistently raises my blood pressure: the unspoken, and often *very* spoken, rules of public spaces, and the surprisingly forceful way some people seem to believe those rules bend entirely to their needs – particularly when children are involved.

Now, before anyone grabs their pitchforks, let me be *very* clear: I love kids. I genuinely do. I have nieces and nephews I adore, and I appreciate the joy and vibrancy they bring to the world. But there’s a difference between appreciating children and tolerating a complete disregard for shared spaces and the comfort of others, often cloaked in the guise of "it's just a kid!"

It started, I think, with a seemingly innocuous trip to a local cafe. I was working on my laptop, enjoying a quiet latte and the company of my dog, Finn. Finn is a phenomenal dog – well-trained, calm, and genuinely loves people (and squirrels, but that’s a story for another time). He was contentedly napping under the table, a picture of canine serenity. 

Then a family arrived. A lovely-looking family, to be fair. But their toddler… well, their toddler was *exploring*. And by exploring, I mean relentlessly circling Finn's head, poking him, trying to pull his tail, and generally engaging in the kind of behavior that would understandably stress *any* animal.

I politely asked the parents if they could maybe keep an eye on their child, explaining that Finn was a little nervous and I didn't want him to get overwhelmed. The response? A shrug and a breezy, "Oh, he's just being a kid! He doesn't mean any harm."

And that, my friends, is where my frustration really began to bubble. It wasn’t about Finn. It was about the utter dismissal of my – and Finn’s – right to enjoy a peaceful moment in a public space. It was about the assumption that *my* needs, *Finn’s* needs, were less important than the perceived freedom of a toddler to do whatever they please.

This isn't an isolated incident. I've experienced similar situations at parks (children shrieking directly into my ear while I'm trying to read), on public transport (running, uncontrolled chaos), and even at the grocery store (a child using a display of avocados as a climbing frame).  Each time, the response is remarkably similar: a wave of defensiveness, a justification rooted in the idea that children are exempt from basic social etiquette.
