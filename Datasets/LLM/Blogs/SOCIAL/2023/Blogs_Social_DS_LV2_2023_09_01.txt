There’s a certain rhythm to life that you don’t notice until it changes. For years, my local Stripes was part of that rhythm. It was the 7 AM pit stop, the place where the coffee was always hot, the floors were clean, and Maria at the counter would remember that I took my coffee with two creams, no sugar. It felt less like a corporation and more like a neighborhood checkpoint.

Then 7-11 took over, and the rhythm stuttered.

It wasn’t an immediate collapse, but a slow, quiet decay. The first thing I noticed was the floor. It went from being freshly mopped to having a permanent, sticky sheen. The coolers started humming a little louder, and sometimes, they didn’t feel so cool. The little things—a neatly stacked magazine rack, a wiped-down condiment station—started to disappear.

The real gut punch, though, was when Maria left. A new, tired-looking employee stared blankly when I gave my usual coffee order. The personal touch was gone, replaced by a corporate script. The store lost its soul. It became just another gas station, a transaction point instead of a familiar place.

I’m not just mourning a clean floor or a friendly face. I’m mourning a small, tangible piece of community that’s been paved over by the relentless machinery of a giant chain. In a world that feels increasingly impersonal and digital, these tiny human connections at the corner store mattered. They were anchors.

Now, when I pull in for gas, I see a 7-11. But in my mind, I still see the ghost of that old Stripes, a reminder that progress often has a hidden cost, paid in the small, sacred currency of a remembered name and a clean, welcoming space.
