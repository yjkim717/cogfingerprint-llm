## The Study Slump is Real (and Coffee Isn't My Friend)

Okay, real talk: college is *tough*. Like, academically challenging, but also just… draining. Lately, I've been hitting this wall after every study session. Hours poured over textbooks, notes blurring, and then *bam* – total exhaustion. The problem? My blood pressure isn't exactly thrilled with my coffee habit, so I'm on a mission to find sustainable energy. 

It's made me think about how we push ourselves, especially as students. We’re constantly told to grind, to hustle, to *do*. But what about listening to our bodies? I'm experimenting with short breaks, walks outside, and actually eating proper meals (not just ramen!). It's a work in progress, but I'm hoping to find a balance that keeps me going without the jitters and the crash. Anyone else battling the study slump? Share your tips!
