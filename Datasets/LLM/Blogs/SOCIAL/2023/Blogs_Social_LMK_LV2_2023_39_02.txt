As I dove into my latest Terraria playthrough in 2023, I found myself stuck, just like many of you. I was determined to master the summoner class, but unlocking those initial summoner items felt like an insurmountable task. I turned to online communities, seeking advice from fellow players. The shared struggles and tips sparked a sense of camaraderie. It was a reminder that even in solo gaming, we're part of a larger, supportive social network, connected by our passions and frustrations. In that moment, gaming felt more social than ever.
