## My Twitter Escape Plan (and Why I Need It)

Okay, let's be real. 2023 has been...a lot. And Twitter? It’s often felt like wading through a minefield of political arguments and negativity, especially when it comes to issues impacting the queer community. I love the *idea* of social media – connection, sharing, finding joy! But lately, it's been draining. So, I’m actively crafting an escape plan. Less doomscrolling, more cute animal videos. More connecting with friends, less engaging with debates. It's about reclaiming my space for positivity and authentic expression. Anyone else feeling this need to curate their online world?
