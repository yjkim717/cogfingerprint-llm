**Three Months In: More Than Just the Physical Changes**

Okay, let’s be real – when I started HRT three months ago, a huge part of my mind was fixated on the physical stuff. Testosterone levels rising, a softening jawline, the deepening of my voice… it was all so *visible*. And honestly, those changes have been incredible. A genuine sense of feeling ‘right’ in my body is starting to bloom.

But lately, something shifted. It’s not just about the mirror anymore. I’ve started to notice how my social interactions are changing too. There’s a newfound confidence, a willingness to speak my mind, and a comfort in simply *being* myself that I didn’t have before. 

My social transition feels like a parallel journey to my physical one. It’s about shedding old expectations and embracing the woman I’m becoming. It’s a little scary, sure, but mostly exhilarating. It’s a reminder that true change isn’t just about what’s happening under the surface; it’s about how we show up in the world. 

What’s been your experience with social transition? Let’s chat in the comments!

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a particular aspect (e.g., a specific emotional change)?
