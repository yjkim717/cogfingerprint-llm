**The Quiet Hum of Connection**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2023, surrounded by screens and endless scrolling, I’ve been craving *quiet* connection. Lately, I've found myself just watching people – a couple sharing a coffee, a parent helping a child with their homework.  Those small, unscripted moments feel…real.  Like a reminder that genuine connection isn’t about likes or filters, but about simply *being* present with someone else.  It’s a subtle shift, but a welcome one.
