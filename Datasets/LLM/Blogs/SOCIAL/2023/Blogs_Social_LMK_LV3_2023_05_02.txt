"Dealing with a hairline fracture on my patella has been a humbling experience. By day 4, I was surprised to have almost full range of motion, despite minor pain. It raised questions for me - do I really need to keep my knee straight? As I navigated this knee injury, I realized that recovery isn't just about healing physically, but also mentally. It's a journey of patience and self-care in 2023."
