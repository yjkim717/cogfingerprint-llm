Navigating a new city like Dallas in 2023 can feel isolating, but finding a church home has been my anchor. I’m searching for that sweet spot—intergenerational, with vibrant small groups and a nursery for my toddler. Non-denominational or Baptist, somewhere faith feels alive and inclusive, not bound by tradition alone. I’m dreaming of a community where my family can grow together, maybe even join an AWANA program. It’s more than a Sunday visit; it’s about planting roots and building connections that last.
