## The Capitalization Crisis: A Tiny Detail, a Big Reflection

Okay, I need to share something that's been swirling around in my head ever since I saw it on Reddit. Apparently, a mother completely lost it at her child's preschool teachers because they were correctly capitalizing her child's name on a worksheet. *Really?*
