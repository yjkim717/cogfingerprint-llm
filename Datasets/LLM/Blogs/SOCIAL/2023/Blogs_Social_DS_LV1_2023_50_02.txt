It’s 2023, and I keep thinking about A24’s gamble on Beau is Afraid. In a world obsessed with viral hits and box office numbers, it’s refreshing to see a studio bet on art, not just algorithms. It reminds me that true connection isn’t always measured in likes or ticket sales. Sometimes, the most meaningful stories are the ones made for the few, not the many. What a beautiful, defiant act of faith in creativity.
