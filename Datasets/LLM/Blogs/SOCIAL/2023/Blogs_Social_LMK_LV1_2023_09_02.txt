As I binge-watched Star Trek: Strange New Worlds in 2023, I couldn't help but notice a shift in the Klingons' demeanor. They seemed... softer. Their height, too, appeared more... human. The rugged, warrior-like behavior that defined them was now tempered with a more nuanced, almost relatable quality. I wondered, had the Klingon language and culture evolved, or was it just a new take on a classic character?
