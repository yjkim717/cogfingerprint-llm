Of all the things I expected to bond with my coworkers over during a Tuesday morning Teams call, it wasn’t the shared, weary understanding of “The Paw.” You know the one. It’s the insistent, rhythmic tap-tap-tap a dog gives with its nose or paw when it’s decided your work call is less important than its immediate need for a snack or a belly rub. We laughed about it, a small moment of universal pet-owner solidarity. It got me thinking, though, about a different kind of entitlement I’ve been encountering lately—one that doesn’t come with a wagging tail.

Last weekend, I was at the park with my dog, a gentle, well-trained rescue who adores calm people but gets nervous around unpredictable energy. A child, maybe five years old, came sprinting towards us, arms outstretched, screeching at a pitch only dogs and dolphins can fully appreciate. I instinctively put my body between the kid and my dog, saying a firm, “Please don’t run at him, he’s shy.”

The mother, who had been absorbed in her phone several yards away, looked up with an expression of pure annoyance—directed at me. “He just wants to say hi!” she called out, as if that was a universal free pass. I stood my ground, and she eventually huffed, “Come on, sweetie, that lady doesn’t want to share her dog.” The implication was clear: I was the unreasonable one for not treating my companion as public property.

This scenario, in various forms, has become a weirdly common feature of my life in 2023. It’s part of a broader pattern I’ve started to call “assumed access”—the idea that because someone is a parent, their child’s desires automatically trump everyone else’s boundaries, from a dog’s personal space to the professional quiet of an office.

Which brings me back to the workplace. The same principle seems to apply. I’ve lost count of the times a video call has been punctuated by the unmuted, chaotic sounds of a toddler meltdown or a child demanding attention in the background. While I have immense sympathy for the juggle of modern parenting, there’s a subtle entitlement in the expectation that the entire team must simply accept this constant, unmanaged disruption. We’re told to be understanding, to be a “family.” But my colleagues and I don’t bring our personal lives into meetings with such forceful, unapologetic intrusion. I mute myself when my dog barks at the mailman; it’s a basic courtesy of shared professional space.

It’s not about disliking children. It’s about respecting that the world is a shared space. My dog’s comfort and safety are my responsibility, just as a parent’s responsibility is to teach their child that not every dog is a toy and not every public space is a playground. And in the workplace, our shared responsibility is to maintain a baseline of professionalism that allows everyone to focus.

The truth is, I’d love for a calm, curious child to meet my dog, with permission, and learn how to interact with animals safely. I’d love to work in a supportive environment where occasional family life happens, but where mutual respect is the default. The divide isn’t between “childfree” and “parents.” It’s between consideration and entitlement. And right now, in this chaotic post-pandemic world, a little more consideration—for dogs, for coworkers, for strangers in the park—would go a very, very long way.
