>## Finding My Tribe in a New City

Moving to Dallas this year has been exciting, but also a little lonely. Beyond unpacking boxes, the biggest challenge? Finding a church community. It’s more than just a Sunday service; I’m craving intergenerational connection, a vibrant small group, and a place where my little ones are safe and engaged (hello, AWANA!). 

Being non-denominational myself, I'm exploring different options, hoping to discover a church that feels like *home*. It’s a reminder that building community takes effort, especially when you’re starting fresh. Any Dallas church recommendations are seriously welcome – I’m on the hunt for my tribe!
