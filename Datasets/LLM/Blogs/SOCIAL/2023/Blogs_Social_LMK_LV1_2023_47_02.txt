As I jammed out to an infectious funk track online, I became fixated on identifying the song. The deep male voice, backed by a soaring female choir, and that unmistakable 'Come on Come on' refrain had me hooked. The electric guitar riff was pure fire. Using an online sequencer, I started to recreate the beat, and it sparked a thought - how music can unite us across cultures and generations. In 2023, the power of funk remains undeniable.
