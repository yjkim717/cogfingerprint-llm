## The Empty Goal: When Nostalgia Feels Like a Betrayal

Remember that feeling? The first time you booted up Rocket League? The sheer, unadulterated *joy* of hitting a giant ball with a car. It was a revelation. Simple, chaotic, endlessly replayable. For years, it was *the* game. My friends and I spent countless evenings perfecting our rotations, trash-talking (affectionately, of course), and celebrating ridiculous, last-second saves. It was a cornerstone of our friendship, a shared language of aerials and demos.

And lately… that joy feels tarnished.

I've been feeling increasingly uneasy about the direction of Rocket League. It’s not a sudden shift, but a slow, creeping realization. It started with the free-to-play transition – which, in itself, isn’t inherently bad. But then came the loot boxes, the escalating prices for cosmetics, and the constant push towards battle passes that feel less like optional enhancements and more like a requirement to feel truly “part” of the community.

I saw a thread pop up recently, a call for a boycott. At first, I scoffed. Could a boycott *really* make a difference against a corporate giant like Epic Games? But the more I read, the more I understood the frustration. It’s not just about the money, though the prices are definitely ridiculous. It’s about the feeling that the developers – Epic – don’t *get* what made Rocket League special anymore. It feels like they’re squeezing every last drop of profit out of it, prioritizing shareholder value over the long-term health of the game and its community.

It’s a familiar story, isn't it? We’ve seen it happen countless times. A beloved game, once nurtured with care, becomes a cash cow. The passion of the original developers fades, replaced by a relentless pursuit of monetization. And we, the players, are left feeling… abandoned.

I think about the concept of "permanent growth" that companies tout these days. It’s a seductive idea, promising endless expansion and prosperity. But at what cost? Is permanent growth sustainable when it comes at the expense of the very thing that fueled it – the love and dedication of the player base?

Honestly, I’m torn. I still enjoy playing Rocket League, but it's tinged with a sense of melancholy. It’s like visiting a place you used to love and finding it unrecognizable. 

Maybe a boycott *is* a long shot. Maybe it won't change anything. But the thought of doing *nothing*, of passively accepting this trajectory, feels even worse. Perhaps, just perhaps, a collective voice can remind Epic – and other companies like them – that community matters. That nostalgia isn’t just a marketing buzzword, but a powerful force built on genuine connection and shared experiences. And that sometimes, the most valuable thing a company can protect isn't its profit margin,
