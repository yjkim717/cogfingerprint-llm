## The Slow Fade of "Forever" in Our Digital Libraries

Something’s been on my mind lately, and I suspect it resonates with a lot of us. Remember the thrill of owning something *permanently* online? A season pass for a show you loved, a digital book you knew you'd revisit? It felt like building a little library, a collection truly yours.

Now, it feels like everything's shifting towards subscriptions. And while that model definitely has its perks, a little voice whispers, "What happens when the subscription ends?" Will that access just… vanish? I saw a discussion online about this exact fear regarding a favorite podcast, and it hit home. 

It's a subtle shift, but it makes you pause and consider what we're truly *owning* in this increasingly digital age. Are we renting our entertainment, our knowledge, our stories? Food for thought, right?
