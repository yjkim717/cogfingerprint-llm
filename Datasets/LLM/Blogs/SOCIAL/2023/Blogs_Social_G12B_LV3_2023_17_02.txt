## The Waiting Game & a Big Move: My Subaru Crosstrek Adventure

Okay, so I’m officially a Subaru owner-to-be! I finally bit the bullet and ordered a Crosstrek – my first ever new car! I’m ridiculously excited, picturing weekend adventures and finally having a reliable ride. But… there's this nagging worry in the back of my mind. 

It's 2023, and everyone’s talking about the chip shortage. Will my Crosstrek actually arrive when they say? And to top it off, we're moving next month! The timing feels… precarious. It’s a strange mix of anticipation and anxiety, isn't it? Hoping for the best, bracing for potential delays, and dreaming of that first drive. Wish me luck!
