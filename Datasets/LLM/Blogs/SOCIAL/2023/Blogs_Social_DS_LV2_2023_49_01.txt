There’s something uniquely powerful about finishing a game like *Baldur’s Gate 3* in 2023—a year where real life often felt like a series of escalating difficulty settings. After 100+ hours, I finally reached the end of my playthrough, and I didn’t expect to feel so… moved.

It wasn’t just about defeating the Illithid threat or saving the city. It was seeing my companions—these digital friends I’d laughed and struggled with—find their own peace. Karlach, finally free from her engine, smiling without a trace of pain. Shadowheart, at last unburdened, choosing a life of her own. Even Lae’zel, riding off toward a future she chose for herself.

In a year where so much of the world felt chaotic and out of our control, guiding these characters toward happiness felt like a small, meaningful act of order. It was a reminder that even when we can’t fix everything, we can still create pockets of hope and resolution—in games, and maybe, just maybe, in life, too.

Funny how a fantasy RPG can leave you reflecting on what really matters.
