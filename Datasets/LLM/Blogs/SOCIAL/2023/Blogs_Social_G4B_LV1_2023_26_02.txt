**Is My Anxiety Just… Thirst?**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve been feeling *weird*. Like a low-grade anxiety that’s not connected to anything specific, mixed with this nagging feeling of being perpetually dehydrated. It’s messing with my meds, honestly.  I even spent an embarrassing hour yesterday scrolling through Reddit, asking if dehydration could *actually* mimic anxiety symptoms. 

It’s strange, isn’t it?  We’re so connected online, yet sometimes the simplest answers – like drinking more water – feel completely overlooked when you're wrestling with a bigger emotional wave.  Anyone else ever feel this way?
