It’s been three months since I started HRT, and honestly? I didn’t expect to feel this much like *me* so soon. At first, I was just focused on the numbers—tracking my hormone levels, wondering when I’d see changes. But now, the shifts are more than just clinical. I catch my reflection and notice subtle feminization: softer skin, a brightness in my eyes I hadn’t seen before. It’s not just physical, though. Emotionally, I feel more grounded, more connected to myself than ever.

Every small change has built my confidence bit by bit. I’ve started wearing clothes that feel authentic, speaking up in conversations I used to shy away from. Transitioning isn’t just about the destination—it’s about these quiet, powerful moments along the way. In 2023, with so much noise in the world, finding this inner calm and self-assurance feels revolutionary. Here’s to the journey, and to becoming, step by step.
