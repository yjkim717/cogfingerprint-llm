**Finding My Tribe: A Dallas Church Search**

Moving to a new city is…weird. You’re surrounded by possibilities, but also this deep-seated feeling of “where do I belong?” For me, that feeling hit hard when I started looking for a church in Dallas. I wasn’t just after a Sunday service; I craved connection – especially between generations. 

I’m really drawn to non-denominational churches that feel like a genuine community.  It’s about finding a place where you can actually *be* yourself, and maybe even build some lasting friendships. It’s a surprisingly important search, and honestly, a really hopeful one.  Anyone else feel this pull to find their people?
