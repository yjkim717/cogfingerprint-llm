The nostalgia is real! I was scrolling through my social media feed and saw a post from a fellow Costco Canada fan lamenting about discontinued items. It hit close to home - I'm still mourning the loss of the Mediterranean pasta salad and that delicious 1 year aged Balderson cheddar. Who thought it was a good idea to discontinue those?! The pasta salad was the perfect summer side dish, and the cheddar was a game-changer for snacking and cooking. I've tried to recreate them, but it's just not the same. I'm calling on all my fellow Costco enthusiasts to share their favourite discontinued items. Let's start a petition to bring them back! Who's with me? Share your own discontinued faves in the comments below, and let's see if we can make some Costco magic happen.
