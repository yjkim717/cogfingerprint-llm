**Is Streaming Losing Its Soul? My Reddit Worry**

Okay, so I was scrolling Reddit last night, and stumbled onto a really interesting (and slightly concerning) thread. It’s about how a lot of streaming services are moving away from season passes and toward a straight-up subscription model. And honestly, it got me thinking. 

I remember the joy of getting a season pass – that feeling of anticipation building as you unlocked each episode. Now, it feels like we’re just paying a monthly fee and hoping they *keep* everything available. 

Plus, the disappearing RSS feeds! Seriously, where’s the easy way to track new episodes? It feels like a step backward.  Is this the future of streaming, a constant chase for content?  It’s making me miss the old days, a little.  Anyone else feeling this shift? Let's chat! #streaming #reddit #content #subscription

Would you like me to tweak this in any way (e.g., focus on a specific aspect, adjust the tone, or add a call to action)?
