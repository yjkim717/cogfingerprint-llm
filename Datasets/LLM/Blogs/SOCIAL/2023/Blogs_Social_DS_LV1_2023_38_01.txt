It’s 2023, and I’ve noticed something strange happening in online debates. We’re all so quick to react—grabbing a screenshot, a clipped quote, or a second-hand summary from someone like Doomcock or the Knights of Melvin—and then we run with it. But lately, I’ve been asking myself: are we really understanding what we’re arguing against?

I decided to watch a few controversial TFM videos myself, start to finish. Not just the parts people were angry about, but the whole thing. And wow, what a difference that made. Suddenly, the context changed everything. It’s like watching a movie instead of judging it by a single out-of-context frame.

When we rely on fragments, the goalposts keep shifting because we’re not even playing on the same field. If we want honest discussions, maybe it’s time to do the work—watch the content, read the full story, and engage with ideas, not just echoes.
