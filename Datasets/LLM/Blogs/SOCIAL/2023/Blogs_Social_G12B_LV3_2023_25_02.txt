## The Nostalgia Trap & My GBA Glow-Up

Anyone else remember the sheer joy of a Game Boy Advance? I do! Recently, I’ve been diving back into my childhood favorites, but my adult hands weren't exactly cooperating with that tiny, original design. So, I started looking into GBA mods – bigger shells, brighter screens, rechargeable batteries… It’s a whole rabbit hole! It's a funny thing, revisiting the past, isn’t it? Sometimes, you need a little upgrade to truly enjoy the trip.
