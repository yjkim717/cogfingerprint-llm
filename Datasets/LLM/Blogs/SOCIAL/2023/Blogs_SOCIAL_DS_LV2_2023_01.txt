### The Unspoken Social Contract: On Dogs, Kids, and the Spaces We Share

I was sitting at my favorite café, the one with the slightly too-expensive coffee but the perfect amount of ambient noise for thinking. I was mid-sip, scrolling through my phone, when I felt a sudden, sharp tug on my hair. I yelped, spinning around to find a small child, no older than three, staring at me with wide, curious eyes, his sticky hand still outstretched. A harried-looking parent was rushing over from across the room, offering a breathless, “I’m so sorry, he’s just so fast!”

I smiled, said, “It’s okay,” and turned back to my laptop. But my heart was pounding. It wasn’t okay, not really. My personal space had been violated, and the expectation was immediate, gracious forgiveness. This small moment is a microcosm of a larger, more complex social dance I’ve been navigating for years as a happily childfree person in 2023.

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room—or rather, the dog. My golden retriever, Barnaby, is my family. He’s well-trained, gentle, and I am hyper-aware of his presence in public. If we’re on a patio, he’s tucked under the table. If someone approaches to pet him, I gauge his mood first. I operate under a constant, self-imposed mandate: *My dog, my responsibility. Do not inconvenience others.*

Yet, I’ve watched colleagues navigate a different reality. The same workplace that would raise an eyebrow at a barking dog in a Zoom meeting readily accepts a toddler crashing a crucial client call in the background. There’s a collective, understanding nod. “Kids will be kids.” And they’re right—they will. But where is the line between understanding and entitlement? Why is one form of disruption a professional faux pas, while the other is a charming inevitability?

This isn’t about hating children. I love my nieces and nephews fiercely. This is about the unspoken social contract and the strange double standard that has become increasingly apparent. It’s the expectation that public spaces—from quiet cafes to peaceful parks—are default extensions of the family living room. I’ve seen children run screaming through restaurant aisles while servers balance hot plates, their parents deep in conversation. The risk, the noise, the invasion of other people’s peaceful moments—it’s all waved away with that same mantra: *They’re just kids.*

But I was a kid once, too. And I was taught to use an “inside voice,” to not touch people without permission, and to be aware that the world doesn’t revolve around me. That’s not repression; it’s socialization. It’s learning how to coexist.

The core of the issue, I’ve come to realize, isn’t the children themselves. It’s the vortex of parental exhaustion and societal pressure that leads to what can feel like a sense of entitlement. We’ve swung so far in celebrating the challenges of parenting that we’ve sometimes abdicated the core duty of *managing* our dependents in shared spaces, whether they have two legs or four.

My ask isn’t for child-free everywhere. That’s unrealistic and frankly, unkind. My hope is for a more mindful reciprocity. A recognition that we all share this world, with our different choices and different kinds of families. If I’m expected to keep my 70-pound dog from sniffing your table, is it too much to hope that your child isn’t using my leg as a climbing post?

It’s about respect. Respect for my choice to have a dog instead of a kid, and my respect for your Herculean task of raising a tiny human. That respect has to flow both ways. It means parents supervising, and non-parents offering grace when things inevitably go sideways. It means creating a social contract where we all try a little harder, so that cafes can be for coffee-lovers, parks for play-lovers, and peace for everyone.
