### The Final Bill and the Empty Chair

I never thought I’d be Googling “public health funeral” while my grandfather sat three feet away, asking for the third time that hour where Mum had gone. The cruel irony of the situation wasn’t lost on me. Here I was, trying to access the money in his joint account—money he and my grandmother had saved together for over fifty years—to pay for her funeral, and he couldn’t even remember she was gone.

His dementia had created a heartbreaking paradox. The bank, understandably, needed his consent. But the man who once balanced his chequebook to the penny now had the financial capacity of a child. Every piece of paperwork felt like a betrayal, a legalistic dance around the gaping hole his memories had left behind. The very system designed to protect him was preventing him from honouring the love of his life.

It’s in these bureaucratic cracks that you truly feel the weight of things unspoken. We were so prepared for the emotional toll of his illness—the confusion, the sadness. But no one prepares you for the financial labyrinth that comes with it. The joint account, a symbol of their shared life, had become a locked door.

In the end, we navigated it. It took lawyers, doctors’ notes, and a mountain of patience. But as I finally wrote the cheque for the funeral costs, I didn’t feel relief. I felt a profound sadness for a system that sees numbers before it sees people. In 2023, with an aging population, we need to talk more about this. We need to build more compassion into the fine print, because the greatest costs in life are never the ones you can actually pay for.
