**The Unexpected Joy of Shared Experience**

Okay, so I just got back from something completely unexpected, and it’s really got me thinking about connection. I went to see “The Barber of Seville” at San Jose Opera – you know, Rossini’s classic? And honestly, it wasn’t just a performance; it was a reminder of the power of shared experience. 

I’d been feeling a little…disconnected lately, you know? Scrolling endlessly, catching up on everyone else's highlight reels, and feeling a little like I was watching life through a screen.  Going to the opera, surrounded by a room full of people collectively experiencing the same soaring music and dramatic story, was surprisingly grounding. 

The cast was phenomenal, especially Nikola Printz – he absolutely *owned* the role. But it wasn’t just the talent on stage. There was this buzz, this collective gasp during a particularly tricky aria, and even a few audible sighs of delight. It was beautiful. 

Even the little distractions – a phone buzzing, a cough – felt…less significant when everyone was united in that moment. It made me realize how much we miss out on just *being* present with others. 

Maybe it’s time to ditch the endless scroll and seek out experiences that pull us out of our heads and into the real world.  A live performance, a local festival, a simple coffee date – anything that reminds us we’re not alone in this messy, beautiful thing called life.  What about you?  What’s been bringing you back to the present lately?
