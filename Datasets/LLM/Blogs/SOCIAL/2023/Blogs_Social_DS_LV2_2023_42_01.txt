It hit me while rewatching an old Star Trek episode last night: the female captain was still being called “Sir.” In 2023, why does authority still sound so masculine?

I thought about my own workplace—how often women leaders feel pressured to adopt a tougher, traditionally “male” demeanor to be taken seriously. It’s like we’re borrowing a costume of command, one stitched together centuries ago.

But what if we designed new uniforms of leadership, tailored to authenticity rather than tradition? Imagine a workspace where authority isn’t about echoing old hierarchies, but about fostering collaboration, empathy, and diverse voices.

Maybe the final frontier isn’t space—it’s rewriting the script for how we lead, right here, right now.
