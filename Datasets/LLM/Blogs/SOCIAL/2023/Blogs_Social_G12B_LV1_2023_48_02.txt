## The Weight of the Watchful Gaze

It's funny, isn't it, how easily workplace culture can veer into something… unsettling? I’ve been noticing a trend lately, especially online, about companies doubling down on tracking *everything*. Attendance, project completion times, even keyboard activity. It feels... intense.

I remember a brief stint at a previous job where my manager seemed to observe everything *hawkishly*. Every late arrival, every slightly extended lunch – it all came under scrutiny. It wasn’t about improvement, it felt more about proving something. It created this constant, low-level anxiety, a feeling of being perpetually judged. 

It got me thinking about how much we’re sacrificing for perceived productivity. Are we truly fostering creativity and a healthy work environment, or just breeding a culture of fear?  Maybe 2023 needs a collective reset on how we monitor, and more importantly, *why*.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
