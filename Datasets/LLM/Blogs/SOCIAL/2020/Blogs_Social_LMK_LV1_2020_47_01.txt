As I scrolled through my Facebook memories in 2020, a familiar guitar riff transported me back to the 90s. I'm on a mission to identify a slow rock song from my teenage years, potentially by a German rock band. Can you help me solve this musical mystery and uncover the song that's been stuck in my head for decades?
