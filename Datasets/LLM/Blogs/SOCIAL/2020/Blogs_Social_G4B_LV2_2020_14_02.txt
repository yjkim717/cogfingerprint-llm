**Burritos & Brain Fog: A Strange Little Habit**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? Between the pandemic and everything else, my brain felt permanently stuck in a low-level fog. And I developed this *weird* thing. It started with migraines – the really bad ones that left me feeling utterly drained. Then, without fail, a burrito craving would hit. Like, *really* hit. 

It felt bizarre, like some kind of Pavlov’s Dog experiment gone wrong. I started noticing it – a headache, *then* the desperate need for a cheesy, spicy burrito. It wasn't just about the food, though. It was this strange, automatic association. 

I think it highlighted something about how our bodies and minds connect, especially when we’re stressed and overwhelmed. It’s a reminder that our habits, even the seemingly random ones, can be shaped by our experiences.  Anyone else have a quirky, pandemic-induced ritual? Let me know in the comments!
