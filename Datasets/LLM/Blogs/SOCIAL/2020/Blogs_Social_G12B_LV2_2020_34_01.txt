## Remember Those Ridiculous School Dress Codes? Let's Talk.

Ugh. Just thinking about it still makes my shoulders tense. I was scrolling through social media the other day and saw someone talking about school dress codes, and it unlocked a *flood* of memories. Two, in particular, stand out, and they're both… well, ridiculous in retrospect.

First, there was the fifth-grade incident with the spaghetti straps. Apparently, my perfectly innocent tank top was deemed “distracting” to the boys. Seriously? I was ten. The solution? A borrowed, itchy cardigan and a healthy dose of mortification. Then, in high school, I got called out for my shorts being "too short" – even though they were the exact same length as everyone else’s! It felt so targeted, so…unfair.

It’s 2020, and we're supposedly more enlightened, but I still see stories online about kids being pulled out of class for things like bra straps or ripped jeans. It’s baffling. Why is policing clothing suddenly so important? Why is it often disproportionately aimed at girls?

Anyone else have similar experiences? I’d love to hear your stories. Let’s reminisce (and maybe vent a little!) in the comments. It’s comforting to know I wasn’t alone.

I hope this meets your needs! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or further iterations.
