## Trading Four Wheels for Two? My Commute Reimagined.

2020 has been… a lot, hasn't it? Between everything else, I had a car accident a few months back. Thankfully, everyone was okay, and the insurance settled up. Now, I'm facing a familiar question: car replacement. But this time, something feels different. 

I've been seriously eyeing ebikes. A significant chunk of my commute is a solid 10 miles, and the thought of zipping along on electric power, feeling the breeze, and ditching the traffic… it's surprisingly appealing. It feels like a small rebellion against the usual, a step towards a more sustainable, and frankly, *joyful* way to get to work. Maybe trading four wheels for two is exactly what I need right now. Anyone else considering a similar shift?
