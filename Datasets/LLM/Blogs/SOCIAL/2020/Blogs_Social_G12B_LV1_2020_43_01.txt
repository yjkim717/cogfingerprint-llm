>## The Quest for Shared Undead Mayhem (and Less Rage-Quitting)

So, my friend Liam, a seasoned WoW raider, decided to give *Dying Light* a shot. Let’s just say the difficulty curve… didn't agree with him. He’s used to coordinated strategies and predictable boss fights, not getting swarmed by hordes while trying to parkour across a building!

We were on the hunt for a similar thrill – the cooperative zombie apocalypse – but something a little more forgiving. It got me thinking about how different gaming communities approach teamwork. WoW's reliance on roles and clear communication contrasted sharply with the frantic, improvisational chaos Liam experienced. Finding that sweet spot, that online zombie game where we could team up and survive (without the screaming), feels like a new raid boss in itself. Any suggestions?
