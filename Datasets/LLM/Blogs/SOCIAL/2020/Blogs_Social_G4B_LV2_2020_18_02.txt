**The Cart That Broke My Brain (and My Trust)**

Okay, real talk. 2020 was…a lot. And I dove headfirst into the vape scene, chasing that chill. I’d heard about these amazing carts – sleek, discreet, and supposedly delivering a top-tier buzz. I grabbed a Buddha Bros cart, hyped up by everyone online. 

Big mistake. 

It started with a dull headache, then a weird nicotine crash. Honestly, it felt like a cloudy, unpleasant shadow over everything. Suddenly, all the Instagram posts and influencer boasts felt…hollow. It made me question the whole social media hype around these cheap, fake carts. 

I realized I missed the simple connection with real flower, the aroma, the ritual.  It’s funny how a bad experience can really shake your faith in a whole trend, right?  Sometimes, going back to basics is the best medicine.
