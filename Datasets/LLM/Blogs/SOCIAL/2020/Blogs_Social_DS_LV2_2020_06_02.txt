It’s 2020, and I’m stuck in a cycle: I join a team, bring energy, then watch it unravel. I used to think it was bad luck, but now I see the common thread—me. My own negativity seeps in, poisoning projects and pushing people away. It’s a lonely realization, wondering if I’m the toxic element in my own story. Anyone else feel they’re their own worst enemy?
