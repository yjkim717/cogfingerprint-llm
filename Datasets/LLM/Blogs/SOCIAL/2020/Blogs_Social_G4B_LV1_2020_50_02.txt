**The Ghosts of "What If?"**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? Between the pandemic and everything else, I felt like I was just trying to keep my head above water. But underneath the surface of just *surviving*, there was this weird, persistent current of… longing. 

It started with Mark. My ex. He was really struggling with his mental health – a dark place he wouldn’t talk about, and honestly, I felt completely helpless. I’d spend hours scrolling through social media, seeing couples laughing, building lives, and it just felt like a punch to the gut. Like, what was *I* doing? 

Naturally, it started to bleed into my current relationship. I found myself comparing, analyzing, and, let's be honest, worrying about whether I was "enough." It felt ridiculous, I know. He’s wonderful, genuinely wonderful, but the echo of Mark’s pain kept bouncing around in my head. 

I realized I was trying to fix a broken piece of my past in my present.  It's a tricky thing, wanting to help someone you care about, but also protecting yourself.  I started focusing on my friendships – really leaning into those connections.  It helped me realize that my happiness wasn’t dependent on someone else's well-being, or even on a past relationship.  It’s a work in progress, but stepping away from those “what ifs” has been crucial.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps explore a different angle?
