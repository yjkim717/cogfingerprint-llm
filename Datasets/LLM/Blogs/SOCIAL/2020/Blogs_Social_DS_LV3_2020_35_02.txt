It’s 2020, and I’m watching a close friend dive headfirst into Arbonne. She’s a student, already stressed about tuition and rent, but now she’s talking nonstop about recruiting a downline and building her own business. I see the excitement in her eyes when she shows me the skincare products, but I also see the price tags.

My heart sinks a little each time she mentions another late night spent on Zoom calls or another friend she’s trying to bring onboard. I want to tell her about the risks—the statistics that show most people in MLMs don’t profit, the strain it can put on relationships. But she’s not ready to hear it yet.

So for now, I listen, hoping she’ll see the red flags before the excitement fades and the financial reality sets in. It’s hard watching someone you care about walk a path you fear is leading to disappointment.
