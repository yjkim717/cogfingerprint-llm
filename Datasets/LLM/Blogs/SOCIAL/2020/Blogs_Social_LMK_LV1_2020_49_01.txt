As I played Sims 4 in 2020, a thought struck me - where's the legacy? When a Sim passes away, their wealth just disappears into thin air. It got me thinking, shouldn't it be like a real family estate? The wealth, property, and heirlooms should be passed down to the next generation. It's a missed opportunity to explore complex family dynamics and social commentary on inheritance. By incorporating a more realistic inheritance system, the game could dive deeper into the intricacies of family wealth and social status, making it even more relatable and immersive.
