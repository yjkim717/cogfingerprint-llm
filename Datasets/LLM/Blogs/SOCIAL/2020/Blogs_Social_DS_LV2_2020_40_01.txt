It’s 2020, and date nights feel like a minefield. I love him, but every shared meal tightens a knot in my stomach. So I smile, push my food around, then later binge alone in shame. Bulimia makes me a liar in my own life, hiding the ugly truth behind a clean plate. If you’re trapped in this cycle, know you’re not dining alone in this struggle.
