**The Ghost of a Vaping Promise**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was trying to find a little escape, a little comfort in the new normal. I was definitely dipping my toes into the vaping world, lured by those slick Instagram ads promising ‘authentic flavor’ and ‘cloud perfection.’ I ordered a cart – a really pretty one – and when it arrived, it was…nothing. Just a cheap, plastic shell. 

Honestly, the disappointment hit hard. It wasn’t just the money, though that stung. It was the feeling of being misled, of trusting a brand and getting a complete letdown. It’s a weird kind of frustration, isn't it? Like a little crack in your faith in something you thought was genuine. 

That experience really made me think about how easily we can be swayed by marketing, and how important it is to be a little skeptical, especially when it comes to online promises.
