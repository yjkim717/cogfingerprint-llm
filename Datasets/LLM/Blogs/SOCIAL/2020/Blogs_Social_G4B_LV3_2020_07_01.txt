**The Quiet Joy of Being Unpopular**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Looking back at 2020, a year of so much uncertainty, I had this unexpected little moment of… contentment. It stemmed from recording myself singing – something I’d always avoided.  I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it, and the little nods of approval from my friends when they heard it. 

It made me think about how easily we chase external validation.  We build our worth on likes and comments, on being seen as ‘right’ or ‘popular.’ But this felt different. It was a quiet, almost rebellious joy in simply having a voice, even if it wasn’t universally loved.  Maybe the real self-acceptance isn’t about fitting in, but about embracing your own unique perspective – even if it’s an unpopular one.  It's a surprisingly comforting thought, don't you think?
