There’s a certain kind of 2020 frustration that can’t be captured by headlines—it’s the small, cumulative letdowns. For me, it was my local McDonald’s drive-thru.

Week after week, I’d pull up with a sliver of hope, craving that specific comfort only salty fries and a correct order can bring. And week after week, I’d drive away with a mystery bag. A cheeseburger instead of a McChicken. A Diet Coke instead of a Sprite. And always, without fail, a sad clump of cold fries.

In a year where so much felt out of our control, this tiny, predictable failure became a strange metaphor. It wasn’t just about the wrong order; it was the broken promise of a simple, reliable pleasure. That glowing yellow sign, once a beacon of easy satisfaction, now just reminded me that sometimes the universe—or at least the understaffed kitchen—is just not on your side. It was the year of big problems, but man, those cold fries really stung.
