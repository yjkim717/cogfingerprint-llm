**That Fuzzy Feeling of Shared Nostalgia**

It’s funny, isn't it? How a single memory can suddenly flood you with a whole wave of… something. Lately, I’ve been getting hit with this weird nostalgia, triggered by a random mention of a game from 1996. It reminded me of a desperate search for a forgotten title – something like Rocket League, but with a totally different vibe. 

It made me think about how intensely we remember these little digital moments, especially when they were experienced with friends.  We’d yell across rooms, strategize over tethers (seriously, who remembers those?), fueled by the shared excitement of a good game.  

2020 was isolating, and those echoes of past social experiences felt even more poignant. It’s a reminder that connection, even through pixels and controllers, can leave a lasting mark.  Anyone else suddenly gripped by a wave of ‘remember when…’?
