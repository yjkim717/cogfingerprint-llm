It’s 2020, and I’m 21, staring at my budget like it’s a puzzle with missing pieces. On $25k a year, my $735 in monthly bills feels like a mountain. A truck payment, lot rent—it all adds up. My dream isn't extravagant, just a small house to call my own. But in this economy, affordable housing seems like a myth. I’m learning that financial stability isn’t a straight road; it’s a winding path of tough choices and hopeful calculations. Anyone else feeling this pinch?
