>## The Line Gets Blurry

It's 2020, and we're all craving connection, right? Especially with… well, with *people*. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about platonic touch. Specifically, cuddling. I've had a few really lovely, genuinely comforting cuddle sessions with male friends – the kind where you just feel safe and relaxed. But almost every single time, there’s this… tension. A subtle shift. An unspoken question hanging in the air. 

Why does innocent physical closeness so often feel like a prelude to something else? Is it societal conditioning? Are we just so wired to interpret touch as a signal of romantic or sexual interest? I really want to believe that deep, platonic intimacy – a hug that *just* feels good – is possible, but it's proving surprisingly tricky to navigate.
