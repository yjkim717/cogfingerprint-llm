**The Weight of a Plate on MLK Day**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020 felt like a year for simmering anxieties, and I stumbled across a Reddit thread that really stuck with me. Someone was wondering if making soul food on Martin Luther King Jr. Day felt… presumptuous? Like, were we, as a predominantly Caucasian group, overstepping by honoring Black culture with a dish steeped in its history?

Honestly, it hit a nerve. It’s not about *what* you eat, but *why*.  Sharing a meal, especially one with deep roots, can be a beautiful act of connection. But it’s crucial to acknowledge the story behind it – the resilience, the struggle, and the profound legacy of those who created it. Let’s honor MLK Day with awareness and respect, always.
