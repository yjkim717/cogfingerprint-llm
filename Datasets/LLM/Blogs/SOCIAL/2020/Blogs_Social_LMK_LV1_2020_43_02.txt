"In 2020, Illinois was once again abuzz with election fervor. As I watched the votes roll in, I couldn't help but think that Chicago's influence overshadowed the rest of the state. It's as if the city's dense population and liberal leanings drowned out the voices of downstate voters. Springfield, and other rural areas, seemed to fade into the background, their votes rendered insignificant by the sheer weight of Chicago's electoral might."
