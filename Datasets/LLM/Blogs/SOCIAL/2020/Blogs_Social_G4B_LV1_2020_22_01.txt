**Beyond the Thank You Notes**

It’s March 2020, and honestly, the sheer volume of “thank yous” felt… overwhelming. Everyone was sending pictures of hand-knitted masks – incredibly thoughtful, truly. But as a nurse, I started realizing something crucial was missing. We needed more than just appreciation; we needed *support*. 

Specifically, we needed access to proper Personal Protective Equipment. It wasn't about ego, it was about patient safety.  I found myself acting as a kind of informal mediator, trying to bridge the gap between the anxieties of non-medical civilians and the realities of our work.  It felt strange, this need to advocate for our own resources.  It highlighted a shift in mentality – gratitude was wonderful, but action was vital. We needed to be equipped to do our jobs, and to keep everyone safe.
