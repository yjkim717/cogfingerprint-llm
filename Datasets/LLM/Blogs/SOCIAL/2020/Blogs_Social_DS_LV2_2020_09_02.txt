It’s 2020, and I’m scrolling through endless headlines about uncertainty, when a story stops me cold: Ray Poteet, a man with 121 life insurance policies. He’s not just planning for an end-of-life payout; he’s built a living, breathing financial engine. Loans against his policies fund his life, while the death benefits secure a legacy.

It got me thinking—aren’t we all just trying to build something that outlasts us? In a year that’s felt so fragile, the idea of creating wealth that works for you now, not just later, feels revolutionary. It’s not about hoarding money, but designing a life rich in possibility. What are we building, if not a future we can actually live in?
