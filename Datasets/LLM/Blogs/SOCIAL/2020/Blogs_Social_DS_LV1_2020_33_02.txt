It’s 2020, and honestly, sometimes the most exciting part of my week was the prospect of a hot, salty McDonald’s fries run. But lately, my local drive-through has become a lesson in patience and disappointment.

I pull up, already bracing myself. The line is six cars deep, and I can feel the minutes ticking by. When I finally get to the speaker, I recite my order like a well-rehearsed script. Yet, without fail, something is always off. Last time, my burger was missing the cheese, and the fries were cold and limp. The time before that, they’d forgotten the sauce for my nuggets entirely.

It’s more than just an inconvenience; it feels like a small, personal letdown. In a year where so much was stripped away, these little comforts mattered. A perfectly assembled burger was a tiny victory. But consistently getting it wrong? It chips away at that small joy. It makes me wonder if the rush to serve quickly has completely overshadowed the basic principle of just getting it right. That connection, the simple trust that your order will be correct, feels broken.
