## The Ghosts in the Algorithm

It's weird, isn’t it? How a fleeting memory can just surface, seemingly out of nowhere. I was playing Rocket League the other day – seriously, a ridiculous amount of time, I admit – and it triggered something. A hazy recollection of a game I played sometime in the late 90s. 

It was… vehicular. Something about aerial combat, maybe? And I’m convinced it was bundled with Diablo! I remember the excitement of getting that two-in-one deal. This game felt like a bizarre precursor to Rocket League, all about maneuvering vehicles to control a ball, but with a more chaotic, arcade-y feel. 

I've been down internet rabbit holes trying to find it. Searching for “90s vehicle ball game Diablo bundle” feels utterly futile. It's like a digital ghost, existing only in the fragmented corners of my brain. Maybe it was a small indie title? Something that didn't quite make it. 

It's frustrating, but also a little poignant. A reminder of how quickly digital history fades, swallowed by the constant churn of new releases and shifting algorithms. Anyone else ever feel like that? Like they’re chasing a memory that might not even be real?



Hopefully, this captures the reflective, conversational tone and connects to the initial prompts.
