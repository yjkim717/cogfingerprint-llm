**The Weight of a Choice**

It’s strange, isn’t it? Hearing about someone else’s monumental decision, and suddenly *you’re* feeling… a whole mess of things. My grandfather just shared his plans for assisted death, and honestly, I’m wrestling with it. A prickly mix of resentment – feeling like this is *his* path, not mine – and a deep, unsettling grief for a future we won’t share. 

2020 felt like a year of endings, and this just feels like another one. It’s a reminder that grief isn’t always about loss, sometimes it's about navigating someone else’s journey, and trying to understand your own complicated heart.
