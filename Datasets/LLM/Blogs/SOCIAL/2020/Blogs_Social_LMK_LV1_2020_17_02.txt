"As I navigated my 19th year, I found myself stuck in a rut. Living with noburp (a rare condition where burping is impossible) and related digestive issues was taking a toll on my mental health. Emetophobia, or the fear of vomiting, had become a constant companion. In 2020, I stumbled upon an unconventional treatment - Botox for noburp. Desperate for relief, I started considering it. But one question lingered: would I vomit after the procedure? I turned to online forums, searching for answers from those who'd been there, done that, and lived to share their story."
