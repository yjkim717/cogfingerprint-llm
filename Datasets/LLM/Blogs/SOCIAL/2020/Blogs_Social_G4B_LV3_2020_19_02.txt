**The Weight of a Headline**

Remember 2020? It felt like the world was constantly shouting, didn’t it? I found myself scrolling through social media, and it was… overwhelming.  Specifically, the way Sushant Singh Rajput’s death was dissected and debated. It wasn't just grief being shared; it was a wildfire of conspiracy theories, accusations flung like stones. 

Honestly, it felt unsettling.  It wasn’t just about a tragic loss; it was about how quickly a story could be twisted into something unrecognizable, fueled by a desperate need to find a “reason” – any reason – instead of simply acknowledging a heartbreaking situation. 

I started to notice a troubling trend: a decline in genuine critical thinking. People seemed more interested in confirming pre-existing beliefs than in actually *understanding* what was happening. It made me question the responsibility we have as consumers of information, and the way media – even social media – can amplify the worst parts of ourselves.  It’s a reminder that empathy and truth are often casualties in the echo chambers of the internet.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the summary?
