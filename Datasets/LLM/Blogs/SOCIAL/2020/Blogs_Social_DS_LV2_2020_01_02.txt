It’s 2020, and honestly, I think we’re all just trying to hold it together. But I was watching a Rocket League tournament the other day, and something stuck with me: a player forfeited early in a match they were losing.

It got me thinking—how often do we forfeit in our own lives? We drop a project when it gets tough, ghost a conversation that feels awkward, or give up on a goal because the first attempt failed. It’s easier to tap out than to see things through, especially when the outcome looks bleak.

But there’s something powerful about playing to the final whistle, whether in a game or in life. It’s not always about winning; it’s about respect—for the process, for others, and for yourself. In a year full of uncertainty, maybe the most professional thing we can do is just show up, fully, until the very end.
