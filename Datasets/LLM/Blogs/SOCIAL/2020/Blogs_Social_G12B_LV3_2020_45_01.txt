## My Pajamas vs. My Potential: Finding Focus in a World of Sweatpants

Remember early 2020? The world shifted, and suddenly, *everyone* was working from home. I, like many, initially embraced the pajama-clad life. It felt…liberating! But quickly, the lines blurred. My living room became my office, my kitchen my conference room, and my productivity? Well, it took a serious nosedive.

It wasn't the *where* that was the issue, it was the *how*. I realized I needed a routine, a small act of normalcy in a very abnormal time. Now, I get ready as if I'm heading into an office – shower, coffee, actual clothes. It sounds simple, but it’s been a game-changer. It's a small way to reclaim some control, protect my work-life balance, and actually *feel* productive amidst the chaos. Anyone else relate?
