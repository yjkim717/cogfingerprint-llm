Remember that childhood book you can’t quite name, but one gruesome scene is burned into your memory? For me, it’s a boy swinging an axe right into his own leg. In 2020, stuck at home, that vague memory became my white whale.

I posted in online forums, describing that single, visceral moment. And something amazing happened. Dozens of strangers, isolated in their own homes, united in a digital scavenger hunt. We weren’t just looking for a book; we were chasing a shared feeling of childhood wonder and shock.

It was a powerful reminder that even in a year of distance, our most fragmented memories can become the very things that connect us. We found the book, by the way. It was "The Sign of the Beaver." The connection, however, was the real prize.
