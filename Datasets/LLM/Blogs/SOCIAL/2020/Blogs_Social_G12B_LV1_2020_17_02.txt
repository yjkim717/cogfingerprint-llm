## The Things You Worry About (and Why It's Okay to Worry)

Okay, so, 2020, right? The year anxiety had a permanent seat at the table. For me, it's been a year of… well, *a lot*. I finally decided to get Botox a few weeks ago – purely preventative, I swear, just a few lines smoothed out. I was excited, but also…terrified. 

It sounds ridiculous, I know. I’ve been battling a weird combo of digestive issues and a persistent fear of vomiting (emetophobia, Google it if you’re curious – it’s a thing!) for years. And somewhere in my brain, it decided Botox injections were going to trigger a full-blown crisis. 

I spent days researching “Botox and nausea”, convinced I’d be a mess. Turns out, some people experience that. I even mentioned my, shall we say, *unique* anxieties to the practitioner. They were amazing, really reassuring.

It didn't happen. But the worrying? That’s a process. It’s a reminder that even small decisions can feel monumental when you're dealing with deeper anxieties. And honestly? It’s okay to acknowledge that. We're all navigating something in this crazy year.
