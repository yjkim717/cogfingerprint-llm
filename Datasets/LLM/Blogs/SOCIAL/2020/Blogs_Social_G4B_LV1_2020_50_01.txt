**The Tightrope of Friendship (and Seriously Bad Advice)**

Okay, 2020 was… a lot, right? Between the pandemic and everything else, I was clinging to my friendships like they were lifelines. And honestly, sometimes those lifelines felt a little frayed. 

Recently, I had a really uncomfortable situation with a friend, Sarah. She’d been relentlessly critical of my boyfriend, Ben. Not just a gentle observation – full-blown demands that I break up with him and “do him a favor.” It started as a few worried comments, but it escalated into genuinely hostile conversations. 

I was furious. Not just at her, but at feeling like she was trying to dictate my life. We had a huge fight, and I seriously considered distancing myself. It felt like she wasn’t respecting my relationship, or even my boundaries. 

Looking back, I realize I needed to be clearer about what I needed. Setting boundaries felt so awkward, like admitting I wasn't always going to agree with her. But protecting my happiness and Ben’s feelings was more important. It was a tough lesson in navigating friendships – sometimes, even the people closest to you can unintentionally cause a lot of hurt. 2020 taught me that fiercely protecting your own space is never a weakness.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps generate a post focused on a slightly different angle (e.g., the role of communication in conflict)?
