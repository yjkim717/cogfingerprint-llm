## Remember Those Dress Codes? Still Thinking About Them.

Remember being a kid and feeling utterly baffled by school dress codes? A recent Reddit thread brought back a flood of memories for me – the awkward explanations, the policing of shoulders and skirt lengths, the feeling that *we* were the problem, not whatever we were wearing. 

It's wild to think how much of that scrutiny disproportionately fell on girls. It felt like a constant message: your body is distracting, your clothing is provocative. Looking back, it was just… exhausting. And honestly, a little body-shaming disguised as "appropriate" attire. Let's hope we're moving towards schools that prioritize learning and respect, not policing our clothes. 2020 feels like a year for re-evaluating a lot of things, doesn't it?
