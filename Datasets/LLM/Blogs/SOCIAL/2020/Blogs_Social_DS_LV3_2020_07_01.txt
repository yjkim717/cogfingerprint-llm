It’s 2020, and I’m watching myself in a video for the first time in months. My own voice sounds strange—higher, almost unfamiliar. I used to cringe at recordings, convinced I sounded nothing like “me.” But in a year of endless Zoom calls and voice notes, something shifted. Hearing my own voice became less about vanity and more about acceptance. It’s the sound of my thoughts, my laughter, my truth. And now? I don’t just tolerate it—I recognize it as mine, unapologetically.
