The screen glowed in the dim light of my apartment, a portal to a world that felt both terrifyingly close and impossibly far away. It was the spring of 2020, and the silence in my own home was a stark contrast to the silent crisis unfolding in my grandfather’s. We were all isolated, but I felt a different kind of isolation—one that came not from a government mandate, but from my own family.

The phone calls became our sole point of contact, and with each one, the updates on Grandpa grew more vague. “He’s holding up,” they’d say. Or, “It’s a bad day.” The lack of detail was a familiar, chilling echo. It took me back to being thirteen, standing outside a hospital room door, overhearing hushed, serious tones about my grandmother that no one would explain to me. That old, childish feeling of being shut out, of grief being an adults-only conversation, came rushing back.

Now, as an adult in a global pandemic, the dynamic was painfully similar. I was being protected, or so they thought. But protection felt like exclusion. The guilt was a heavy, two-sided coin. On one side, I felt guilty for not being there, for not fighting harder to be included in the care, for the miles that separated us. On the other, I felt a gnawing guilt for my frustration—for being angry at the very people who were on the front lines, witnessing his decline day in and day out.

My most desperate need wasn’t for the grim details; it was for the shared burden. I craved a simple, honest conversation. A text that said, “He forgot my name today, and it broke my heart.” A call where we could just sit in the sadness together, our silence a communication in itself. I needed to know I was still a part of the family unit, even from a distance. Because grief, I was learning all over again, isn’t a private event. It’s a thread that, when woven together by a family, can create a fabric strong enough to hold the weight of the pain. In 2020, I was holding my single, frayed thread, desperately looking for the others to help me weave.
