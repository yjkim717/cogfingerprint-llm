The silence in my apartment during those early months of 2020 was a physical presence. It was the kind of quiet that didn’t just mute the outside world—it amplified the noise inside my own head. Social distancing, a term we all learned to live with, became my excuse for a different kind of isolation, one I’d been practicing long before the lockdowns.

I remember staring at a bar of soap in my bathroom, the kind that’s clear. Under the fluorescent light, I could see the faint, silvery lines on my wrists, a secret map of a private war. The world was collectively holding its breath, paralyzed by a virus, and I felt a strange, chilling kinship with that paralysis. My own pain had been slowly replaced by a hollow numbness, a static that drowned out everything. The sharp sting of a razor had once been a feeling—a terrible one, but a feeling nonetheless. Now, there was just… nothing. A flatline of emotion.

Looking back, I see how I used the global crisis to justify my personal one. “We’re all isolated,” I’d tell myself. But my isolation was different. It was a cage I was actively building, brick by brick, with every suppressed cry for help and every moment I chose the cold comfort of self-harm over the terrifying warmth of human connection.

My mental health wasn't just a personal struggle; it was a reflection of a world turned inward. The challenge wasn't just to survive the pandemic, but to survive myself within it. It meant learning that the most profound social connection I could make was finally reaching out, breaking my own quarantine of the soul, and letting someone see the scars I’d tried to wash away.
