>## The Empty House and a Sim's Sad Goodbye

It's funny how games can spark such specific nostalgia. Lately, I've been diving back into The Sims 4, and it's hit me just how much I miss a proper inheritance system. Don’t get me wrong, the building and customization are fantastic, but playing a long-term legacy family feels… incomplete without it.

I remember playing Sims 2, meticulously planning for my Sims to leave behind a family estate for the next generation. Passing down furniture, heirlooms, even just a well-tended garden – it added so much weight and meaning to their lives. Now, watching a Sim age and eventually… disappear, leaving behind a completely empty house? It feels a little sad. It's a reminder that in the Sims 4, everything resets. Maybe it’s just me, but I’d love to see a little more permanence in our virtual families.
