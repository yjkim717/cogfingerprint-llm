>## The Fuzzy Line: Can We Really Just Cuddle?

Remember 2020? The year we all craved connection, but physical touch felt… complicated. I noticed something interesting then, and still do now. So many conversations around cuddling quickly veer into *other* territory. Is it just me, or is there an unspoken expectation that a snuggle equals something more?

I genuinely long for the simple comfort of platonic touch - a friend’s arm around my shoulder, a warm hug without ulterior motives. But the pressure to make it "romantic" feels real. Is a purely platonic cuddle truly possible in our hyper-sexualized world? I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Let's talk about it.
