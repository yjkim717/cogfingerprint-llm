## That Strange Museum & Lingering Questions

I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day – Bay Area folks sharing stories of childhood cult experiences. It struck a chord. Growing up, we always visited the Rosicrucian Museum in Fremont. Beautiful gardens, ancient artifacts… but also a pervasive, unsettling feeling I couldn't quite place. 2020 feels like a year for revisiting those buried childhood curiosities, doesn't it?
