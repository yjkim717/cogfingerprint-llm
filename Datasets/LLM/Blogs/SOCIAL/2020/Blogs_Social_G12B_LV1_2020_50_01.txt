## When Your Best Friend's Advice Feels…Wrong

It's funny, isn't it? How the people you trust most can sometimes be the hardest to navigate. Especially when you're already feeling shaky. Lately, I've been wrestling with something that’s left me feeling confused and a little betrayed, and I thought maybe sharing it would help me – and maybe someone else out there – feel a little less alone.

I've been with Mark for almost three years. It hasn’t always been sunshine and roses, let's be honest. We’ve had our rough patches, the kind where you wonder if you’re just fundamentally incompatible. But we’ve always talked, or at least *tried* to. We’ve been doing couples counseling, and I genuinely believe we’re making progress, even if it’s slow.

Then I confided in Sarah, my best friend since college. I told her about the latest disagreement, the frustration I was feeling, the hope I still held for us. And her response? It wasn't what I expected. It was… intense. She laid it on thick, painting Mark as a terrible person, a drain on my energy, and basically urging me to just *leave*. "You deserve better," she kept saying.

Honestly, it stung. A lot. Part of me, the part that’s already questioning everything, latched onto her words. But another part, a quieter, more persistent voice, felt…off. It felt like she was projecting her own past relationship traumas onto my situation. 

2020 has been a year of isolation for so many of us. We’re leaning on our friends more than ever for emotional support, and that’s a beautiful thing. But it’s also highlighted how easily advice can be skewed, how perspectives can clash, and how sometimes, even the best intentions can feel incredibly damaging.

I realized I needed to set a boundary. Gently, but firmly, I explained to Sarah that while I appreciated her concern, her advice wasn’t helpful. I needed support, not a verdict. It was a tough conversation, but it felt surprisingly liberating. Ultimately, I need to trust my own gut, my own process, and the work I’m doing with Mark. Because at the end of the day, *my* relationship is *mine*.

Has anyone else experienced something similar? I’d love to hear your thoughts.
