Okay, here's a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 257 words, set in 2020:

**The Weight of a Hand on the Counter**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How quickly things can shift, how a normal Tuesday afternoon can suddenly feel… different. I’m still processing it, honestly. Back in March of 2020, I was working at my local neighborhood market – just trying to stock shelves and help folks grab their essentials during the pandemic. 

That’s when he walked in. 

He wasn't aggressive, not outwardly. But he was carrying a gun. Open carry. And the way his hand rested on the counter as he browsed felt… heavy. It wasn’t a threatening gesture, exactly, but it was a weight. A sudden, jarring awareness of something not right. 

I’d read about these things, of course. The debates around gun control, the arguments about open carry, the anxieties simmering beneath the surface of our society. But reading about it is a world away from actually *feeling* it. 

I found myself acutely aware of my colleagues, of the customers, of the potential for… anything. It’s unsettling to realize how quickly a sense of vulnerability can creep in.  I’m a retail worker; my job is to be friendly, helpful, and a constant. But that day, I just wanted to disappear. 

It made me think about the quiet, persistent fear a lot of us carry – the fear of walking down the street, of going to the grocery store, of simply existing in public spaces.  2020 was already a year of uncertainty, and that encounter just amplified it, adding another layer to the feeling that things were…fragile.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the story (like the worker's feelings about authority, or the broader societal context)?
