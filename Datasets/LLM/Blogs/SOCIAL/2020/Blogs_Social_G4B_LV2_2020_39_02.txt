**The Static of a Silent Phone**

Okay, real talk. 2020 was… a lot. Between the pandemic and everything else, connection felt extra fragile. I remember vividly a few months back, staring at my phone, utterly baffled. Liam – my boyfriend at the time – just… vanished. Gone. No texts, no calls, nothing for a whole month. 

It wasn't just the silence, though. It was the *feeling*. A knot of confusion tightening in my stomach, laced with a serious dose of worry. Was I not enough? Had I done something wrong? The social media highlight reels of everyone else's seemingly perfect relationships only amplified the mess in my head. 

Then, suddenly, he was back. A mumbled apology, a vague explanation about needing space. It felt… insufficient.  It sparked a whole messy internal debate about communication, about what a healthy relationship *should* look like.  It’s a reminder that even when you’re connected online, genuine connection needs real, honest conversation.  Anyone else experienced something similar? Let’s talk about it. #relationships #ghosting #2020memories

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
