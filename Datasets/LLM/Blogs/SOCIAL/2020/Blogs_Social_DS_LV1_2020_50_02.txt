### The Third Person in Our Relationship: My Girlfriend, Me, and Her Ex in Rehab

It’s 2020. The world has shrunk to the size of our apartment, and my relationship with Sarah has become the main event. We’ve baked sourdough, binge-watched everything, and navigated the intense closeness that a global pandemic forces upon you. It’s been beautiful and hard, but there’s a third person in our bubble, and he lives in a rehab facility two states away.

His name is Mark, Sarah’s ex-boyfriend.

When she told me he was struggling and had checked himself in, my first feeling was sympathy. My second, creeping in like a shadow, was a knot of anxiety. Because their friendship isn’t just a casual, yearly catch-up. It’s a daily text thread. It’s hour-long phone calls where she talks him down from a ledge I can’t even see. She is his primary emotional support system, a lifeline tethering him to stability.

And I’m over here, feeling like a jealous monster for even questioning it. How can you compete with someone’s mental health crisis? You can’t, and you absolutely shouldn’t. That’s what my logical brain says. But my heart, the insecure one, whispers a different question: Is this just profound compassion, or is it a thread of unresolved attachment?

I see the weight of it on her. She’s exhausted, carrying his pain on top of our pandemic anxieties. I want to be her rock, but sometimes it feels like I’m just another person in the room while she’s emotionally elsewhere, tending to a history I wasn’t part of.

I haven’t said any of this to her. Not really. How do you voice a fear that sounds so selfish? “I’m worried you care too much about someone who is suffering.” It sounds awful.

But the unspoken worry is a presence in our home, too. It’s the quiet that falls after she gets off the phone with him. It’s the question of where this intense, platonic friendship leaves room for *us*. In a year where connection is everything, I’m just trying to figure out if our bond is being strengthened by her kindness, or if it’s quietly being stretched thin by a ghost from her past.
