The nightly applause from balconies has faded, but the echo of our gratitude for nurses remains. In 2020, we learned that staying home and banging pots wasn't enough. The real question became: how do we offer support that truly reaches them, past the PPE and the exhaustion?

I remember dropping off a simple care package—not homemade masks, but good coffee and soft socks—for a nurse friend. Her text later wasn't about the items; it was, "You remembered I exist outside these walls." That was the shift. It wasn't about grand gestures, but consistent, practical acts that said, "I see your whole self."

True support meant running an errand so they could sleep, sending a meal they didn't have to cook, or just listening without expecting a reply. It was about moving beyond the symbolic and into the deeply personal. Our gratitude is most powerful not when it’s shouted from a distance, but when it’s quietly woven into the fabric of their unimaginably difficult days.
