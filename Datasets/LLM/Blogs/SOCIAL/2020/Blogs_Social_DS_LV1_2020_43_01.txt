It’s 2020, and my dad, at 66, asked me to find a co-op zombie game like *Dying Light*—something we could play together online while stuck at home. He’d tried it before but found it too tough. It hit me then: gaming isn’t just for the young or skilled. It’s about connection, especially when the world feels distant. Finding the right game became more than a pastime; it was our bridge across generations and miles.
