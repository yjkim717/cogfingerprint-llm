The rumble of the highway called, promising better pay than my local delivery routes. But in 2020, home was my anchor. The world felt uncertain; being home every night wasn't a perk, it was a necessity. I started looking for that unicorn: a CDL job hauling steel or building materials on a daily route. Itâ€™s about finding a balance, trading some long-haul romance for the irreplaceable comfort of your own bed and the stability we all craved that year. The road can wait until morning.
