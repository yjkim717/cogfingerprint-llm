**The Weight of a Digital Trophy**

Remember 2020? We were all glued to screens, desperately seeking connection online. I got sucked into this whole “trophy hunting” thing in *Final Fantasy XIV*.  It started as fun, chasing those elusive achievements. But lately, it’s felt… heavy.  So many felt impossible, thanks to server lag and dwindling groups. 

It made me think about how we measure success online. Is it really about collecting digital badges when it feels like a frustrating race against the odds?  Maybe some achievements deserve a different kind of recognition – a quiet acknowledgement of the effort, not a forced victory.
