## The Long Road to Maybe: When Your Body Just Doesn't Make Sense

It’s 2020, and honestly, feeling a little off has become almost…normal? But for me, “a little off” has been the story of the last six years. Recurring dizziness, waves of weakness that leave me struggling to get out of bed, strange vision shifts, and even chest pain – it all felt so random, so *wrong*. For a while, doctors thought it was seizures. Medication, tests, the whole shebang. Nothing really clicked.

Recently, I stumbled across POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) while scrolling through Reddit, and something resonated. The symptoms…they align. It’s a long shot, I know, and I'm still seeing a neurologist. But it offers a glimmer of hope, a possible explanation for this frustrating, isolating journey. Anyone else out there feel like they've been searching for answers for *years*?
