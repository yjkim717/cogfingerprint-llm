## The Tilt and the Tournament: Why Showing Up Matters

Remember those early days of online gaming? The frantic dial-up, the pixelated graphics, and the *rage* when things weren't going your way? Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about that frustration, and how it's manifested in a weird new way, especially in Rocket League.

I recently watched a smaller online tournament – a real scrappy affair – and saw a team just *quit* after dropping their first match. Seriously. Just left the lobby. It felt…deflating. Not just for the other team, who had actually earned that win, but for the whole spirit of competition.

2020 has been a year of unexpected exits, hasn't it?  We’ve all felt the urge to just walk away from something challenging, something frustrating. But in Rocket League, and in life, I think there's something powerful about pushing through. Even when your MMR is tanking, even when you're getting stomped. 

It's about the lessons learned, the growth that comes from battling back, and the respect you show to your opponents. Plus, those tournament rewards are pretty sweet!  Maybe it’s just me, but sticking it out feels a whole lot more rewarding than rage-quitting. What do you guys think?
