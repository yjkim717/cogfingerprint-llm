**More Than Just ‘Thank You’ – A Nurse’s Plea**

It’s 2020, and the word “thank you” has been shouted from every porch and plastered across every social media post. And honestly, we nurses – we *do* appreciate the sentiment. But as I’ve been on the front lines, witnessing firsthand the sheer exhaustion and vulnerability, it’s become clear that’s not enough. 

We need something deeper. We need a shift in how we, as a community, offer support.  It’s not about crafting a hastily-made mask (though those were hugely appreciated!). It’s about being a mediator – a quiet presence, a listening ear, a small act of solidarity that acknowledges the immense emotional weight we carry. 

Right now, we’re desperately needing practical help: meal deliveries, childcare, even just a handwritten note saying, “You’re not alone.” Let’s move beyond gratitude and into genuine, tangible support.  Because truly, we are holding this whole system together, and we can’t do it alone.
