>Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the provided keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational tone and storytelling style, set within a 2020 context:

## The Empty Chair and the Empty Words

It’s funny, isn’t it? How 2020 just kept piling it on. A pandemic, political upheaval…and for me, the sudden loss of my grandmother. It hit me harder than I expected. And then came the well-meaning, but ultimately hollow, responses. Especially from the school.

A generic email about “sending strength” and a suggestion to “focus on the positive memories.” It felt…detached. Like a script. My kid, who was struggling to understand everything, just looked at me with wide, confused eyes. We were navigating a world of masks and lockdowns, and suddenly, this huge, gaping hole in our family. 

I just wanted someone to *see* the grief, not offer a pre-packaged solution. It’s not that I didn't appreciate the thought, but the idealism felt false. We didn't need positivity; we needed space to *feel* the sadness. Maybe schools, maybe all of us, need to get better at acknowledging the messiness of life, instead of trying to gloss it over with platitudes. It felt like another layer of distance in a year that already felt miles long.

**Note:** I tried to capture the feeling of loss alongside the critique of institutional responses, all filtered through the unique context of 2020's challenges.
