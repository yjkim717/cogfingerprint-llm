**The Quiet Shame of Watching Things Fall Apart**

Remember 2020? It felt like *everything* was a potential disaster, didn’t it? And honestly, I found myself caught in a strangely familiar pattern – a quiet shame of watching my own efforts crumble. It wasn’t about laziness or lack of care; it was this unsettling feeling that I was, somehow, a destructive force. 

I’d dive into a new online community, excited to connect, and then… silence.  Or start a creative project, brimming with enthusiasm, only to abandon it after a few weeks. It felt like I was actively sabotaging myself, pushing away the very connections I craved. 

Looking back, I realize it stemmed from a deep-seated fear of failure, a belief that if I invested emotionally, I’d inevitably end up isolated and disappointed.  It’s a painful pattern, but recognizing it is the first step toward breaking free.
