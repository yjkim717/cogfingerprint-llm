### The Silence That Screams: A Reflection from 2020

It’s a strange feeling, to be completely surrounded by people yet feel utterly, devastatingly alone. I think a lot of us felt a version of this in 2020, when the world shrank to the size of our apartments and our social lives became a grid of faces on a screen. But for me, that loneliness wasn't new; the lockdown just gave it a physical address.

My loneliness has always been an internal one, a social disconnect that hums under the surface even in a crowded room. It’s the voice that whispers, during a group laugh, *“They’re just tolerating you.”* It’s the feeling of watching a beautiful, intricate dance from behind a soundproof glass wall, convinced you’d only step on toes if you tried to join.

And for a long time, the only way I knew to make that internal scream audible, to prove to myself that the pain was real, was to turn it into something physical. A scratch, a burn. It was a desperate, twisted form of communication with myself. The emotional static inside was so loud and chaotic that creating a clear, simple, physical pain felt like a relief. It was a problem I could see, one I could tend to and bandage. Unlike the messy, sprawling ache of feeling worthless, it had a defined edge.

The isolation of 2020 forced me to sit with that static without the usual distractions. And in that quiet, I had a terrifying realization: the physical act was just a symptom. The real injury was the belief that I didn’t deserve to take up space, that my presence was a burden in the social fabric of the world.

Healing, I’m learning, isn’t about silencing that voice of self-hatred overnight. It’s about changing the channel. It’s about forcing myself to send that risky text, to accept that invitation even when every fiber screams to cancel, to believe the person who says, “I’m glad you’re here.” It’s about building a new, quieter voice that says, “You belong in the dance,” even if your steps are a little clumsy.

The scars are still there, but now they feel less like marks of shame and more like a map of a war I’m finally learning how to fight—not against myself, but for myself. And that’s a battle worth showing up for.
