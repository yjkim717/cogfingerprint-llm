## The Echo Chamber and the Weight of Unknowing

I remember the summer of 2020 feeling… different. It wasn’t just the pandemic, though that was certainly a huge part of it. It was something else, a kind of collective anxiety that seemed to amplify with every news cycle. And it manifested in some really strange ways.

Specifically, I started noticing how readily people were accepting narratives. Not just accepting them, but *investing* in them. When a tragedy struck – and it felt like tragedies were striking more frequently than ever – the internet exploded with explanations, often wild and unsubstantiated. Theories blossomed, spreading like wildfire across social media. And the more outlandish they were, the more traction they seemed to gain.

It was unsettling. I’d see friends sharing these things, people I respected, genuinely believing these elaborate storylines. And I felt this weird mix of sadness and frustration. Sadness for the grief they were finding solace in, even if that solace was built on shaky ground. Frustration because… well, where was the critical thinking? Where was the pause before sharing, the little voice asking, "Is this actually credible?"

I found myself retreating a little.  Not from the world, but from the constant barrage of speculation. It felt like everyone was desperate to *know* what happened, to fill the void of uncertainty with a story, *any* story. But often, these stories weren't about understanding, they were about assigning blame, about finding a comforting villain in a chaotic situation.

It made me think about how easily we can get caught up in echo chambers online. We gravitate towards people who share our views, and algorithms feed us more of what we already believe, reinforcing our biases. Suddenly, a fringe theory can feel like common knowledge, simply because we’re surrounded by people repeating it.

Looking back, I realize that 2020 was a masterclass in the dangers of unchecked speculation and the importance of pausing, questioning, and seeking out reliable information. It’s a lesson that feels more relevant now than ever, and one I’m trying to carry with me in this increasingly noisy world.  It’s okay to not know. It’s even better to admit it and seek understanding, rather than cling to a comfortable, but potentially false, narrative.
