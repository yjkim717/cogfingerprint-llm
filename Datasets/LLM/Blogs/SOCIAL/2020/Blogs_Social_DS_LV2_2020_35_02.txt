It’s 2020, and I’m watching a friend—a broke college student—get swept up in something that breaks my heart a little. She’s bright, ambitious, and just trying to make ends meet. Then Arbonne enters the picture.

Suddenly, her Instagram feed is all glossy skincare hauls and talk of building a “downline.” She’s posting recruitment links instead of study notes. I see the hope in her eyes, the promise of financial freedom in a year when everything feels uncertain.

But I also see the pressure. The inventory she can’t afford, the friends she’s awkwardly pitching to. It’s hard to watch someone you care about get caught in the MLM whirlwind, especially when they’re already struggling. You want to protect them, but all you can do is hope they find their way out before the cost—financial or emotional—becomes too high.
