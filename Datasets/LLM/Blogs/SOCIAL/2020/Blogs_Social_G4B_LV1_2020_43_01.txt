**Remember When We Were All Just… Online?**

It’s weird to think about 2020 now. Remember how everything felt mediated? Zoom calls replaced coffee dates, and “social distancing” became our new normal. I spent so much time scrolling, feeling connected yet utterly alone.  I started noticing how *urgent* everyone seemed to want validation online – likes, comments, shares.  It was exhausting.  There’s a strange comfort in a real hug, isn’t there?  A simple, un-filtered connection.

Would you like me to generate another blog post, perhaps with a different theme or length?
