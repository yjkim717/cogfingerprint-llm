**The Quietest Panic**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How sometimes the most unsettling things aren’t loud or dramatic. Like, I’ve been battling this… *lack* of something – no burp. Seriously. It sounds ridiculous, I know, especially when you’re scrolling through endless news about the pandemic in 2020. But it’s triggered a tidal wave of anxiety and, honestly, a pretty intense bout of emetophobia.

Suddenly, the thought of eating, of being around food… it’s become a minefield. I’ve had a few panicked moments, real mini-panic attacks.  I’m exploring all sorts of options, including some conversations about Botox – a totally strange solution to a completely bizarre problem. It feels isolating, trying to explain this to people, but I’m learning that sometimes, the quietest struggles are the hardest to face.
