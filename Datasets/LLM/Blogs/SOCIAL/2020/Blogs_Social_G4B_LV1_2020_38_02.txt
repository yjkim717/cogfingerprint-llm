**Lost Signals & Shared Stories: Navigating the Unexpected in 2020**

Okay, so, 2020. It was… a lot.  Lockdowns, masks, the constant low-hum of anxiety. But amidst all the chaos, I found myself really wrestling with a core question in my DCC RPG campaign: how do you introduce a *massive* shift in your story and still let your players feel like they’re driving it? 

I was building a campaign about a crew of astronauts returning from a decades-long mission, and I had this meticulously planned ‘reveal’ – a terrifying discovery waiting for them.  But my players, bless their hearts, were already starting to build their own little narratives, focused on the ship’s systems and the crew’s dynamics. 

It forced me to think about player behavior – not just *what* they were doing, but *why*.  I realized I needed to weave their choices into the core campaign arc, not just react to it. It's about finding that balance between a GM’s vision and the players’ agency.  Ultimately, the best moments came when we built a shared story, a collective “lost signal” echoing through the game.
