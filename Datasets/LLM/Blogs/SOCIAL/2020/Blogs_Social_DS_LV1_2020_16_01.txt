### The Day I Stopped Trusting the System to Keep Us Safe

It was the third time in six months. The sound is something you don’t forget—a high-pitched, terrified yelp from my own terrier, Buster, followed by the guttural snarls of the off-leash pit bull mix from down the street. This was the spring of 2020, a time when the world felt like it was holding its breath, and our quiet neighborhood walks became our only escape. Until they weren’t.

I’d done everything you’re supposed to do. After the first attack, I called Animal Control. A polite officer took my statement and promised to talk to the owner. After the second, more serious incident that left Buster with a vet bill and a lasting fear, I called again. I was told the owner had been cited. But the dog was still there, still roaming, and the owner’s neglect was a visible, festering thing. You could see the dog’s ribs, its water bowl was always overturned in the mud, and its furious barking at the fence was a constant, sad soundtrack.

The real turning point for me wasn’t the third attack itself; it was what happened after. When the same Animal Control officer arrived, he just sighed with a weary recognition. “We’ve spoken to him,” he said. “There’s only so much we can do.”

That phrase has haunted me ever since. *There’s only so much we can do.*

It laid bare a brutal truth: the system designed to protect us, and the animals, is fundamentally broken. It’s a reactive carousel of paperwork and warnings, utterly unequipped to handle the root of the problem—negligent, abusive owners. We weren’t dealing with a naturally “dangerous dog”; we were dealing with a dog made dangerous by a cruel environment and an owner who faced no real consequences.

My frustration slowly morphed into a sadder, more social realization. This isn’t just an animal control issue; it’s a societal one. We create these bureaucratic bandaids for deep, festering wounds. We respond to the symptom—the attacking dog—while ignoring the disease of irresponsibility and the cycle of abuse that created it.

I still walk Buster, though he startles more easily now. I look at that house and I don’t just see a dangerous animal. I see a failure—a failure of compassion, a failure of accountability, and ultimately, a failure of a system that tells good people, “There’s only so much we can do,” while allowing the worst to continue unchecked.
