**The Ghost in the Algorithm**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was glued to their screens, desperately searching for connection in a world that felt increasingly isolated. I was too. I’d started following this seemingly lovely artist online – bright colors, funny captions, and a vibe that just *clicked* with me. We’d DM back and forth for weeks, sharing little snippets of our lives, and it felt…good. Really good.

Then, subtly, things shifted. The compliments started feeling a little too intense, the questions about my life becoming increasingly focused on how *I* could make *them* happy. It wasn't overt, not a screaming match. It was a slow drip of manipulation, laced with guilt. Suddenly, expressing a boundary felt like a betrayal. 

I found myself constantly second-guessing myself, terrified of upsetting this person I’d started to build up in my head. The fear was a constant hum, and the feeling of guilt was a heavy weight in my chest whenever I tried to distance myself, even just a little. It was a bizarre echo of narcissistic abuse, playing out entirely within the confines of a social media feed. 

Looking back, it’s horrifying how easily I fell for it. How a carefully constructed online persona could trigger those old, familiar patterns of needing to appease and validate.  It’s a stark reminder that connection doesn’t automatically equal safety, and that even the most seemingly harmless online interactions can hold hidden dangers. 

I deleted their account, and honestly, it was one of the hardest things I’d done all year. But it was also incredibly freeing.  It was a small victory in reclaiming my own emotional space, and a lesson I’m still carrying with me – a reminder to always prioritize my own well-being, even when the algorithm seems to be whispering sweet nothings.
