**The Weight of What We Hide**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we build these little walls around ourselves, especially during a year like 2020. We curate our online profiles, present a polished version of our lives – and it’s exhausting. I started noticing it a lot during lockdown, this feeling that everyone was performing a version of ‘normal.’

Then I read something that really stuck with me – a description of a “Stand” that manifested fears. It made me think about how much of what we project is actually a shield, a way to avoid confronting the things that truly scare us. 

I’ve been wrestling with this lately, realizing how much of my social anxiety is fueled by the *fear* of being judged, of not fitting in. It’s a cycle, isn't it? The fear manifests, and we build up defenses, reinforcing the very thing we dread.  Maybe, just maybe, acknowledging those underlying anxieties – seeking support like a psychotherapist might offer – is the first step to dismantling those walls. It’s a scary thought, but a potentially freeing one.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different length?
