### The Hardest Button I’ve Ever Pressed: Blocking a Friend

It’s 2020. The world is on fire in a dozen different ways, and my phone dings. It’s her. Again. A paragraph-long text that starts with “I know you’re probably busy, but…” and spirals into a drama I don’t have the emotional bandwidth to absorb. My stomach clenches. It’s the same feeling I’d get walking on eggshells in person, now digitized and delivered straight to my pocket.

This was my final straw with a friendship that had long since turned toxic. For years, I was the loyal sidekick in her one-woman show. Her crises were always more urgent, her needs more pressing. If I had a problem, it was minimized. If I had a success, it was a threat. I was a supporting character in the story of her life, and my sole purpose was to reflect her glory and absorb her chaos. I now know this has a name: narcissistic abuse. Back then, I just called it exhausting.

The manipulation was a masterclass. It was never a direct insult; it was a sigh and, “I’m just worried you’re changing.” It was the guilt-trip when I couldn’t drop everything: “I guess I’ll just deal with this alone, then.” She had a PhD in making me feel responsible for her emotional state, and I was an A+ student.

In a year defined by isolation, the idea of willingly cutting someone out felt… wrong. Was I being cruel? Was I abandoning her during a global pandemic? The guilt was a heavy blanket. I’d write and rewrite texts, trying to find the perfect words to explain the slow death of our friendship by a thousand paper cuts. But there are no perfect words for a person who rewrites every script to make themselves the victim.

So, I didn’t send a long, explanatory text. I didn’t pick a fight. I simply pressed “block.”

And friends, that button felt more monumental than any “send” button ever had. My finger hovered for a full minute. It felt like an act of violence, a final, cruel slam of a door. But in the quiet that followed—the first true quiet in years—I realized it wasn’t an act of aggression. It was an act of construction. I was finally building a boundary.

The relief wasn’t immediate joy. It was the absence of dread. It was waking up and not checking my phone for a landmine. It was the space to finally hear my own thoughts again without her static.

Blocking her wasn’t about punishment. It was about preservation. It was me choosing my own fragile mental health in a traumatic year. It was the ultimate act of setting a boundary when all other attempts had failed. Sometimes, the kindest thing you can do for yourself is to make a clean break, even if the scar remains. And in the strange solitude of 2020, I finally started to heal mine.
