**The Weight of Unspoken Words**

Remember 2020? It felt like a year of holding things back, didn’t it? I found myself thinking a lot about my Chinese heritage, and the frustrating gap between wanting fluency and actually *getting* there.  It’s not just about textbooks, is it? It’s about connection. 

I was wrestling with motivation – how to keep practicing when time and money felt so limited.  It’s a surprisingly emotional process, trying to reconnect with a language that felt like a piece of my family history, just out of reach.  Maybe the biggest challenge isn't the grammar, but the quiet longing to truly *speak* it, to bridge that gap.  Anyone else feel this pull?
