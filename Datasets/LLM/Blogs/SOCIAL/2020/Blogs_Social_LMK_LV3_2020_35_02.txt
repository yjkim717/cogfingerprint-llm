As I watched my friend get swept up in Arbonne's promise of glowing skin and financial freedom in 2020, I couldn't help but feel a deep concern. The lure of a multi-level marketing scheme can be intoxicating, especially when it involves a product as appealing as skincare. But I've seen the financial strain it can put on individuals, and the potential risks of recruitment-driven business models. My friend's enthusiasm is genuine, but I'm left wondering: is the promise of a lucrative side hustle worth the potential financial fallout?
