**The Weight of "Maybe"**

Remember 2020? Everything felt… paused. And dating felt even more complicated. I was stuck on this guy, Liam, who was *almost* interested. He’d laugh at my jokes, we’d chat for hours, but a date? He’d just shake his head, citing “too much effort.” 

It wasn’t about him, of course. It was me, wrestling with this swirling uncertainty. Was I overthinking it? Was I pushing too hard? It’s a weird feeling, wanting someone so badly while simultaneously wanting to protect yourself.  Anyone else ever felt the weight of a potential “maybe”?

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
