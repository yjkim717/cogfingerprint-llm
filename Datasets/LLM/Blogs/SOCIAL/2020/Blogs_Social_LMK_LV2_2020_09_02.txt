As I caught up with a Living Wealth representative in 2020, I was struck by the remarkable story of Ray Poteet, who had harnessed the power of infinite banking. With a staggering 121 life insurance policies, Ray had transformed his financial landscape. Inspired by Nelson Nash's philosophy, he had created a self-financing loop, leveraging his policies to fuel his living wealth. It's a testament to the potential of this unconventional strategy, and a reminder that with the right guidance, we can all take control of our financial futures and build lasting prosperity.
