## The Golden Arches and a Little Bit of Disappointment

Remember 2020? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? A year of uncertainty, of pivoting to drive-throughs for… well, everything. And for a while, I found myself relying on McDonald’s more than I ever thought I would. It was quick, easy, and a small comfort during a really strange time.

But lately, something felt… off. It wasn't just the longer-than-usual wait in the drive-through – that was practically expected. It was the food. Soggy fries, cold burgers, and a general lack of care in the preparation. It felt like the usual standards had completely slipped.

I know, it’s just fast food. But it's also a little symbol of how the pandemic impacted *everything*, even our simple routines. It made me think about how much we all adapted, and how sometimes, the little things we relied on let us down. Maybe it was just a rough patch for that particular McDonald's, but it left me with a lingering feeling of disappointment, a small echo of the bigger frustrations of 2020.
