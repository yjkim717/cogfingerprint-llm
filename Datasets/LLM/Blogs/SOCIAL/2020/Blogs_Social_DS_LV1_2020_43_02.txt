Walking to my local polling place here in Springfield last November, I couldn't shake the feeling that my vote would just disappear into the Chicago-dominated totals. The media had called Illinois for Biden before I even left my house. But as I filled in that oval, I remembered my grandfather telling me about voting for the first time as a young Black man in the 60s. My vote matters because it's mine. That act itself—standing in that booth—is where the real power lives.
