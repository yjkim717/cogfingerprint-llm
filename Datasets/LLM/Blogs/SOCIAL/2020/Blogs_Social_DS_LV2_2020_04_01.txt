### The Silence Was the Loudest Sound

I remember the exact moment I realized the world had gone quiet. It was late March 2020, and the constant hum of traffic from the freeway near my apartment had simply vanished. In its place was a silence so profound it felt heavy, like a blanket smothering the city. I thought the quiet would be peaceful. I didn’t know it would make the noise inside my own head deafening.

That internal noise wasn’t new. For years, it had taken the shape of a corrosive whisper, a voice that cataloged every flaw and magnified every mistake. It was the architecture of my own self-hatred, built brick by brick through bouts of depression. I had become an expert at managing it, at dressing the wounds on my soul before they could bleed through. My coping mechanism was a frantic busyness—a calendar packed with social engagements, coffee dates, and late-night work sessions. The external noise was my white noise machine, drowning out the static within.

Then, the world stopped. The calendar emptied. The silence descended.

Suddenly, there was nowhere to run from myself. The emotional pain I’d been outrunning for years finally caught up, and it was overwhelming. The whispers became shouts. The old, familiar urge to translate that internal chaos into a physical sensation—to make the invisible pain visible—crept back in with a vengeance. It felt like the only thing I could still control in a world spinning out of control.

The turning point came on a Tuesday, during another endless video call. A friend, her face a small, pixelated square on my screen, suddenly broke down. “I just feel so… trapped,” she whispered, her voice cracking. “Trapped in my own head.”

Her words were a key turning in a lock I didn’t know I had. I wasn’t alone in this feeling of being caged. My struggle wasn’t a unique failure; it was a human response to an inhuman situation. In that year of mandated isolation, we were all forced to sit with our own minds. For those of us who carried old ghosts, 2020 held up a merciless mirror.

My journey since hasn’t been about vanquishing the noise. It’s been about learning to hear it without letting it dictate my actions. It’s about picking up the phone on the hard days and saying, “My head is a scary place to be right now.” The silence of 2020 was brutal, but it taught me a crucial, painful lesson: you cannot heal a wound you refuse to acknowledge. And sometimes, the first step to quieting the storm inside is to finally, bravely, give it a name.
