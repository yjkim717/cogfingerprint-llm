>## The Year My World Started Tilting (and Why I'm Finally Asking for Help)

Okay, so, 2020. We all remember 2020, right? Global pandemic, lockdowns, a general feeling of… off-kilter. But for me, 2020 wasn't just about the world feeling weird. It was about *my* world feeling weird, too. 

It started subtly, six years ago now. Just a fleeting dizziness here, a wave of nausea there. I’d brush it off – stress, low blood sugar, not enough water. But it’s slowly, relentlessly gotten worse. Lately, standing up feels like being on a boat. My vision blurs, my heart races, and sometimes… sometimes I just have to grab onto something to keep from fainting.

For a while, doctors thought it was seizures. The fainting spells were the biggest concern. It felt… frustrating, to be honest. Like my body was betraying me in a way I couldn’t explain, and no one really *got* it. 

But recently, I stumbled across something called POTS – Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. It feels… right. A lot of the symptoms line up. So, I'm finally taking the leap, scheduling an appointment with a neurologist. It’s scary, putting yourself out there, admitting you need help. But maybe, just maybe, this is the start of understanding what's been going on and finally feeling grounded again.
