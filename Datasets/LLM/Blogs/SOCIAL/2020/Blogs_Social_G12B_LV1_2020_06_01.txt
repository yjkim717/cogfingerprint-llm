## Static on the Screen, Static in My Soul

It’s weird, isn't it? 2020. The world feels…off. Like a badly tuned radio, just a constant hum of anxiety and uncertainty. I keep scrolling, endlessly consuming news and social media, but it all just feels…worthless. Another headline, another tragedy, another perfectly curated life flashing across my screen. And I’m just…here.

I've been wrestling with a feeling I can't quite shake: a creeping sense of expendability. Like a background character in a play nobody's watching. What’s the point? What am I even *doing*? I know, deep down, that's a pretty bleak thought. I try to push it away, but it clings. Maybe everyone feels this way a little bit right now, adrift in the chaos. Maybe we're all just trying to find a signal amidst the static.




I hope this fits what you were looking for! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
