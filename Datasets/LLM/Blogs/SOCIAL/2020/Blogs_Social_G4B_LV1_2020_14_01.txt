**Chrome Dreams & Worry Lines**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a simple desire can suddenly feel like a full-blown argument. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with this thing – a motorcycle. A gleaming, roaring, open-road motorcycle. And my girlfriend, Sarah, is… not thrilled.

Honestly, she’s been pretty quiet about it, just a constant, low-level furrow in her brow. She’s worried about the money, of course. 2020 was… a year, let’s just say. Recession talk was everywhere, and saving felt like a losing battle. And then there's the whole “responsible adult” thing, which she definitely embodies. 

But it’s more than just the finances, I think. It's this pull, this need for something *more* than the daily grind. I’ve been feeling trapped lately, you know? Scrolling through Instagram, seeing everyone’s summer adventures – mostly from their balconies, admittedly – and feeling like I was missing out. 

I keep telling myself it’s about freedom, about feeling the wind in my hair (and not just the dust of a commuter train). But Sarah’s right, of course. It’s a huge purchase, and we need to be smart. 

I'm posting this here, partly because I need to hear if anyone else has faced this kind of pushback – a huge, exciting thing colliding with someone else’s carefully constructed reality.  It’s a reminder that even the wildest dreams need a little bit of compromise, and a lot of honest conversation.  Anyone else got a shiny object they’re battling with?
