## The Soap and the Scroll: Finding My Reflection in 2020

Remember when everyone was making those DIY transparent soaps? The ones where you could embed flowers or little trinkets inside? I tried it once. It was… unsettling. You’d pour the mixture, and as it started to solidify, you’d see *everything* suspended within – little bubbles, stray bits of color, imperfections you hadn’t noticed before. It felt like looking at a distorted version of myself.

That’s kind of how I’ve been feeling about social media this year. 2020, right? The year that felt like a collective holding of breath. The year when we were all glued to our screens, searching for connection, for answers, for *something* to make sense of the chaos. And what did we find? Mostly reflections.

But not the kind you want.

Scrolling through Instagram, TikTok, even LinkedIn – it was like staring into a giant, shimmering soap bubble. Everyone presenting the *best* version of themselves. The perfect sourdough loaves, the flawless home offices, the relentlessly positive affirmations. And the more I scrolled, the more I felt…numb.

It's like my brain started building a protective layer, a kind of emotional static, to shield itself from the constant comparison, the curated realities. I felt trapped in this endless loop of seeing everyone else seemingly thriving while I was just…existing.  It felt like a personalized hell, honestly, a constant reminder of what I *wasn't* doing, what I *didn’t* have.

I realized I needed to step away. Just for a little while. To look away from the distorted reflections and try to find something real, something grounded, within myself. It’s still a work in progress, battling the pull of the scroll, but I’m starting to see clearer now. Maybe the best connection isn't found in a perfectly filtered image, but in the quiet spaces between the posts.
