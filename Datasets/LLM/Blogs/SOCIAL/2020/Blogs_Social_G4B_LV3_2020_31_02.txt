**The Unexpected Conversation**

Remember 2020? It felt like *everything* was a conversation, even about things we didn’t expect. I had a really strange one recently while dating. It kept circling back to this… expectation of anal sex. Honestly, it threw me. I’m not against it, but it felt like a fundamental difference in what we both wanted. 

It made me think about how often we gloss over preferences in relationships, assuming everyone’s on the same page.  How do you gently navigate a disparity like that and still build a connection? It’s a tricky dance, isn’t it?
