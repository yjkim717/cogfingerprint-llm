## That Mac and Cheese Question on MLK Day

It’s January 20, 2020. MLK Day. I spent the weekend wrestling with a question a friend posed, and it’s stuck with me. He’s Caucasian, like me, and he was planning on making a big batch of mac and cheese – with a little spice, a little smoky flavor – to share with friends.  His concern? Was it…off? Insensitive, even, to be celebrating MLK Day with what he termed “soul food?”

Honestly, it threw me. We talked about it for a while. It wasn't about the food itself, obviously. It was about appropriation, about honoring a day dedicated to the Civil Rights Movement by engaging with a cuisine so deeply rooted in Black history and culture. 

We landed on the idea that intention matters. It’s not about *taking* something, but about *appreciating* and *honoring* the legacy behind it.  Sharing a meal, especially one with that history, can be a way to connect and learn, as long as it’s done with respect and a genuine desire to understand.  It’s a conversation I’m glad we had, and one I think we all need to be having.
