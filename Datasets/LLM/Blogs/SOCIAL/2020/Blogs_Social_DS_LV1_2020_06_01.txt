It’s 2020, and I’m scrolling through my feed, feeling like a cog in a machine. Sometimes I wonder: am I just here to produce, consume, and serve some invisible system? It’s easy to feel expendable, like my purpose is just to feed the cycle. But then I remember—we’re all in this together, trying to find meaning beyond the grind. Maybe our real worth isn’t in what we provide, but in the connections we keep alive.
