Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone, and keeping the 2020 context in mind. I've included a possible title and some notes afterward on why I made certain choices.

## The Unexpected Side Effect of Surviving 2020: My Burrito Obsession

Let's be honest, 2020 was… a lot. Stress levels were through the roof, and I was battling more headaches than I care to remember. Migraines became a regular, unwelcome visitor. I’d clutch a heating pad, down some ibuprofen, and desperately search for anything that offered a sliver of comfort. 

And somehow, somewhere along the line, that comfort started looking like a giant, cheesy, overloaded burrito. 

It’s ridiculous, I know. But I’ve realized I’ve accidentally Pavlov'd myself. That feeling of relief after a migraine, that little flicker of happiness – my brain has decided it equals…burritos. Now, I crave them. Like, *really* crave them. My wallet's weeping, and my "burrito gut" is definitely a thing.

It's a weird, little consequence of a year that brought so much upheaval. A silly, slightly embarrassing testament to how our brains seek solace, even in the most unexpected places.  Anyone else find themselves strangely attached to a comfort food they never saw coming? I feel like I'm not alone in finding bizarre coping mechanisms in this strange new world. Maybe we should all share our weird food obsessions – it might be the only thing that makes me feel normal right now.

**Notes on Choices & Considerations:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** Used phrases like "Let's be honest," "I know," and direct questions to the reader.
*   **Relatability:** Tied the burrito obsession to the shared experience of the stressful 2020 year.  Mentioning the heating pad and ibuprofen grounds it in a common experience.
*   **Storytelling:** Started with a broader context (2020) and then narrowed down to the personal anecdote.  Used descriptive language ("giant, cheesy, overloaded") to paint a picture.
*   **Pavlov's Name Drop:** Included it naturally, as it was a keyword.
*   **Humor:** Added a touch of self-deprecating humor ("my wallet's weeping," "burrito gut") to make it more engaging.
*   **Call to Action/Connection:** Ended with a question to encourage reader interaction and create a sense of community.



I hope this draft meets your needs! Let me know if you'd like any modifications.
