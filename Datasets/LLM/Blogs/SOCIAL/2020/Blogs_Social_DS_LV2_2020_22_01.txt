It started with a simple question in a nursing forum: “What can we actually do to help?” We’d already baked the banana bread, sewn the masks, and dutifully stayed home. But the news felt heavy, and the desire to do more was a physical ache.

The answers from the nurses were humbling. They didn’t ask for more homemade PPE. One wrote, “Just knowing we’re seen as people, not just faceless workers, is everything.” Another mentioned how a neighbor leaving a coffee on her porch after a double shift made her cry.

It hit me then. Our most powerful tool wasn’t a sewing machine; it was intentional compassion. In 2020, we were all fighting a silent war, but our healthcare workers were on the front lines, exhausted and isolated. The real help was in the small, human gestures—the text message, the grocery run, the simple, unwavering acknowledgment: I see you, and you are not alone.
