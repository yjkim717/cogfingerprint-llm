As I navigated my early twenties in 2020, I found myself torn between my desire for simple living and the harsh realities of financial uncertainty. With a variable income and a dream of owning a small, secluded house in a quaint town, I was desperate for guidance on managing my debt and creating a sustainable budget. Embracing the principles of simple living, I began to prioritize my spending and explore ways to make my financial goals a reality. By sharing my journey, I hope to connect with others who are walking a similar path and learn from their experiences in achieving financial freedom.
