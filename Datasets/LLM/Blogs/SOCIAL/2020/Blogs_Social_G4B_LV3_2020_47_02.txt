**The Ghost in the Algorithm**

Remember 2020? It felt like the internet was a constant, low-level hum of anxiety, didn’t it? And lately, I’ve been haunted by a melody. Not just any melody, but this insistent, repetitive techno loop – a fragment from some forgotten playlist. It’s lodged itself in my brain, a tiny, insistent ghost. 

I’ve spent hours searching, trawling through old Spotify playlists, even digging into obscure music forums. It’s the kind of frustrating, obsessive search that feels uniquely 2020 – a digital rabbit hole with no clear exit. It’s triggering this weird nostalgia, a longing for a time before information overload. 

It’s more than just a song; it’s a symbol of the way our attention gets pulled, fragmented, and ultimately, lost.  Maybe that’s the point – to remind us that sometimes, letting go is the most powerful track we can choose.
