## The Scroll and the Soul: Are We Really Connecting?

Remember 2020? The year the world shrunk to the size of our screens. We were all frantically connecting online – video calls, social media updates, endless scrolling. But lately, I’ve been feeling… disconnected. It's like looking at an RMS voltage reading of connection – a smoothed-out average that doesn't capture the peaks and valleys of real human interaction.

I was actually wrestling with this concept while trying to understand the difference between instantaneous and RMS voltage in AC circuits (nerd alert!). It hit me: social media often shows us the RMS – the consistent, polished version of everyone's lives. We rarely see the dips, the quiet moments, the genuine struggles. 

Are we truly building meaningful relationships, or just accumulating digital impressions? Maybe it’s time to look beyond the surface, to seek the instantaneous moments – the real, messy, beautiful connections that nourish our souls. Let's prioritize *being* over *appearing*, shall we?
