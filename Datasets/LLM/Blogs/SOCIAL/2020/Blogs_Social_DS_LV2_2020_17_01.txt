The year 2020 was supposed to be one of control—new decade, new resolutions. Then the world turned upside down. For me, the constant news about health and sickness triggered a deep-seated fear I’ve carried for years: emetophobia. It’s not just a dislike of being sick; it’s a terror of losing control over my own body, a ghost from past medical trauma that whispers, "What if it happens again?"

Ironically, in a year where we all lost control in some way, I’ve had to learn to sit with that fear. To acknowledge it without letting it dictate my days. Maybe you’ve felt something similar—that in the chaos, we’re all just trying to find our footing again.
