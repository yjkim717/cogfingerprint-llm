**Remembering the Rush**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a specific feeling can just… hit you out of nowhere. Lately, I’ve been thinking about 2020 – a year of a lot of quiet, a lot of staring at screens. But amidst all that, there was this incredible rush I felt during the Wichita campaign in *World of Warships Legends*. 

Specifically, those hardmode missions and weekly havocs. They were *hard*, genuinely pushing you to the top tier, and the feeling of accomplishment after conquering them? Pure gold. I miss that competitive spark, that sense of shared challenge with other players. It makes me wonder what truly keeps us connected in a digital world – maybe it’s those moments of pushing ourselves, together.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different version with a slightly different focus?
