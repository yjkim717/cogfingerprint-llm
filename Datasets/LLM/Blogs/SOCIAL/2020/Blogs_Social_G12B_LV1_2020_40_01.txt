## The Rules Around My Plate

It's weird how much control someone can exert, even over something as personal as eating. Last few months, things with Mark have felt…off. Subtle comments about portion sizes, suggestions about what I *should* be eating. It started small, but it escalated. Suddenly, I was restricting, feeling this constant pressure to be 'good.' Then, the guilt would hit, and I'd just…lose it. 

It’s a messed up cycle, and honestly, it’s exhausting. Trying to navigate this during a pandemic, already feeling isolated, has just amplified everything. I'm realizing healthy relationships don't involve policing someone's food. I need space to breathe, and maybe, so does my appetite.
