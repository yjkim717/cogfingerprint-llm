## Scrolling and Sighing

Honestly, 2020 has beenâ€¦ a lot. Lately, I find myself just *sighing* after scrolling through Reddit. It's not even specific arguments, just a general feeling of frustration with the way people interact online. So much anger, so much quick judgment. It makes me miss genuine connection, real conversations. Maybe we all need a digital detox and a reminder that there's a whole world beyond the screen.
