## My Brain, My Burritos, and a Very Strange Connection

Okay, so this is a little embarrassing to admit, but I need to share it. Anyone else ever develop a *weird* association between a feeling and a specific food? Because I think I’ve accidentally trained my brain to crave burritos when I have a headache. Seriously.

It started last year, 2020 – a year where comfort food was basically a survival skill. Whenever a migraine would hit (and let me tell you, they were frequent!), I’d reach for a warm, cheesy, tortilla-wrapped burrito. It felt good, comforting, a little bit of normalcy in a chaotic time.

Now? The *second* I feel that familiar throb behind my eyes, BAM – burrito craving. It’s Pavlov's dog all over again, but instead of a bell, it’s a pounding head. And my wallet (and my digestive system) are definitely feeling the effects. 

It’s a silly thing to be frustrated about, but it's a reminder of how powerful our brains are, and how easily we can create these unexpected connections. Anyone else have similarly bizarre food associations? I need to know I’m not alone in this tortilla-fueled madness!
