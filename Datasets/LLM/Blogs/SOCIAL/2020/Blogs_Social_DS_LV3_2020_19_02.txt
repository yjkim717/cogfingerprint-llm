The morning the news broke about Sushant Singh Rajput, my phone buzzed incessantly. At first, it was just shock—a collective, breathless “why?” whispered across the nation. I remember feeling a profound sadness for a talented life cut short, a story ended before its time.

But within days, that quiet grief was hijacked. My social media feeds, once filled with tributes, transformed into a chaotic courtroom. Wild conspiracy theories sprouted like weeds, each more outlandish than the last. The television news, which should have been a source of clarity, became a 24/7 spectacle of shouting matches and baseless accusations. It felt like we were no longer mourning a man; we were consuming a drama.

I found myself falling down rabbit holes, clicking on sensational headlines, getting swept up in the “whodunit” frenzy. It was addictive. But one evening, after watching another prime-time debate reduce a human tragedy to a political football, I had to shut it all off. The silence was jarring. In that quiet, a chilling thought emerged: We had collectively failed him.

We weren’t discussing the silent struggles of mental health that so many, especially young men, face in silence. We weren’t talking about the immense, often crushing, pressure of public life. Instead, we were pointing fingers, creating villains, and crafting narratives that served everything but the truth. The public’s thirst for a conspiracy, amplified by a media ecosystem that profits from outrage, had completely erased the person at the center of it all.

Sushant’s death became a national Rorschach test, and what we saw said more about us than about him. It revealed our dwindling patience for nuance and our erosion of critical thinking. In 2020, a year already defined by uncertainty and fear, this felt like a particularly painful symptom of a larger sickness. We lost not just an actor, but a piece of our collective empathy, choosing the comfort of a conspiracy over the difficult, human reality of suicide.
