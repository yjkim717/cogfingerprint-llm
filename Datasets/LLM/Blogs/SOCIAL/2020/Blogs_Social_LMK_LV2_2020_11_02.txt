"After a nasty car accident in 2020, I received an insurance payout and was considering how to use it. As I weighed my options, I started thinking about ditching my car for good. An ebike caught my eye - a greener, healthier alternative for my daily commute. I began exploring the world of ebikes, seeking advice from fellow cyclists and researching different models. Has anyone else made the switch? What were your experiences like?"
