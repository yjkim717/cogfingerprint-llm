It’s 2020, and honestly, the future feels like a foggy road. I’ve been thinking a lot about how we find clarity in uncertain times. Lately, I’ve been fascinated by this idea: what if we could tap into our collective wisdom, like a digital campfire where we all share our best guesses?

Imagine a space—a subreddit, perhaps—where people pool their insights on everything from stock trends to which movies will be hits. Alone, our predictions might be shaky, but together? There’s a quiet magic in averaging our perspectives, maybe even with a little machine learning to help connect the dots.

It reminds me that even when we feel isolated, our shared intuition can light the way. In a year that’s tested us all, maybe the most powerful forecasts come not from experts, but from us, together.
