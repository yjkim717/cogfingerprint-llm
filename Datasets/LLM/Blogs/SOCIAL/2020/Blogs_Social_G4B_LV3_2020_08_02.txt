**When Social Just Felt Like a Stomach Ache**

Remember 2020? It felt like the world was perpetually processing something awful. Scrolling through social media felt… heavy. Like a cat violently vomiting up its dinner – a chaotic mess of anxiety and information overload. 

My own little Luna, my ginger tabby, was going through a similar ordeal. Food poisoning left her dehydrated and utterly stressed. Watching her, I realized I was mirroring her distress. The constant stream of bad news, the arguments, the feeling of being overwhelmed – it was taking a serious toll. 

Just like rehydrating Luna with small, frequent sips, I started taking breaks. Turning off the notifications, focusing on simple things like a sunny windowsill and Luna purring on my lap. It wasn’t a cure-all, but it was a reset.  Sometimes, stepping away from the digital chaos is the most compassionate thing you can do – for yourself, and maybe even for the world.
