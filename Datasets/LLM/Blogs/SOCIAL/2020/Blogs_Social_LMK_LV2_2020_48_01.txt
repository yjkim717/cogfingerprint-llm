"Should I Stay or Should I Go: Navigating Remote Work and the Housing Market"

As I sit in my Boston apartment, laptop open and Wi-Fi strong, I'm reminded that the world is my office. It's 2020, and remote work has given me the freedom to choose where I live. But with that freedom comes a big decision: should I sell my house and relocate back home? As a software engineer, I've seen firsthand how job opportunities and financial decisions are influencing people's choices. Some are fleeing cities for more space, while others are moving to areas with a lower cost of living. For me, the decision is personal. I'm weighing the comforts of home against the excitement of city life. As I consider my next move, I'm realizing that it's not just about the place â€“ it's about what I want my life to look like. What's your remote work story?
