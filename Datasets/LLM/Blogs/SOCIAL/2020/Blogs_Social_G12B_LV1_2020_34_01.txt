## The Shoulder-Gate and the Tank Top Trauma: Still Thinking About School Dress Codes

It's 2020, and we're all hyper-aware of power dynamics and societal expectations, aren't we? Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about something that felt incredibly unfair as a kid: school dress codes. 

I remember two specific instances vividly. Once in fifth grade, I was sent home for my shoulders showing in a simple sundress. The principal, a stern woman with perfectly coiffed hair, lectured me about “distracting the boys.” Seriously? Distracting them from *learning*? Then, in middle school, a tank top incident. Apparently, even with a cardigan, it was "too revealing." 

Looking back, it wasn’t about safety or appropriateness. It felt like policing girls' bodies, subtly teaching us that our clothing choices were a problem, a disruption. I wonder how many other kids felt the same, singled out and embarrassed because of what they were wearing. Let’s hear your stories. Did your school have a particularly ridiculous dress code? What memories stick with you?
