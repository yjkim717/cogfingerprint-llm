### The Unwanted Commentary on My Existence

It’s 2020. The world is on fire, and my aunt’s biggest concern is still that I’ve “let my roots grow out.” It’s just one comment in a lifetime of unsolicited feedback, but it’s the one that broke me today.

It’s never just about the hair, is it? It’s a constant, low-grade hum of criticism about my appearance, my choice in books, my quiet personality. “You should smile more.” “Why don’t you wear more color?” “Are you still into that weird music?” Each one feels like a tiny paper cut. Individually, they’re nothing. Collectively, they sting like hell, and you’re left wondering why you’re bleeding.

This social pressure to contort yourself into a more palatable version for public consumption is exhausting. In a year where we’re all just trying to survive, the last thing anyone needs is a running commentary on their very being. It chips away at you, making you question your own choices and, slowly, your own worth.

But here’s what I’m holding onto in this messy year: my life is not a committee meeting. The goal isn’t to win a majority vote on my personality or my appearance. The goal is to be me—the real, unedited, root-growing, weird-music-loving me. And honestly? She’s pretty great. Everyone else’s opinion is just background noise I’m learning to tune out.
