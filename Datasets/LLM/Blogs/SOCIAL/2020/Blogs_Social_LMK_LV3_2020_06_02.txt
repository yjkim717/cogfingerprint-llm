As I navigated the challenges of 2020, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I was somehow toxic to those around me. Every failed project, strained relationship, and anxious thought fueled my self-doubt. I felt like I was perpetuating a cycle of guilt and toxicity, not just for myself, but for others too. It was a heavy burden to carry, and one that made me question my place in the world.
