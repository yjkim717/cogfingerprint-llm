**The Lopsided Smile and a Whole Lot of Worry**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something as seemingly small as a crooked smile can suddenly feel monumental. I remember last year, 2020, watching my foster son, Leo, obsess over his teeth. He was so self-conscious, constantly comparing himself to the other kids online – a really tough thing to navigate during lockdown. 

It sparked a memory of my own childhood – the awkward braces, the feeling of being different, and the worry it caused.  I realized how profoundly those early experiences could shape someone’s mental health. 

We started looking into pro bono orthodontic care, and honestly, just being there to listen and validate his feelings made a huge difference. It reminded me that sometimes, the biggest support we can offer isn't a fix, but a safe space to feel seen.  Foster parenting is about so much more than logistics; it’s about nurturing the whole person, inside and out.
