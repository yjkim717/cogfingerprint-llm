Remember in 2020, when the world was on fire and my daughter’s middle school was still obsessed with her bra strap? Seriously. She got pulled aside for a "distracting" strap peeking out from her tank top, while a boy in a muscle tee got a free pass.

It took me right back to my own school days, being told my shorts were "too short" and would "disrupt the learning environment." It was never about the boys' learning; it was about policing our bodies. This isn't just about fabric; it's a pattern. We teach girls, from a shockingly young age, that their bodies are problems to be covered up, that they are responsible for the reactions of others. It’s a subtle but powerful form of sexualization, and it’s time we called it what it is: gendered nonsense. Our kids deserve better than to learn that lesson.
