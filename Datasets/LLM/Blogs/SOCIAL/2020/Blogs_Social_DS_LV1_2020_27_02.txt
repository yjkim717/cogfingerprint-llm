It’s 2020, and I’ve been driving a delivery van for months—steady, but the pay barely covers rent. Lately, I’ve been eyeing CDL jobs; hauling steel sounds tough, but the money could change everything. A buddy told me about residential trucking gigs where you’re home every night—best of both worlds? I miss my family after long days dropping off packages. Maybe it’s time to trade cardboard boxes for something heavier, something that lets me build a future without sacrificing the present. What do you think—any truckers out there with advice?
