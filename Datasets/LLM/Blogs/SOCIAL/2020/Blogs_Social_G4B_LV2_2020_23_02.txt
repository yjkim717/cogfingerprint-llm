**That *Killing Stalking* Feeling…**

Okay, real talk. I just finished *Killing Stalking*, and I’m still…processing. It’s one of those stories that just *gets* under your skin. The ending hit me so hard, a real tidal wave of emotion. 

It’s weird, right? How something so dark and unsettling can leave you feeling so profoundly affected? I kept thinking about the messed-up dynamics of the relationships – complicated, messy, and honestly, a little unsettling.  It made me really consider how we react to characters who aren’t “good,” and the uncomfortable feelings they evoke.  Anyone else feel this way after diving into something intense like this?
