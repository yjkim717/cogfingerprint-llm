>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary, aiming for a conversational tone, relatability, and a reflective feel, set in a 2020 context. I've tried to weave in the core themes of heritage language learning, Mandarin, and the challenges of time/money, while keeping it personal.  I've included some potential image suggestions at the end.

## Lost in Translation (and Trying to Find My Way Back)

Remember back in 2020, when everything felt… uncertain? For me, it wasn't just the pandemic that was swirling around. It was also a growing feeling of disconnect from a part of myself: my Mandarin. Growing up, I heard it constantly at home, but formal classes? Never happened. Life got in the way, and suddenly, I felt like I was losing a piece of my heritage.

I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day about people trying to revive their heritage languages, specifically Mandarin. It hit me hard. So many shared the same struggle – wanting fluency but feeling trapped by time and money. It’s a really real thing. I’m starting small, re-watching old Chinese dramas (with subtitles, for now!), and trying to chat with my grandma more. It’s slow, but it feels good to be reconnecting. Anyone else feeling this pull?
