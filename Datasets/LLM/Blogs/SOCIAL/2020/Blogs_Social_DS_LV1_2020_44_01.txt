It’s 2020, and I’m rewatching *Avatar: The Last Airbender*—again. That scene where Hakoda tells Sokka to stay behind still hits hard. It’s not just about battle plans; it’s about feeling sidelined, unseen. In a year when so many of us felt disconnected, it reminded me how small exclusions can echo deeply. Sometimes, the quietest moments in stories speak loudest to our own lives. Anyone else find comfort in these emotional scenes lately?
