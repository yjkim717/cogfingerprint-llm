Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary and instructions, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and a 2020 feel:

**The Weight of a "Friend's Opportunity"**

It feels weird to write this, but I’ve been wrestling with something lately – a situation with a friend that’s left me feeling a little uneasy.  You know how it is, right? Someone you genuinely like gets excited about a new opportunity, and suddenly you're hearing about “amazing products” and “building a team.” 

My friend, let’s call her Sarah, got really caught up in an MLM (multi-level marketing) – Arbonne, specifically. She’s a student, juggling classes and a part-time job, and a really charismatic recruiter was singing its praises. It felt… intense. 

Honestly, it’s concerning. The pressure to recruit, the emphasis on ‘friendship’ as a sales tactic, it just didn’t sit right. It reminded me of those overly-enthusiastic network marketing pushes we saw everywhere in 2020 – a lot of promises, a little reality.  I wanted to be supportive, but I also felt this quiet worry for her.  It’s a tricky balance, isn’t it?

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way?  Perhaps add a specific detail or focus on a particular aspect of the situation?
