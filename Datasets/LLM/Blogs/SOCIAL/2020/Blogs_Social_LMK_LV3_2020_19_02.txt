The Sushant Singh Rajput Saga: A Reflection on Our Collective Obsession

The summer of 2020 will be etched in our memories for a long time, largely due to the frenzy surrounding Sushant Singh Rajput's untimely death. As news broke out, social media platforms were flooded with condolences, theories, and speculations. What started as a genuine outpouring of grief soon spiralled into a maelstrom of conspiracy theories and media trials.

As I scrolled through my feeds, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The narrative around Sushant's death was being shaped by armchair detectives and keyboard warriors, with little regard for facts or evidence. The media, too, was complicit in this spectacle, with some outlets prioritizing sensationalism over responsible reporting.

This episode got me thinking about our collective obsession with celebrity culture and the erosion of critical thinking. We're so invested in the lives of Bollywood stars that we forget to apply the same scrutiny to the information we're consuming. We lap up theories and speculation without questioning their validity, and in the process, we create a toxic environment that's more focused on entertainment than truth.

As we moved forward with the narrative, we were all caught up in it. We were all guilty of being swept away by the tide of speculation and gossip, and we forgot to be empathetic. Sushant Singh Rajput's death was a tragedy, and it's essential we remember him with dignity and respect, rather than getting bogged down in the murk of conspiracy theories.
