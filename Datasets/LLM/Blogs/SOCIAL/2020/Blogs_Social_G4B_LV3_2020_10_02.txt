**The Echo of “Just One More”**

It’s funny how little things can build up, isn’t it? 2020 was *the* year for noticing those quiet, persistent irritations. And mine came in the form of my fiancé’s… enthusiasm for audio equipment. Seriously, the man was obsessed. Not in a cool, audiophile way, but in a “let’s just buy *everything*” kind of way. 

He’d casually suggest a new microphone, then a mixer, then a fancy compressor – each purchase completely unnecessary for my work as a freelance graphic designer. It wasn’t about control, not really. It was about a frustrating inability to articulate my preferences, a feeling he just didn't *get*. 

It highlighted something bigger, though: how easily miscommunication can creep into even the closest relationships.  We both wanted to show affection, to be thoughtful, but the constant stream of “just one more” created a wall of unspoken frustration.  It made me realize that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is gently, clearly state your needs – even if it means saying “no” to a shiny new gadget.
