It’s 2020, and I’m starting to wonder if I’m just wired for self-destruction. Every project I touch, every team I join—it’s like I’m a corrosive presence, inviting failure. I watch my efforts turn to ruin, and I can’t help but feel I’m the common thread in this string of misfortune. It’s a lonely realization, this belief that I’m the one who inevitably breaks what I try to build. Does anyone else ever feel like their own worst enemy?
