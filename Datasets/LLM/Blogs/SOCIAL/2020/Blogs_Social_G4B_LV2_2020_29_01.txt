**When Schools Just Don’t Get It**

Remember 2020? It felt like *everything* was shifting, and grief was a constant shadow. My mom passed away unexpectedly, and navigating that loss was already incredibly hard. Then, I turned to our school system for support – a place that *should* be a safe haven. Instead, I mostly got polite, distant emails and a frustrating lack of understanding. 

It wasn’t about grand gestures, just a little acknowledgment that a family was hurting. It highlighted how crucial it is for schools to truly support students through personal loss, and how profoundly it impacts family relationships.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest support comes from simply *seeing* someone’s pain.
