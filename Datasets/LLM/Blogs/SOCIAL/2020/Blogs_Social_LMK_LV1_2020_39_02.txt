"The Ghost Who Came Back: A Month of Silence and a Dubious Reconciliation"

I'll be the first to admit, I was not prepared for the radio silence that followed our last text exchange in March 2020. My boyfriend just... vanished. No explanation, no warning, just a sudden and complete cutoff. I was left wondering if I'd done something wrong, or if he'd simply lost interest. A month went by, and I'd all but given up hope of hearing from him again. But then, out of the blue, he reappeared. The reason? He claimed to have been a victim of online bullying and needed time to "recharge." I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. Was I supposed to be understanding? Sympathetic? The truth is, I was hurt and confused. He'd blocked me on social media, only to come back and expect everything to be okay. I'm left questioning our status - are we okay? Or are we just pretending to be?
