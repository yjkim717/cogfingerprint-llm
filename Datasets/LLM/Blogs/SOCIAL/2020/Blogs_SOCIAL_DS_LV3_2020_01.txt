### The Silence Was the Loudest Sound

It’s strange, the things you remember about the year the world stood still. For many, 2020 was defined by the blare of news alerts and the palpable fear in grocery store aisles. But for me, locked in my apartment, the defining sound was silence. And in that silence, the old, familiar voices of **guilt** and **despair** found a perfect echo chamber.

Before the lockdowns, I could outrun them. A coffee with a friend, the hum of a busy office, the simple act of people-watching in a park—these were my shields. But when the world retreated indoors, I was left alone with the one person I was trying to escape: myself.

The **emptiness** wasn't just about a vacant social calendar; it was an internal void. I’d stare at my reflection, and the narrative was always the same: *You are not enough. You are a burden. This pain is all you deserve.* The isolation didn’t create these feelings, but it handed them a megaphone. The internal battle I’d been fighting quietly for years was now the only show in town, playing on a relentless loop.

I wish I could say I reached out. I didn’t. Shame built a higher wall than any government mandate. How could I complain about my **mental health** when people were losing their lives, their jobs, their loved ones? My pain felt indulgent, illegitimate. So, I did the only thing that made the screaming in my head stop for a few, fleeting moments. The sharp sting, the welling red—it was a feeling, any feeling, to combat the terrifying numbness. It was a terrible, secret solution to a problem I couldn’t name aloud.

The turning point wasn’t dramatic. It was a pixelated video call. A friend, just checking in, said, “You look tired.” Not judgmental, just… kind. And in that simple act of being *seen*, the dam broke. I didn’t confess everything, but I whispered, “I’m not okay.”

Sharing that fractured truth didn’t fix me. Therapy isn’t a magic wand, and healing isn’t linear. But it introduced a new, quieter voice to the chorus—one of compassion. I’m learning that my pain is not a competition. It’s valid.

In a year defined by social distance, my journey back began with one small, socially-connected truth: I am not alone in this. And if you’re reading this, feeling that same profound isolation, neither are you. Your pain is real, and help, however hard it is to ask for, is real, too.
