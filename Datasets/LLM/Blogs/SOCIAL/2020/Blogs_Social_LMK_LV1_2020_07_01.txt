"I'll be the first to admit, I used to cringe at the sound of my own voice. But after months of working from home in 2020, I'd grown accustomed to hearing myself on voice recordings. To my surprise, I started to enjoy it. I'd catch myself replaying messages, not just to ensure I'd conveyed my point, but to appreciate the tone and cadence. It sparked a pang of self-doubt - was I being vain? As I navigated the isolation of lockdown, I realized that self-acceptance was key. Embracing my own voice was a small step towards embracing myself."
