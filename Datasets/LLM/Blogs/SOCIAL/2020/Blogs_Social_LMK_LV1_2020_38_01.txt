As I prep for our 2020 Eberron campaign, I'm stuck on Temple of the Mad Dragon Priestess. Our dragonborn cleric's zeal for Tiamat is intriguing, but the priestess's motives are murky. Is she a delusional zealot or a calculated villain? I'm seeking fellow D&D enthusiasts' insights on how to navigate her head trauma-driven backstory. How can I balance her twisted goals with the players' agency, creating a compelling narrative that explores the blurred lines between devotion and madness?
