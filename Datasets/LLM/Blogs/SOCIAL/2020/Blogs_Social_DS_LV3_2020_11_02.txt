That fender-bender last month rattled me more than my old sedan. The insurance check felt like a weird second chance. Staring at another car loan in 2020 just felt... wrong. So, I'm considering a radical shift: an e-bike for my 18-mile commute. It's a budget-friendly, eco-conscious choice that promises fresh air instead of road rage. Now, I'm hunting for a reliable model under $2k. Has anyone else made the switch? I'd love to hear your stories.
