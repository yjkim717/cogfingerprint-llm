I still remember the heat rushing to my cheeks in 2020, standing in the middle-school hallway as a teacher pulled me aside. My crime? A strap on my tank top was deemed "too distracting." Meanwhile, my male classmates roamed freely in similar attire.

This wasn't an isolated incident. It was part of a pattern where dress codes often felt less about modesty and more about policing young women's bodies. The underlying message was clear: my education was secondary to how my appearance might affect others.

These policies, framed as neutral, were steeped in gender bias, quietly teaching us that our bodies were problems to be solved. It’s a form of subtle body shaming that sticks with you, making you question your own comfort and autonomy long after you’ve left the school doors behind.
