## The Tilt is Real: Ranked and the Rising Tide of… Everything

Ugh, 2020. The year everything felt a little off, and League of Legends ranked was no exception. I swear, it felt like every other game was a descent into chaos. It wasn't just the usual losses; it was the *way* we were losing. 

Suddenly, you'd have someone picking Yuumi jungle. Seriously. And then feeding. Like, spectacularly. It wasn’t malicious, I don’t think. Just… completely clueless. It felt like a wave of new players, probably drawn in by the hype, just being thrown into the deep end of ranked with no life raft.

It got frustrating, I won’t lie. The constant explanations, the tilted teammates, the feeling of dragging a team of strangers through a minefield. I even muted chat more than usual. It made me wonder, is there a better way to onboard people into competitive play? Or are we destined to endure a constant cycle of frustration and… Yuumi jungle?  Anyone else experience this bizarre phenomenon in 2020? Let me know in the comments!
