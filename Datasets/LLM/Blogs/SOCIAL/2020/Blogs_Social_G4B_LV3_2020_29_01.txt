**When “Thinking of You” Just Doesn’t Cut It**

Remember 2020? It felt like a year of constant shifts, and alongside the pandemic, we were all grappling with grief. I found myself reaching out to people – acquaintances, colleagues – after a personal loss, hoping for a little support. And I got… platitudes. “Thinking of you.” “Let me know if you need anything.” 

It felt incredibly invalid, honestly. Like my pain was being neatly packaged and filed away.  The school system, even trying to offer condolences, often stumbled with the messy realities of family relationships – the unspoken tensions, the complicated dynamics. It highlighted how sometimes, genuine connection requires more than just a kind phrase. It demands presence, a willingness to just *be* with someone through the darkness.  It’s a reminder that empathy isn't a one-size-fits-all solution.
