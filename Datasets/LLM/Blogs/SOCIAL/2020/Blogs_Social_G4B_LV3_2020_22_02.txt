**The Invisible Weight**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily people assume something is “just a bad day” when you’re battling a migraine that’s been a constant companion for months. 2020 was… a lot. We were all trying to navigate lockdowns and uncertainty, and honestly, my chronic migraine felt like an extra, invisible weight. 

I’d describe the pain, try to explain the debilitating fatigue, but it often landed with a polite, pitying glance. “You just need to relax!” they’d say. Relax? When my head feels like it’s being crushed? It’s incredibly isolating to feel like your experience isn’t *real* to those around you. The frustration builds, a quiet, persistent ache that mirrors the pain itself.  It’s a lonely battle, and one I wish people understood a little more deeply.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps add a specific anecdote or focus on a particular aspect of the experience?
