"In 2020, I was left speechless when a student marked assignments 'done' on Google Classroom without submitting the actual work. It was a frustrating attempt to deceive, and I couldn't help but wonder what drove this behavior. As I reflected on the incident, I realized that it was a symptom of a larger issue - the blurred lines between academic integrity and the ease of online assignments. It was a wake-up call to revisit my teaching practices and ensure students understood the value of genuine effort."
