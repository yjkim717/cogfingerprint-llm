It’s 2020, and I’m stuck at home, scrolling through endless debates: Intel or AMD for my first gaming PC build? My desk is littered with component boxes, and I can’t help but laugh. Here I am, trying to choose a processor while the world feels like it’s on pause. But in this quiet space, I realize it’s not just about specs or speed—it’s about connection. Building this rig has become my link to friends in multiplayer battles and my escape during late-night study sessions. Funny how a little machine can anchor you when everything else is floating away.
