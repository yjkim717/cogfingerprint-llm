## Mother's Day in the Time of Quiet

Remember 2020? The year the world seemed to pause? Mother’s Day felt different then, didn't it? Restaurants were shuttered, and the usual celebrations felt… impossible. I saw a post on Reddit the other day, someone grappling with how to honor their mom while navigating isolation. It struck a chord. It wasn't about lavish gifts, but finding those small, heartfelt ways to connect, even from afar. A reminder that love finds a way.
