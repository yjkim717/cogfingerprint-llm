**Lost in the Fortress – and Finding My Focus**

Okay, let’s be real. 2020 was… a lot. Zoom calls replaced coffee dates, and the idea of “hanging out” felt like a distant, slightly terrifying memory. I spent a lot of time feeling utterly adrift, bouncing between online communities, trying to find a connection that actually *felt* real. 

It reminded me a little of playing those massive Fortress raids in *Harry Potter: Wizards Unite*. You know, those epic, chaotic battles where you’re suddenly swamped with teammates, everyone shouting instructions, and the whole thing feels like a frantic, beautiful mess? 

At first, I was just flailing. I’d try to take charge, barking orders, but it just ended up creating more confusion. I realized I needed to shift my approach.  It wasn't about *my* strategy; it was about understanding how everyone else was playing, how we could work *together* to maximize our success.  That’s when things started to click.

It was the same with the online spaces I was dipping into. I’d get frustrated when people didn’t respond immediately, or when conversations went off-topic. But I started to think about how I could contribute, not just *demand* attention.  Simple things, like offering a helpful tip or just acknowledging someone’s post – it made a difference. 

Learning to manage that focus, to understand the team dynamic, was key. Just like in the Fortress, sometimes the best thing you can do is let go of the need to control everything and trust that everyone is doing their part. 

Has anyone else felt this way lately?  Let’s talk about finding our footing in this strange, connected world.
