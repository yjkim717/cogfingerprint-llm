>## When the School Bells Don't Understand

It's 2020, and honestly, the world feels heavy enough already. We're all navigating so much uncertainty. But what happens when personal tragedy strikes on top of it all? I recently saw a post online that really resonated with me – a parent frustrated with how their child’s school handled a family loss. 

It got me thinking. Schools are supposed to be safe spaces, places of support. Yet, so often, the response feels…generic. The well-meaning but ultimately hollow platitudes, the pressure to "just be normal" – it’s just not what a grieving student needs. 

Grief isn't a box you tick off. It’s a messy, complicated process that impacts family relationships in ways that are unique to each situation. Maybe we, as a society, need to be better at recognizing that and offering genuine empathy, not just empty words. Let's start with our schools.
