## The Weight of Worlds (and Tumblr Threads)

Remember that flurry of excitement a few weeks back about a potential Tortall TV show? I dove deep into a Tumblr thread dissecting it, and honestly, the more I read, the more anxious I felt. It’s thrilling to imagine Alinor and Neverya on screen, but so many details – the sheer scope of Tortall, the complex politics – felt ripe for simplification, or worse, butchering. It's a reminder that adaptation is *hard*, and fan love can be a double-edged sword. Let's just hope any studio is listening closely.
