As I sat with my grandpa in 2020, he revealed his plans for assisted death, and I felt a tidal wave of emotions. I was torn between respecting his autonomy and grappling with the impending loss. The days that followed were a blur of grief, as I struggled to process the thought of living without him. I turned to loved ones, journaling, and quiet reflection to cope. It's been a journey of self-discovery, teaching me that grief is a messy, non-linear path, and that it's okay to not have all the answers.
