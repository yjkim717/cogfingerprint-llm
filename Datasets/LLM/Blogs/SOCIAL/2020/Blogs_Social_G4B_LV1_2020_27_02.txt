**Miles and Memories: Seeing My Friend’s World**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a single conversation can completely shift your perspective? Last year, I was seriously considering a CDL – always drawn to the idea of being a trucker, hauling steel. Then I started spending time with Mark, a friend who spends his days as a package handler, but also does some residential deliveries. 

He described the quiet routes, the small towns, the feeling of actually *helping* people get their essentials. It’s a world away from the long highway stretches I pictured. Suddenly, the “big rig” dream felt…complicated. It made me realize that fulfillment isn’t always about the destination, but the people you’re serving.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different variation?
