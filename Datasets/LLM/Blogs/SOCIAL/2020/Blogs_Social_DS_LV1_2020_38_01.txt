That first lockdown spring in 2020, our D&D group was my only social lifeline. We were playing through a module I’d tweaked, featuring a dragonborn cleric with severe head trauma who was convinced a confused baby black dragon was the avatar of Tiamat.

It was absurd, hilarious fun. But later, I realized why the story resonated so deeply. We were all living in a world saturated with conflicting information, struggling to separate truth from fear. My poor cleric wasn't just delusional; he was desperately trying to make sense of a reality that felt shattered, latching onto a grand narrative to explain the chaos. In a strange way, his quest for divine meaning in a baby dragon’s screech mirrored our own collective search for clarity in a year that offered very little.
