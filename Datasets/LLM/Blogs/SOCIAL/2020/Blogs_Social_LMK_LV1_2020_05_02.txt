Nostalgia alert! As I was watching my friends play Rocket League in 2020, I was suddenly transported back to my childhood. I vividly remembered a retro game from around '96 that had a similar blend of high-octane action and vehicular mayhem. The twist? Players were connected by tethers, adding a thrilling mechanic to the mix. It was like a mashup of Diablo's intense combat and Star Wars' space battles, but on the ground and with cars. I've been scouring the internet, trying to uncover the identity of this forgotten gem. Has anyone else out there got a clue about what game has been stuck in my head for decades?
