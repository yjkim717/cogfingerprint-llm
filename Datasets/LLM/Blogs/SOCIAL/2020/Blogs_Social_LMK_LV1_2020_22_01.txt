"A Year of Unwavering Support: How Civilians Stepped Up for Nurses During COVID-19"

As I reflect on 2020, I'm reminded of the outpouring of love and support from our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a nurse, I was touched by the countless messages from non-medical civilians asking how they could help. While homemade masks and thank-you notes were appreciated, we yearned for more tangible ways to alleviate our workload. People asked: "What can we do beyond showing gratitude?" Their willingness to help was palpable. Some offered to help with errands, grocery shopping, or even dog-walking for nurses working long hours. Others provided meals, childcare, or emotional support. The personal protective equipment (PPE) shortage was a pressing concern, and some even organized donations or fundraised to supply our facilities. These acts of kindness not only eased our burden but also reminded us that we weren't alone. The pandemic may have isolated us, but it also galvanized our communities to support us in meaningful ways.
