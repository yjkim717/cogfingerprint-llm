"Lockdown League: A Toxic Haven? 

The 2020 lockdown saw a surge in online gaming, but for me, it was a mixed bag. As I dove back into ranked League of Legends, I was hit with a wave of toxic teammates and opponents. Trolling became rampant, and it was like a never-ending nightmare. Casual players were getting harassed, and it was disheartening to see the community devolve. I couldn't help but wonder: had the isolation of lockdown brought out the worst in us? I started to question whether competitive gaming was still fun."
