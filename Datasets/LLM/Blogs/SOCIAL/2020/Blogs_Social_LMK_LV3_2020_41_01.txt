"Shipping" K-pop idols - a guilty pleasure or harmless fun? As I scrolled through Reddit in 2020, I stumbled upon a humorous post fantasizing about a Kang Daniel and Park Jihyo collaboration. The K-pop fandom's enthusiasm was palpable, and I couldn't help but chuckle. Shipping can bring fans together, sparking creativity and a sense of community. But it's also a reflection of our own desires and emotional connections. As I pondered the "what ifs," I realized that shipping idols is more than just fan fiction - it's a way to connect with others and explore our own imaginations.
