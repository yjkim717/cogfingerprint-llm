## Where Did All the Boston Tech Dreams Go?

Remember back in 2020, everyone was talking about Boston? Incredible universities churning out brilliant minds in computer science – it felt like the next Silicon Valley was brewing right here. Yet, looking around now, the Bay Area still reigns supreme when it comes to launching *actual* tech businesses. 

It’s a question that’s been bouncing around my head (and apparently Reddit too!). We have the talent, the drive, the research… so what’s the missing ingredient? Is it risk tolerance? Access to capital? Maybe the Boston mindset is more geared towards innovation *within* established companies, rather than striking out on your own? 

It’s a fascinating puzzle, and one I think deserves a closer look. Anyone else pondering this shift?
