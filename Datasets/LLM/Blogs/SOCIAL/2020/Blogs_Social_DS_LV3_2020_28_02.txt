It was March 2020, and my old laptop just couldn’t keep up with the sudden shift to remote life. I decided to build my first PC—a project born from lockdown boredom. The big question: Intel or AMD? I spent hours scrolling through forums, weighing performance for gaming after a long day of Zoom classes. It felt like more than just picking parts; it was about building something reliable for an unpredictable future. That tower became my anchor, a personal project that saw me through a lonely semester. In the end, it wasn't just about specs, but crafting a companion for a new, isolated world.
