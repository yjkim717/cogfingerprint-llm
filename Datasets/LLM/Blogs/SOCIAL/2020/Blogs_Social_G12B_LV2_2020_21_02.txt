>Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the user's prompt, aiming for a conversational, reflective, and relatable style, set in a 2020 context. I've focused on the feeling of confusion and the gradual "aha" moment, mirroring the student's experience but translating it to a social media context.  I've included a couple of options to give you a little variety.  **Please read the notes at the end of *both* options after the drafts, as they explain the choices I made and offer suggestions for further refinement.**

**Option 1: The Algorithm and My Feed**

Okay, so I've been feeling… weird about my Instagram feed lately. Like, *really* weird. Remember back in 2018, 2019, when it felt… more organic? Now, it’s just a curated highlight reel, a constant stream of perfectly styled vacations and flawless avocado toast. I started to wonder, is this *really* what everyone’s doing? Are they *actually* that happy?

Then it hit me, kind of like a sudden electrical realization. My feed isn’t showing me the *instantaneous* reality. It's the RMS – the Root Mean Square – version. It's smoothing out all the messy, the mundane, the stressful bits to give me an average, a seemingly consistent, and frankly, idealized picture. 

It’s not a lie, exactly, but it’s definitely not the whole truth.  It’s the algorithm, doing its thing. And I realized I needed to remember that.  Everyone’s presenting their “RMS” self online. Makes you think, doesn’t it?

**Option 2: Behind the Filter**

I spent a good chunk of last week feeling… inadequate. Scrolling through TikTok, seeing everyone seemingly mastering sourdough baking or learning a new language, I felt like I was failing at quarantine. Seriously, my biggest accomplishment was successfully watering a succulent.

Then, a friend shared something that clicked. She said, “We’re only showing the highlight reel. It’s the ‘RMS’ of our lives.” Meaning, we’re presenting the average, the smoothed-out version, not the chaotic, frustrating reality behind the scenes.

It was such a simple analogy, but it was freeing. Suddenly, my slightly chaotic apartment and my lack of viral dance moves felt… okay. Because everyone else is filtering too. We all are. It's a reminder to be kinder to ourselves and to remember that social media rarely shows the full picture. 2020 is *weird* for everyone.

**Notes & Explanation of Choices (Crucial to Read!)**

*   **Analogies are Key:** The core of the prompt was about RMS vs. instantaneous voltage. Directly explaining voltage concepts in a social media blog would be confusing and alienating. The key was to *translate* the feeling of confusion and the difference in measurement to a relatable social media experience. The RMS analogy works because it suggests an averaging, a smoothing-out, and a potential for misrepresentation.
*   **2020 Context:**  I leaned into the 2020 pandemic/quarantine experience because it was a period of heightened social media usage and also widespread feelings of isolation and comparison. It grounds
