As I scrolled through my social media feed in 2020, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disconnection. The COVID-19 pandemic had brought the world to a standstill, yet online platforms were buzzing with activity. People were sharing their experiences, supporting one another, and finding creative ways to stay connected. I realized that social media wasn't just a tool for socializing, but a lifeline for many during this isolating time. It allowed us to share our struggles, celebrate our triumphs, and feel a sense of community. As I reflected on my own online interactions, I began to appreciate the beauty of digital connection and the resilience of the human spirit. In a year marked by physical distancing, social media brought us closer together in ways I never thought possible.
