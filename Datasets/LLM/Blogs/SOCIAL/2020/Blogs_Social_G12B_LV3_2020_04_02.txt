## The Echo in the Empty Room

2020. The year the world collectively held its breath. The year “social distancing” became the norm, and suddenly, so many of us found ourselves staring at the walls of our own isolation. It wasn't just a physical separation; it felt like a severing of something deeper, a quiet unraveling of connection. 

I remember those early days, the initial fear quickly morphing into a strange, unsettling quiet. A quiet that wasn’t peaceful, but heavy. It felt like being trapped in a room with only my own thoughts for company – and those thoughts weren't exactly friendly. 

There’s a particular kind of hell, I think, that isn't fire and brimstone. It's the slow, creeping realization that you’re utterly alone, even when surrounded by screens and notifications. It’s the inescapable echo of your own anxieties bouncing back at you, amplified by the silence. 

It's the kind of place where you can't escape the things you don't want to see. The things you’ve been pushing down, the insecurities that whisper in the dark, the lingering marks – both visible and invisible – of battles fought and lost. Suddenly, everything feels laid bare, exposed under a harsh, unflinching light.

And then there's the numbness. That chilling blanket that descends when the feelings become too much to bear. It’s a defense mechanism, I suppose, a way to shut down the constant barrage of worry and sadness. But it’s also a prison. Trapped behind that wall of detachment, it's hard to reach out, hard to connect, hard to *feel* anything at all. 

I know I’m not alone in this. Many of us navigated – and are still navigating – similar landscapes throughout this year. The pandemic stripped away the distractions, the constant activity, leaving us face-to-face with ourselves. And sometimes, what we found wasn't pretty.

But maybe, just maybe, that’s okay. Maybe acknowledging that desolate space, that echo in the empty room, is the first step towards finding a way out. Maybe it’s the beginning of healing, of rebuilding connection, and of learning to be kinder to the person staring back at us in the mirror.
