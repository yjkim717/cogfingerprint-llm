### The Silence Was the Loudest Sound

It’s strange, the things you remember about the year the world stood still. For me, 2020 wasn’t defined by the constant news alerts or the sourdough starters. It was defined by a profound, deafening silence. The kind that settles in a room when you’re utterly alone, and then, more terrifyingly, when you realize that same silence has taken root inside you.

I’d wake up, the sun straining through my apartment blinds, and feel… nothing. A flatline. The world was in chaos, but my internal landscape was a sterile, empty room. The emotional pain I’d been running from for years by staying busy, by being “social,” finally caught up. And in that quiet, it didn’t scream; it whispered. It whispered that I was the problem. That the emptiness was my own fault. A deep, resonant self-hatred became my most constant companion.

I never picked up a blade, but I learned that self-harm wears many disguises. For me, it was the sharp, internal lash of my own thoughts. It was the relentless criticism for not being more “productive” during a pandemic. It was denying myself a moment of peace, a good meal, a break, because I felt I didn’t deserve it. I was carving myself up from the inside out, piece by piece, with the weapon of my own mind.

My depression wasn’t a dramatic, weeping thing. It was the heavy blanket I dragged around from room to room. It was the Herculean effort required to send a simple text back to a friend asking, “How are you holding up?” I was holding up by slowly disintegrating, and the thought of admitting that felt like another failure.

The turning point, as it often is, was a tiny, almost insignificant crack in the wall I’d built. A friend, in a Zoom call, wasn’t her usual bubbly self. On a whim, I typed in the chat: “Me too. This is really hard.”

Her relief was palpable. “God, yes. It’s so hard.”

That small, shared moment of honesty did what weeks of solitude could not. It let a sliver of light into my empty room. I realized my silence wasn’t protecting me or anyone else; it was isolating me in a shared experience of pain. My struggle with mental health wasn’t a solitary, shameful battle. It was a human one, amplified by a year of unprecedented pressure.

I’m not “cured.” Some days the silence still feels loud. But now I know its name. And now, I know the most powerful, rebellious act against it is to whisper back, “Me too.” Because in a world that felt so disconnected, the most social thing I could do was finally be honest about being broken.
