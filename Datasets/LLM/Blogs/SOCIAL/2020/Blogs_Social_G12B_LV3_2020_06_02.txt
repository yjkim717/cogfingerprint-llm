## The Weight of "Always"

It's 2020, and honestly, the collective anxiety feels palpable. Lately, I've been wrestling with something familiar, yet heavier than usual: the relentless cycle of self-doubt. It’s that nagging feeling that *I* somehow contribute to the negative things happening around me. A friend’s struggling? It’s my fault. A project flops? Clearly, I messed up.

It’s a destructive pattern, fueled by anxiety and those insidious negative thoughts. Reading a post on Reddit the other day, someone articulated this feeling so perfectly – the belief that you're a catalyst for misfortune. It’s isolating, and frankly, exhausting. Recognizing it is the first step, I think. Letting go of the “always” and remembering that life, and its challenges, are rarely solely our responsibility.
