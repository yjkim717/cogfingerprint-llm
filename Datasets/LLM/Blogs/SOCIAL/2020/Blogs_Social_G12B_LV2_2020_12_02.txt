>## The Grind is Real (and Sometimes Really Frustrating)

Okay, let's be honest. 2020 has been… a lot. And my League of Legends ranked experience has been mirroring that feeling pretty closely. I'm not even mad, just… consistently bewildered.

I’ve always enjoyed the climb. That tense feeling before a game, the strategic planning, the rush of a well-executed team fight. But lately, it’s been feeling less like a climb and more like wading through molasses while someone throws rocks at you. 

We're talking *serious* trolling. People intentionally feeding the enemy team, refusing to cooperate, just generally making the game a miserable experience. And it’s not just the obvious trolls, it's the sheer volume of players who seem completely new to the game, making fundamental mistakes that cost us the match. 

It’s tempting to rage, to flame, to just uninstall. But then I remember why I play: the moments of genuine teamwork, the satisfying victories earned through grit and strategy. It’s a tough balance. Maybe 2020 just taught me to appreciate the good games *that much* more. Anyone else feeling this in their online gaming lately?
