**The Echo Chamber of “Should”**

Remember 2020? It felt like a pressure cooker, didn’t it? Between the pandemic and everything else, social media felt… amplified. Like everyone was shouting their opinions, their “perfect” lives, and, let’s be honest, a *lot* of unsolicited advice. 

I found myself constantly battling this feeling – this nagging sense that I wasn't measuring up. It started with little things: a comment about my outfit, a suggestion on how I should be spending my time, a quick judgment on my personality. Before I knew it, it was a relentless stream of criticism, especially about how I presented myself. 

It chipped away at my self-esteem, you know? Like tiny little pebbles against a stone. I desperately needed validation, but the more I sought it online, the further I felt from feeling secure in my own skin.  I realized I was trying to build my identity based on what *others* thought, instead of what *I* felt. 

Setting boundaries became crucial. Unfollowing accounts that made me feel inadequate, muting comments that weren’t constructive – it felt radical at first, but incredibly liberating. It wasn't about ignoring the world; it was about protecting my inner space and remembering that my worth isn’t determined by a like or a fleeting opinion.  It’s a practice I still carry with me today.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way – perhaps focus on a specific aspect, adjust the tone, or aim for a slightly different word count?
