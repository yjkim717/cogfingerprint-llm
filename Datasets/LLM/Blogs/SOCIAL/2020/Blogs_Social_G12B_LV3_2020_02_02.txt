## Throwaway Accounts & VR: Are We Really Losing Our Games?

Okay, so I saw this post on Reddit the other day that really got me thinking. Apparently, there’s a rumor swirling around that Facebook might lock people out of VR games they bought using… well, throwaway accounts. Seriously? 

It feels a little dystopian, doesn’t it? We all used those burner accounts for different things back in 2020, and the thought of losing access to something you paid for just feels wrong. Hopefully, it's just fear-mongering, but it’s a good reminder to be mindful of where we’re spending our digital dollars.
