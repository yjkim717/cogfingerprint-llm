It’s 2020, and everywhere I look, people are searching for financial stability in uncertain times. That’s when I stumbled upon Ray Poteet’s story—a man who turned life insurance into a living financial tool. He didn’t just see policies as safety nets; he used infinite banking strategies, borrowing against them to build wealth while still securing a death benefit for his wife.

It made me reflect: what if we could reshape how we view money? Instead of letting savings sit idle, what if they worked for us, creating opportunities now and leaving a legacy later? It’s not just about numbers—it’s about crafting a future where our choices today echo for generations.
