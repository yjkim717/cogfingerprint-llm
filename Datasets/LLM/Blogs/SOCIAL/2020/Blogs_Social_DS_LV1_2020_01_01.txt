### The Great Wall of Unranked: Finding Community in Rocket League's Chaos

Remember 2020? The world felt like it was on pause, but my little corner of it was a blur of rocket-powered cars and aerial goals. Rocket League going free-to-play was the highlight of my locked-down autumn. But that excitement quickly met a new, frustrating reality: the Smurfening.

It became a nightly ritual. I’d queue for a competitive match, heart pounding with the hope of finally climbing out of Platinum. The countdown ends, and there it is—the dreaded “Unranked” tag on the other team. What followed was never a match; it was a spectacle. A player who clearly lived and breathed the game would dance around my teammates and me, pulling off moves I’d only seen in highlight reels.

At first, it was infuriating. I’d yell at my monitor, “What’s the point? The ranking system is broken!” The matchmaking felt opaque, like a black box arbitrarily deciding my fate. I wasn’t just losing MMR; I was losing the joy of a fair fight.

But then, something shifted. After one particularly brutal loss, instead of quitting, I typed, “Okay, that was insane. How did you do that?”

To my surprise, the “smurf” responded. “No problem, wanna hop in a private match? I can show you the setup.”

That one interaction changed everything. We spent an hour just practicing. He wasn’t a malicious troll; he was just a skilled player starting a new account, and he was bored of crushing people. In the chaos of a broken-seeming system, I found a teacher. It made me realize that behind every “Unranked” tag is still just a person. In a year where we were all isolated, sometimes the most unexpected connections—even with your digital nemesis—are the ones that keep you going, and learning.
