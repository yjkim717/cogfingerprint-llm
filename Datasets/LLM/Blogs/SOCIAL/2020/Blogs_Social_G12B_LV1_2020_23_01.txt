## The Waiting Game (and a Little Surprise)

It’s 2020, and honestly, everything feels like a waiting game, right? For things to go back to normal, for the world to feel stable… and for *changes*. I started testosterone about six months ago, and the biggest question swirling around in my head (and in a lot of online FTM forums) is: when will I *see* something?

Early on, I was obsessively checking, comparing, you know? Then I remembered a silly, early moment – a couple months in, feeling… different. It was subtle, but I definitely noticed a change. It’s easy to get caught up in timelines and expectations, but sometimes the shifts are quieter than you think. It's a journey, and honestly, a little bit of patience (and self-compassion!) goes a long way.
