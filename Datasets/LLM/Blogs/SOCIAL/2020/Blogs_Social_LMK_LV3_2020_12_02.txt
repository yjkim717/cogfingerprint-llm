"Lockdown gaming took a toll on League of Legends' ranked play in 2020. As more new players jumped in, I found myself facing off against inexperienced teammates and toxic opponents. Trolls and feeders ran rampant, but the punishments didn't seem to stick. The frustration was palpable. I couldn't help but wonder, had the community become too accepting of bad behavior? The 2020 season left a sour taste, a reminder that even in a virtual world, sportsmanship matters."
