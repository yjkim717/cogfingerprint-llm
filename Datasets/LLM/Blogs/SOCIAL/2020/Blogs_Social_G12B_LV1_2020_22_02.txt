>## The Invisible Load

It's 2020, and we’re all collectively exhausted. But some of us are exhausted in a way that's… invisible. I’m talking about the kind of exhaustion that comes with chronic migraines. 

You see me out, maybe grabbing coffee, or even managing to navigate a grocery store trip. And people – well-meaning people – will say, "Oh, you look so much better!" Or, "It's great to see you out and about!" 

And I smile, I nod, I thank them. Because what else *can* I say? Explaining the three hours of agonizing pain I endured to get to that coffee shop, the carefully orchestrated schedule of medication and rest that allows me to leave the house at all? It feels… futile.

The isolation is a heavy thing. Not just the physical isolation of retreating to a dark room when the pain hits, but the social isolation of feeling perpetually misunderstood. It’s a constant performance, a tightrope walk between appearing “okay” and screaming for someone to *see* the load I’m carrying.

This year, more than ever, I think we need to be better at recognizing that appearances can be deceiving. There’s a lot happening beneath the surface.
