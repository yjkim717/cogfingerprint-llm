Looking back on 2020, I keep thinking about that quiet scene in *Avatar: The Last Airbender* where Hakoda finally connects with Sokka. In a year of distance, it reminded me how much we all craved those small, meaningful moments with family. It wasnâ€™t about grand gestures, but just being seen and understood. Funny how a cartoon moment can hit so close to home.
