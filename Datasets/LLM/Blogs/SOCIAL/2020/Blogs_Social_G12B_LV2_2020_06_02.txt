Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a relatable and reflective tone, set in a 2020 context. I've included a title suggestion too.

**Title: The Scroll and the Shadow: When Social Feels…Off**

Remember early 2020? The world felt shaky, and honestly, so did I. I found myself spending *hours* scrolling, seeing everyone seemingly thrive – new hobbies, perfect sourdough, thriving relationships. And the more I scrolled, the more this nagging feeling grew. Like I was subtly, consistently, messing things up. Not in huge, dramatic ways, but a quiet erosion of potential.

It’s a weird feeling, this sense of self-sabotage. Like a corrosive touch on everything I tried. Maybe it was the isolation, maybe it was the general anxiety, but I felt like I was unintentionally creating distance, dampening enthusiasm. Anyone else feel like social media amplified those little insecurities, turning them into something bigger? It’s a work in progress, learning to navigate it all.

**Notes on this draft:**

*   **2020 Context:** I explicitly mentioned the early 2020 timeframe to ground the piece in that specific period of global uncertainty.
*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Remember early 2020?", "Anyone else feel…?", and a more informal sentence structure.
*   **Relatability:** The focus is on a common experience (feeling inadequate compared to online portrayals) rather than a dramatic story.
*   **Reflective:** It ends with a sense of ongoing work and acknowledges the complexity of the issue.
*   **Keywords Integrated:** The core concepts from your keywords (self-sabotage, negative impact, failure, destructive patterns, corrosive touch) are woven into the narrative without sounding forced.



I hope this draft meets your needs! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or further refinements.
