"Toxic Tendencies in Friendships: A Boundary Battle"

As I sat down to catch up with my friend over a video call in the midst of the 2020 lockdown, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration and hurt. We had been friends for years, but a recurring issue had been nagging me - her disregard for a boundary I'd set regarding my boyfriend. Every time we spoke, she'd pry and probe, asking intrusive questions that made me uncomfortable.

I'd explicitly told her that I wasn't ready to discuss certain aspects of my relationship, but she continued to push the envelope. I felt disrespected and unheard, like my boundaries were being constantly disregarded. It got to a point where I dreaded our conversations, feeling like I was walking on eggshells, never knowing when she'd cross the line again.

This experience made me realize that toxic tendencies aren't limited to romantic relationships. Friendships can be just as draining and damaging if not nurtured with care and respect. I'd been so caught up in maintaining the friendship that I'd neglected to prioritize my own emotional well-being.

It's taken me a while to acknowledge that I deserve better - a friend who respects my boundaries and doesn't push me to discuss things I'm not ready to share. I've come to understand that setting boundaries isn't about being controlling or closed-off; it's about being clear and direct about what I need to feel safe and valued in a friendship. I'm learning to be more assertive and communicate my needs more effectively, even if it means re-evaluating the dynamics of our friendship.
