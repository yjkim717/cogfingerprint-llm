It’s 2020, and I’m supposed to be afraid of the virus, but my real fear is older, deeper. Emetophobia—the dread of vomiting—has roots in a childhood medical trauma. It’s not just about getting sick; it’s about losing control over my own body in a world already spinning into chaos. While everyone stockpiled sanitizer, I was fighting silent battles with my own anxiety, terrified that one moment of physical weakness could unravel everything. Control feels like the only shield I have left.
