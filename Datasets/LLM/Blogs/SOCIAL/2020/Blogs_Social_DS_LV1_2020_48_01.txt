### The Boston Question

It’s the fall of 2020, and my inbox is a strange mix of existential dread and golden opportunities. On one hand, my company’s stock (those precious RSUs I’ve been counting on) is finally starting to vest. On the other, my Boston condo—my one solid, tangible asset—sits empty. My tenants moved out to be closer to family, and now it’s just me and this monthly mortgage payment, staring at each other from three hundred miles away.

When I bought the place, the plan was simple: climb the ladder, be present, build a life in the city. Now, the ladder has been replaced by a Zoom link, and the concept of “presence” has been completely rewritten. A recruiter from Austin just messaged me, and for the first time, I didn’t immediately dismiss it because of geography. Why not Austin? Or Denver? Or just… anywhere?

The logical part of me screams to sell. The housing market is wild; I could pocket a nice profit and be free of the landlord headaches. That cash could pad my savings, which feel suddenly fragile in this weird economy.

But selling feels like closing a door I’m not sure I’m ready to lock. That condo was my first big adult decision. Letting it go is admitting that the old rules—that you build your career and life in a specific, physical hub—might be permanently over. It’s not just a financial calculation; it’s a bet on what the future of "home" even means. Do I cash in, or hold on and hope the world figures itself out? I’m still weighing the scales.
