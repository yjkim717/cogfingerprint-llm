It’s 2020, and like so many of us, I’ve been spending more time online, diving into Rocket League tournaments. Just last week, my team was getting crushed. The score was ugly, and the temptation to just forfeit and move on was real. One teammate even voted to quit.

But we played it out. We lost, of course, but in those final minutes, something clicked. We pulled off one ridiculous, coordinated play that had us all laughing in the chat. We still lost the credits and rewards, but we gained a shared moment of resilience.

That’s the thing about forfeiting: it’s not just unprofessional; it’s a lost opportunity. Losing with dignity, playing until the final whistle—that’s where you sometimes find a different kind of win, a lesson in grit that no tournament credit can ever replace.
