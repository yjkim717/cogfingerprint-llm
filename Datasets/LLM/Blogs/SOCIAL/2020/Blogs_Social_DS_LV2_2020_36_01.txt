Of course. Here is a reflective blog post written from the perspective of a Harry Potter: Wizards Unite player in 2020.

### The Real Magic Wasn't in the Spells, But in the Silence

It was March 2020, and the world had shrunk to the four walls of my apartment. My only constants were the ping of news alerts and the eerie quiet from the street below. I felt untethered, a professor with no classroom, a friend with no hugs to give. In a desperate search for a distraction, I re-downloaded a game I’d barely touched: *Harry Potter: Wizards Unite*.

At first, it was just a way to pass the time. But then I discovered the Fortress battles.

As an Auror, my job was straightforward on paper: deal massive damage. But to do it right, I had to learn to be a team player. I’d join a chamber with a Magizoologist and a Professor—complete strangers from who-knows-where. We had no voice chat, no text boxes. Our entire conversation was a silent ballet of spells and timing.

I’d enter a battle and cast a Weakening Hex on a fierce Werewolf, not for me, but for the Magizoologist I knew was about to engage it. I’d hoard my Focus, that precious blue resource, not to empower myself, but to pass it to the Professor so they could cast a shield on our healer. A Bat-Bogey Hex here to shave off the last bit of an enemy’s health, a well-timed revive there for a fallen teammate.

In that pixelated fortress, we were building something fragile and beautiful: trust without words. Coordination without a plan. It was the polar opposite of the noisy, chaotic, and often divisive world of social media that was my other window to the outside. Online, everyone was shouting. In the fortress, we were listening. We were paying attention.

I’ll never forget the time I was in a tough battle, my health critical, facing a foe that would surely finish me. I braced for the knockout. But it never came. A second before the enemy struck, a green shield shimmered around me—the Professor, whom I’d never met, had been watching. They saw me, understood my predicament, and acted. They spent their hard-earned Focus to save me. In that moment, I didn’t feel like I was playing a game; I felt… seen.

In a year defined by isolation, those silent, five-minute collaborations were my most profound social interactions. They reminded me that connection isn’t always about grand gestures or long conversations. Sometimes, it’s in the small, selfless acts. It’s in the unspoken agreement that we’re in this together.

The real magic of 2020 wasn’t the *Confringo* or the *Bat-Bogey Hex*. It was found in the quiet focus of a team of strangers, silently having each other’s backs in a crumbling fortress, proving that even when we are utterly alone, we can still choose to fight side-by-side.
