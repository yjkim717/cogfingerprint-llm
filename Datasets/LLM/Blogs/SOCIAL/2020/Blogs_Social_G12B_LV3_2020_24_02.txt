## Could the Internet Actually Be Wise? A Wild Idea I've Been Mulling Over

Remember back in 2020, when we were all glued to our screens, trying to make sense of… well, *everything*?

Imagine a subreddit, a dedicated online community, pooling insights to predict things like market trends. It sounds a little sci-fi, I know. But the idea of harnessing that mass intelligence, filtering out the noise with clever algorithms… it’s genuinely intriguing. Maybe, just maybe, we can learn to tap into the collective brainpower of the internet for something more than just memes. It's a hopeful thought in a year that desperately needed them.
