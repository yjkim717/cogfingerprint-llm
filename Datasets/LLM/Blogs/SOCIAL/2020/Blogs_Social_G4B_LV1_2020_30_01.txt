**Remember When Things Were *Actually* Hard?**

Okay, I’ve been scrolling through old Reddit threads, and it hit me – I seriously miss the Wichita campaign. Remember those weekly havocs? They were brutal, right? Like, genuinely challenging. It felt like a real test of skill, and the top-tier rewards actually *felt* earned. 

2020 was already a weird year, and World of Tanks felt…easy.  I get the updates and the progression, but sometimes I crave that feeling of pushing myself, of having to really strategize and execute.  Anyone else feeling this way?  Let’s bring back the hardmode, WG!  Seriously.
