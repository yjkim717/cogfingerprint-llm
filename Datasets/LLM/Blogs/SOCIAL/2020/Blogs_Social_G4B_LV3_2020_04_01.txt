**The Echo in the Feed: Feeling Seen in a World of Noise**

Remember 2020? It felt… heavy. A constant hum of anxiety layered over everything – the pandemic, the uncertainty, the sheer *volume* of information. And honestly, a lot of that volume came from social media. Scrolling, liking, commenting… it became this almost compulsive habit, a desperate attempt to feel *something*, anything, in the face of it all. 

I found myself caught in a strange loop. Posting carefully curated snippets of my life – a walk in the park, a homemade meal, a funny meme – hoping for validation, for someone, *anyone*, to see that I was still here, still fighting. But the likes and the hearts felt… hollow. Like echoes bouncing back at me from a vast, indifferent space.

The keywords kept circling in my head: self-harm, depression, suicidal thoughts, anguish, despair. They weren't necessarily *present* in my life in a dramatic way, but they felt like a persistent undercurrent, amplified by the constant comparison and the pressure to project a perfect image online. It was a terrifying realization – that this carefully constructed digital facade was actually fueling a deeper sense of isolation.

I started noticing how easily we can get lost in the highlight reels of others, forgetting that everyone – even the people who seem to have it all figured out – is battling their own demons. The relentless pursuit of “likes” shifted my focus away from my own internal landscape, from the quiet moments of reflection and the small victories I was actually experiencing. 

It wasn’t a sudden epiphany, but a slow, painful understanding.  I began to mute notifications, to limit my time online, and to actively seek out connections that felt real, not performative.  It was about remembering that my worth wasn’t determined by the number of followers I had, or the reactions I received to a post. 

It's still a work in progress, of course. But learning to prioritize my own well-being, to find solace in the offline world, and to recognize the echo in the feed has been a crucial step in reclaiming my sense of self.  Has anyone else felt this way? Let’s talk about it.
