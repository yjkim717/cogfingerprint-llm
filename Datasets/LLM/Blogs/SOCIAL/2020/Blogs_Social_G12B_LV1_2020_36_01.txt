Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a conversational tone with a storytelling approach, and set within the 2020 context. I've tried to weave in the themes of teamwork, strategic thinking, and managing limited resources, echoing the "Wizards Unite" context while grounding it in a relatable social experience.

## The Great Zoom Fortress and the Art of Not Losing Your Mind (and Your Bandwidth)

Okay, let's be honest. 2020. Need I say more? We were all adrift in a sea of uncertainty, sourdough starters, and endless video calls. Remember the early days? The novelty of working from home wearing pajama bottoms? That faded *fast*.  And then came the desperate need for connection. Real, human connection, beyond the fleeting "thumbs up" reaction on Slack.

That’s when the “Great Zoom Fortress” was born in my friend group. It started innocently enough. A few of us, scattered across different states, decided to have a weekly virtual game night. We’d tried online board games, trivia apps, even a disastrous attempt at virtual escape rooms (seriously, don’t). Nothing quite scratched the itch of being *together*.

Then Liam, ever the creative one, had the idea. He envisioned a virtual fortress, built entirely within a single, sprawling Zoom call. Each of us would represent a “defender,” tasked with keeping the “attackers” (mostly just Sarah, who was ruthlessly competitive) at bay.

The rules were simple, but the strategy… that was where things got interesting. We had limited “resources” – basically, a rotating roster of quirky talents we assigned ourselves each week.  One week I’d be the “Focus Specialist,” responsible for keeping the call stable and muting the inevitable background noises (my dog, Barnaby, has a *passion* for barking at squirrels). Another week I’d be the “Hex Disrupter,” tasked with… well, distracting Sarah with ridiculous sound effects and strategically timed GIFs. My best was a looped video of a cat playing the piano. It bought us a solid three minutes.

It wasn’t about winning, not really. It was about the *process*. The frantic strategizing before each "attack wave." The frantic calls for backup when Sarah launched a particularly devastating barrage of memes. The sheer absurdity of arguing over the optimal placement of a virtual potted plant to block her line of sight.

It was a lot like that game, Wizards Unite, actually. You know, the one where Aurors fight dark wizards?  We’d talk about how managing your "Focus" was crucial – keeping the call stable, not letting Barnaby derail the whole operation. And those "hexes" we used? They were just creative ways to throw Sarah off her game, like the Bat Bogey Hex – a sudden burst of spooky sounds designed to momentarily break her concentration.

The thing is, the Zoom Fortress highlighted something profound about navigating 2020. It wasn’t just about surviving the isolation; it was about *collaborating* within it. We learned to rely on each other, to anticipate needs, and to leverage individual strengths to
