As I watched my Sims family grow and thrive in the world of Sims 4, I couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment when it came to inheritance. The game mechanics just didn't quite capture the complexity of real-life family legacies. When a Sims parent passes away, their estate is simply divided among their children - no consideration for sentimental value, family heirlooms, or long-term family goals. It's 2020, and I'm left wondering, where's the nuance? A more realistic inheritance system would add a whole new layer of depth to Sims 4 legacy play.
