"As I grind for that platinum trophy in 2020's hottest games, I often find myself stuck in a frustrating cycle. Online trophies, while fun for some, can be a source of stress for others. I've lost count of how many times I've replayed the same level or battled the same boss, only to be rewarded with a virtual badge. Perhaps it's time to create a separate category for online trophies? This way, trophy hunters like me can pursue them without feeling like we're ruining the experience for others. The gaming community deserves a more inclusive trophy system."
