### The Year the World Felt Like My Brain

It’s strange to say, but in 2020, when the world outside was collectively holding its breath, I felt a little less alone in my own chaos. My internal landscape had always been a place of storms—a quiet, desperate war waged behind a smile. But when the global lockdowns hit, it was like the outside world had finally caught up to the screaming silence inside my head.

Before, I could pretend. I’d paste on a smile for the office, make small talk in the coffee line, and use the noise of the world to drown out the hissing voice of self-hatred that lived in my mind. But in the isolation of my apartment, with only my thoughts for company, the performance became impossible. The emotional pain, usually a dull ache, became a sharp, constant presence. The world was falling apart, and it felt like a perfect mirror for what was happening inside me.

I remember one evening, scrolling through endless news cycles of case numbers and political strife, and feeling a perverse sense of kinship. *You see?* the voice in my head whispered. *Everything is broken. You fit right in.* The urge to self-harm, to make the internal pain something tangible I could see and address, was stronger than ever. The suicidal ideation wasn't a dramatic cry; it was a logical, chilling conclusion to the equation of my existence in a world that seemed to have ended.

But that same isolation that amplified my pain also became the catalyst for a fragile connection. A friend I hadn't spoken to in months sent a simple text: "This is all really hard. How are you, actually?" That "actually" broke me. It was an invitation to be real.

Tentatively, I started being more honest in my virtual interactions. I wasn't the only one barely holding it together. In group chats and video calls, we started admitting our fears, our bad days, our mental breakdowns. We were all, in our own ways, learning that it's okay to not be okay.

2020 was the year my private hell became a shared, global experience. It didn't magically cure my depression, but it stripped away the shame. It taught me that our deepest pains don't have to be borne in solitary confinement. Sometimes, salvation is just a quiet, honest conversation away.
