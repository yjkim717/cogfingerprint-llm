**Remembering Aang’s Pain: A 2020 Reflection**

It’s weird, but I was scrolling Reddit last year – 2020, remember? – and stumbled upon a thread dissecting *The Last Airbender*. People were really focused on the quiet, heartbreaking moments, specifically Hakoda and Sokka’s conversation about Aang’s grief. It made me think about how we all process trauma, even secondhand, and how those vulnerable scenes still resonate years later.  Isn’t it powerful when a show can tap into such deep emotions?
