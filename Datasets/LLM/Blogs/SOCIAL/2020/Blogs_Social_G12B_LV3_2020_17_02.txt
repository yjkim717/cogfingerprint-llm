## The Butterflies and the Botox: When Anxiety Gets Real

Okay, so here's a thing. I've been dealing with… let’s just say *digestive anxieties* for a while now. Specifically, this weird thing I call "noburp" – that trapped, uncomfortable feeling. It’s all tangled up with a deeper fear, emetophobia, which, if you don't know, is a fear of vomiting. It’s not glamorous, and it’s definitely not something you broadcast on Instagram.

But I'm considering Botox. Just a little something to soften some lines, you know? And the anxiety is *real*. I'm terrified of having a reaction, of feeling nauseous, of… well, you get it. I’ve been lurking in online forums, searching for anyone else who's dealt with this. Has anyone had Botox and experienced digestive upset afterward? It feels silly to worry, but my brain's going a mile a minute. Anyone out there relate? Seriously, send help (and maybe some calming tea!).
