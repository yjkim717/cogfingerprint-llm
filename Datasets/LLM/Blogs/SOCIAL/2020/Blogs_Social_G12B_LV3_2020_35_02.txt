## The Tightrope Walk of Friendship and Financial Dreams

It’s 2020, and everyone’s hustling in some way, right? Lately, I’ve been feeling a little… conflicted. A close friend has really thrown herself into Arbonne. I’m genuinely happy she’s pursuing something she’s passionate about, but I can't shake this nagging worry. She's a student, juggling classes and, increasingly, a whole MLM business. 

I’ve noticed the subtle shifts – the constant posts about inventory, the pressure to buy products, the late-night recruitment calls. And honestly, I’m concerned about the financial strain. It feels like she's sinking a lot of money into something with a very uncertain return.

The tricky part is wanting to be supportive without sounding judgmental or dismissive of her dreams. It’s a delicate balance. How do you express concern about someone's financial choices without damaging a friendship built on years of shared laughter and understanding? I'm still figuring it out, but I think open, honest conversation – approached with empathy – is the only way forward. It’s a tough lesson in navigating modern friendships and the pressures of the entrepreneurial spirit.
