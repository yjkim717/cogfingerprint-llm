>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and fitting the 2020 context. I've focused on the emotional impact of reading difficult content as a child, tying into the Reddit post's theme.  I've included a few options for titles at the end.

## The Books That Stuck With Us

Remember those required reading lists from elementary school? The ones your teacher swore would “broaden your horizons”? I do. And sometimes, those horizons weren't exactly…pleasant. I saw a post online recently from someone trying to identify a book they read as a kid – a book with a particularly disturbing scene involving an axe and a self-inflicted wound. It got me thinking.

As kids, we don't always have the language or the emotional tools to process the darkness we encounter in stories. I recall one book in particular– I won’t name it– that left me feeling genuinely unsettled for weeks. It wasn't the plot itself, but the sheer *weight* of it, the feeling of something heavy settling in my stomach. 

Looking back, I wonder what impact those early exposures to challenging themes had on us. Did they harden us? Or did they, in some strange way, help us develop empathy, to understand that life isn't always sunshine and rainbows? Maybe it’s both. It's certainly a reminder of the power – and potential responsibility – of the stories we share, especially with young minds.
