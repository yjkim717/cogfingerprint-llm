**The Shame of the Abandoned Goal**

Okay, real talk. Remember 2020? Everyone was stuck inside, glued to their screens, and Rocket League was *the* escape. I was deep in a tournament, grinding for a decent MMR, and feeling genuinely invested. Then, BAM – my teammate just… left. No message, just vanished. A forfeit. 

It stung, honestly. It wasn’t just about losing the game; it was about the disrespect. Like, seriously? Abandoning a team mid-match? It felt petty, fueled by ego more than frustration.  I remember thinking, “This is why people don't take esports seriously.” 

It made me realize something about online social dynamics – even in a virtual world, showing up and finishing what you started matters.  It’s a small thing, maybe, but it’s about integrity, right?  Anyone else have a similar experience?
