As I sat in front of my screen in 2020, frustration mounted - my CM Punk CAW textures refused to load in WWE DoR 2 on Dolphin Emulator. I joined online forums, scouring for solutions, only to find others struggling with the same issue. It struck me how a simple gaming glitch could unite strangers, sparking a sense of community in the virtual world. Little moments like these remind us that even in isolation, connection is just a click away.
