## Could the Internet Actually Be Smart? My Experiment with Collective Forecasting

It’s 2020. We’re all glued to our screens, bombarded with information, and frankly, a little overwhelmed. We’ve seen predictions go wildly wrong – the pandemic, the election… it’s made me wonder: are we *really* getting any smarter as a society, despite all this data?

Recently, I stumbled across this idea of “wisdom of the crowd.” The concept is simple: a large group of people, even if individually not experts, can often make surprisingly accurate predictions when their answers are averaged. It got me thinking… could we harness that power more effectively?

I started a tiny, informal group online, just a few friends, trying to predict things – daily stock fluctuations, the outcome of minor sporting events. It’s been fascinating watching how simple averaging performs.  We're even dabbling with a little machine learning to see if we can weight opinions based on past accuracy. It’s early days, but it’s a quirky experiment in collective intelligence, and honestly, it’s more fun than doomscrolling. Maybe, just maybe, there's something to this whole "crowd" thing after all.
