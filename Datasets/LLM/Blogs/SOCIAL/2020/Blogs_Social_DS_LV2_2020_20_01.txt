It’s 2020, and I’m stuck at home, scrolling through Chinese dramas I can’t fully understand. My Mandarin feels like a ghost—something I know is part of me, yet just out of reach. Between work Zooms, I squeeze in ten minutes of a podcast, grasping at familiar tones. It’s not about becoming a scholar; it’s about reclaiming a piece of myself, one phrase at a time. In this isolated year, these flickers of language feel like quiet acts of resistance, stitching me back to a heritage I almost lost.
