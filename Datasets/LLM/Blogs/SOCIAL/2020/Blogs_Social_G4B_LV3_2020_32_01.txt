**The Echo in the Crowd**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was trying to shout louder, to *mean* louder, online. Scrolling through endless feeds, it’s easy to feel utterly invisible, lost in the noise. I found myself withdrawing, honestly, just trying to protect my energy. 

Recently, I’ve been navigating a really strange fog – dizziness, blurry vision, and a persistent feeling of… disconnection. It started with a seizure diagnosis, a scary word that sent me spiraling. But now, a whisper keeps surfacing: POTS. It’s a bizarre feeling, like being *in* a crowd, but utterly alone. 

It’s made me think about the nature of connection, especially online. Are we truly connecting, or just broadcasting?  I realized I needed to curate my digital space, to choose the voices that felt grounding, not draining. It’s a slow process, but stepping back from the digital echo chamber has been surprisingly vital for finding a little quiet – and maybe, just maybe, a clearer path forward.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
