## The Book That Haunts Me (and a Reddit Plea!)

It's funny how certain memories burrow into your brain, isn't it? Lately, I've been wrestling with one â€“ a vivid scene from a book I read as a kid, probably in elementary school around 2005-2010. I remember the sheer shock of it: a character, for reasons I can't quite recall, embedding an axe into their leg. Gruesome, I know! 

It's been decades, and the book itself is a total mystery. I posted about it on Reddit hoping someone else remembers it too. Book identification is surprisingly tough! It feels like chasing a ghost of a childhood reading experience, but maybe, just maybe, someone out there holds the key. Wish me luck!
