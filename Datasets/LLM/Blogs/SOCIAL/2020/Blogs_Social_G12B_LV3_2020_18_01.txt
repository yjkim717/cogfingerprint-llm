## The Sims and the Silent Struggle of Engagement

Anyone else feel a weird disconnect sometimes? I’ve been playing The Sims for years, and lately… it just feels *off*. I watch streamers effortlessly build thriving Sim families, feeling genuinely entertained, but when I boot up my own game, I’m just…stuck. What’s the point? Is there even a “win”? It’s a strangely isolating feeling, this struggle to engage with something I should enjoy. Anyone else experiencing this digital disconnect in 2020?
