## The Unseen Guest at Every Gathering

It's 2020, and social gatherings look a little different, don’t they? Zoom calls, distanced picnics… it’s all a bit… cautious. And honestly, that’s been a small blessing for me. Because lurking in the background of nearly every social situation, for as long as I can remember, has been this persistent anxiety.

It's not a fear of germs, not really. It's something deeper, rooted in a childhood incident I’d rather not unpack right now. Let's just say it involved a hospital and a feeling of utter, terrifying loss of control. It’s emetophobia, the fear of vomiting, but it’s more than just *that*. It's the worry about losing control, the panic of feeling my body betray me in front of others.

Even now, watching everyone laugh and chat, I'm subtly scanning for exits, mentally rehearsing excuses. It’s exhausting. I know it's irrational, especially when we're all navigating a pandemic and its anxieties, but that feeling of potential, unexpected upheaval just… lingers. Maybe we all have our unseen guests at the table now.
