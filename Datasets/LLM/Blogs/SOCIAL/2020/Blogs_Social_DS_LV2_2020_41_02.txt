It’s October 2020, and Lee Taemin’s birthday has me reflecting on connection in this isolated year. We share the same birthday, and though we’ve never met, his music—especially the *Move* album—feels like a companion. Watching his relentless work ethic from afar has been a quiet motivator during my own stagnant days. It’s funny how a K-Pop artist can become a personal benchmark for perseverance. In a time of social distance, these small, shared inspirations feel more vital than ever. Happy birthday to us both.
