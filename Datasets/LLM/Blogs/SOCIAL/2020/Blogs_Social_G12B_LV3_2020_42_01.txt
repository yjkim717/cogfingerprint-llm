## The Comfort of Shared Silly

It's 2020, and connection feels…fragile, doesn't it? I recently bought a Calvin and Hobbes pillow. Sounds ridiculous, I know. But seeing that familiar strip sparked such a rush of nostalgia, a warm wave of remembering simpler times. It made me realize how much we all crave these little shared touchstones – a pop culture reference, a childhood memory – anything that says, "Hey, I get it. You’re not alone.” Maybe a silly comic strip *is* a lifeline.
