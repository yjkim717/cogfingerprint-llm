**The Static on the Screen, and the Silence in My Head**

Remember 2020? It felt…heavy. Like the world was perpetually stuck in a slightly out-of-focus photograph. We were all glued to our screens, trying to find connection in a time when physical connection felt utterly impossible. And honestly, scrolling through Instagram and TikTok felt like wading through a sea of carefully curated happiness – a happiness that just wasn't reflecting my reality.

I found myself falling down a rabbit hole of comparison, a silent, insidious competition I didn’t even realize I was participating in. Everyone seemed to be *doing* something amazing: travelling, launching businesses, finding new love. Meanwhile, I was just…existing.  A low-level hum of anxiety was constantly playing in the background, punctuated by these sharp spikes of intense sadness. 

It wasn’t a dramatic, earth-shattering kind of sadness. It was more like a persistent, dull ache – a feeling of being fundamentally *empty*.  And mixed with that emptiness was this unsettling voice, whispering insidious things about myself.  You know the kind – the ones that tell you you’re not good enough, that you’re a burden, that you don’t deserve to be happy. 

I started to notice patterns. When I felt overwhelmed, when the pressure of the world – the pandemic, the isolation, the constant stream of bad news – became too much, I’d turn to…well, coping mechanisms that weren’t exactly helpful.  Small things at first, a bit of overeating, a few too many glasses of wine. Then, things escalated.  I found myself engaging in self-harm as a way to…to feel *something* other than the crushing weight of despair. 

It’s a shameful secret, and one I almost didn't write about. But the truth is, I wasn't alone.  I saw it reflected in the quiet posts of friends, in the hesitant messages in group chats.  We were all battling the same unseen demons, desperately trying to project an image of strength and resilience while crumbling inside. 

The irony, of course, was that the very platforms designed to connect us were often the source of our disconnection – fueling our insecurities and making us feel even more isolated. 

Looking back, 2020 was a brutal teacher. It forced me to confront uncomfortable truths about myself and the insidious ways social media could erode our mental health. It wasn’t about having the ‘perfect’ life; it was about acknowledging the messy, complicated reality of *my* life. 

If you’re reading this and recognizing something of your own experience, please know that you are not alone. There is help available, and you deserve to feel seen and heard.  Take a deep breath, and reach out.  Let's start breaking the silence, together.
