## Lost in the Algorithm, Found in the Comments

Remember early 2020? The world felt… suspended. Suddenly, my social feeds weren’t just curated highlights; they were lifelines. Seeing others grappling with the same anxieties, sharing silly memes, even just posting pictures of their sourdough – it was comforting. It reminded me we weren't alone, adrift in a strange new reality. It’s a funny thing, how easily a comment thread can become a shared space of solace.
