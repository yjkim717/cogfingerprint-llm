>## The Echo of a Better Challenge

It's funny how quickly things change online, isn't it? I've been grinding these weekly challenges in [Game Name], and while they're…fine, I keep finding myself thinking back to the Wichita campaign. Remember those hardmode missions? The ones that *really* made you think, the ones that felt genuinely rewarding to conquer?

They just hit different. These current time-gated challenges feel a little…hollow. A little too straightforward. Bringing back something like those hardmode missions – a layer of optional difficulty for players who crave it – would inject some serious life into the weekly rotation. Just saying, a little nostalgia goes a long way! Anyone else feeling this?
