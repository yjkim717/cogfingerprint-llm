**The Ghosts in the Game**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was just… staring at screens. I was obsessed with tweaking old wrestling games, trying to get the *perfect* texture mod for my WWE 2K. Specifically, CM Punk’s face just wouldn’t load right. It was frustrating, a tiny digital ghost refusing to appear. 

It made me think about how we project ourselves online – wanting to be seen, to be *fixed*. Sometimes, the things we wrestle with are just glitches, not failures of self.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a post based on a different summary?
