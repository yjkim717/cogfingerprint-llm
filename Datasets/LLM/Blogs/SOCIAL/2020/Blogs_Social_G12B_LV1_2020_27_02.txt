## Thinking Beyond the Belt: Is Trucking the Answer?

This year's been… a lot, hasn't it? Stuck sorting packages, day in and day out, I kept thinking about my grandfather. He was a trucker, always on the road, but he seemed to *own* his time. I'm tired of the conveyor belt, honestly. The pandemic amplified everything – the risk, the exhaustion, the feeling of being just a cog.

I’m seriously looking into getting a CDL. The idea of residential delivery, being home daily, feels like a real possibility for a better life. Steel hauling isn't glamorous, but stability and a decent paycheck? That’s what I’m chasing. It's a big leap, but maybe, just maybe, finding a new road is exactly what I need right now. Wish me luck!
