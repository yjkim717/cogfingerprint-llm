**The Echo Chamber of Grief**

It feels a little strange writing this now, looking back to 2020. But there’s something I need to unpack, something that still feels…raw. It’s about the way we grieve, the way we process tragedy, and, frankly, the way we *argue* about it online. 

I’m talking about Sushant Singh Rajput. 

It feels almost impossible to revisit the storm that engulfed everyone when he died. The initial outpouring of sadness quickly morphed into something else entirely – a frenzied, almost aggressive, dissection of his life, his relationships, and ultimately, his death. And layered on top of all that, a tidal wave of conspiracy theories. 

I remember scrolling through Twitter, feeling a growing sense of unease. Every accusation, every “fact,” seemed to be fueled by a desperate need to *believe* something, *anything*, rather than accept the possibility of a tragic, complex situation. It felt like we’d collectively lost our ability to simply *feel* with someone, to offer empathy without demanding a narrative. 

Bollywood, naturally, became the immediate scapegoat. The media portrayal, already often sensationalized, was amplified into a weapon. It wasn't just about finding answers; it was about assigning blame. 

What really stuck with me was the realization that we’d created an echo chamber of grief. We were so busy shouting our own theories, so determined to be “right,” that we weren’t really listening to anyone – or to ourselves. 

It’s a reminder, I think, that online spaces can be incredibly powerful, but they can also be profoundly damaging if we let them dictate how we connect with loss and with each other.

Would you like me to tweak anything about this, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the topic?
