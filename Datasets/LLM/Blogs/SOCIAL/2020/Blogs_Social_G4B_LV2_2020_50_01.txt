Okay, here’s a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and roughly 234 words, set in 2020:

**The Weight of "Helpful"**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How something meant to be supportive can actually feel… crushing? 2020 was a year for feeling overwhelmed, for needing a lifeline. And I definitely needed one. 

I had a friend, let’s call her Sarah, who, bless her heart, genuinely wanted to help. But her help often came in the form of a relentless stream of advice, usually centered around my relationship. Every little hiccup, every disagreement with my partner, was met with a cascade of “you should do this,” “you should say that,” and a whole lot of unsolicited opinions. 

Honestly, it started subtly. A well-meaning suggestion here, a gently worded critique there. But it built. It became this constant pressure, a feeling that I wasn’t capable of navigating my own life without her steering me. 

Then came the argument. A truly awful, heated exchange fueled by months of simmering frustration and, I realized in the heat of the moment, a blatant disregard for my boundaries. She’d crossed a line, pushing past what I was willing to accept. 

Looking back, it was a painful lesson. It wasn’t that she didn't care, it was that her intention – to be helpful – had completely overshadowed my need for space and autonomy. Sometimes, the kindest thing you can do for someone is to step back and let them figure things out for themselves.  It’s a tough one to swallow, but a vital one to learn.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way (e.g., adjust the tone, add a specific detail, or change the length)?
