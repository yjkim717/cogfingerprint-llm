**The Echo in the Hallway**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How sometimes, the things we’re most afraid of seem to…show up? Like, not in a dramatic, monster-under-the-bed kind of way, but as a subtle echo in the hallway of our social lives. 

2020 was a *year* for that. Suddenly, everyone was hyper-aware of how we were *doing* socially. Every Zoom call felt like a performance, every text a potential judgment. It was exhausting. 

I started noticing this with my own anxiety. My biggest fear? Not being liked, not being *seen*. And it manifested, bizarrely, as this constant, low-level dread during online conversations – a feeling that I was saying the wrong thing, that people were silently scrolling past, judging me. 

It reminded me of that “Nirvana Stand” concept – taking your deepest fear and amplifying it.  I realized I needed a psychotherapist to help me unpack it, to understand where this fear originated. 

It’s a tough one, navigating the social landscape, especially when your own mind is throwing obstacles in your path.  But recognizing those echoes, naming the fear, is the first step toward silencing them.  Anyone else feel this?
