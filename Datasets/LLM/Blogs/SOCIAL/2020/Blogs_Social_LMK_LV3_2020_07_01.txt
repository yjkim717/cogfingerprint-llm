As I listened to my recorded videos on social media in 2020, I realized I'd grown more comfortable with my voice. It wasn't always this way - I'd cringe at the sound of myself. But knowing my audience connected with my content changed everything. I began to see my voice as a tool for connection, not a source of insecurity. This shift in self-perception boosted my confidence, and I felt more authentic, embracing my uniqueness in the process.
