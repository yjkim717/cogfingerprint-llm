**The Way They Looked At Me**

Remember those awkward years of adolescence? For me, a lot of it revolved around trying to figure out who I was, and, honestly, who *they* thought I was. It’s a strange thing, isn’t it? How easily a simple outfit – a dress, a skirt – could trigger something unsettling. 

I had this recurring feeling of being watched, judged, and, frankly, sexualized by adults, all based on what they *misinterpreted* about my appearance. It wasn't about the clothes themselves, but about the assumptions they made. It felt incredibly isolating, a constant pressure to shrink myself, to hide. 

Looking back from 2020, it’s heartbreaking to realize how deeply those experiences impacted my *body image* and how much it warped my perception of social spaces. It’s a reminder that even seemingly small rules and expectations can carry a huge weight, especially for young people navigating their identity.  Have you ever felt that scrutiny?
