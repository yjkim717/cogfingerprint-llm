## That Reflex Sight and My Brain: A Half-Life: Alyx Revelation

Okay, so I've been completely lost in *Half-Life: Alyx* – seriously, VR gaming has leveled up. But I stumbled across something fascinating on Reddit the other day. Apparently, the pistol's reflex sight is designed with a dominant eye in mind. As someone who’s always felt a little… off-kilter when aiming in games, this clicked. It's a surprisingly thoughtful design choice, highlighting how even seemingly small details in VR can impact usability. It made me wonder how many other subtle assumptions are baked into our digital experiences!
