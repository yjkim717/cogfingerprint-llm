## The Strange Case of My Post-Headache Burrito Habit

Okay, so this is going to sound… weird. But bear with me. 2020 has been a year of strange revelations, right? Mine involves burritos and a surprising amount of self-conditioning.

It started, predictably, with migraines. Last spring, when everything felt like it was tilting and throbbing, I found myself reaching for the same thing every single time: a massive, cheesy, overloaded burrito. It felt like comfort, a reward for surviving the pain. And it worked, momentarily.

But somewhere along the line, my brain decided to play a cruel trick. Now, *after* a migraine, the craving hits. It's not a gentle suggestion; it’s a full-blown, insistent need. My stomach actually *rumbles* for a burrito. 

My friend Sarah jokingly called it being "Pavlov'ed" – like a dog salivating at the sound of a bell. And she’s probably right. My brain has linked the relief of post-migraine recovery with the deliciousness of a burrito. 

The downside? My bank account weeps, and I've developed a distinct “burrito gut.” It’s a small price to pay for headache relief, maybe, but a slightly embarrassing one. I’m trying to break the cycle, but honestly, the siren song of that warm tortilla is powerful. Wish me luck – and send over some healthy alternatives!
