Living in Springfield, I get it—sometimes it feels like my vote is just a whisper in Chicago’s roar. In 2020, with so much at stake, that disconnect stung. But I showed up anyway, standing in line with neighbors, sharing weary smiles. It wasn’t about swinging the state; it was about honoring my own voice, my small piece of this democracy. That ballot was my statement, my quiet act of hope. And honestly? It counted—to me.
