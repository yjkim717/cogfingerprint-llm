## The Shiny Promise & Empty Pockets

It’s 2020, and everyone’s online, talking about “side hustles” and “passive income.” My friend, Sarah, jumped on that bandwagon a few months ago, getting really into Arbonne. At first, I was happy for her. She seemed excited, posting all these gorgeous skincare pics and talking about “empowerment” and building her “downline.”

But lately, I've noticed a shift. She’s stressed. Constantly hustling on Instagram, running online workshops, and buying more product to “qualify” for bonuses. She’s a student, remember? Trying to juggle classes and, you know, *actually* learn something. 

It’s gotten to the point where she's borrowing money. Seeing her so focused on this, chasing a dream that feels increasingly precarious, it’s made me really think. Is this empowerment, or just another way to pressure people into spending money and recruiting friends? I’m worried about her, and honestly, a little wary of the whole MLM thing now. It's a tough one to navigate.
