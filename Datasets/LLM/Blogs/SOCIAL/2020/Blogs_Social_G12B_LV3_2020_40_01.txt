>## The Tightrope Walk of Food and Feelings

It's 2020, and honestly, everything feels a little precarious, doesn't it? Lately, I've been feeling that instability acutely around food. It’s a weird thing to admit, but my relationship has become… complicated, especially when it comes to what I eat. There's this subtle pressure, a constant questioning of my choices. It's not overt, not shouting about calories, but it’s there. 

And you know what happens then? I restrict. I tell myself "just a little less," and that little less spirals. Then, the guilt hits, and the cycle starts again – the binge, the shame, the feeling of being utterly out of control. It's exhausting. I'm working on recognizing these patterns, understanding this isn’t about the food, but about feeling controlled. It’s a tough battle, but recognizing it is the first step, right?
