As a foster parent in southern Oregon, I've seen firsthand how a child's smile can impact their self-esteem. My own experiences as a teenager with crooked teeth left me feeling self-conscious, and I didn't want my child to go through the same struggles. When my child's insurance didn't cover the full cost of their orthodontic care, I was determined to find a solution. I reached out to local orthodontists, searching for one who would be willing to take on my child's case pro bono. After months of searching, I finally found a compassionate orthodontist who understood the importance of a healthy, confident smile. To help cover the remaining costs, I started a GoFundMe campaign, and the outpouring of support from our community has been heartwarming. It's a reminder that even in challenging times, kindness and generosity can make all the difference in a child's life.
