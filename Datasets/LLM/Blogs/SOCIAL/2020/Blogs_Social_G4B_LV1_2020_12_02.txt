**Remember 2020 League? Ugh.**

Okay, let’s be real – 2020 League of Legends felt…rough. I spent so much time stuck in ranked, just desperately trying to climb, and it was constantly undercut by the same frustrating patterns. Seriously, the trolling was *rampant*. And the feeders? Don't even get me started. 

It felt like there was zero accountability. No real system to punish those intentionally ruining games. You’d get isolated, starved, and then someone would just camp you. It just sucked the joy out of the whole thing.  Anyone else feel like 2020 was a particularly brutal year for League’s social element?
