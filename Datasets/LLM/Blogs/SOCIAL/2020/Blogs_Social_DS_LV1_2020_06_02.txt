It’s 2020, and I’m starting to think I have a corrosive touch. Every group project I join, every team I’m on—it’s like I bring a slow, quiet ruin. I watch my own negativity seep in, and things just… fray. It’s not intentional, but the impact feels real. I’m left wondering if the common denominator in all this social friction is just me. Maybe self-awareness is the first step to stopping the cycle.
