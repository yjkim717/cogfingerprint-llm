As I navigated the uncharted territory of remote work in 2020, I realized that establishing a routine was crucial to my productivity and sanity. By getting dressed professionally and creating a dedicated workspace, I was able to separate work from personal life. This simple switch helped me stay focused and avoid the blur between work and leisure time. By setting boundaries, I achieved a better work-life balance, and I was more present in both my personal and professional life. It was a game-changer for my remote work experience.
