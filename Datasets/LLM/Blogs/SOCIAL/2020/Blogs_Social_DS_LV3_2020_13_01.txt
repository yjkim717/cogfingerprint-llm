The first time I saw my foster daughter cover her smile with her hand, my own teenage years came rushing back. I remembered standing in front of the mirror, feeling that same self-conscious twist in my stomach. It’s a feeling that doesn’t just fade; it shapes you.

Now, in the uncertainty of 2020, that familiar struggle has resurfaced in our Southern Oregon home. Her spirit is bright, but her confidence is held back by teeth that need an orthodontist’s care—something our insurance simply won’t cover.

I’m writing this not just as a plea, but as a testament to the power of community. We’re seeking a pro bono miracle, a professional willing to see the person behind the dental chart. Because a transformed smile does more than straighten teeth; it unlocks a voice, a laugh, a newfound belief in oneself. It’s an investment in a future where she no longer has to hide.
