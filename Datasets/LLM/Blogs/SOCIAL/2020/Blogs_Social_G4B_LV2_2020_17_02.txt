**The Quiet Panic**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something so…basic – the simple act of burping – can trigger a whole wave of anxiety. I was scrolling through Instagram last year, 2020, feeling utterly adrift, when a friend mentioned she’d had Botox. It led to a bizarre tangent about *not* burping. 

Seriously. She was convinced she’d lost the ability, and it felt…wrong. Like a tiny, unsettling glitch. I realized I felt a similar prickle of unease sometimes, a low-level anxiety about bodily functions. It’s emetophobia, I know, and it’s a sneaky thing. 

Social media amplifies everything, right? Suddenly, everyone’s showcasing their ‘perfect’ lives, and I was worried about being ‘wrong’ too – about not fitting in, about having these strange, quiet anxieties. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest battles are fought within ourselves.
