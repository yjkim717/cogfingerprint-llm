**The Shame of the Unused Mixer**

It’s weird, right? As a sound engineer in 2020, I’m constantly battling a strange kind of professional guilt. I’ve got a serious soft spot for really good, affordable headphones – the kind that let me dial in a perfect mix on the go. They’re my EDC (everyday carry) audio lifeline. But lately, I’ve been staring at a shelf overflowing with audio gear I just… don’t use. 

A fancy Bluetooth transmitter, a miniature digital mixer, a second pair of studio headphones – all untouched. It’s embarrassing, honestly. I’d buy things on impulse, convinced I’d need them for *that* project, *that* client. 

Social media definitely didn’t help. Everyone was showcasing their meticulously curated audio setups, making me feel like I was failing. But then I realized: chasing the “perfect” setup is pointless. My trusty, budget headphones and a little ingenuity are enough.  It’s about practicality, not prestige.  Maybe it’s time to stop buying and start *doing*.
