## The Unspoken Expectation: Navigating Anal Sex in Gay Dating

Okay, let's be real. Scrolling through dating apps these days, you see a lot. And sometimes, you see an unspoken expectation hanging in the air. As a gay man in 2020, it feels like anal sex is often presented as a default preference, even in casual encounters or budding relationships. 

I recently saw a thread on Reddit where someone was feeling really uncomfortable with this pressure, and it resonated deeply. It got me thinking – how do we navigate this? How do we communicate our boundaries without feeling like we're somehow "less" or "difficult"? It’s a conversation we *need* to have, openly and honestly, to build healthier, more respectful connections.
