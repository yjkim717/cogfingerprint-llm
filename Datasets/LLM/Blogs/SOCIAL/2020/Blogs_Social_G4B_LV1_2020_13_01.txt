**The Unexpected Cost of Care**

It’s funny how life throws you curveballs, right? This past year, 2020, has been a wild ride for everyone, but I was recently struck by a story that really hit home. A friend, a dedicated foster parent in Southern Oregon, was struggling to get her child the dental care he needed. 

She’s doing amazing work, providing a safe and loving home, but navigating the complexities of foster care – and especially the lack of insurance – felt overwhelming. It made me think about the unseen costs of care, the ways systemic issues can disproportionately affect vulnerable families. 

I learned about pro bono services offered by local orthodontists, a small ray of hope. It’s a reminder that even small acts of kindness and connecting people with resources can make a huge difference. Let’s keep pushing for equitable access to basic needs for everyone.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
