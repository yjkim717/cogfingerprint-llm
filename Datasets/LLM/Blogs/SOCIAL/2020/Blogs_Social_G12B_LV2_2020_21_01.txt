>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and a 2020 context. I've focused on the anxieties around connection and potential disappointment, which felt particularly relevant during that time.  I've included a couple of options, varying slightly in tone.  **Please read the notes at the end of each option after the post, outlining the choices I made and potential areas for further development.**

**Option 1: The Maybe-Friend, Maybe-More Dilemma**

Remember 2020? The year everything felt… uncertain. Even something as simple as a potential connection felt loaded. I got a message the other day from a friend wrestling with this. He met someone briefly, a visitor passing through, and now he's wondering if trying for “just friends” is worth the effort. 

Honestly, I get it. We've all been there, haven't we? That flutter of hope, the quick spark of something… and then the quiet question: is this going to lead anywhere? Sometimes, chasing a "maybe" feels exhausting, especially when life already feels so heavy. But isn’t the risk of connection, even a small one, worth a little effort? Or are we all just bracing for another letdown? It's a question I'm asking myself too.

**Option 2: Low-Stakes Longing**

2020 was a year of distance, wasn't it? Not just physical, but emotional too. Maybe that's why this question hit me so hard: Should you pursue a connection with someone you know is likely to be temporary? A friend is grappling with it – a fleeting acquaintance, a spark of something… and the worry that a friendship might just amplify the eventual goodbye.

It feels like a uniquely modern problem, doesn’t it? We’re so used to curating connections, to weighing the potential ROI of every interaction. But sometimes, maybe the point *isn’t* the grand outcome. Maybe it's just allowing yourself to feel a little something, even if it's low-stakes longing.  What do you think?

**Notes on Choices & Potential Development (for both options):**

*   **2020 Context:** I leaned into the isolation and uncertainty of 2020 as a backdrop to amplify the emotional weight of the question. The pandemic made casual connections feel even more precious (and potentially painful).
*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Remember 2020?", "I get it," and direct questions to the reader to create a feeling of a conversation.
*   **Relatability:** The focus is on the *feeling* of the situation rather than strictly outlining advice. The blog post aims to resonate with readers who have experienced similar anxieties.
*   **"Boy Toy" Keyword:** I deliberately *didn't* directly address the "boy toy" keyword. It felt potentially loaded and risked shifting the tone in an unwanted direction. Instead, I focused on the broader theme of pursuing someone with limited availability.  If you *want* to address it more directly, it would require a more cautious and nuanced approach (e.g., discussing power dynamics, expectations, and consent).
