**The Shiny Promise of "Opportunity"**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily something can look like a brilliant chance when you’re scrolling through Instagram in 2020? My friend Sarah was all over Arbonne – skincare, a ‘downline’ of students, the whole nine yards.  It felt… optimistic.  

But seeing her pour her student loan money into it, coupled with her aunt’s enthusiastic promotion, honestly raised a red flag.  It’s easy to get caught up in the idea of building something for yourself, of being ‘independent.’  But when the focus shifts to recruitment and the pressure to buy your own products, it felt less like opportunity and more like a carefully constructed system. 

I just hope she realizes it before it’s too late.  Sometimes, the shiniest promises hide the trickiest traps.
