"Remember the thrill of WoWs Legends' Wichita campaign in 2020? The hardmode missions were a true test of skill, pushing us to our limits. What's striking is how these challenging levels have stuck with me. Bringing back this feature in future campaigns would not only satisfy nostalgic gamers like myself but also attract new players seeking a tougher experience. It's time to revive the excitement and take our gaming to the next level."
