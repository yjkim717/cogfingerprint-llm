It’s late 2020, and my weekly Civ game has become a ritual of frustration. Since September, our multiplayer sessions keep crashing with desyncs. We’ve tried everything—disabling mods, rehosting the save, even restarting the router. But nothing works. In a year already defined by distance, these technical glitches feel like one more wall going up, severing one of the few reliable connections I had left with friends. It’s more than a game bug; it’s a social lifeline, frayed.
