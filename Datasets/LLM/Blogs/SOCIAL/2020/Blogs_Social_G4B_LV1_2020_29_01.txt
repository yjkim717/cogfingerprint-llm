**When “Just Be Strong” Doesn’t Cut It**

Remember March 2020? Everything felt…uncertain. Then, my dad died. I reached out to my school, expecting support. Instead, I got platitudes – “Focus on your studies,” “Time heals all wounds.” It felt so profoundly wrong.  

It’s not about *doing* anything; it's about *feeling*.  My family was a tangled mess of grief, and the school’s advice completely missed that.  We needed genuine empathy, not a checklist of how to "move on."  It highlighted how desperately we need schools to understand that loss isn’t a problem to be solved, but a deeply personal experience.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps explore a different angle?
