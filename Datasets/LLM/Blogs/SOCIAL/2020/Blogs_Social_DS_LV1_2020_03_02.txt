As MLK Day approached in 2020, my husband and I paused before our usual soul food menu. We’ve cooked collard greens and cornbread for years—it’s comfort food we genuinely love. But this year felt different. With conversations about cultural appropriation swirling, we wondered: does intention matter if impact is what counts? We decided to share the meal with Black friends, turning dinner into dialogue. It wasn’t about absolution; it was about connection. Honoring Dr. King meant listening, learning, and breaking bread together—mindfully.
