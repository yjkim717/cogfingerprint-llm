## The Vanish & Return: When Online Worlds Bleed Into Real Life

Okay, so I need to get this off my chest. Lately, I've been thinking a *lot* about how much our social media lives are impacting our relationships. It’s 2020 – we're all glued to our phones, constantly curating a version of ourselves for the world. And honestly, it's exhausting.

I have a friend who’s going through something rough right now. A boyfriend just reappeared after a month of… nothing. Total ghosting. He claims it was because of online bullying – some nasty comments on his Snapchat, apparently. He says it got to be too much, that he needed to disappear to protect his mental health.

Look, I get the need to protect yourself. Truly. But a month of silence? No explanation? It feels… extreme. It also makes you wonder: how much of this is *real* pressure, and how much is him struggling to handle difficult emotions?

It’s a really unsettling thought, isn’t it? That our relationships can be so easily derailed by something that exists solely in the digital sphere. It highlights how fragile things can feel when your sense of self is so tied to likes and followers. It makes you question everything. Is this healthy? Is this sustainable? And ultimately, are we equipped to navigate this increasingly intertwined digital/emotional landscape? I'm not sure I have the answers, but I think it’s a conversation we all need to be having.
