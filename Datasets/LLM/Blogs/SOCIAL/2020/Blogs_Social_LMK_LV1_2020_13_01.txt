As I watched my foster child struggle to smile, I knew I had to do something. Their crooked teeth had become a source of self-consciousness, and I couldn't bear the thought of them feeling embarrassed or ashamed. The problem was, orthodontic care isn't covered by our insurance, and the out-of-pocket costs were staggering. I started researching options and was heartbroken to discover that many families in Southern Oregon face the same challenge. That's when I decided to start a GoFundMe campaign, hoping to raise the funds needed to give my child a confident smile. To my surprise, our community rallied around us, and we were able to secure pro bono orthodontic care from a local orthodontist who shared our compassion. It's moments like these that remind me of the power of kindness and generosity â€“ and I'm grateful to live in a community that cares.
