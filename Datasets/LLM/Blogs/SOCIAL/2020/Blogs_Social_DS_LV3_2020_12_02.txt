It’s 2020, and I’m stuck at home, turning to ranked games for an escape. But instead of fun, I’m met with a surge of trolls and feeders—players who seem determined to ruin the experience. Every match feels like a gamble: will my team cooperate, or will someone throw the game just for kicks?

It’s disheartening when you’re trying your best, only to watch disruptive behavior go unpunished. In a year when we’re all craving connection and a bit of control, these moments of chaos hit harder. Gaming should be a refuge, not another source of frustration. Here’s hoping for a better season ahead.
