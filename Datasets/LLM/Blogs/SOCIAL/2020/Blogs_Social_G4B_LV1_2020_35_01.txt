**The Shadow in My Feed**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? We were all just trying to navigate Zoom calls and sourdough starters, but beneath the surface of everything, I was dealing with something really unsettling. It started with Sarah, a friend I’d known for years. We'd always been pretty solid, a good, reliable platonic friendship. Then, slowly, things shifted. 

It began with little things – overly detailed observations about my life, a constant need to be the center of attention, and then… the comments started. Not outright mean, but subtly cutting, designed to make me feel small and insecure. It escalated to veiled threats, disguised as “concerned advice” about my dating life, and then, inevitably, the lies. Fabricated stories about other people, twisting my words, just to maintain this carefully constructed narrative where *she* was the victim.

Honestly, I spent weeks battling guilt. I kept asking myself, “Why am I letting this happen? Shouldn’t I just drop her?” But there was this weird pull, this concern for *her* that felt completely misplaced. It felt like I was trapped in a loop, constantly apologizing for feelings she’d instigated. 

Looking back, it’s horrifying to recognize the patterns. It was classic narcissistic abuse, masked as a friendship. I’m still processing the emotional fallout, and it’s a reminder that sometimes, the most painful relationships are the ones you thought were safe.  It’s taken a lot of work to step away and prioritize my own well-being.  And you know what?  It’s the bravest thing I’ve ever done.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
