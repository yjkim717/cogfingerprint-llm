>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a relatable, conversational tone and a 2020 context.  I've focused on the broader feeling of exclusion that can arise from design choices, connecting it to wider social issues.  I've included a couple of options, varying slightly in emphasis.  Choose the one that feels most aligned with your desired voice.

**Option 1 (More Personal Focus):**

## That Reflex Sight Got Me Thinking...

Okay, so I'm *obsessed* with *Half-Life: Alyx*. Seriously, the VR immersion is incredible. But I hit a snag – the pistol's reflex sight. Apparently, it’s designed assuming you have a dominant eye. I don't. And suddenly, what should be a seamless experience felt… frustrating.

It’s a small thing, a game design choice. But it got me thinking about how often things are built for an "average" that leaves people out. It’s easy to forget that not everyone experiences the world the same way. This year, more than ever, we've all been forced to confront perspectives different from our own. Maybe a little more empathy in design – in *everything* – wouldn’t hurt.

**Option 2 (Slightly Broader Social Commentary):**

## The Unintended Exclusion of VR

*Half-Life: Alyx* is a masterpiece, no doubt. The VR is breathtaking. But I ran into a weird problem with the pistol – the reflex sight is clearly optimized for players with a dominant eye. As someone who doesn’t have one, aiming felt awkward and off.

It's a tiny detail, but it highlights a bigger issue. We often design experiences – physical, digital, social – with a default user in mind. And that default often unintentionally excludes others. 2020 has been a year of reckoning, a year of realizing how many systems privilege certain groups. Let's carry that awareness into how we create, and strive for inclusivity, one reflex sight (and beyond) at a time.

**Notes & Considerations:**

*   **Relatability:** Both options try to ground the issue in a personal experience (the frustration with the game).
*   **2020 Context:**  The references to 2020 and the year of reckoning are meant to tie the specific game design issue to the broader social consciousness of the time.
*   **Conversational Tone:** I've used contractions ("I'm," "it's") and a more informal writing style.
*   **Call to Reflection:** Both end with a reflective thought about the broader implications.



Let me know if you'd like me to tweak either option or create a different version!
