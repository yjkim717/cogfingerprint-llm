### The High Score That Felt Like a Loss

I had one of those gaming sessions last night that sticks with you. Not because of some epic, against-all-odds victory, but because of a single, sour voice in my headset.

It was 2020. We were all trapped in our own little boxes, and for many of us, online games were our town square, our pub, our escape. This particular match was in a competitive shooter, and for once, everything was clicking. My reflexes were sharp, my positioning was on point—I was, without ego, carrying the team. The final scoreboard lit up with my name at the very top, a solid two thousand points ahead of anyone else. By any metric, it was a personal best.

And yet, the dominant memory isn't the flawless play; it's the relentless, grating commentary from one teammate. From the moment we spawned, it was a torrent of complaints. My strategies were wrong, my positioning was selfish, my every move was met with a sigh of frustration—even the ones that secured us objectives.

There I was, performing at my peak, and instead of feeling that collaborative high, that shared triumph, I felt a knot of frustration tightening in my chest. The digital pat on the back from the game meant nothing compared to the real-time toxicity from a fellow human.

It’s a strange paradox of online life, isn't it? We log on for connection and teamwork, only to be reminded how a single negative voice can poison a shared experience. In the final thirty seconds, I finally did what I should have done at the start: I hit the mute button. The silence was instant, and profoundly peaceful.

It was a small victory within the larger one. I was reminded that while I can't control the toxicity of others, I absolutely control my exposure to it. My best match ever taught me that sometimes, the most powerful skill isn't on the keyboard—it's the wisdom to know when to simply tune out the noise.
