**The Weight of the Scroll**

Remember 2020? It felt… heavy. Not just with the pandemic, but with this constant, low-humming pressure of *social*. We were all glued to our screens, desperately trying to connect while feeling utterly, profoundly alone. 

I found myself scrolling for hours, a bizarre kind of isolation. It wasn't a physical loneliness, but a deeper one – a feeling of being adrift in a sea of curated happiness. Everyone seemed to be having the *best* time, traveling, celebrating, achieving… and I was staring at my messy apartment, battling a particularly stubborn bout of depression. 

There was this poem I stumbled across recently, and it really hit home. It described a landscape of mirrors and coldness, a place where everything felt painfully transparent. That felt *exactly* like being online – exposed, judged, and acutely aware of the gaps between my reality and everyone else’s highlight reel. 

It made me realize how easily we can get lost in the performance of social media. We build these versions of ourselves, carefully crafted to impress, and in doing so, we forget to actually *feel*.  I started taking breaks, putting the phone down, and just… reflecting. It’s a messy process, and honestly, still ongoing, but finding those quiet moments of stillness feels more vital than any number of likes.
