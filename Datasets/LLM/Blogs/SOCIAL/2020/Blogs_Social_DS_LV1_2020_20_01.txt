In 2020, stuck at home, I finally faced the Mandarin my grandparents always hoped I’d master. My fluency was a ghost—present in family Zooms, but vanishing the moment I tried to form a sentence on my own. So, I dove into Chinese dramas and news podcasts, letting the sounds wash over me during my solitary walks. It was more than vocabulary; it was about rebuilding a bridge to a part of myself that felt distant. I’m not fluent yet, but for the first time, I can feel the connection strengthening, word by word.
