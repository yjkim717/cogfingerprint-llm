It’s 2020, and my dad’s been gone six months when a well-meaning school counselor pulls me aside. “We’re so sorry for your loss,” she says, handing me a pamphlet. I nod, but inside, I’m screaming.

See, my dad wasn’t just “Dad.” He was complicated—sometimes distant, often hard to love. Our relationship was a messy tapestry of quiet car rides and occasional laughter. But the school’s scripted sympathy? It smoothed everything into a Hallmark card, erasing the real, flawed person I was grieving.

In trying to comfort, they unintentionally dismissed the truth: grief isn’t tidy. It’s tangled up in regret, relief, and love all at once. By offering one-size-fits-all condolences, the system missed a chance to acknowledge that families—and our feelings about them—are beautifully, painfully complex. Sometimes, the kindest thing you can do is just listen, without the platitudes.
