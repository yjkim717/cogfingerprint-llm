It’s 2020, and honestly, the world feels heavy. But today, Lee Taemin’s birthday, is a bright spot. I’m looking at my "Move" postcards from his latest album, and it hits me: in a year of distance, K-Pop fandom is my social anchor. We’re celebrating together online, sharing the same joy for an artist who gives his all. It’s a reminder that passion and dedication, like Taemin’s, can still connect us, even through a screen. Happy birthday to an inspiration.
