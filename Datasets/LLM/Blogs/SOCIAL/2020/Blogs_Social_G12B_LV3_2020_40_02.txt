## The Weight of Moving In (and Everything Else)

Okay, let's be real. 2020 has been… a lot. For a *lot* of us. And if you’re anything like me, the weight of it all has settled in ways you didn't quite anticipate. I've been navigating mental health challenges for a while now – the usual suspects: anxiety, a tendency towards depression, and a complicated relationship with food. It's been a journey, to say the least. 

But lately, things have felt… heavier. Like I’m carrying an extra invisible backpack filled with worries and self-doubt. And it’s impacting everything, especially my relationship. 

My partner and I are moving in together. It's something we've talked about for ages, a huge milestone! On paper, it's perfect. But the reality feels a little more tangled. I find myself withdrawing, feeling guilty for needing extra space, for not always being "on."  I worry I'm bringing my baggage – my anxiety spirals, my moments of low mood, my battles with disordered eating – and that it's somehow dimming our joy.

Communication has become… tricky. I don't want to burden him, but I also don't want to hide. It’s a delicate dance, trying to explain the invisible forces at play without making him feel like I’m a project.

I know I'm not alone in this. So many of us are grappling with mental health in this strange, isolating world. And big life changes, like moving in with someone, just amplify everything. It’s a reminder that vulnerability isn't weakness – it's the foundation of a strong, honest connection.  

Right now, I'm focusing on small steps: being honest (even when it's hard), prioritizing self-care (even when motivation is low), and reminding myself that this is a journey for *both* of us.
