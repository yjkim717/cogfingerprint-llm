Okay, here’s a reflective blog post inspired by the Wizards Unite strategic advice, aiming for a conversational tone and approximately 233 words, set in 2020:

**The Art of the Shuffle: Lessons from a Strange Year**

Okay, so 2020. It was… a lot. Suddenly, everyone was glued to their screens, seeking connection in a world that felt increasingly distant. And I realized something, watching my friends navigate this new reality: it was a lot like building a group fortress in *Wizards Unite*, only with people instead of spells. 

I’ve always been a bit of a ‘focus charm’ person – intensely interested in one thing, sometimes to the exclusion of everything else.  Early in lockdown, I was laser-focused on perfecting my sourdough starter, ignoring the calls to just *be* with people. It felt productive, but ultimately isolating. 

Then I started noticing how my friends were handling it. Some were ‘bat bogies’ – instinctively pulling away, understandably needing space. Others were experimenting with ‘weakening hexes’ – trying different ways to connect, but not quite landing.  We needed to be strategic about our team efforts. 

It took a while, but I started realizing the importance of distributing my energy, like a good strategist allocating focus charms. A quick video call here, a shared meme there, even just a simple "how are you *really* doing?" – small, consistent efforts. 

It wasn’t always smooth. There were misfires, awkward silences, and the occasional frustrated ‘hex’ thrown. But by recognizing the different ways people needed to connect, and by consciously shifting my approach, I found a way to build a stronger, more resilient social “fortress” – even from a distance.  It’s a reminder that connection, like magic, requires practice and a little bit of strategy.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
