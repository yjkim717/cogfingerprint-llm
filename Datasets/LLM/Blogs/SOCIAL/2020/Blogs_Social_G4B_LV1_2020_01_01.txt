**The Unranked Avalanche & My Rocket League Breakdown**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? And Rocket League? Still my escape. But lately, something’s been seriously throwing a wrench in the fun. It’s this weird “smurfening” – a tidal wave of incredibly high-skill unranked players popping up in my games. 

I get it, everyone wants to play! But the re-ranking system feels completely broken. One minute I’m battling a decent team, the next I’m staring down a squad that clearly spends their evenings practicing advanced aerials. It’s demoralizing, honestly. 

I started obsessing over the rankings, trying to figure out *how* this was happening. Was it a glitch? A new matchmaking algorithm gone wild?  It felt like a constant uphill battle, a frustrating cycle of winning a few, getting swamped, and then feeling like I was just… competing against a different game entirely. 

Anyone else feeling this? Let's commiserate! #RocketLeague #Smurfening #MatchmakingWoes
