"When Social Selling Goes Sour: A Cautionary Tale of MLMs"

As I sat down with my friend over coffee in early 2020, I couldn't help but notice the Arbonne catalog peeking out of her bag. She was excited to share her new venture, having just signed up as a distributor for the popular skincare MLM. I listened attentively, trying to be supportive, but my mind wandered to the countless friends I'd seen fall into the same trap. The promise of easy money and flexible hours often overshadowed the harsh reality: financial loss and a distraction from what truly matters â€“ in her case, her studies. As I watched her enthusiastically order product after product, I couldn't help but feel a pang of concern. Was she prepared for the potential financial strain, not to mention the impact on her student life? I hoped she'd think twice before investing too much.
