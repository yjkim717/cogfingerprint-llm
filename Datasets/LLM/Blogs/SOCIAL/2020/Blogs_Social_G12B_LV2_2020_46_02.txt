## The Weight of the Scroll

It’s 2020, and honestly, the internet feels… heavy sometimes. I find myself getting unexpectedly frustrated by comments, by debates that go nowhere, by the sheer volume of *everything*. It’s not always a big thing, just a low-level hum of annoyance. I wonder if we're all just a little more frayed around the edges these days, and it’s spilling out online. Maybe a little digital detox is in order.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Expansion:**

*   **"The Weight of the Scroll"**:  A metaphorical title to evoke the feeling of being weighed down.
*   **2020 Context**: The mention of "2020" subtly acknowledges the heightened stress and anxiety of that year (pandemic, social unrest, etc.), making the frustration feel more understandable.
*   **Conversational Tone:** Short sentences, relatable language ("a little more frayed around the edges").
*   **Open Ending:** Suggesting a digital detox leaves room for reader reflection and potential discussion.
*   **Possible Expansion:**  You could add a specific (but anonymized) example of an online interaction that triggered the feeling, or delve deeper into *why* the author thinks people are behaving this way.
