It’s 2020, and I’m scrolling through my phone when a message pops up from Sarah, a friend from church. We haven’t spoken in months, but she’s bubbly, asking how I’m doing—then pivots to Arbonne. She’s selling skincare now, she says, and it’s changed her life. But as a student, I can’t help but worry: how is she affording all those starter kits?

Her Instagram is suddenly flooded with posts about “financial freedom” and building a “downline.” Every chat circles back to recruiting. It feels less like a business and more like a plea. I remember her sharing dreams of paying off loans, not pitching protein shakes.

Seeing someone you care about dive headfirst into an MLM during a pandemic year is tough. You want to support them, but you also see the red flags. I hope she finds her way, but for now, I’m keeping my wallet—and my concerns—close.
