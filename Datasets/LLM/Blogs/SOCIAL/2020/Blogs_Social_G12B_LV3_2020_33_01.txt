## The Ghosts in My Trophy Case

Anyone else feel a pang of digital sadness when they think about older games? I do. Lately, I've been revisiting some classics, chasing that sweet, sweet platinum trophy. But then reality hits. Remember when *[insert popular online game from 2020]* was *the* game? Now, its servers are silent, and that online trophy feels… permanently out of reach.

It’s frustrating! We pour hours into these games, striving for 100% completion, only to have a crucial achievement vanish because the online community moved on. Shouldn't there be a way to acknowledge these achievements, perhaps categorize them separately, so a platinum isn't forever haunted by the ghosts of defunct servers? Just a thought from a frustrated, but still hopeful, trophy hunter. Anyone else share this feeling?
