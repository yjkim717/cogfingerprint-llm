## The Upgrade Dilemma & the Unexpected Pause

Remember 2020? The year everything screeched to a halt. For me, it wasn't just toilet paper shortages â€“ it was a PC build paralysis. I was finally going to upgrade my aging laptop, aiming for a gaming rig that could also handle the mountain of online classes and assignments. Intel or AMD? The forums were a warzone.

Honestly, the whole process felt symbolic. I was chasing performance, wanting something *more*, when the world was teaching me the value of just *being*. The endless specs became less important than, well, surviving. I eventually pulled the trigger on an AMD build (Ryzen 5, no regrets!), but the experience taught me a valuable lesson: sometimes, the biggest upgrade isn't in your hardware, but in your perspective.
