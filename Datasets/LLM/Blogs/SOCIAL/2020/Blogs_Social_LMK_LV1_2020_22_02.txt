The Invisible Struggle: Living with Chronic Migraines in 2020

As I sit here, typing away on my phone with a heating pad wrapped around my neck, I'm reminded of the countless times I've been asked, "But you're fine, right?" or "Can't you just take some medicine for it?" by well-meaning friends and family. The truth is, chronic migraines are a constant companion, one that I've learned to live with but not one that I've learned to control.

In a world where productivity is king, it's hard to explain to others that just because I'm still functioning, doesn't mean I'm not in pain. The debilitating headaches, the sensitivity to light and sound, the nausea that lingers long after the pain has subsided â€“ it's all too real. And yet, so many people seem to think that if I'm still going about my daily life, I must be "better." But the reality is, I'm just getting by, one pain management technique at a time. It's time we start to understand and acknowledge the invisible struggles of those living with chronic illnesses like mine.
