As I navigated the world of online language learning in 2020, I stumbled upon a treasure trove of Korean textbooks. With the rise of social media, it's never been easier to discover new study resources. I was on the hunt for an all-in-one textbook that could be my sole companion on this language journey. After weeks of searching, I finally found "Integrated Korean" and "Master Korean" - comprehensive guides that included exercises, audio clips, and clear explanations. Paired with "Vitamin Korean", which offers bite-sized grammar lessons, I'm confident I'll be chatting with Koreans in no time!
