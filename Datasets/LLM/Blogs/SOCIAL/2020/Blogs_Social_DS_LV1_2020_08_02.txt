It was March 2020, and the world had turned inward. My only constant companion was my cat, Jasper. So when he suddenly became lethargic, refusing food and showing signs of vomiting, my already-heightened anxiety went into overdrive. A trip to the emergency vet felt impossible, a terrifying risk in the early days of the pandemic.

Armed with advice from a frantic online search, I tried a desperate remedy: I made a weak, unflavored broth from a bit of chicken, hoping the scent and hydration would lure him. For two days, I was his nurse, watching him sleep, my heart sinking with every quiet hour. The world outside was chaotic, but our small apartment became a vigil.

Then, on the third morning, he nudged my hand. It was a small gesture, but it was everything. In a time of overwhelming helplessness, caring for him gave me a purpose. It was a stark reminder that even when the world feels like it's ending, the most important things are often the small acts of care right in front of you.
