>## That Book, and the Things We Carry

It's funny the things that stick with you. I was scrolling through a forum the other day, someone asking about a childhood book – a character literally burying an axe head into their leg as a sort of… coping mechanism? Wild, right? It struck a chord. 

I remember reading something similar in elementary school. It was part of a larger project, analyzing symbolism. Honestly, I don't remember the plot, just that image. It felt *heavy*. 

2020 has been a year of carrying a lot. We're all burying metaphorical axes into our legs, aren’t we? Dealing with anxiety, loss, uncertainty... maybe not literally, but finding ways to anchor ourselves to a reality that feels increasingly unstable. That strange, unsettling image from a forgotten book keeps circling back, a little echo of a feeling I understand all too well now.
