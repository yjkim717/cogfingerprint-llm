**The Unexpected Storm on Discord**

It feels a little strange writing about this now, but 2020 was… a lot. We were all trying to navigate a world that felt perpetually uncertain, and honestly, our family was no different. We found solace in the little digital pockets we had – Discord, mostly – just trying to connect amidst the chaos. 

I remember one evening, a seemingly innocuous photo popped up on our server. It was my 16-year-old brother, Liam. He’s autistic, and honestly, he’s brilliant in so many ways, but social situations can be incredibly challenging for him.  The photo triggered a cascade. A sharp reaction from my dad, a tense silence, and then – a full-blown verbal argument.

It wasn’t about the photo itself, really. It was about frustration, about feeling unheard, about the struggle to understand how to best support Liam. I watched, feeling a knot tighten in my stomach, realizing how easily good intentions could turn into hurtful words. 

It was a brutal reminder that even with the best of intentions, communication – especially when navigating neurodiversity – is *so* fragile.  It forced a difficult medication discussion, something we’d been putting off. 

Looking back, it was a messy, painful night. But it also highlighted the importance of patience, empathy, and a willingness to truly listen, even when it’s hard.  Anyone else have experiences like this? Let’s talk about it.
