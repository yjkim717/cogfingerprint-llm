### The Human Cost Behind the Troll

It was in the thick of the 2020 lockdown that I finally lost my cool. For weeks, my Twitter timeline had been a sewer. A particularly nasty IT cell brigade had latched onto a post I’d made about secular values, and the response was a deluge of pure venom. They weren’t just arguing; they were launching deeply personal, economic attacks. “Your career is finished,” one read. “No company will hire a anti-national like you,” said another.

My first instinct was to fire back with facts, to debunk their fake news with links and screenshots. It was like trying to put out a fire with a squirt gun. The paid media echo chamber had already done its job, and their narrative was set in stone. I felt powerless, and honestly, a little scared.

Then, I stumbled upon one of the trolls’ public profiles. It wasn’t a faceless, hate-spewing account, but a young man from a small town. His feed was a bizarre mix of aggressive political memes and desperate posts looking for freelance data entry work. In that moment, the abstract concept of “trolling” snapped into a heartbreakingly clear picture.

I replied to him, but not with an argument. I simply asked, “Bro, how much are they paying you to do this?”

The reply was swift and shocking in its honesty. “300 rupees per 100 tweets. It’s something while I look for a job.”

The anger drained out of me, replaced by a heavy sadness. Here I was, a salaried professional with job security, enraged by a kid trying to earn the equivalent of four dollars to get by in an economy in freefall. The ecosystem is far more complex than good vs. evil. The puppeteers—the political strategists and the complicit media—are the real villains, weaponizing the desperation of the unemployed.

I didn’t “win” that argument. I just stopped participating. I realized that fighting the puppet is exhausting and futile. The real battle is against the puppeteer, and that requires a clarity that sees the human being behind the hateful avatar. Sometimes, the most powerful counter is not a fact-check, but a moment of painful, uncomfortable empathy.
