## The Sims and the Slow Fade of Fun

It's 2020, and my Sims folder is overflowing. I've owned The Sims for *years*, yet lately, booting it up feels…meh. I find myself watching gameplay on YouTube more than actually *playing*. Is there a point? Can you even "win" The Sims? I’m genuinely curious if anyone else has felt this slow fade of engagement with a beloved game, and if so, how you rekindled the spark. Send help (and Sims tips)!
