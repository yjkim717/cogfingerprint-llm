"The Catchy Tune That Got Away"

As I binge-watched a documentary on Netflix one evening in 2020, I found myself tapping my foot to an infectious techno beat. The melody was catchy, and I couldn't help but wonder where I'd heard it before. It wasn't until the credits rolled that I realized the song was actually a sample from the documentary's soundtrack. I was determined to identify the original track, but it was on the tip of my tongue. I turned to social media, posting a snippet of the song on Twitter and asking my followers if they recognized it. The responses were mixed, with some suggesting similar artists, but none quite matching the tune. As I continued to scroll through my feeds, I realized that the internet can be both a blessing and a curse - it's easy to get lost in the noise, but it's also a powerful tool for uncovering hidden gems.
