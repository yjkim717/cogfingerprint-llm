**The Ghosts in the Grain**

It’s funny how certain images just…stick. I was scrolling through old film clips the other day – a random rabbit hole of 60s and 70s cinema – and I was hit with this incredibly haunting memory. A black and white shot, really. Just a child, small and utterly alone, wandering through the rubble of a bombed-out city. 

It felt like something out of Tarkovsky, that sense of fractured time and profound loss.  I can’t place the film, but the feeling remains.  It’s a reminder, in 2020, that even amidst the constant stream of information and digital noise, the echoes of the past – and the weight of collective trauma – still find a way to surface.  Do you have a film that just *stays* with you?

Do you want me to tweak this in any way (e.g., adjust the tone, add more specific details, or change the focus)?
