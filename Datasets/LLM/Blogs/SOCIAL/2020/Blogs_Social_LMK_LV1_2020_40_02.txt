**Taking My Truth into Our New Chapter**

As I sat amidst the chaos of half-packed boxes and uncertain futures, I couldn't help but feel a familiar knot in my stomach. It's 2020, and I'm finally moving in with my partner â€“ a milestone I've been dreaming of for what feels like an eternity. But amidst the excitement, my mind is racing with worries. How will my struggles with depression and an eating disorder impact our life together?

To be honest, it's a fear that's been lingering in the shadows for a while now. I've always been open with my partner about my mental health, and he's been my rock through the ups and downs. Still, the thought of sharing a space, a daily routine, and a life with him makes me anxious. What if my dark days become his burden too? What if my eating disorder triggers resurface, and I struggle to cope in our new home?

As I reflect on these concerns, I'm reminded that my partner has been supportive from day one. He's seen me at my worst and still chooses to be with me. Moving in together is a new chapter, not just for us, but for my mental health journey too. I'm learning to be kinder to myself, to acknowledge that my struggles are a part of me, but they don't define our relationship.

It's time to take a deep breath, be vulnerable, and trust that together, we can navigate the ups and downs. Our love is strong enough to hold my truth, and I'm ready to take this next step, together.
