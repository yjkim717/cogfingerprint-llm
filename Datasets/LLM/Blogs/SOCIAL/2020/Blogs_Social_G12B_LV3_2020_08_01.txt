>## The Weight of Goodbye: Navigating Grief and a Difficult Choice

It’s a strange thing, isn’t it? How grief can arrive in so many forms, often when we least expect it. Recently, a family member shared something incredibly difficult: my grandfather has decided to pursue assisted death. It’s a choice I understand, intellectually, but emotionally… it’s a tangled mess.

There’s sadness, of course, a deep ache for the future moments we won’t share. But layered within that is a complicated feeling, a whisper of resentment perhaps, for a goodbye that feels so… deliberate. 

This time feels precious, fragile. How do you truly *be* present with someone when you’re also wrestling with such profound emotions? I’m trying to focus on listening, on sharing stories, on simply *being* – even when it’s hard. It’s a lesson in grace, in acceptance, and in the messy, beautiful reality of loss.
