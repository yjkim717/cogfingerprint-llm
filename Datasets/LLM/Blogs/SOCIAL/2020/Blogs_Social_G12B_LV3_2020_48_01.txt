Okay, here's a blog post inspired by the summary and keywords, written in a reflective, conversational tone, and set within the 2020 context. I've aimed for a ~369 word count.

## The Boston House, the Seattle Job, and the Future We’re Building (Slowly)

It’s 2020. Need I say more? The world feels…shifted. And I’m feeling it too, especially when it comes to big decisions. I’m a software engineer, based in Seattle now, but I own a house in Boston. A house that, thanks to a frankly ridiculous run-up in the housing market, has appreciated *a lot*. Like, enough to make my head spin.

The question swirling in my brain? Should I sell?

It’s not a simple yes or no. It’s layered with so many anxieties and uncertainties, amplified by the general weirdness of this year. Back in 2018, when I bought it, the plan was simple: a pied-à-terre, a connection to my East Coast roots, a potential rental property down the line. Now? Well, now the job market in Boston feels…stuck. Opportunities are scarcer than a decent sourdough starter during the early days of the pandemic.

And then there’s the remote work question. I’m incredibly fortunate to be able to work remotely, and I *love* the flexibility. But who knows what the future holds? Will companies continue to embrace fully remote teams? Will I? It feels irresponsible to base a major financial decision on a “maybe.”

Honestly, the thought of selling feels both exciting and terrifying. Exciting because of the potential financial freedom – the ability to invest, travel (when that’s a thing again!), and build a more secure future. Terrifying because it feels like letting go of a piece of myself, of my past. Plus, the housing market is… well, it’s a beast. Selling in this climate feels like navigating a minefield.

I find myself spending hours scrolling through Zillow, not looking at houses *to buy*, but obsessing over what I *could* get if I sold. It's a ridiculous exercise in future-gazing.

More than the financial aspect, I'm wrestling with the bigger picture. What kind of life do I want to build? Do I want to be tied to a specific location, or do I want the freedom to chase opportunities wherever they may be? It feels like this house, this decision, is a microcosm of the larger choices we’re all making about our careers, our finances, and our futures in this strange, shifting world.

It's slow going, this process of reflection. But I know, eventually, I’ll have to make a call. And when I do, I’ll try to do so with as much clarity and intention as possible.
