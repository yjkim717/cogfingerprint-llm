Navigating crushes in 2020 was its own special challenge. I’d been texting this girl from another state for months—our late-night video calls were the highlight of lockdown life. But the distance made everything feel fragile. What if I confessed my feelings and she just saw me as a pandemic pen pal? The "friend zone" felt like a real possibility when you couldn’t even meet for coffee. Still, I decided honesty was better than endless guessing games. Taking that leap was scary, but living with "what if" felt even lonelier.
