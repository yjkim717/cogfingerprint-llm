**The Book That Marked Us**

Remember that dog-eared book from your childhood, the one with a scene so vivid it’s etched into your memory forever? For me, it was a story about a boy—I can’t recall the title—who, in a moment of pure, misguided ambition, tried to swing an axe like a grown-up. The inevitable happened; he gashed his leg. In 2020, stuck at home, that memory hit me hard. It wasn't just about the axe. It was a metaphor for the year. We all charged into something new and daunting, and we all got a little hurt, collectively. That shared, formative “injury” of navigating a pandemic, I realized, is the main character in all our stories now. We’re all healing from the same strange wound.
