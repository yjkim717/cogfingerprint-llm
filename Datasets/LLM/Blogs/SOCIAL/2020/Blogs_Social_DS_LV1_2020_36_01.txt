### The Knight Bus and the Weakening of 2020

I never thought a magical triple-decker bus would teach me how to survive 2020.

Back in March, when the world first went into lockdown, I, like many, felt a profound sense of powerlessness. The news cycle was a relentless **Confusion Hex**, scrambling my thoughts and making it impossible to **focus**. I’d start a work project, then fall down a rabbit hole of anxiety, then try to bake banana bread, accomplishing nothing. My mental energy was constantly in the red.

Then, my nephew got me into a mobile game, *Harry Potter: Wizards Unite*. It was a silly distraction at first, but its central cooperative gameplay—battling dark wizards on the **Knight Bus**—became an unexpected metaphor for my year.

In the game, as an Auror, your job is to take down the most dangerous foes. But you can’t just spam powerful spells. You have to manage a limited resource called Focus. You start with a little, and you get more by defeating easy enemies or from teammates. The smart play isn’t to immediately launch a high-power charm; it’s to use that first bit of Focus to cast a **Weakening Hex** on the most terrifying enemy on the battlefield. You don’t defeat it yourself right away—you make it less dangerous for *everyone*.

And that’s when it hit me. I was trying to fight the dragon of 2020 head-on with my own depleted energy. I was trying to solve global pandemics, political strife, and my own isolation all at once, and I was losing badly.

So, I started applying the "Weakening Hex" strategy to my life. I stopped trying to tackle everything. Instead, I identified what was causing me the most acute stress—the endless scroll of doom on Twitter—and I **weakened** it. I deleted the app from my phone. I didn’t solve the world’s problems, but I made my own battlefield less hazardous.

I used my "Focus Charm" on small, manageable things. A weekly video call with friends became my version of a strategic buff. Finishing a single chapter of a book was a defeated enemy, giving me a tiny bit of Focus back. I learned that you don't have to single-handedly win the war. Sometimes, the most powerful thing you can do is weaken the big threat and trust that your community—your team on the Knight Bus—is working alongside you.

2020 was a year of collective battles. We all faced different foes, from loneliness to loss to fear. The lesson I’m taking forward isn’t about being the most powerful wizard in the room. It’s about smart, supportive action. Manage your focus, weaken the big threats where you can, and remember you’re not riding the bus alone. It’s the only way any of us get through the journey.
