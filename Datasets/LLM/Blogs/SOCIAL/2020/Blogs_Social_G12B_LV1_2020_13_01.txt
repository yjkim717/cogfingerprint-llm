## The Smile That Matters Most

It’s funny, isn't it, how something as seemingly superficial as teeth can carry so much weight? Especially for a kid. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with that, trying to navigate a tricky situation with my foster son, Liam.

Liam’s got this amazing, goofy grin, but his teeth… well, they need some serious work. Crowded, a little crooked – the whole nine yards. He’s started getting self-conscious, which breaks my heart. He used to flash that grin without a second thought.

We're covered by state insurance, which is a blessing, truly. But orthodontics? Nope. Not on the list. And private care? Forget about it. Being a foster parent doesn’t exactly come with a limitless budget.

I’ve been scouring the internet, calling local dental schools, desperately searching for a pro bono orthodontist. It feels like a huge ask, another hurdle in a system that’s already… complicated. 2020 has been a year of unexpected challenges for everyone, and this just feels like another one piled on.

More than just straightened teeth, I want Liam to feel confident, to love his smile. It's a small thing, maybe, but it matters. It *really* matters. And I'm not giving up until I find a way to help him shine.
