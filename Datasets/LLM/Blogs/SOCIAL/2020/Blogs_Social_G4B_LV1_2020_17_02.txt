Okay, here’s a blog post draft inspired by the Reddit user’s experience, written in a conversational style and set in 2020:

**The Sound of… Everything**

Okay, so 2020 was *weird*, right? Everyone was glued to their screens, and I was spiraling. It started with this really unsettling noise – a sort of wet, croaking sound after I ate. I started obsessing, convinced it was a “noburp,” and honestly, the thought sent me into a full-blown anxiety spiral. 

I’m not exactly a foodie, and the constant worry about my digestion was exhausting. It felt like I was constantly listening for gurgles and trying to suppress any little rumble.  I even looked into Botox – desperate for a quick fix, I know! – but it just felt…wrong. 

It’s funny how a tiny, internal sound can trigger such a huge reaction.  I’m still working on it, but just acknowledging the anxiety instead of fighting it has helped a little.  Anyone else ever feel like their body is broadcasting a secret they don’t want to hear?
