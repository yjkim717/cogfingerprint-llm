As I sat with my grandfather in his living room in early 2020, he revealed a decision that left me speechless: he was planning his assisted death. I felt a mix of emotions - sadness, anger, and resentment. How could he choose to leave us so suddenly? As I grappled with his decision, I realized that his choice forced me to confront my own fears and grief. It made me question how I'd cope with the loss and how our family would heal. His autonomy sparked a painful introspection, one that I'm still navigating.
