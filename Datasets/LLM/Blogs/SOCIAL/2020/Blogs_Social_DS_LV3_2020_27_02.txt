The rumble of the diesel engine is a constant companion, but my mind keeps drifting home. After a year of residential deliveries, the open road calls with the promise of a CDL’s higher pay. Yet, the thought of weeks away from my family is a heavy load to carry. I’m searching for that sweet spot—a trucking route that lets me chase the horizon but still pull into my own driveway each night. Is that balance even possible in 2020? Fellow drivers, what’s your advice?
