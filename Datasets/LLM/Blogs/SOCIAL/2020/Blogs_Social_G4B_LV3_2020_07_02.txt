**Finding My Anchor in 2020**

Honestly, 2020 felt… chaotic. The world was shifting beneath our feet, and it was easy to get swept away by the anxiety. I realized I was scrolling endlessly, comparing myself to everyone’s ‘perfect’ lockdown life, and feeling worse about *my* life. 

That’s when I started building a tiny, personal routine. It wasn't about massive transformations, just simple things: a quick workout video, mindful meals, and actually putting my phone down.  

It sounds small, but it became my anchor. Focusing on my own well-being – my mental health, my fitness, my daily habits – actually gave me the motivation to face the uncertainty.  It wasn’t about being ‘better’; it was about feeling *grounded*.  And if you’re struggling to find your footing this year, maybe start with one small, consistent step for yourself.
