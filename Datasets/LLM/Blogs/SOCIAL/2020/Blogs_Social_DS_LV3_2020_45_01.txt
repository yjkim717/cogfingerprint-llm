It’s 2020, and my home has become my office, my gym, my sanctuary—and honestly, it started to blur together. I found myself in pajamas at 3 p.m., feeling like I was always "on." Then, I returned to my old morning ritual: getting dressed as if I were heading out. It sounds simple, but it created a boundary. That small act shifted my mindset, carving out space for work and, just as importantly, for life after. Now, when I change at day’s end, I truly clock out—finding balance in a world that suddenly shrank to four walls.
