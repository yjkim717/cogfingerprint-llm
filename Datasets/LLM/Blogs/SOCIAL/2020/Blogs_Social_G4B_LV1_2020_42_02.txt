Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by your summary, aiming for a conversational tone and around 208 words, set in 2020:

**That Look – And the Weight of It**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a single glance can just… stick with you? I was working at the bookstore last month, a quiet Tuesday evening, and a guy came in. He was carrying a handgun, openly. Not in a cool, “I’m prepared” way. Just… casually slung over his shoulder. 

Honestly, I was more struck by his eyes. There was a weariness there, a kind of frantic energy, and something else I couldn’t quite place.  The store manager immediately called security, and as they were escorting him out, I overheard a snippet of information – a past arrest, a history with drug-related offenses. 

Suddenly, the simple act of carrying a gun felt less like a statement and more like a weight. A weight of potential, of risk, of a life carrying a lot. I’ve been reading a lot about social anxiety lately, and it hit me in that moment – how easily we judge, how quickly we categorize. 

It made me think about the ways we react to people who seem ‘different,’ who carry visible signs of struggle.  It’s 2020, and we’re all carrying our own burdens, our own anxieties.  Maybe, just maybe, a little empathy could go a long way.  It’s a thought I’ve been carrying ever since.
