It’s 2020, and I’ve learned the hard way that not all that glitters is gold—or in this case, not all carts are legit. I grabbed a cheap one from some sketchy brand, thinking I’d save a few bucks. Big mistake. No buzz, just a pounding headache that stuck around for hours.

It got me thinking: in a year full of uncertainty, it’s tempting to cut corners, but authenticity matters. Whether it’s connections with people or what we choose to consume, shortcuts often leave us empty. Now, I stick to the real deal—natural bud and genuine relationships. Sometimes the old ways are the best ways.
