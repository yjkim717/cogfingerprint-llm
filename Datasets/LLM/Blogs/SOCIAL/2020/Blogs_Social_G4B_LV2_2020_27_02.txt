**Scrolling Through a Different Kind of Route**

Remember 2020? Everything felt… paused, right? I spent a lot of time scrolling, feeling that weird disconnect. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a big “what if,” a thought sparked by a friend talking about a career change – specifically, trucking. The idea of hauling packages, especially residential routes, felt surprisingly appealing. It’s a different kind of journey than my usual online wanderings. 

Suddenly, the digital world felt a little small.  I’m wondering if there’s a way to build a more tangible path, a route that actually *means* something.  Anyone else ever feel that pull toward a completely new direction?
