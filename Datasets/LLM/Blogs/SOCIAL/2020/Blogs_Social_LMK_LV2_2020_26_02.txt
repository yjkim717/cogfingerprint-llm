I recall a particularly frustrating experience on Google Classroom when a student marked assignments as complete without uploading the actual work. It was a stark reminder of the struggles of remote learning. As I navigated this issue, I realized that it wasn't just about the technology, but about understanding student behavior and adapting my teaching strategies to meet their needs.
