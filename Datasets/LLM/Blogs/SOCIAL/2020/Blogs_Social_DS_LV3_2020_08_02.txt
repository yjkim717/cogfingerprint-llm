The first time my cat, Mochi, got sick in the spring of 2020, my world shrank to the four walls of my apartment. It was just the two of us, navigating a strange, silent world outside. When the **vomiting** started, followed by terrible **diarrhea**, a cold fear gripped me. He became so **lethargic**, just a limp little loaf curled on the rug, and my heart ached. A trip to the vet wasn't as simple as it used to be, so I felt utterly alone with my worry.

I remembered the vet once saying that when pets are sick, getting them to drink is half the battle. So I tried a trick I’d read online: I offered him tiny bowls of tuna-flavored **water**. He was too weak to lap much, but he’d take a few tentative licks. I spent that entire night on the floor beside him, my phone light casting long shadows, just watching his sides rise and fall. In that quiet vigil, I realized this tiny, vulnerable **cat** was my entire social circle, my responsibility, my family. Caring for him through that scary night was a powerful lesson in love and presence, a quiet anchor in a year that felt utterly unmoored.
