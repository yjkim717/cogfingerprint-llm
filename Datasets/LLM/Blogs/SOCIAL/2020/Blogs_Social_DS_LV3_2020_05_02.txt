You know that feeling when a random scent or sound unlocks a memory you forgot you had? That happened to me today. I was playing *Rocket League* online with friends in 2020, and suddenly, I was a kid in 1996 again.

I remembered this wild game—maybe a forgotten *Diablo*-like mod?—where you used tethers to grab a ball and clothesline other players. It was chaotic, hilarious, and ahead of its time. But for the life of me, I can’t remember its name.

It’s funny how these digital ghosts stick with us. Even now, in a world of hyper-realistic graphics, it’s that fuzzy, half-remembered joy that connects us—not just to games, but to who we were. Anyone else have a game that haunts them?
