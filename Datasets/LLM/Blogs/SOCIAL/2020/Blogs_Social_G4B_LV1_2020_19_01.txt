**The Echo Chamber & Empty Plates**

Honestly, 2020 felt… intense. The internet was a battlefield, and I found myself caught in a particularly frustrating corner of it. I started getting drawn into arguments with people identifying as part of an “IT cell” – you know, the online teams pushing a specific narrative. Mostly on Twitter. 

It quickly became clear they weren’t interested in reasoned debate. It was more… a sustained effort to chip away at your confidence. A relentless barrage of accusations, dismissals, and frankly, some pretty nasty personal attacks. I felt like I was constantly being ‘trolled,’ but it felt less like a prank and more like a calculated strategy.

What really started to stick with me, though, was observing *why* this was happening. These weren't sophisticated strategists; many of them were young, clearly struggling, and deeply insecure. It struck me that a lot of their energy was fueled by a desperate need to feel validated, to be part of something, and maybe, just maybe, to escape the realities of poverty and lack of opportunity. 

It wasn’t justification for their behavior, of course. But it shifted my perspective. It made me realize that behind the carefully crafted online personas, there were just people, trying to find their place in a world that often feels incredibly lonely.  It was a strange, uncomfortable lesson in the human cost of online conflict.
