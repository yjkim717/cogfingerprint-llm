>## Finding My Ground (and My Gains) at Home

2020 has been… a lot, hasn’t it? For me, it felt like everything was shifting, and I was struggling to find my footing. The constant news cycle, the isolation – it all took a toll. I realized I needed to reclaim *something*, something I could control. 

That's when I stumbled back into fitness. Not a hardcore gym routine, mind you, but simple at-home workouts – a few YouTube videos, some bodyweight exercises. Alongside that, I started making small changes to my eating, focusing on more whole foods. 

It hasn’t been a dramatic transformation, but the subtle shifts have been huge. I feel more energized, more grounded, and honestly, a little more hopeful. It's been a quiet, personal fitness journey, fueled by a desire for self-improvement. And if my little corner of the internet can inspire even one person to prioritize their well-being during these strange times, then that’s a win in my book. We're all in this together, right?
