## The Soap Didn’t Quite Wash It Away

2020. Right? What a year. I feel like we're all collectively holding our breath, waiting for something – anything – to shift. For me, a lot of that shift has been inward.  I've found myself staring into a mirror, not just at my face, but at… everything. The anxieties, the disappointments, even the tiny joys. It’s been a relentless excavation.

There's been a strange numbness, too. Like a protective layer I didn’t even realize I’d built. The constant churn of news, the isolation, the sheer *weirdness* of it all… it’s easy to just… disconnect. To go through the motions. To feel… muted.

I’ve been thinking a lot about cleansing lately. Not just the literal kind – the obsessive handwashing we've all been doing (guilty!). But a deeper kind of cleansing. Trying to scrub away the residue of past mistakes, the weight of expectations, the lingering sadness.

It reminded me of those transparent soaps you see. The ones where you can see right through them. You think they’ll wash everything away, reveal a pristine surface underneath. But sometimes, you realize the dirt just swirls around, suspended within the clear bar. It’s still *there*, just… visible. 

And maybe that’s the point, isn't it? Maybe the goal isn't to erase the past or pretend the hard things haven't happened. Maybe it's about seeing them, really *seeing* them, and understanding how they shaped us.  Acknowledging the scars, the swirling sediment, and accepting that they're part of the landscape of who we are.

It’s not easy.  Some days I feel like I’m drowning in the clarity. But other days, I see a flicker of something else – resilience, maybe. A quiet strength in the face of the ongoing uncertainty.  And that, I think, is worth holding onto.

What about you? What have you been seeing in your own reflections lately?
