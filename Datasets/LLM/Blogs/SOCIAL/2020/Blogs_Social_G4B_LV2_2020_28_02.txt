**Scrolling Through a Screen Full of “Perfect”**

Remember 2020? Everyone was hyper-curated online. Instagram felt like a highlight reel of flawless vacations and impossibly good food. I spent way too long scrolling, comparing my messy apartment and half-finished sourdough to everyone else’s seemingly perfect lives. 

It hit me – those were just *moments*, captured and presented a certain way. Building my first PC felt real, a tangible step forward. It wasn’t about impressing anyone; it was about *me*.  Maybe disconnecting a little then – and still now – is the best social media detox of all.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a post with a different focus?
