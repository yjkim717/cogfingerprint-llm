## Remember When We All Cried Watching Sokka and Hakoda? (Seriously.)

2020… what a year, right? We all needed a little escape, and for so many of us, that escape was *Avatar: The Last Airbender*. I’ve been revisiting it lately, and wow, the emotional scenes *hit* differently now. 

Specifically, the moments between Sokka and Hakoda? Forget about it! That reunion, the vulnerability...

It reminded me that even amidst chaos, family – whether by blood or by choice – is what truly matters. Anyone else feeling the feels? Let's talk!
