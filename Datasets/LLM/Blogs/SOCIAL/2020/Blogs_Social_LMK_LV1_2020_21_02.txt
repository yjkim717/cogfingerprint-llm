"Unraveling the Mystery of RMS Voltage: A Physics Student's Journey"

As I sat in my Electricity and Magnetism class in 2020, I found myself tangled in a web of confusion. We were discussing AC voltage, and I was struggling to understand why my multimeter and oscilloscope were giving different readings. My professor mentioned something about RMS voltage, but I wasn't convinced. I thought to myself, "Why can't I just get a straightforward answer?" It wasn't until I took a step back and dug deeper that the mystery unraveled. I realized that my multimeter was measuring the RMS voltage, while my oscilloscope was showing the peak voltage. The pieces clicked into place, and I finally grasped the concept. Reflecting on this experience, I realized that sometimes, confusion can be a catalyst for growth. By embracing the uncertainty, I gained a deeper understanding of the subject and developed a more nuanced appreciation for the complexities of electricity and magnetism.
