## The Quiet Panic of a Sick Kitty (and a Reminder to Breathe)

2020. Need I say more? It felt like the world was collectively holding its breath. And then, last week, my little Leo decided to add to the anxiety. He was…off. Lethargic, refusing his favorite salmon pate, and then…well, let's just say the living room needed a *lot* of cleaning.

My immediate reaction was pure, unadulterated panic. Food poisoning? Was it something I fed him? I spiraled, naturally, Googling frantically, convinced he was on death's door.  My partner gently reminded me to breathe, suggesting small sips of flavored water (apparently, it can help settle things). 

We just monitored him, offering the water and a lot of quiet cuddles. Slowly, painstakingly, he started to bounce back.  It was a small victory, a tiny pocket of normalcy in a year that felt anything but. 

It reminded me that even when the world feels chaotic, sometimes the best thing you can do is focus on the small, immediate things – and maybe keep a roll of paper towels handy.  Anyone else finding solace in the simple routines amidst all this?
