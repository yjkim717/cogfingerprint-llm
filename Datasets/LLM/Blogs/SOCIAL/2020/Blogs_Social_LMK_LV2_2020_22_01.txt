"Beyond 'Thank You': How Civilians Can Truly Support Nurses During COVID-19"

As I scrolled through my social media feed in the spring of 2020, I saw post after post expressing gratitude to nurses on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. While I appreciated the sentiment, I couldn't help but wonder: what can we, as civilians, do beyond saying "thank you"? The clap for healthcare workers was heartwarming, but it's not enough. As a community, we need to think beyond gestures and consider tangible ways to support our nursing heroes.

Proper PPE is still in short supply, and nursing staff are still overworked and exhausted. So, what can you do? Donate to reputable organizations providing COVID-19 relief, offer to help with errands or household chores for a nurse in your life, or simply follow public health guidelines to reduce the spread of the virus. Every small act counts, and for nurses, it's a reminder that they're not alone.
