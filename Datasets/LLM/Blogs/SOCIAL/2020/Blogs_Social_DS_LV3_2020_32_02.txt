It’s 2020, and I’m standing in front of my closet, staring at a pair of jeans I haven’t worn in months. They’re just jeans—faded, comfortable, nothing special. But as I pull them on, my mind starts racing. What will people think if I wear these on my next Zoom call? Are they too casual? Too dated? Too… me?

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something as simple as getting dressed can feel like a performance. I remember a friend once telling me, unprompted, that I should “try brighter colors” to look more approachable. Another time, a relative remarked that my love for sci-fi novels was “unexpected” for someone in my line of work. At first, these comments felt harmless, like raindrops. But over time, they collected into a puddle of doubt I couldn’t step around.

In a year when the world slowed down, you’d think the pressure to perform would ease. But if anything, 2020 magnified it. Our homes became our stages, and every video call felt like a new opportunity to be judged—for our backgrounds, our appearance, even the mugs we drank from. I found myself second-guessing my choices, tailoring my interests and style to fit some invisible, ever-shifting standard.

But here’s what I’ve started to realize: those unsolicited opinions say more about the giver than they do about me. My faded jeans? They tell a story of lazy Sundays and long walks. My dog-eared sci-fi books? They’re portals to galaxies where judgment doesn’t exist. Our personal expression isn’t meant to be a crowd-pleaser—it’s a love letter to ourselves.

So, I kept the jeans on for that call. And you know what? No one noticed. Or if they did, they didn’t care. And in that small, quiet victory, I reclaimed a little piece of the self-esteem I’d let slip away. Because being yourself—without apology—is the most radical act of all.
