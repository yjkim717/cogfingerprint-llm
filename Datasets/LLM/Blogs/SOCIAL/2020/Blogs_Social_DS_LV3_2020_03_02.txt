The aroma of collard greens and black-eyed peas filled our kitchen this MLK Day, a tradition my partner and I cherish. But as a white couple simmering a pot of soul food, I paused, spoon in hand. Was our heartfelt tribute crossing into cultural appropriation?

In 2020, as conversations on racial sensitivity deepened, I realized it’s not just about the food—it’s the reverence behind it. We’re learning to honor the roots, not just recipes, understanding that appreciation means respecting the struggle and history woven into each dish. It’s a delicate balance, one that asks us to listen more than we speak.
