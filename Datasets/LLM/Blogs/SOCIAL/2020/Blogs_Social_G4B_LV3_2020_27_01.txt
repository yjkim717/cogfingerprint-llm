**The Quiet Yearnings of Twenty-Something**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020 felt like everyone was shouting – protests, anxieties, a general sense of upheaval. But amidst all that noise, I found myself strangely drawn to a quiet kind of yearning. I’m 21, drowning in student loans and the relentless pressure of ‘making it,’ and honestly, the thought of a simpler life felt radical.

The housing market felt impossible, a constant reminder of my financial struggle.  I started thinking about minimalism – not as deprivation, but as a way to reclaim control.  A neighbor-free existence felt like a sanctuary, a space to breathe without the constant hum of social expectation. It’s a lonely thought, admitting you crave a little distance, but maybe that’s just the price of trying to navigate debt and build a foundation, one mindful step at a time.
