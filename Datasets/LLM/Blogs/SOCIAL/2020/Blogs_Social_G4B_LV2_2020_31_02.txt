**The “Just Asking” Question**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we slip into assuming everyone wants the same things in the bedroom. I was talking to a friend recently, and he confessed he’s… uncomfortable with anal sex. Not a judgment, just a *feeling*. It sparked this whole thought: how do you even *ask* about these things when dating in 2020? 

I’ve definitely had moments where I’ve wondered if my preferences were “weird,” especially when considering hookup culture.  It’s brave to be honest about desires, and I’m realizing a lot of us are just quietly navigating different rhythms – and that’s okay.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps create a version focused on a specific angle (like relationship dynamics)?
