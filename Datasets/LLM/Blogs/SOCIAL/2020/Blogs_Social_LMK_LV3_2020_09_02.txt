"As I dove into the world of financial strategy in 2020, I stumbled upon Ray Poteet's unconventional approach to wealth management. He leveraged life insurance policies to build wealth, using loans and death benefits to his advantage. This 'infinite banking' concept, popularized by Nelson Nash, resonated with me. It made me realize that with the right strategy, life insurance can be more than just a safety net - it can be a powerful tool for achieving financial freedom. I began to rethink my own financial plans and explore this innovative approach."
