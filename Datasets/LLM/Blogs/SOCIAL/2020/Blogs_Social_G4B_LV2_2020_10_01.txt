**The Quiet Rhythm of a Different Kind of Connection**

It’s strange, isn’t it? How we all started reaching for our phones a little *too* much in 2020. Scrolling, liking, comparing… it felt like the only way to stay connected when everything else felt so distant. But I found myself craving something… slower. 

Recently, I’ve been completely absorbed in bread making – specifically, trying to coax wild yeast to life in a tiny village in rural Vietnam. It’s a ridiculously long process, five days of patient waiting, observing, and trusting. It's humbling, really. 

I’m emailing back and forth with a baker there, sharing tips and struggling alongside him. There’s a beautiful simplicity to it, a connection built not through notifications, but through shared challenges and a mutual respect for the natural rhythms of fermentation. 

It’s made me think about how much we miss when we’re glued to our screens. Sometimes, the most profound connections are found in the quietest moments, in the slow bloom of something real.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps explore a slightly different angle?
