The humid air of rural Vietnam clung to my skin as I stirred the flour and water mixture for what felt like the hundredth time. It was 2020, and my small mission—to capture wild yeast from this very air and create a sourdough starter to bake bread for my neighbors—felt increasingly impossible. Each morning, I’d check the jar, hoping for the telltale bubbles of fermentation, but it remained stubbornly inert.

I’d followed all the rules: consistent feeding, filtered water, a warm spot near the window. Yet, the living culture I dreamed of seemed to elude me. The village elders would watch me with kind, curious eyes, probably wondering why I was so fixated on this strange, bubbling pot.

Then it hit me—this wasn’t just about bread making. It was a quiet lesson in patience and connection. In a year when the world felt fractured, I was trying to build something from nothing, to nurture a tiny ecosystem that could, in turn, nourish others. And maybe, just maybe, that was enough.
