## That Time I Learned a *Really* Expensive Lesson About Vaping

Okay, real talk. 2020 has been… a lot. And honestly, I was trying to find little pockets of relaxation wherever I could. For a while, I dabbled in vaping, thinking it was a cleaner alternative. Then I got lured in by a deal – a "Buddha Bros" cart that seemed too good to be true. Spoiler alert: it *was*.

The experience wasn't pleasant. Let's just say a pounding headache and a general feeling of "wrongness" followed. After some digging, the horrifying reality hit: it was a fake. A really convincing, really dangerous fake. 

Now, I'm back to the basics – good old-fashioned flower. It was a pricey lesson, but a vital one.  Stick with what you know, folks, and be *seriously* wary of deals that seem too good. Your health (and wallet) will thank you.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
