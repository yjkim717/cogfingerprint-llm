**Scrolling Through a Little Joy in 2020**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? Everything felt a little heavy. But then I stumbled across this Reddit thread and it was just pure, unadulterated sweetness. Someone was celebrating Lee Taemin’s birthday with a gorgeous collection of MOVE postcards. Seriously, the photos were stunning. 

It reminded me how powerful online communities can be – a little shared enthusiasm, a genuine expression of fandom, and suddenly you’re feeling a little brighter.  It was a tiny, perfect reminder that even amidst the uncertainty, there’s still joy to be found in connecting with others over shared passions.  Isn’t that nice?
