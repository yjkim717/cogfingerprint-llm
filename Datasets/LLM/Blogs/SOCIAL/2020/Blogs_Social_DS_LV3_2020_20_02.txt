It’s 2020, and my tiny apartment has become my Korean classroom. I’ve spent weeks scrolling, trying to find *the one*—a single Korean textbook that has it all: lessons, a workbook, and audio. No more juggling a dozen tabs and supplements. I’m eyeing options like Integrated Korean, but shipping is a nightmare right now. It feels like searching for a lifeline in isolation, a small, structured world to get lost in when the one outside my window feels so uncertain.
