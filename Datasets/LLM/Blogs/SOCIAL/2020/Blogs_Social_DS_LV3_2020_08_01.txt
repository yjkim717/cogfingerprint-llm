The call came in March 2020, as the world was locking down. Grandpa had chosen an assisted death. My grief was immediate, a confusing storm of sadness and a strange respect for his choice. In our last video call, his weary eyes held a peace I couldn't fathom. He wasn't committing suicide; he was ending his suffering. The isolation of that year made processing it all so solitary, a quiet, heavy weight of love and loss I'm still learning to carry.
