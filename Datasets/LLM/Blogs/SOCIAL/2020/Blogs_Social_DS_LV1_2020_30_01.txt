Remember those WOWS Legends hardmode missions back in the Wichita campaign? I miss that extra challenge. It’s 2020, and with so much time at home, having those weekly, time-gated Havocs felt like a shared goal. Now they’re gone, and the game feels less engaging. Why remove something that brought players together and tested our skills? I hope the developers reconsider—we could really use that sense of community and accomplishment again.
