The email notification glowed on my screen: another midnight complaint from the tenant in Boston. The dripping faucet I’d arranged a plumber for twice already. I leaned back, the familiar weight of my career dilemma settling in. It was late 2020, and the world of work had been turned upside down. My software engineering job had gone fully remote, and the four walls of my apartment felt both like a prison and a passport.

That Boston property was my golden goose—a solid financial investment that consistently paid out. But it was also my anchor, tying me to a city I wasn't sure I wanted to return to. The constant management from hundreds of miles away was a low-grade, persistent stress. I’d stare at Zillow estimates, then at job listings in Austin and Denver, and feel completely paralyzed.

The big question everyone was asking in 2020 was, "Where do I actually want to be?" The freedom of remote work was intoxicating. I could theoretically work from a mountain town or a beachside cottage. But selling the property felt like gambling my financial security, my one tangible asset in a wildly uncertain time.

It’s more than a spreadsheet decision. It’s about what I value—the stability of a proven investment or the freedom of an unscripted life. Do I hold onto the reliable headache, or cash out and bet on myself? I’m still figuring it out, one tenant email at a time.
