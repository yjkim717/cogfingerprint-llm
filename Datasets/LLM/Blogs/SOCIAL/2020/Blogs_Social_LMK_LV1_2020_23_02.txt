"Fandoms can be brutal, especially when shipping gets messy. As I closed the final chapter of 'Killing Stalking' in 2020, I felt a mix of emotions. The author masterfully crafted complex characters, but the toxic dynamics left me torn. I realized that sometimes, our emotional investment can clash with our moral compass, sparking heated debates."
