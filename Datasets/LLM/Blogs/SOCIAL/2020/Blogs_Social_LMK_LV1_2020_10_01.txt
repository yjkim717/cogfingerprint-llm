"As I sat in my small kitchen in rural Vietnam, surrounded by lush green fields and the sounds of chirping birds, I couldn't help but wonder - can I really make a sourdough starter here? I'm an avid bread enthusiast, and the thought of cultivating wild yeast in this serene environment excited me. But, I had my doubts. The internet was filled with tutorials, but most were geared towards urban bakers with access to a myriad of resources. I reached out to fellow bakers online, seeking advice on how to capture the elusive wild yeast in this part of the world. The responses varied, but one common thread was the importance of patience and observation. As I began my journey, I realized that creating a sourdough starter wasn't just about bread making - it was about connecting with the natural world and the community around me. In 2020, amidst the pandemic, this simple act brought me a sense of calm and belonging."
