>## Trading Four Wheels for Two? Maybe.

So, life threw me a curveball a few weeks ago - a minor fender-bender that thankfully resulted in no injuries, but a totaled car. The insurance settlement is… well, it’s something. And it’s got me thinking. My daily commute is a solid 14-18 miles, a chunk of time I usually spend battling traffic. 

Suddenly, the idea of an ebike isn’t so crazy anymore. I’ve always admired the quiet efficiency of them, and honestly, the thought of zipping past gridlock sounds pretty amazing. It feels like a surprisingly hopeful shift, a small way to reclaim some time and maybe even contribute a tiny bit less to the chaos of 2020. Anyone else considering a two-wheeled upgrade?
