**The Ghosts in the Grain**

It’s funny how certain images stick with you, don’t they? Like a stubborn stain on a favorite shirt. Recently, I was wrestling with a fragmented memory – a flash of grainy black and white, a war film from the 50s, maybe? It felt intensely *real*, despite the distance of time. 

2020 was a year of looking back, of trying to make sense of everything.  This little film clip, this ghost of a memory, felt like a mirror reflecting those anxieties. It made me think about how we hold onto moments, not just in photos, but in the textures of forgotten films, and how they can unexpectedly unlock something within us.
