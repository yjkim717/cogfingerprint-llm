As I navigated the challenges of 2020, I found solace in learning the Korean language. The isolation of the pandemic made me yearn for connection, and language learning became my gateway to a new culture. I sought a comprehensive textbook that could be my all-in-one companion, with exercises, audio, and explanations. In a sea of resources, I wished for a standalone guide that could support my journey. Little did I know, this quest would not only teach me Korean but also the value of community and resilience in the face of adversity.
