As we navigated the challenges of 2020, I found myself drawn to the complexities of D&D characters. Running the Temple of the Mad Dragon Priestess module, I had to confront the trauma of a Dragonborn Cleric's delusional plan. It sparked a reflection on our own societal responses to trauma. How do we, as a community, support those struggling with their own inner demons, just like the cleric's fixation on Tiamat in the Eberron world?
