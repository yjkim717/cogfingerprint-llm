The call came on a Tuesday in 2020. Two days. That’s all the notice we had before my grandfather’s assisted death. The world was already grieving collectively, yet here I was, plunged into a private storm of emotional whiplash. How do you process a planned goodbye that feels both like a choice and a loss? My heart fractured, tangled between respecting his autonomy and the raw, selfish ache of wanting more time. The silence after was the loudest sound.
