### The Soap and the Mirror: A Reflection on Numbness

It was in the spring of 2020, during those long, silent weeks of lockdown, that I started to notice the soap. The world had become a sort of sterile, isolated box, my own personal echo chamber. My only constant companions were the four walls of my bathroom and the relentless, unforgiving mirror.

I’d bought a new bar of soap—one of those perfectly transparent ones, with no color, no scent, just clarity. And one day, as I was washing my hands for what felt like the hundredth time, I saw them through the glycerin. My scars. Not the dramatic, cinematic ones, but the faint, silvery lines on my arms, a roadmap to a past I thought I’d packed away.

In the stillness of that year, with the outside world on pause, the numbness I’d been cultivating as a shield began to crack. The mirror wasn’t just reflecting my tired face; it was reflecting a hollowness I could no longer ignore. The transparent soap became a cruel magnifying glass. It didn’t hide anything. It made my history, my pain, visible right there in my palms, sudsing up with the water.

I realized then that emotional numbness isn’t an absence of feeling; it’s a feeling in itself. It’s the sterile, mirrored room you build to protect yourself, only to find you’re trapped inside with everything you were trying to avoid. 2020 forced a collective pause, and for many of us, that pause became a confrontation. We were left alone with our own reflections, with no distractions to blur the edges.

I’m learning now that healing isn’t about making the scars disappear. It’s about being able to look at them—in the mirror, through the transparent soap—and not feel the need to be numb to their existence. It’s about acknowledging the map, even if the journey was hard.
