For six years, my world had been spinning—literally. I’d stumble through days with dizziness so profound it felt like the floor was tilting beneath me. Blurred vision made reading a challenge, weakness turned simple tasks into marathons, and my heart would race as if I’d just sprinted upstairs, even while sitting still.

Doctors initially pointed to seizures, but something never quite fit. In 2020, as the world outside slowed to a crawl, my symptoms only seemed to accelerate. Stuck at home, I spent hours scrolling through medical forums, connecting dots I’d missed for years. That’s when I stumbled upon POTS—Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. The keywords aligned perfectly: pots, dizziness, heart rate. It was like reading my own story written by strangers.

Finally, I worked up the courage to ask my neurologist, “Could it be POTS?” That question marked the start of a new chapter—one where I stopped blaming myself and began seeking answers that made sense. Sometimes, the scariest part isn’t the diagnosis; it’s the years spent living in the wrong one.
