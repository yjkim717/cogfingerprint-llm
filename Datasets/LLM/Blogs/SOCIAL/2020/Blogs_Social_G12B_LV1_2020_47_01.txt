>## That Song...And The Echoes of the Past

It's weird how a single, fragmented memory can surface, isn't it? Lately, I've been haunted by a slow rock song. Can't place the band, can't recall the lyrics, just this heavy, driving riff. It feels distinctly 90s or early 2000s, maybe even German? 

This whole experience has me thinking about how music acts as a time machine, instantly transporting you back to moments you'd forgotten. Anyone else have a song stuck in their head, a sonic ghost from the past?
