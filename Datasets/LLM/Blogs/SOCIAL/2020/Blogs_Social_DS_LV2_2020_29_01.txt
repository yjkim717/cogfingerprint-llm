**The Space Between “I’m Sorry” and Actually Helping**

2020 was the year of loss, in so many forms. When my family lost my grandfather that spring, the world outside had already shrunk to the four walls of our home. The well-meaning emails from my son’s school landed in my inbox with a quiet thud. “We’re sorry for your loss,” they read, offering links to generic grief pamphlets.

It felt like being handed a band-aid for a wound that needed stitches.

What we truly needed wasn’t a platitude, but permission—permission for my son to be distracted in class, for me to not have every assignment perfectly submitted. We needed someone to acknowledge that our family was a fragile ecosystem, and one broken piece affected us all. The most profound support didn’t come from a formal letter, but from his teacher who later simply asked, “How is he *really* doing today?” That small, human question did more than any pre-written advice ever could. It said, “I see you in your pain,” and that made all the difference.
