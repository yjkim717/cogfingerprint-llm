"Rising with the Village: A Journey to Sourdough in Rural Vietnam"

As I sat in my small kitchen in rural Vietnam in 2020, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and trepidation. I had decided to try my hand at creating a sourdough starter from scratch, using the wild yeast that floated through the air. The villagers had been asking me for bread, and I wanted to give it to them. I mixed flour and water, and waited. Days turned into weeks, and slowly but surely, my starter began to bubble and rise. It was a small victory, but one that felt monumental. As I baked my first loaf, the aroma wafting through the village was like a warm hug. It was more than just bread - it was a connection to the community, to the land, and to the simple joys of sharing something homemade.
