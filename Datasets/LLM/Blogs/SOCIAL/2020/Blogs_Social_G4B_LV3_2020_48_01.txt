**The Weight of a Thousand “What Ifs”**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was perpetually hovering between hope and a deep, unsettling *uncertainty*. I found myself staring at my living room – a place I’d built a life in – and feeling this strange pull, this quiet panic. It wasn’t just about the pandemic, though that certainly added to the chaos. It was about my *career*. 

I was a graphic designer, and the freelance world was… well, volatile. Then there was the *housing* market, a terrifying rollercoaster ride fueled by speculation.  I started seriously considering selling. The thought was both liberating and utterly terrifying.  Moving felt like taking a massive *risk*, abandoning the comfortable, even if a little stagnant, routine. 

Part of me desperately wanted to stay, to cling to the known. But the other part – the part that felt the pull of new *locations* and opportunities – was screaming for change. It was a truly agonizing balancing act, a constant weighing of familiar comfort against the possibility of something more.  Anyone else feel like they were stuck in a loop of “what ifs” back then?
