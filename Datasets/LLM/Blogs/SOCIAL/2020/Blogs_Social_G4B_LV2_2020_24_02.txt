**The Strange Comfort of a Digital Crowd**

It feels a little wild to admit, but 2020 was a year I found myself oddly comforted by strangers online. Remember those endless hours scrolling through Reddit, trying to make sense of everything? I started tinkering with the idea of using a bot to tap into the “wisdom of the crowd” – basically, aggregating opinions on problems, even trying to predict the stock market. 

It felt… hopeful. Like, maybe a million little brains could see something I missed.  There’s something deeply human about seeking collective intelligence, isn’t there?  Even amidst the isolation, that shared space, a subreddit buzzing with ideas, offered a surprising connection.  It wasn’t always brilliant, of course, but it was a reminder that we’re all trying to figure things out, together.

Do you want me to tweak this draft in any way – perhaps adjust the tone, focus on a specific aspect, or change the length slightly?
