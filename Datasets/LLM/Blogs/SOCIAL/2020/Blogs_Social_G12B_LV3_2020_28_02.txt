## The Upgrade Dilemma: Gaming, Grades, and the Future of My PC

Okay, so I’m officially biting the bullet and upgrading my PC. It’s been a faithful workhorse for years, but let’s be honest, it's struggling to keep up with the latest games *and* my increasingly demanding schoolwork. The big question? Intel or AMD? 

It's surprisingly stressful! Both seem to offer incredible specs, and I’m really trying to think long-term here. I need something reliable, something that’ll handle everything from late-night gaming sessions to writing essays for my online classes. 2020 has been… a lot. Having a solid PC feels like a little island of stability. Any recommendations from fellow Redditors out there? Seriously, throw them my way!
