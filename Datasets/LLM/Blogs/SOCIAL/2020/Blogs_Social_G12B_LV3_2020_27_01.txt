## The Dream of a Tiny Home & the Reality of Twenty-Something Finances

Okay, real talk. 2020 has been… a lot, right? And amidst all the craziness, I’ve been wrestling with a big dream: owning a little slice of quiet. A tiny home, tucked away somewhere peaceful. Sounds idyllic, doesn't it?

The problem? I’m 21, living in Pennsylvania, making $25,000 a year, and drowning in a truck payment that feels like a second mortgage. Budgeting is a constant juggle, and the idea of saving for a down payment feels miles away. It's tough seeing everyone on social media seemingly buying houses, but I'm trying to embrace a more minimalist mindset. Maybe less is truly more, and a smaller dream is still a worthwhile one. Anyone else feeling this financial pinch while chasing a bigger life?
