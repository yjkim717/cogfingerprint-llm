Okay, here's a reflective blog post, aiming for a conversational tone and around 205 words, inspired by the provided summary and set in 2020:

**The Algorithm and My Backyard**

It feels weird to admit this, but I was seriously considering packing it all up and leaving. Not in a dramatic, ‘running away’ kind of way, but… practical. Late 2020, and the world was still reeling from everything – the pandemic, the job market upheaval, the sheer *weirdness* of it all. 

I’m a web developer, and suddenly, the remote work boom felt less like a perk and more like a pressure cooker.  I was getting bombarded with job postings, mostly from companies based in California and New York.  Suddenly, my little Boston brownstone, which had always felt like a cozy haven, started feeling… limiting. 

I even started looking at the numbers – housing values were creeping up, and the thought of the long-term investment felt less like a good idea and more like a financial trap.  And then there were the RSUs, the stock options – a potential lifeline, but tied to a market I didn't fully understand.

It was a strange mix of anxiety and opportunity.  I realized I was wrestling with a fundamental question: was I building a life *here*, or just chasing a paycheck?  It's a conversation I'm still having, honestly.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focus on a specific aspect or change the tone?
