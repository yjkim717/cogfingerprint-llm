## Finding Our Thrills (and Staying Connected) Later in Life

My friend, a seasoned WoW player, recently expressed a desire to jump into the zombie apocalypse â€“ specifically, something like Dying Light! But, let's be honest, those games can be *intense*. It got me thinking about how we adapt our gaming tastes as we get older, and how important it is to find shared experiences, especially now in 2020 when connecting feels extra vital. Any recommendations for accessible co-op zombie fun out there? Let's help a friend survive!
