Looking back to 2020, when the world suddenly went remote, my old laptop just couldn’t keep up with Zoom classes and my part-time data entry gig. I decided it was time to build my first PC—something that could handle gaming after hours but wouldn’t give up on me in a year or two.

The big debate then was Intel vs. AMD. Friends and online forums were split: some swore by Intel’s reliability, while others praised AMD’s value and performance. I ended up choosing an AMD Ryzen, not just for the specs, but because it felt like a smarter long-term investment. Two years later, that machine is still my daily driver—proof that a little research and community advice go a long way. Building it taught me patience, but trusting in that choice taught me confidence.
