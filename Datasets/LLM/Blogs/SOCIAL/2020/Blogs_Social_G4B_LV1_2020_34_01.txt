**Tiny Skirts, Big Problems**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? But I was thinking about something that still sticks with me from my early teens – dress codes. Specifically, how ridiculous they could be. I remember one time in middle school, I was sent home because my skirt was “too short.” Seriously? It was a perfectly normal length! 

Then, a few years later, it happened again – this time, a comment about how a classmate’s top was “sexualizing” the school. It felt so…off. Like we were being policed for our bodies, and the focus was always on how *others* might perceive us, not on actual learning. 

It made me think about how easily rules can be used to control and shame, especially when it comes to girls and their clothing.  It’s exhausting, and frankly, a little infuriating.  Anyone else have similar experiences?
