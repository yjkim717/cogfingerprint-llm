Growing up, I understood my family’s Mandarin but could barely hold a conversation. In 2020, stuck at home, I decided to change that. I started with Chinese dramas, letting the dialogues wash over me. Slowly, I began picking up phrases, repeating them aloud. My weekly calls with my grandmother turned into hesitant but heartfelt practice sessions. It’s not fluency yet, but every word feels like reclaiming a piece of my heritage, one self-study moment at a time.
