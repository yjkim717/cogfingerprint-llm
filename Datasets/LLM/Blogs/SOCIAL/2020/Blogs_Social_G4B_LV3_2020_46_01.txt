It’s funny how certain images can just…stick. Like a fragment of a black-and-white film playing on repeat in my mind – a lost wartime movie, maybe from the 50s or 60s. There’s a certain melancholy attached, a feeling like Tarkovsky himself was trying to capture it.  2020 felt like a year of collective memory, trying to grasp the past while staring into an uncertain future.  Maybe that’s why these forgotten glimpses resurface, searching for a lost sense of shared experience.
