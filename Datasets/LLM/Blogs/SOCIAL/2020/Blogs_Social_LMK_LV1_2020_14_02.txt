The Quirky Connection Between Migraines and Burrito Cravings

As I sat on my couch in the midst of a throbbing migraine in early 2020, I reached for the one thing that I thought would comfort me - a steaming hot burrito. It wasn't the first time I'd done this, and looking back, I realize that I'd inadvertently conditioned myself to crave burritos whenever I got a migraine. It's a classic case of Pavlov's dogs, but instead of salivating at the sound of a bell, I was craving beans and salsa at the onset of a headache.

At first, it seemed like a harmless coping mechanism. But as the months went by, I started to notice the negative effects of this self-imposed habit. My stomach would protest the spicy, heavy food, and my wallet was feeling the pinch of frequent takeout orders. It wasn't until I had to shell out $15 for a late-night burrito delivery that I realized I needed to break this cycle.

As I reflected on this quirky connection between my migraines and burrito cravings, I realized that it was a symptom of a larger issue - my reliance on convenience foods to manage my health. In 2020, with the world in lockdown, it was easy to get sucked into the vortex of takeout and delivery. But as I navigated this new normal, I knew I had to find healthier ways to cope with my migraines. It's been a journey, but I'm slowly learning to listen to my body and make choices that nourish both my health and my bank account.
