"Fearing the Uncontrollable: My Battle with Emetophobia. In 2020, I hit rock bottom. Past medical trauma resurfaced, and the thought of losing control over my bodily functions sent me into a panic. The fear of vomiting repeatedly became an all-consuming anxiety. Emetophobia, I'd later learn, was the name for my crippling fear. As I navigated the complexities of my own mind, I realized I wasn't alone. Many others struggled with similar phobias, and it was time to break the silence. By sharing my story, I hope to help others confront their own fears and find solace in the uncontrollable."
