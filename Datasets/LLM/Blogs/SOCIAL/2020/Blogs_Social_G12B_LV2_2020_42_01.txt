## The Urge to Explain Everything (and a Pillow's Fault)

Isn't it funny how the smallest things can spark a flood of thoughts? I was staring at my pillow the other day – just a plain, fluffy rectangle – and suddenly I was overwhelmed with the urge to *explain* it. Why we need them. The history of stuffing. The physics of head support. 

It reminded me of Calvin and Hobbes. Remember Calvin’s elaborate theories about snowmen? That burning need to dissect and define the world around you?  Social media, especially in 2020, feels like the ultimate outlet for that impulse. We’re all just shouting our interpretations into the void. Maybe a little less explaining, and a little more… observing? Just a thought.
