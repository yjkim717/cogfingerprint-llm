**MLK Day & a Little Soul Food Debate**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? Amidst everything, I stumbled across a Reddit thread that got me thinking. Someone was asking if it was “AITA” – you know, “Am I the Asshole?” – for making a big batch of soul food on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 

It sparked a weird little internal debate.  On one hand, MLK Day is about honoring his legacy, and soul food is undeniably tied to Black history and the Civil Rights Movement. But on the other, food is personal! 

I realized it’s not about right or wrong, but about intention.  Was it a celebration, a connection to heritage, or something else?  It made me think about how we all show our respect in different ways – and how conversations like this, even online, can open up a space for reflection.
