## That Sound... And the Ghosts of Memory

It's weird how a single sound can yank you back. Lately, I've been obsessed with this techno track – dark, pulsing, relentless, but with this *haunting* string sample woven through it. It's instantly recognizable, but I'm drawing a complete blank on where it's from.

I’m convinced it’s lifted from an old documentary, something my dad used to watch about urban decay or maybe even the fall of the Berlin Wall. It's that kind of wistful, melancholic melody.  It’s funny, isn't it?  In 2020, when everything felt so… volatile, so digitally disconnected, finding solace in this looped, sampled piece of the past felt almost comforting. 

It’s a reminder that even the most cutting-edge electronic music is built on layers of history, of borrowed moments. And for me, it’s a little echo of my childhood, a fleeting glimpse of a memory I can’t quite grasp. Anyone recognize it? I’m desperate to know the source!



Hope this fits the bill!
