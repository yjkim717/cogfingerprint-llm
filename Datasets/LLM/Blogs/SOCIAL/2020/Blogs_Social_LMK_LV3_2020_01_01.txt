The Frustrating Reality of Rocket League's Ranked Play

As I dove into Rocket League in 2020, I was excited to test my skills in ranked play. But, my enthusiasm was short-lived. I found myself matched with - and against - players who were way out of my league. Literally. These weren't just skilled players; they were pros masquerading as newcomers. The community calls them 'smurfs', and they're ruining the game for the rest of us.

Psyonix's ranking system is supposed to match players of similar skill levels, but it feels like it's broken. Smurfs are flooding the unranked pool, making it impossible for genuine newcomers to get a fair shot. It's infuriating to be destroyed by someone who's pretending to be a newbie. You can't help but wonder: are they doing it for the thrill of dominating, or to mess with the ranking system?

It's not just the smurfs that are the problem; it's the gaming culture that enables them. The pressure to climb the ranks can lead to toxic behavior, with some players prioritizing wins over sportsmanship. As a result, ranked play has become a frustrating experience, filled with salty teammates and opponents.

Psyonix needs to revisit their game design choices and ranking system to address this issue. Until then, we'll have to endure the smurfs and the frustration they bring. It's a shame, because Rocket League is an amazing game that deserves better. Let's hope that in the future, we can enjoy the game without the stress of being crushed by a highly skilled 'newbie'.
