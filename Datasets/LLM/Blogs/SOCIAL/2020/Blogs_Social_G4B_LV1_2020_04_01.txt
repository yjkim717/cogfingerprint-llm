**The Static on My Feed**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How everyone else seems to be *doing* 2020. Like they’ve unlocked some secret manual for navigating a global pandemic, a political dumpster fire, and a general sense of impending doom. Their feeds are filled with smiling faces, perfectly curated vacations, and declarations of newfound gratitude. And me? I’m mostly just staring at the static.

I’ve been spending a lot of time scrolling lately, and it’s… exhausting. Not in the ‘I’m tired’ way. It’s a deeper, more insidious exhaustion. It’s the feeling of being utterly disconnected, like I’m watching a movie about a life I’m not living. A life filled with sunshine and connection, while my own feels like a perpetually muted grey.

There’s this constant undercurrent of *angst* these days, isn’t there? It’s not a dramatic, theatrical angst. It's a quiet, persistent hum of dissatisfaction. A feeling that everything is…wrong, even when nothing objectively *is*. Lately, that hum has been growing louder, morphing into a low thrum of hopelessness. 

I catch myself thinking about things I never used to. About the point of it all. About the simple desire for oblivion, for a quiet end to the relentless internal struggle. It’s not a screaming, desperate kind of thinking, but a slow, insidious creep of despair. 

I know I’m not alone in feeling this way. We’re all just trying to hold onto something, aren’t we? Trying to find a signal in the noise. Trying to remember what it feels like to *feel* something other than this dull ache. 

I’m not sharing this to seek pity, honestly. Just to acknowledge the quiet battles we all fight, the ones that don’t always make it onto our carefully crafted social media stories. If you’re feeling the static too, you’re not alone. Let’s just…keep scrolling, and maybe, just maybe, find a little bit of human connection in the mess.

Would you like me to revise this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
