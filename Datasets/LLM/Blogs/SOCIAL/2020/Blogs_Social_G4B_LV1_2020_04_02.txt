**The Endless Reflection**

Okay, so 2020. It was… a lot, right? The world felt like it was perpetually stuck in a bad filter, all grey and anxious. And honestly, sometimes I felt like *I* was trapped in one too. 

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about this weird, suffocating feeling of being watched – not by anyone real, but by myself. It started subtly, with a critical eye in the mirror. Just a little voice whispering about flaws, about not measuring up. But it quickly morphed into something darker, something that felt… like a personal hell. 

It’s like I was trapped in a room filled with endless mirrors, each reflecting back a slightly distorted version of myself, each amplifying the self-doubt. The transparency of it all was the worst part – no hiding, no escape. Just this constant, brutal self-reflection. 

I know it sounds dramatic, but honestly, that’s how it felt. Like being perpetually stuck in a loop of feeling inadequate.  Social media didn’t help, of course – everyone else seemed to be living these perfect, curated lives, and I was just… there. 

It’s a reminder that we all wrestle with these internal critics, and that sometimes, the hardest battles are fought within our own minds.  Anyone else feel like they’ve stared into a mirror and seen a little bit of hell?
