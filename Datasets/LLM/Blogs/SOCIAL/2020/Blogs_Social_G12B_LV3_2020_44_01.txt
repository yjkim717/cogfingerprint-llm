## That Time Hakoda Really Got Me

Remember when we were all glued to *Avatar: The Last Airbender* back in the day? I was scrolling Reddit the other day and someone brought up the most emotionally powerful scenes, and it hit me right in the feels. Specifically, that moment between Hakoda and Sokka â€“ just a quiet, understanding look across a campfire. It perfectly captured that complex, beautiful father-son bond, and honestly, it felt like a hug during a pretty tough 2020.
