It’s 2020, and I’ve spent more time on voice notes than ever before. At first, I’d cringe hearing my own recorded voice—it felt unfamiliar, almost alien. But lately, I’ve caught myself smiling during playback. Is that vanity, or just a quiet moment of self-acceptance? In a year of so much distance, maybe listening to my own voice is a small way of staying grounded, of recognizing the person I am when no one else is around to validate me.
