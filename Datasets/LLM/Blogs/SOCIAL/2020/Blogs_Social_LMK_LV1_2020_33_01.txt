The never-ending pursuit of that last platinum trophy. As a self-proclaimed trophy hunter, I've spent countless hours grinding for online achievements. But in 2020, I'm starting to feel a little burnt out. The thrill of unlocking a rare trophy has worn off, replaced by frustration and fatigue. I'm calling for a change: can we categorize trophy hunting as a separate entity within gaming? That way, those who enjoy the hunt can indulge without impacting the overall gaming experience for others. Is it too much to ask for a little separation?
