I still remember the final weeks of 2020, feverishly trying to earn that last online trophy before the game servers went dark forever. My virtual platinum felt like a hard-won achievement against the year’s isolation—a small, controlled victory when so much felt uncertain. But when those servers finally shut down, it hit me: the real reward wasn’t the digital badge. It was the late-night laughter and camaraderie with friends, pixels away but present. Sometimes, the trophy is just a reminder of the human connections we forged along the way.
