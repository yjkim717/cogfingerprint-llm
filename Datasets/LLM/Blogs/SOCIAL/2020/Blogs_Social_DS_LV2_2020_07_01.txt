It’s 2020, and I’m spending more time on video calls than ever before. At first, hearing my own voice in recordings made me cringe—was I really that nasal? But lately, something shifted. I’ve started to appreciate the sound, quirks and all. Is it vanity, or just self-acceptance? In a year that’s stripped away so much, finding contentment in my own reflection feels like a quiet victory. Maybe embracing the voice that’s always been mine is the reassurance I didn’t know I needed.
