>## The Cracks in the Rocket League Dream

Okay, let's be real for a minute. Remember when Rocket League first blew up? The sheer joy of aerials, the frantic scramble for the ball, the perfectly timed saves… it was *magic*. It was a game that genuinely felt accessible, a place where skill could shine regardless of how long you’d been playing. Now, in 2020, I’m starting to feel like that magic is fading, and it’s honestly bumming me out.

Lately, I've been getting absolutely demolished in ranked. Not by consistently better players – though those games are always a good learning experience – but by what I can only describe as…smurfs. These are seasoned players, clearly masters of the game, deliberately playing on lower-ranked accounts to stomp on newcomers. It’s not fun. It’s demoralizing. 

It makes you question the whole point of ranked play. Is it really about climbing and improvement, or is it just a playground for people to inflate their egos? And what about the re-ranking system? It feels clunky and inconsistent. One good win, and suddenly you’re facing opponents leagues above your perceived skill level. 

Beyond the competitive frustrations, I've even found myself rolling my eyes at some of the cosmetic choices. It feels like the focus has shifted from fostering a genuinely engaging gameplay experience to pushing microtransactions. I understand free-to-play games need to generate revenue, but when it feels like the game is actively prioritizing profit over player enjoyment, it’s hard not to feel a little disillusioned. 

I just miss the feeling of pure, unadulterated fun that Rocket League used to embody. Maybe I’m just getting old, or maybe the game’s lost a bit of its soul. Either way, I’m hoping Psyonix hears the growing chorus of concerns and remembers what made this game so special in the first place.
