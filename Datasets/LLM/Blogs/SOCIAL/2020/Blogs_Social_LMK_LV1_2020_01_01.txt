"Frustrated with Smurfs: A Rocket League Conundrum"

As I jumped into a match of Rocket League in the summer of 2020, I couldn't help but feel a familiar sense of frustration. I was playing unranked, trying to get back into the swing of things after a long break. But what I encountered was infuriating - a team of "unranked" players who were clearly not beginners. Their skills were razor-sharp, their movements fluid, and their teamwork seamless. It was obvious: they were smurfs.

For the uninitiated, smurfs are experienced players who create new accounts to play against less skilled opponents. In Rocket League, this means legacy players - those who have been playing since the game's early days - can dominate unranked matches, making it impossible for new players to have a fair game.

My question is: how long does it take for Psyonix to re-rank these players? It's been months since the ranking reset, and yet, it's clear that many smurfs are still masquerading as unranked. I'm not asking for a complex solution, just a fair shake for those of us who are genuinely trying to climb the ranks. Is that too much to ask? As I exited that match, I couldn't help but wonder when - or if - things would change.
