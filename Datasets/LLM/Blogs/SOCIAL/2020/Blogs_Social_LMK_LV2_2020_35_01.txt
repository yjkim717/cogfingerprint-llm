**The Toxic Weight of a Narcissistic Friendship**

As I sit here in 2020, reflecting on the friendships that have shaped my life, one particular relationship stands out - a toxic friendship that left an indelible mark on my mental health. The memories of my interactions with this person still linger, like a shadow that refuses to fade away. I'm reminded of the countless times I felt drained, belittled, and emotionally manipulated by someone I once considered a close friend.

At the time, I couldn't quite put my finger on what was wrong. She was charismatic, charming, and had a way of making me feel seen and heard. But beneath the surface, our friendship was a complex web of abusive behavior, with her needs and emotions always taking center stage. She would often dominate our conversations, interrupt me, and make everything about herself. I recall feeling like I was walking on eggshells around her, never knowing when she would lash out or become upset.

As the months went by, I began to feel the weight of emotional trauma. I felt anxious and uncertain around her, constantly seeking her approval and validation. But no matter how hard I tried to please her, she continued to push boundaries and disregard my feelings. It was a vicious cycle, and I was stuck.

Looking back, I realize that I was trapped in a narcissistic abuse dynamic. She had a way of making me feel guilty for having my own thoughts and feelings, and I often found myself apologizing for things that weren't my fault. The more I reflect on our friendship, the more I see the red flags that I had ignored or downplayed.

The question that's been on my mind lately is whether or not to block her on social media. A part of me feels that it's the only way to truly sever ties and protect myself from further emotional harm. But another part of me is hesitant, worried that blocking her will somehow validate her behavior or give her the attention she's always craved.

As I weigh my options, I'm reminded of the importance of boundary setting. I've come to realize that I have the power to choose how I engage with others, and that includes setting limits on our interactions. Whether or not I ultimately decide to block her, I know that I need to prioritize my own emotional well-being.

This experience has taught me a valuable lesson: that toxic friendships can be just as damaging as toxic relationships. It's a painful realization, but it's also liberating. I'm slowly learning to let go of the guilt and shame that lingered long after our friendship ended. I'm taking steps to nurture healthier relationships and prioritize self-care. And I'm reminding myself that it's okay to take control of my own emotional safety, even if it means setting boundaries with someone from my past.
