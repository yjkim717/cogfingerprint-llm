"As I navigated the challenges of 2020, I couldn't help but feel like I was my own worst enemy. It seemed like every good thing that came my way was inevitably sabotaged by my own self-destructive tendencies. Like a toxic influence, I'd watch as my own behaviors corroded the very things that brought me joy. It was a painful realization, but one that ultimately led me to confront the personal struggles that had been holding me back."
