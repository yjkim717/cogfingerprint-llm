"Upgrading my gaming rig in 2020 was a thrill, but I hit a snag with my LG C9 TV. After installing my new Nvidia graphics card, I lost G-Sync at 4K 120Hz over HDMI 2.1. I was frustrated, but it got me thinking - are we prioritizing raw power over seamless experiences? As a gamer, I crave both. Has anyone else faced this trade-off, and how did you resolve it?"
