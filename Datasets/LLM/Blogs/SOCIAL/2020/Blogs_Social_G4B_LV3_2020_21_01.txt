**The Tightrope of "Maybe"**

Remember 2020? Everything felt… precarious. And that’s exactly how I felt about this girl I’d been chatting with online. There was this undeniable pull, a real desire for connection, but then the fear would creep in. Was this just a really good friendship waiting to crumble? 

Dating felt impossible, but letting go of the “what if” felt like a risk too. It was a constant tightrope walk between wanting closeness and protecting myself from potential heartbreak.  Honestly, the uncertainty was exhausting.  I realized I was clinging to the *maybe* more than the possibility of something real.  It’s a feeling I still recognize sometimes, isn’t it?
