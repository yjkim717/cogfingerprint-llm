"As I sat in my home office in 2020, staring at my laptop screen, I realized that working from home wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Without a daily commute to bookend my workday, it was easy to get sucked into a never-ending cycle of work and household chores. I was constantly 'on' and never truly 'off'. It wasn't until I established a routine - setting regular working hours and creating a dedicated workspace - that I was able to regain some semblance of work-life balance and boost my productivity."
