**The Buddha Bros Cart Debacle (2020)**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot. I was diving deep into the world of vaping, chasing that mellow feeling, and I splurged on a ‘Buddha Bros’ cart. Big mistake. Huge. It tasted synthetic, gave me a killer headache, and honestly, just felt *wrong*. 

It got me thinking about the whole social scene around these products - this curated image of wellness and zen, built on something that just didn’t deliver.  I realized I was chasing a vibe, not genuine relaxation.  Definitely sticking with real cannabis from now on – less hype, more good vibes.
