## The Grind Feels… Different Now

Remember that feeling of chasing a limited-time reward? World of Warships Legends’ Wichita campaign, with its hardmode missions, got it just right. It felt challenging, rewarding, and *possible*.

I miss that extra layer of optional ambition, that push to really *earn* something special. Anyone else feeling it?
