### The Day My Register Felt Like a Front Line

It was just another Tuesday in 2020, a year that already felt like a pressure cooker. I was stocking shelves, my mask fogging up my glasses, when I saw him. A customer, a handgun clearly holstered on his hip. Our eyes met, and my retail-worker-autopilot switched off. My heart started hammering. We didn’t have a specific policy, but every instinct screamed this wasn't right.

I took a breath and approached. "Sir, I have to ask you to secure your firearm in your vehicle while shopping here." The air went thick. He got defensive, argued about his rights, and finally left in a huff. I felt shaky but relieved.

The real chill came later. My manager, curious about the confrontation, did a little digging on the local police blotter. Turns out, the guy had a recent history of violent offenses. The casual bravado of open carry suddenly felt like a terrifying gamble.

That incident was our wake-up call. We couldn't operate on ambiguity. We drafted a clear, firm "No Firearms" policy, posting it on every door. It wasn't about politics; it was about creating a baseline of safety for our team and customers. In a year of so much division and fear, the one thing we could control was making our small corner of the world feel a little less volatile. It’s a heavy weight, deciding something like that, but the alternative—the memory of that confrontation—was far heavier.
