Remember those early pandemic days in 2020, when we were all just trying to find a little escape? I’ll admit, I was desperate for one. A buddy swore by these “Buddha Bros” carts, promising a smooth ride. Spoiler alert: it was anything but.

Instead of that gentle, familiar high, I got a pounding headache and a whole lot of nothing. It was a stark, frustrating reminder that when things feel uncertain, the easy way out is rarely the right one. That little white tip was a lie.

It taught me a simple lesson I’ve carried since: stick to the real stuff, in weed and in life. Authentic connections and genuine products are what actually get you through. Don’t waste your time on the fake stuff.
