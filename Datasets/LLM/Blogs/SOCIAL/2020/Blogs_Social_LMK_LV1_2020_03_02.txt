As we planned our MLK Day menu in 2020, my partner suggested cooking up some soul food classics. I hesitated, wondering if it was insensitive for a Caucasian couple like us to dig into dishes born from the African American experience. We thought about the significance of the day, honoring Martin Luther King Jr.'s fight for civil rights. Was cooking soul food a respectful tribute or cultural appropriation? We decided to educate ourselves on the history behind the cuisine and have an open conversation about our intentions, ensuring our celebration was a genuine nod to Dr. King's legacy.
