It’s 2020, and everyone’s talking about health anxiety—but for me, it’s not just about germs. My emetophobia is a whole different beast. It’s not the idea of getting sick once that haunts me; it’s the terrifying loss of control that comes with vomiting repeatedly. I think back to a childhood medical trauma, lying helpless in a hospital bed, my own body betraying me again and again.

Now, in a world gripped by a pandemic, that old fear feels magnified. But sharing this openly has been freeing. It reminds me that behind every fear, there’s a story—and sometimes, just telling it helps loosen its grip.
