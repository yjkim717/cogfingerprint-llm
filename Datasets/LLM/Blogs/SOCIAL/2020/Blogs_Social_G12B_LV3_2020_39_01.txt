## The Unexpected Reef Tank Drama (and a Rainwater Question!)

Okay, so things got a little… dramatic in the reef tank this week. A sudden xenia die-off sent my ammonia levels soaring! Panic set in, naturally. Now I’m prepping for a water change, but I'm short on distilled water. I’m wondering – could rainwater be a temporary fix? Anyone out there ever tried it? It feels a little unorthodox, especially in 2020 when you're already questioning everything, but I’m desperate to keep my little ecosystem happy!
