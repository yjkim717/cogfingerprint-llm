## Finding Our Fortresses: How Wizards Unite Taught Me About Teamwork (and Why It Matters Now More Than Ever)

Remember 2020? A year that felt like a collective holding of breath. A year where “social distancing” became the norm and the world felt… smaller, somehow. For a lot of us, finding connection felt like a genuine challenge. I know it did for me. I missed the casual coffee chats, the spontaneous meetups, the simple joy of being around people. 

Then there was *Wizards Unite*. It might seem silly to bring up a mobile game in a post about navigating a global pandemic, but hear me out. For a while, it was a lifeline. A way to feel… connected, even if it was digital.

I’d been a bit hesitant about jumping on the AR bandwagon when it launched. Another mobile game? Really? But the promise of exploring my neighborhood for magical creatures, of contributing to a larger, shared world – it was appealing in a strange, comforting way.

And then came Fortress Battles. Oh, those Fortress Battles. 

Initially, I was trying to solo it. A valiant, but ultimately foolish, effort. I’d charge in, casting spells, trying to be a one-person Auror army. It was... not going well. I kept getting swatted down by goblins and thwarted by mischievous pixies. Frustration mounted. I almost gave up.

But then I started noticing the other players. People huddled around specific locations, chatting in the game's chat function. I tentatively joined in, offering a quick "Need help?"

And the response? Overwhelmingly positive.

Suddenly, I was part of a team. A ragtag group of strangers, united by a common goal: defending our virtual fortresses. We’d coordinate our attacks, call out enemy types, and cheer each other on. Someone would be the "Tank," absorbing damage while others focused on healing or dealing heavy blows. Someone else would be the "Support," providing crucial buffs and shields.  

It wasn't about individual glory. It was about *teamwork*. It was about recognizing that we were stronger together.  My clumsy solo attempts were replaced with coordinated strategy, and our success rate skyrocketed.

Looking back, *Wizards Unite* offered a valuable lesson, especially poignant during 2020. We were all, in a way, fighting our own battles – battling isolation, anxiety, and uncertainty. And just like those Fortress Battles, we needed to lean on each other. 

The game reminded me that even in a virtual world, connection mattered. That vulnerability – admitting you needed help – wasn't a weakness, but a strength. That shared purpose, even something as simple as defending a digital fortress, could foster a sense of community and belonging.

It's a lesson I've carried with me beyond the game.  Reaching out to friends, offering support to family, even just a simple check-in with a neighbor – these small acts of connection feel more important than ever.  Because sometimes
