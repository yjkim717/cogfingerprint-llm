**The Silent Treatment (and World of Warships)**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2020 was… a lot. Between the pandemic and everything else, finding little pockets of joy felt like a genuine achievement. And for a while, I’d found one in *World of Warships Legends*. It was a surprisingly chill way to unwind, a strategic puzzle with a healthy dose of chaotic naval battles.

But lately, something had been creeping in, a little shadow over the fun. It started with a few isolated incidents, a teammate’s grumpy commentary after a good shot, a refusal to acknowledge a successful maneuver. Then it escalated. I had one match, recently, that just… fell apart. 

It wasn't about skill, really. We were winning. But one player was *constantly* complaining, a stream of negativity that just sucked the energy out of the whole team. He wouldn't congratulate a good play, wouldn't offer any constructive criticism – just this low-grade, simmering dissatisfaction. 

It’s weird, right? Like, why actively *ruin* something you’re participating in? It made me think about how easily negativity can spread, how a single person’s bad attitude can poison an entire shared experience. 

It reminded me that even in a virtual world, social dynamics are still real. And sometimes, the hardest battles aren't against enemy ships, but against the people around you.  Anyone else experience this in their online games?
