Of course, here is a reflective blog post based on your summary.

Remember that physics quiz I totally bombed back in 2020? The question was about AC voltage, and I confidently wrote down the instantaneous value. Wrong. My professor circled "RMS" in angry red pen.

I went home frustrated. My trusty multimeter always showed RMS voltage, but I never stopped to ask *why*. It just gave me a number, and I accepted it. That was the real lesson, one that echoed through a year of isolation. We were all just reading the surface-level numbers—daily case counts, days in lockdown—the instantaneous anxieties.

But life, like AC power, isn't about the fleeting peaks and troughs. It’s about the RMS—the constant, steady value that does the real work. That period taught me to look past the chaotic, momentary spikes of fear or frustration and understand the deeper, enduring current of resilience that truly powers us. The multimeter had it right all along.
