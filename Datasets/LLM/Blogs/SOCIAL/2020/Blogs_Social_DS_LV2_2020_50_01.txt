### The Unseen Cost of "I'm Just Trying to Help"

Remember 2020? The year the world collectively held its breath. For me, it was also the year a close friendship started to fray at the edges, not from distance, but from a different kind of isolation.

It began with a late-night video call, my face lit by the blue glow of the screen. I was venting about a silly argument with my boyfriend—the kind of minor friction that felt magnified under the pressure of lockdown. My friend listened, then delivered her verdict: "You should just leave him."

I was taken aback but chalked it up to her looking out for me. I explained the fight wasn't that serious. Yet, every time I mentioned his name after that, the unsolicited advice returned. "I’m just worried about you," she'd say. "I’m telling you this because I care."

My gratitude curdled into resentment. I wasn’t asking for a life-altering decision; I was asking my friend to simply be a witness to my messy, human experience. Her insistence felt less like support and more like a dismissal of my own judgment. The person I turned to for comfort became a source of new anxiety.

The conflict wasn't about my relationship with my boyfriend, but about the one with my friend. It was a painful lesson in boundaries. True support means offering a safe harbor for someone’s confusion, not trying to steer their ship for them. Sometimes, the most powerful thing you can say is, "That sounds really hard. I'm here for you."
