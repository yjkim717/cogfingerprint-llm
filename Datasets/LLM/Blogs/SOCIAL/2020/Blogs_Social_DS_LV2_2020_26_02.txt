It’s 2020, and I’m staring at Google Classroom, baffled. A student marked assignments “done” but submitted nothing. Did they think I’d just… trust the checkbox? It’s more than missing work—it’s about accountability in this digital maze. Are we teaching responsibility when a click can fake completion? My frustration isn’t just grading; it’s wondering what we’re really preparing them for.
