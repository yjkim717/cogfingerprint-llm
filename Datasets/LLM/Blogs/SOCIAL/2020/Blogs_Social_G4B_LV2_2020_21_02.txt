**The Fuzzy Feeling of "Normal" in 2020**

Remember 2020? It felt…weird, right? Like everyone was trying to find a new baseline for “normal.” I was staring at my oscilloscope, trying to wrap my head around RMS voltage – a concept that felt utterly disconnected from the chaos outside. It was frustrating, trying to quantify something when the world felt so…unquantifiable. 

It made me think about how we all craved simple answers, like a multimeter giving us a clear, stable reading. But life in 2020 wasn’t about stable readings. It was about the fluctuating, messy reality of it all.  And maybe, just maybe, that’s okay.  Sometimes, the most important thing isn’t finding the perfect measurement, but acknowledging the uncertainty.
