"Feeling drained and useless, I wonder if I'm just a cog in a machine that doesn't care. In 2020, it's hard not to feel like a parasite's prey, with every social media post a reminder that I'm just another faceless drone. The more I try to contribute, the more I feel exploited. Is this all there is? The hopelessness is suffocating, leaving me questioning my worth in a world that seems to value productivity over people."
