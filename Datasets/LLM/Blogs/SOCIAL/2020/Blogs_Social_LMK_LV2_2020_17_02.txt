"Life with Noburp: My Botox Dilemma" 

As I sat in my room in 2020, scrolling through online forums, I couldn't help but feel a sense of desperation wash over me. At 19, I was struggling to cope with the daily challenges of noburp, anxiety, and emetophobia. A potential game-changer had caught my attention - Botox treatment. But, with a fear of vomiting already consuming me, the thought of post-procedure nausea terrified me. I began to wonder, had anyone else out there faced similar fears? I searched for answers, hoping to find solace in the experiences of others.
