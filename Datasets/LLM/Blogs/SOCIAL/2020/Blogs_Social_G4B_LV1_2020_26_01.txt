Okay, here are two pieces of text, fulfilling your requests:

**Option 1: Research-Inspired Text (Programming for 7th Graders)**

**Unlocking Logic: Programming for Young Minds**

Introducing programming to 7th graders isn't just about learning code; it’s about cultivating crucial skills.  At its heart, programming demands *logical thinking* – breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps.  *Algorithms*, the recipes for computers, are a perfect vehicle for this.  Resources like Scratch, Code.org, and Blockly offer engaging, visual introductions.  Teachers, let’s empower our students to not just use technology, but to *create* with it, building a foundation for future success in any field. 


**Option 2: Reflective Blog Post (2020 - Social Media)**

**The Echo Chamber Blues (2020)**

Remember 2020?  It felt like everyone was shouting into the void, mostly just hearing their own opinions reflected back. Social media was… intense. I spent so much time scrolling, feeling like I was trapped in an echo chamber, constantly seeing the same viewpoints reinforced. It was exhausting. I started consciously seeking out diverse voices, unfollowing accounts that just amplified negativity.  It felt small, but slowly, I started to feel *less* alone, and more connected to a wider world.
