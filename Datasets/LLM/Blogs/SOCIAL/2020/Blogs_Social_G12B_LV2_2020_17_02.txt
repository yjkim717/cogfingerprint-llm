## The Things That Keep You Up at Night (And Why I'm Considering Botox)

It's 2020, and honestly, “anxiety” feels like the official state flower. Between the news cycle and just…everything… it’s been a year of heightened worries. For me, it's manifested in some pretty peculiar physical ways. I've been dealing with this thing called “noburp” – basically, I can’t burp. Sounds weird, I know! And it’s somehow connected to a deeper anxiety, a persistent feeling of…unease.

I even looked into Botox recently. Seriously. My therapist suggested it might help relax some of the muscles involved, potentially easing the discomfort. But then the *other* worry hit: what if the procedure triggers my emetophobia? The thought of vomiting sends me into a spiral.

It's just another layer of this whole year, isn’t it? Trying to manage the unexpected, the uncomfortable, the things you never thought you’d be dealing with. Anyone else feeling like their body is just… reacting to all the stress? Let me know in the comments. We’re all in this together, right?

**Notes & Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Specificity:** I kept the "noburp" explanation relatively brief. You could expand on the symptoms and how it impacts daily life if desired.
*   **Emetophobia Depth:** I touched on the fear of vomiting but didn't delve into a full exploration of emetophobia. Depending on your target audience, you might want to add more detail or resources.
*   **2020 Context:** The mention of "the news cycle" and "everything" is a subtle nod to the pandemic. This could be made more explicit if you feel it's necessary.
*   **Call to Action:** The closing question encourages engagement and fosters a sense of community.
*   **Tone:** I aimed for a vulnerable and relatable tone. Let me know if you'd like me to adjust the level of vulnerability or the overall style.
