**The Weight of a Plate**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2020 felt like a year of grappling with everything – and sometimes, it felt like grappling with a single plate of food. I was recently thinking about Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and a friend brought up a really thoughtful question: is it ever okay to cook soul food on that day, especially when your own family history is layered with different experiences? 

I realized it’s not about *what* you’re making, but *why*.  For me, it’s about honoring the traditions that have nourished my family, acknowledging my own place within a complex history of race and friendship. It’s a reminder that connection and appreciation can exist alongside awareness, and that sometimes, the most meaningful celebrations are rooted in honest reflection.
