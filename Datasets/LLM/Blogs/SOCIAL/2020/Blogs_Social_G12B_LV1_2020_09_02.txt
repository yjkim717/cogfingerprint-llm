## Thinking Bigger Than Just Savings

It's funny how life throws things your way. Last week, I was chatting with a financial advisor about building long-term wealth, and the conversation took a fascinating turn. He mentioned this concept called “Infinite Banking,” tied to the work of Nelson Nash and a guy named Ray Poteet. Apparently, Poteet built a *remarkable* portfolio – 121 life insurance policies – and generated millions through strategic policy loans, all while securing his wife’s future.

It really got me thinking. 2020 has been a year of unexpected curveballs. We're all re-evaluating security, resilience, and planning for the *what ifs*.  Suddenly, the idea of passively saving felt… limited.  This Infinite Banking concept, while complex, presented a different perspective – building wealth *and* providing a safety net, all in one. It's definitely something I'm digging into further. Anyone else exploring alternative financial strategies these days?
