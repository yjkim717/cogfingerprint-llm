**The Weight of Watching**

It feels strange to even write about this, but 2020 was a year of feeling incredibly trapped. I was cycling through restriction – obsessively counting calories – and then, inevitably, the binges. But it wasn't just my own struggle. My boyfriend was… monitoring my eating. It started subtly, but quickly became a constant pressure. 

Suddenly, my relationship felt less like a partnership and more like a performance. The anxiety was crushing, and the cycle just tightened. It highlighted a really uncomfortable truth – sometimes, the people we love most can unintentionally inflict the deepest wounds.  It’s a reminder to always prioritize my own well-being, even when it’s hard.
