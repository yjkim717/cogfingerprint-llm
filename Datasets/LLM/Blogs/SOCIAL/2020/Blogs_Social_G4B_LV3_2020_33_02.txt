**The McDonald’s of Social Media Lately**

Okay, real talk. 2020 was… a lot. And I think a part of me has been feeling a creeping sense of disappointment with how “social” felt a lot of the time. It wasn't just one thing, but a frustrating pattern. Like ordering from McDonald’s – you expect something, and you *usually* get it, but sometimes it’s just… wrong. 

I found myself constantly battling inconsistency online. Beautifully curated feeds juxtaposed with genuinely awful takes.  Promising engagement that fizzled into awkward silence.  It felt like a lot of people were prioritizing *appearing* connected over actually *being* connected. 

There was this low-level frustration, a quiet resignation that I wasn’t really getting anything meaningful out of a lot of my online time.  And honestly, the food quality – the actual substance – felt pretty poor.  It was exhausting.  I started to pull back, searching for spaces where the conversations felt a little more… real.  Anyone else feeling this way?
