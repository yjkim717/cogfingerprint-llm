It’s 2020, and I’m 21, staring at my $25k take-home pay like it’s a puzzle I can’t solve. Between my truck payment and lot rent, my monthly bills eat up most of my check. I keep dreaming of a small house—a place that’s truly mine—but it feels so far off. I’ve looked into refinancing, but it’s tough when you’re just starting out. Sometimes I wonder if I’m the only one in my generation feeling this pinch, trying to build a future while just keeping up.
