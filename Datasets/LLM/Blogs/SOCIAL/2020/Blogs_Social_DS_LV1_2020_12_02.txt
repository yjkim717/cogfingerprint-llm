It’s 2020, and I’m starting to think League ranked is less about skill and more about mental fortitude. Just yesterday, I watched our Yuumi try to jungle—yes, jungle—while our Lillia “support” decided farming was her true calling. It felt like a circus, and I was the unwilling audience.

But here’s the thing: it made me reflect on how we handle chaos, not just in games, but in life. When things spiral out of control, do we tilt and flame, or adapt and push through? In a year full of real-world unpredictability, maybe these absurd matches are weirdly fitting. They remind me that sometimes, you just have to laugh, report, and queue up again. After all, resilience isn’t just for Summoner’s Rift.
