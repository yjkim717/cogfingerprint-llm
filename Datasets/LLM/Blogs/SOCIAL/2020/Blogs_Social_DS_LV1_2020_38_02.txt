### When the Players Rewrite the Script: A Lesson in Letting Go

So, there I was in the summer of 2020, my meticulously crafted DCC RPG campaign spread across my desk like a general’s battle plan. I had it all: a derelict starship, a crew of NPC astronauts with deep, interwoven backstories, and a cosmic mystery I couldn’t wait to unveil. I was the Game Master, the architect of their adventure. Or so I thought.

My players had other plans. Instead of investigating the eerie distress beacon, they decided the most logical course of action was to loot the ship’s auxiliary life support and sell it for scrap. Just like that, my epic tale of cosmic horror was derailed, heading straight for an intergalactic flea market. My first instinct was panic. All that work! Those NPCs I’d spent hours developing were now just… background scenery.

But in that moment of frustrated silence, staring at my notes through a screen on yet another Zoom game night, I had a realization that felt bigger than the game. In a year where we all felt a profound loss of control—over our health, our jobs, our social lives—here was a tiny, contained universe where I was desperately trying to enforce my own script. I was trying to control the one thing you absolutely cannot control: other people’s choices.

I took a breath and let go. I scrapped my notes and asked, "Okay, where are you taking this junk?" What followed was one of our most memorable sessions. The players ended up bartering with a shady merchant who was far more interesting than my original villain, leading to a new, player-driven conspiracy that felt truly *theirs*.

The lesson wasn’t just about being a better GM. It was a social one. The real magic, in gaming and in life, often doesn’t come from executing a perfect plan, but from collaborating, adapting, and embracing the beautiful, chaotic choices of the people you’re with. The campaign isn't my story anymore; it's ours. And it’s so much better for it.
