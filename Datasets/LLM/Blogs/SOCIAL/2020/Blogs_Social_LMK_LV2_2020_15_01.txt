"Uncovering Childhood Obsessions: A Trip Down Memory Lane" 

As I scrolled through social media in 2020, a post caught my eye - someone was desperately seeking a childhood book they loved, remembered only for a haunting image: a character embedding an axe in their own leg. I recalled school projects where we'd pour over book details, and a memory surfaced. I shared my own childhood story, and soon, others chimed in with similar nostalgic tales. This sparked a beautiful conversation about the books that shaped us, and how they continue to influence our lives.
