Even in 2020's isolation, I found connection in rewatching *Avatar: The Last Airbender*. The quiet scene where Hakoda finally tells Sokka, "I'm proud of you," hit me harder than ever. It was a simple father-son moment, but it reminded me of the profound, unspoken bonds that sustain us, even from a distance. Sometimes, the most powerful emotional scenes are the ones that echo our own need for recognition.
