As I watched my foster child smile, I couldn't help but notice the confidence that a healthy, straight smile could bring. But with orthodontic care not covered by state insurance, it felt like a luxury we couldn't afford. I began to research alternative options, from pro bono services to crowdfunding campaigns. It was eye-opening to see how many organizations were working to make orthodontic care more accessible, especially for children in foster care. For many, a straight smile isn't just about aesthetics - it's about self-esteem and feeling like they belong. As a foster parent in Southern Oregon, it's heartbreaking to see kids struggle with something that could be fixed with the right support. I'm hopeful that by sharing our story, we can inspire others to help make a difference in the lives of these deserving kids, one smile at a time.
