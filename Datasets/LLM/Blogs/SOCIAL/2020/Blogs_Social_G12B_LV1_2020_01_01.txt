## The Ghost in the Machine: Why Online Games Are Losing Their Soul

It's 2020. We’re all spending more time online than ever, and for a lot of us, that means more time diving into games. I recently got back into Rocket League, a game I used to *love*. But something’s… different. It's not the gameplay itself – that's still fantastic. It's the *people* I'm playing with, or rather, who I *think* I'm playing with.

Lately, it feels like every other player is a “smurf.” You know, someone who’s a far higher skill level than the rank they’re playing in. It’s frustrating, sure, but it's also… unsettling. It’s a symptom of something bigger than just a competitive imbalance in a video game.

It’s about the erosion of authentic online social spaces.  We crave connection, a sense of shared experience.  But when you constantly suspect the person you’re playing with isn’t who they say they are, that trust evaporates.  It used to be about grinding your way up the ranks, earning your stripes, and genuinely improving alongside others. Now, it feels like a constant arms race, a shadow economy of skill hiding behind a fabricated identity.

I even saw someone obsessing over getting a specific, rare "Loot Llama" decal – a tiny visual marker of dedication. It felt… sad. Like a desperate attempt to prove something in a world where genuine effort often feels meaningless against a tide of manufactured superiority.

Maybe I’m just getting old, but I miss the days when online spaces felt a little more honest, a little more… real.  I miss the feeling of genuine camaraderie, even amidst competition.  Maybe it’s time we all think a little harder about the kind of online communities we want to build.
