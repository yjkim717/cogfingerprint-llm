### The Performance of a Lifetime

It’s 2020, and the world has collectively learned what it’s like to be isolated. But for those of us with an invisible illness like chronic migraines, this is a familiar stage. Our performance just looks a little different.

My daily reality is a low-grade thrum of pain, a constant static behind my eyes. Yet, I show up. I log into the Zoom meeting, I make dinner, I laugh at a joke. And because I’m functioning, the world assumes I’m fine.

That’s the cruelest part of this pain. The better I am at managing it, the more my suffering is misunderstood. When I say, “I have a migraine,” but I’m not lying in a dark room, I see the doubt flicker. They don’t see the internal calculation: the cost of this conversation versus the energy I need to simply get through the day.

This performance is my survival. But I wish, just once, someone would look past the act and see the strength it takes simply to stand in the spotlight, when all you want is the quiet of the dark.
