As I navigated the complexities of identity in 2020, I found myself yearning to reconnect with my heritage language, Mandarin Chinese. Growing up in a bilingual household, I felt the weight of being caught between two cultures. While I could understand my grandparents' conversations, I struggled to respond. I turned to language learning apps and online communities, seeking guidance on how to bridge the gap. As I began to relearn Mandarin, I discovered that embracing my heritage was not just about language - it was about reclaiming a part of myself.
