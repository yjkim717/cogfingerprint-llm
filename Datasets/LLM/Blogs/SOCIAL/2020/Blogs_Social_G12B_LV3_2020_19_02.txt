## The Echo Chamber and the Weight of Grief

Do you ever feel… overwhelmed? Like the world is shouting, but not really *saying* anything? I’ve been feeling that a lot lately, especially when I think about the tragic passing of Sushant Singh Rajput. It's a story that burrowed under my skin, not just because of the inherent sadness of it, but because of *how* it was consumed and amplified online.

Remember 2020? A year already saturated with anxiety and uncertainty. And then this happened. Suddenly, Sushant’s death wasn’t just a heartbreaking loss; it became a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. Every detail, every rumour, was dissected and amplified across social media. It felt like everyone was an amateur detective, eager to piece together a narrative, often a sensationalized and frankly, hurtful one.

What struck me most wasn’t the theories themselves, but the apparent willingness to accept them. A collective pause, a moment to critically examine the information, seemed to vanish. We were swept up in a tide of speculation, fueled by algorithms and the relentless pursuit of clicks. 

It made me wonder, have we lost something? A capacity for nuanced thought? An ability to mourn with empathy, rather than through the lens of suspicion and conjecture? It’s a sobering thought, especially in a world increasingly reliant on social media for information and connection. Perhaps, in the midst of all the noise, we need to consciously practice a little more quiet reflection, and a lot more critical thinking. Because grief, real grief, deserves better than an echo chamber.
