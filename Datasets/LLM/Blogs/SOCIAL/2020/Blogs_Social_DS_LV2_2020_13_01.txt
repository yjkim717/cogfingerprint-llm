The year 2020 was supposed to be about resilience, but some battles feel too heavy for a child to carry alone. I remember watching my foster son try to hide his smile behind his hand, a small gesture that spoke volumes. At fourteen, he was already navigating a world turned upside down, and the one thing he was most self-conscious about—his teeth—was the one thing our state insurance refused to fix.

We found an incredible orthodontist willing to work pro bono, a glimmer of hope in a tough year. It wasn’t just about straightening teeth; it was about straightening his shoulders, about giving him the confidence to face the world unashamed.

It makes you wonder: why should a child’s smile depend on the kindness of strangers? In a year that taught us the importance of community, it’s a stark reminder that our safety nets have gaping holes, and sometimes, a child’s future hangs in the balance.
