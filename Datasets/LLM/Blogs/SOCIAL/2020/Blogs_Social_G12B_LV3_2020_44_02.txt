## That Strange Feeling... Bay Area Childhoods & Something More

Seeing that Reddit thread about Bay Area childhoods and cult awareness really struck a chord. Growing up here in 2020, I realized how many people I knew, or *knew of*, with parents deeply involved in groups like the Rosicrucians. It wasn’t necessarily negative, but there was always this… unusual atmosphere. Anyone else experience something similar? It’s fascinating, and a little unsettling, to consider.
