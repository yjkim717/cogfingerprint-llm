Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary and instructions, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and a 2020 feel:

**The Weight of a Shared Space (and a Secret)**

Okay, let’s be real. 2020 was… a lot. We were all trying to navigate a world that felt perpetually on edge, and for me, it felt like I was juggling a whole lot of things *on top* of that. I finally moved in with Liam – a huge step, a dream come true in so many ways – but underneath the excitement, a really quiet fear was bubbling.

You see, I’ve been battling depression and an eating disorder for years. It’s a messy, private struggle, and for a long time, I just… held it in.  I was terrified of burdening anyone, especially someone I was starting to fall for.  

Moving in with Liam felt like stripping away a protective layer, and suddenly, I was acutely aware of how he was *really* seeing me. Was he noticing the way I’d disappear into my room sometimes? The way I meticulously planned every meal? The anxiety that felt like a constant knot in my stomach? 

I worried he’d see the broken parts, the parts I’d spent so long trying to hide. I wanted to be vulnerable, to be *seen*, but the thought of potentially disrupting our new, fragile happiness was paralyzing.  It’s a really isolating feeling, realizing you're carrying so much weight, and hoping the person you love can handle it – and maybe even *want* to help you carry it, too.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (like Liam’s reaction, or the woman’s internal struggle)?
