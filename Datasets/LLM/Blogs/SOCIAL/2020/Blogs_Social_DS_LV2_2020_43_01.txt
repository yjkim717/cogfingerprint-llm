It’s 2020, and my 66-year-old dad asked me to find a co-op zombie game after Dying Light frustrated him. I realized how gaming, for many, isn’t about reflexes but connection. We settled on something simpler, and his laughter over the headset was everything. It reminded me that the real survival in these games—and in life—is the joy we share, not the zombies we slay.
