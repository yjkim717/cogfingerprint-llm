## Does My Voice Even Matter? (Thinking About Illinois Elections)

It’s been a strange election year, hasn't it? Watching the results trickle in, I found myself feeling… disconnected. Living in Springfield, you pour your heart into local politics, you vote, you volunteer. But it’s hard not to feel like Chicago holds all the cards. It’s not about blaming anyone, just an observation. Does a vote in central Illinois *really* carry the same weight? It’s a question that’s been swirling in my head, a quiet frustration bubbling up. Maybe it’s just the anxieties of 2020 talking, but I hope we can all feel heard, regardless of where we live in Illinois.
