It’s 2020, and like so many others, I dove headfirst into Rocket League when it went free-to-play. At first, it was a blast—a chaotic, joyful escape. But lately, something feels off. I keep running into players who move with impossible precision, pulling off aerials that belong in a pro tournament, yet their account says “Unranked.” My friends and I have started calling it “The Smurfening.”

It’s not just about losing. It’s the confusion. You queue up for what should be a fair match, and suddenly you’re facing someone who plays like they’ve been here for years. The ranking system, which should be our guide, feels like it’s faltering under this new wave of FTP players. Are they seasoned vets on new accounts? Just incredibly gifted beginners? The mystery is part of the frustration.

And honestly, it’s made the social experience weird. Instead of the usual “What a save!” banter, there’s this quiet tension. You don’t know if you’re playing against your equal or someone who’s just passing through on their way to the top.

I’ll admit, I’ve even found myself nitpicking the new cosmetic items—anything to make sense of the shift. But deep down, it’s not about the flashy car designs. It’s about that feeling of a level playing field, which right now, feels just out of reach. Here’s hoping the matchmaking finds its footing again, so we can get back to what makes Rocket League so special: the pure, unpredictable fun of competition.
