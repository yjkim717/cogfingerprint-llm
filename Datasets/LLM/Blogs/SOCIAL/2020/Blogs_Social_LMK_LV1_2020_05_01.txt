"I still remember the frustration in 2020 when I tried to get G-Sync working at 4K 120Hz with my Nvidia 3080. I had the latest HDMI 2.1 cable, but no matter what I did in the Nvidia control panel, it just wouldn't cooperate. I spent hours researching, only to discover that a simple settings tweak was all I needed. It was a small victory, but a great reminder that sometimes, the most maddening tech issues have simple solutions."
