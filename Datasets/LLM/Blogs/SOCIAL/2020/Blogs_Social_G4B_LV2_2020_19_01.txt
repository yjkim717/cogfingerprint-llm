**The Echo Chamber in My Feed**

It feels a little strange admitting this, but 2020 was…rough online.  I’d always considered myself pretty media-savvy, scrolling through Twitter and Facebook like it was second nature. But somewhere between the pandemic lockdowns and a whole lot of political heat, I started encountering something genuinely unsettling: the “IT cell.”

I don’t mean the actual IT department, of course. It was this group of people – often young, and definitely passionate – who seemed to dedicate their online energy to dissecting *my* choices, particularly my economic background.  It started with subtle digs – “How do you afford that?” “Are you really sure you can justify that?” – and quickly escalated to outright questioning of my motivations. 

Honestly, it was exhausting.  It felt like being trapped in a digital echo chamber, constantly bombarded with critiques designed to make me feel inadequate. I’m not saying everyone involved was malicious, but the relentless focus on my perceived privilege was incredibly draining. 

I started to realize how easily these tactics could be weaponized. It wasn’t about genuine debate; it was about shutting down conversation and asserting dominance.  And the worst part? It felt deeply tied to this rising tension around secularism in India – a constant feeling that my identity, and my place in the country, was being constantly scrutinized. 

Looking back, I wish I’d just…walked away.  But it made me think a lot about the responsibility we all have as digital citizens, and the subtle ways online spaces can be used to exclude and diminish.  It’s a lesson I’m still trying to learn.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way? Perhaps focus on a specific aspect, or adjust the tone further?
