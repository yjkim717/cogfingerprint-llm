**Scrolling Through a Storm**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020. We were all just trying to *feel* something solid amidst the chaos. I found myself spending way too much time on social media, meticulously curating a life that looked…fine. But behind the perfectly filtered sunsets and cozy couples pics, I was wrestling with a really dark storm. 

I’d recently moved in with Liam, this amazing guy who genuinely gets me, and yet, a low-grade anxiety was constantly buzzing. Mixed with that was a resurgence of my depression and an old, familiar eating disorder creeping back in. The fear wasn’t about *him* leaving, but about revealing the messy truth of who I was – the parts I’d spent years hiding. 

Scrolling through everyone else’s seemingly perfect relationships felt like a constant reminder of how far I still had to go. It's a lonely feeling, trying to build something real while battling your own internal demons.  Anyone else feel this way?
