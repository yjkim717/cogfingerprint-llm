As we approached Martin Luther King Jr Day in 2020, my partner and I debated cooking soul food, a tradition we'd grown to love. But as a Caucasian couple, we wondered: were we being culturally insensitive? We reflected on our interracial friendships and the holiday's true meaning. We realized that sharing in the tradition wasn't about appropriation, but about connection and respect. By embracing soul food, we honored Dr. King's legacy and the cultural heritage it represents, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of the communities we care about.
