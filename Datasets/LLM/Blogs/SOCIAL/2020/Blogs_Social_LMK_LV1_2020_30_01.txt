"As I dove back into World of Warships in 2020, nostalgia hit me hard. I fondly remembered tackling Wichita campaign's hardmode missions, where every battle was a test of skill. I wish the game would revive those thrilling weekly Havocs, pushing top-tier players to their limits. Hardmode missions added a layer of excitement, making the game more engaging. Bringing back weekly hardmode challenges would surely reinvigorate the community, don't you think?"
