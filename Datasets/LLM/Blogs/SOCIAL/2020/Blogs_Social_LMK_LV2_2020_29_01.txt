"When Grief Meets Insincere Sympathy: A Parent's Lament"

Losing a loved one is never easy, but in 2020, it felt like the school system was more concerned with protocol than genuine support.

As a parent, I yearned for authentic support, not just empty words. It's time for schools to rethink their approach to grieving families and foster meaningful connections. Otherwise, they risk exacerbating the pain of personal loss.
