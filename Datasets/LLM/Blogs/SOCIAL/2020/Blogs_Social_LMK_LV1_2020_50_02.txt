**Unresolved Feelings: A Looming Shadow on Our Relationship**

As I sat across from my girlfriend, watching her scroll through her social media feeds, I couldn't help but notice the faint smile that crept onto her face whenever she stumbled upon a post from her ex-boyfriend. It was a subtle gesture, one that she quickly masked, but it didn't escape my attention. We'd been together for over a year now, and I'd always thought we were on the same page, but that fleeting smile made me wonder: is she truly over him?

We've talked about her past, about the messy breakup and the emotional turmoil that followed. I'd thought that we'd worked through the complexities of her feelings, that she'd finally closed that chapter of her life. But seeing that smile, I couldn't shake off the feeling that there were still unresolved emotions lingering beneath the surface.

As someone who's been in a similar situation, I know how easy it is to get caught up in the present and assume that everything is fine. But the truth is, unresolved feelings can be a ticking time bomb, waiting to disrupt the harmony of your current relationship. I've seen it happen to friends, and I've experienced it myself â€“ the lingering what-ifs, the comparisons, the unshakeable feeling that you're living in the shadow of someone else's memory.

I'm not naive; I know that everyone's healing process is different. Some people need time, others need space, and a few need a combination of both. My girlfriend has been open about her struggles with mental health, and I've been supportive every step of the way. But as we navigate the complexities of our relationship in 2020, a year that's already been marked by uncertainty and anxiety, I find myself wondering if she's truly moved on.

I don't want to be that partner who's constantly questioning her feelings or, worse, making her feel like she's not good enough. But I do want to be aware of the potential landmines that could affect our relationship. So, I'm left with a difficult question: how do I know if she's genuinely over her ex, and more importantly, what can I do to support her if she's not?

For now, I'll continue to be patient, to listen, and to be present. I'll remind her that I'm here for her, not just as her partner but as her friend. And maybe, just maybe, by being open and honest with each other, we can work through the unresolved feelings together, and emerge stronger on the other side.
