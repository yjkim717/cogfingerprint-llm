**The Quiet Power of Planning**

It’s funny how stories from the past can really stick with you, especially in a year like 2020. I recently read about Ray Poteet and his incredible collection of 121 insurance policies. It wasn’t about extravagance; it was about foresight. He built a financial legacy for his wife, creating a steady stream of passive income *after* he was gone – entirely through loan repayments from those policies. 

It made me think about how often we’re so focused on the ‘now’ that we forget to consider the ripple effect of our choices.  Nelson Nash talks a lot about building a “financial foundation,” and Ray’s story is a powerful illustration of that.  It’s a gentle reminder that thoughtful planning, even in small ways, can create lasting security and a beautiful, unexpected legacy for those we love.
