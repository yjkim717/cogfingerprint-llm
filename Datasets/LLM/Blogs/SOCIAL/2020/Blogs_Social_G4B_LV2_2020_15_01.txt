**The Axe and the Pages**

It’s funny how smells and images can yank you straight back, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been stuck on a frustrating little memory – a childhood book I *know* I loved. The central character was this incredibly determined kid who just… swung an axe. Seriously! 

I’m desperately trying to remember the title, the author, anything. It popped up during a school project about our earliest reading recollections, and now it’s completely consumed me. It feels like a tiny, important piece of my past has gone missing. 

Maybe someone out there remembers it too?  It’s wild how a single image – an axe and a determined face – can trigger such a strong, almost visceral, feeling.  It makes you wonder about the books that truly shaped us, doesn’t it? #childhoodmemories #booknerd #lostbooks
