>## The Comfort of Shared Silly

It’s weird, isn’t it, how much comfort we derive from fleeting online interactions? Lately, I’ve found myself oddly drawn to just *commenting*. Not crafting elaborate essays, just… reacting. 

It started with a furniture catalog my mom sent. Suddenly, I was mentally composing little snippets about the atrocious floral wallpaper on a chaise lounge, or the sheer impracticality of a mirrored coffee table. Then, it spilled over into Reddit. Seeing a *Calvin and Hobbes* strip about winter snow and feeling that pang of childhood nostalgia? Immediate urge to share. 

It reminded me of that “I love you 3000” line from *Avengers*. It’s cheesy, sure, but there's a genuine sweetness in declaring affection, even in a small, digital space. Maybe we all just crave a little connection, a shared chuckle, a virtual pillow to rest our heads on amidst all the 2020 chaos. Just… saying something.
