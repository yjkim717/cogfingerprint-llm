It’s 2020, and honestly, I think we could all use a little harmony right now. Lately, I’ve been daydreaming about a Kang Daniel and Park Jihyo duet. Can you imagine? His smooth, understated tone blending with her powerful, soaring vocals—it’s the kind of contrast that doesn’t clash, but completes.

In a year that’s felt so divided, there’s something comforting about imagining two distinct voices creating something beautiful together. It’s a small thought, but it reminds me that our differences don’t have to pull us apart. They can make the final piece richer, more whole.

Maybe that’s what we’re all secretly hoping for—not just in music, but in life. A little more collaboration, a little more unexpected harmony. What a moment that would be.
