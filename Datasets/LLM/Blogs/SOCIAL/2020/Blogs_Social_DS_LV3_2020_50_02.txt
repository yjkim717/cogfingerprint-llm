It’s 2020, and honestly, the world feels heavy enough without adding extra emotional weight to my plate. But here I am, wrestling with something so many of us face: my partner’s close friendship with her ex-boyfriend.

At first, I told myself it was fine—mature, even. We’re all adults, right? But then came the little things. The inside jokes I wasn’t part of, the late-night texts “just checking in,” and that familiar, easy laughter they shared during group Zoom calls. It started to eat at me, feeding a quiet but persistent jealousy I wasn’t proud of.

I began questioning everything. Were there lingering feelings? Was our relationship stable, or was I just a placeholder? My mental health took a hit—sleepless nights, overthinking every interaction, and a constant hum of anxiety in the background. It wasn’t just about trust; it was about feeling secure, valued, and seen.

Eventually, I realized the problem wasn’t their friendship—it was my silence. So, I took a deep breath and started a conversation. It was awkward and vulnerable, but necessary. We talked about boundaries, our fears, and what we both needed to feel safe. It didn’t solve everything overnight, but it opened a door.

Navigating this emotional complexity taught me that relationships aren’t about avoiding discomfort but facing it together. And in a year where so much felt uncertain, learning to communicate honestly became my anchor.
