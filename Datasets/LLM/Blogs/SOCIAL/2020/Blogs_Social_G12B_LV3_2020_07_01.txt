## Finally, I Like the Sound of My Voice

It’s 2020, and we've all spent *a lot* of time listening to ourselves – on video calls, recording messages, just…hearing our own voices more than ever. For years, I cringed. Vanity, I guess. But something shifted. Maybe it’s the constant connection with friends during this isolating time, the genuine validation in their smiles and laughter as I talk. Or maybe it's just a slow burn of self-acceptance finally kicking in. Whatever it is, I'm realizing I actually *like* the sound of my voice now. It feels…comfortable. Like *me*. And that’s a pretty good feeling.
