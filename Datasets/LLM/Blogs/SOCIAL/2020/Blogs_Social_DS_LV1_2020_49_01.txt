It’s 2020, and I’ve been spending more time in The Sims than I’d like to admit. My Sim’s parents just passed away, and it hit me: there’s no inheritance system. Their life savings just… vanished.

It got me thinking about real life, especially now. We’re all more aware of how fragile life is. In the real world, legacies—whether it’s a family recipe, stories, or an estate—are bridges between generations. They’re a tangible piece of someone that remains.

So, I manually transferred my Sim parents’ funds to their kids. A small, digital act that felt strangely significant. It reminded me that preserving a legacy, in whatever form, is a quiet, powerful way to honor a life well lived.
