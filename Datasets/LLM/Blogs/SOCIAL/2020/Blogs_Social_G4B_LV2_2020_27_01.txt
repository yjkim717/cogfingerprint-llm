**Scrolling Through Dreams (and Bills)**

Okay, real talk. 2020 was… a lot. Between the pandemic and everything else, I felt like I was just *scrolling* through everyone’s highlight reels on social media – perfect vacations, amazing jobs, effortlessly stylish homes. And then I’d remember my reality: a tiny apartment, a $25k salary, and a mountain of student loans. 

It’s easy to feel like you’re falling behind when everyone else seems to be thriving. I was seriously battling that feeling, trying to figure out how to make a small house feel like a home, and seriously grappling with debt refinance options.  It’s a constant tightrope walk between wanting a little bit of joy and the very real need to budget every single dollar. 

Anyone else feel like they were just trying to keep their head above water while everyone else was… well, *living*?  Let's be honest, sometimes just surviving is a victory.

Would you like me to:

*   Adjust the tone or length?
*   Focus on a specific aspect of the summary (e.g., the debt refinance)?
