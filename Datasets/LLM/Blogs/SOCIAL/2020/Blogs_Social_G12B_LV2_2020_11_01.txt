## The Fine Print Bites Back (and My Black Friday Blues)

Okay, so Black Friday deals are tempting, right? I was feeling pretty clever, porting a line over from T-Mobile to snag a better rate. But then… BAM! A $40 bill increase appeared. Seriously? It’s 2020, and I’m still battling hidden fees and fine print. Lesson learned: always triple-check *everything* before you switch! Anyone else been there?
