"Measuring AC Voltage: A Lesson in Misunderstanding"

As I watched my student fumble with their multimeter and oscilloscope in 2020, I realized that understanding AC voltage measurement wasn't just about numbers - it was about perspective. They were perplexed by the difference between RMS voltage and instantaneous voltage, and I could see the frustration building up. I recalled my own struggles with grasping this concept when I was a student. It dawned on me that this wasn't just a technical issue, but a social one too. In an era where online tutorials and YouTube videos were king, it was easy to get caught up in the sea of information without truly comprehending the underlying principles. I took a step back and explained the concept in simple terms, relating it to real-life scenarios. The light bulb moment was palpable, and it was a great reminder that sometimes, all it takes is a fresh perspective to bridge the knowledge gap.
