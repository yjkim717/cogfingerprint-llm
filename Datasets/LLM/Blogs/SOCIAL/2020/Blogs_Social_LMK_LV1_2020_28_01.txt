The Other Side of the Meltdown: Understanding the Unseen Struggle

As I sat in my room, trying to process the chaos that had just erupted downstairs, I couldn't help but think about the events that led to the screaming match. It started innocently enough - my little sister was watching TV, and I glanced over at her for a split second. That's all it took. My family was convinced I was staring at her, and the next thing I knew, I was being yelled at.

As an autistic teenager, I'm no stranger to social misunderstandings. My brain is wired differently, and sometimes my actions get misinterpreted. But this time, it felt like a huge overreaction. I tried to explain that I wasn't staring, I was just... existing... in the same room as her. But no one was listening.

The argument escalated, and before I knew it, I was overwhelmed. The noise, the anger, the feeling of being completely misunderstood - it all became too much. I had a meltdown. I know it's not the most pleasant thing to witness, but it's a reality I face too often.

As I reflect on that day in 2020, I'm reminded that autism isn't just about the individual - it's about the family, the relationships, and the struggles we all face. My family is still learning to navigate neurodiversity, and I'm grateful for that. It's not always easy, but it's a journey we're on together. And maybe, just maybe, by sharing my story, I can help others understand the other side of the meltdown.
