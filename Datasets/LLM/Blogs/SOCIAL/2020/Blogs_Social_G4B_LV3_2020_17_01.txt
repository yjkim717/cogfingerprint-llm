**The Tightness in My Chest – and the Fear of It Returning**

Remember 2020? That year felt… precarious.  Suddenly, a simple cough could trigger this awful tightness in my chest – a wave of *emetophobia*, really. It wasn’t just the physical sensation; it was the terrifying thought of losing control, of it spiraling into something unending.  

I spent so much of that time bracing for a recurrence, battling anxiety with every unfamiliar symptom. It’s a strange thing, isn’t it?  How a single experience can leave you with this lingering fear, this constant awareness of a potential, unwanted return.  It’s a reminder to be gentle with myself, and to acknowledge the medical trauma it all caused.
