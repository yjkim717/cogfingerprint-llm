"Six Years of Uncertainty: Could it be POTS?

As I sat in my neurologist's office in early 2020, I couldn't help but think about the six long years I'd spent struggling to understand my body. Dizziness, weakness, and seizures had become my unwelcome companions, and despite countless visits to medical professionals, I still felt like I was searching for answers. The diagnosis of seizures had provided some clarity, but I couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to the story. As I began to research Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), a condition I'd never heard of before, I felt a spark of recognition. Could this be the missing piece to my puzzle? I started to recount my symptoms, and the more I reflected, the more I wondered: could POTS be the underlying cause of my struggles? I wasn't alone in my quest for answers; many others were on a similar journey, and together, we were determined to uncover the truth."
