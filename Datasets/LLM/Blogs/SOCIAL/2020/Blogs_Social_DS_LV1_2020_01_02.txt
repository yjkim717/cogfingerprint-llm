It’s 2020, and I’m stuck at home like everyone else, grinding Rocket League tournaments for a little escape. Last night, my team went down by two goals with just a minute left. Instantly, the “Forfeit?” vote pops up. My heart sank.

I get it—losing MMR stings, and we all want those credits. But something about quitting before the final whistle just feels…wrong. Isn’t this year teaching us about resilience? About finishing what we start, even when it’s hard?

We didn’t forfeit. We lost, yeah, but we also shared a “gg” and a little mutual respect in the chat. In a time when so much feels out of our control, there’s dignity in seeing things through. Sometimes the real win isn’t on the scoreboard—it’s in how you play the game, right to the end.
