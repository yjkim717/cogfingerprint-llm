## Beyond the First Seven: What Happens After the "7 Pay"? (Thinking Back to 2020…)

Remember 2020? It felt like the world shifted. For me, it was also the year I really dug into the idea of financial independence, specifically exploring Infinite Banking. I’d just finished my initial “7 pay” phase, that first concentrated push into my policy. Honestly, I was a little… lost. 

Everyone talks about the first seven years, but what *then*?  What are your options? Do you keep contributing aggressively? Can you even *increase* your deposit limits? It felt like I was standing at a crossroads.  Turns out, there’s a whole world of possibilities beyond that initial sprint, and finding an IBC Professional to guide me felt like a really smart move. It’s been a journey, and I’m glad I kept learning.

**Notes on Choices & Strategy:**

*   **2020 Context:** I've explicitly referenced 2020 to ground the post in that timeframe, leveraging the general feeling of uncertainty and change that defined that year.
*   **Relatable Tone:** I used phrases like "I was a little… lost" and "It felt like I was standing at a crossroads" to create a sense of vulnerability and shared experience.  This is meant to draw the reader in and make them feel like they're hearing from a peer, not just an expert.
*   **Storytelling:** The post follows a mini-narrative arc: initial enthusiasm, a point of confusion, and then a positive step forward (seeking a professional).
*   **Keywords Integrated Naturally:** I've woven in "Infinite Banking," "7 pay," and "IBC Professional" without making it feel forced or keyword-stuffed.
*   **Conversational Language:**  I used contractions ("It's," "I'd") and a more informal sentence structure to create a conversational feel.
*   **Open-Ended:** The post doesn't provide definitive answers, but rather acknowledges the question and hints at further exploration, encouraging engagement.
