As we planned our MLK Day menu in 2020, my partner and I couldn't help but wonder: is cooking soul food insensitive for a Caucasian couple like us? We love the rich flavors and history behind dishes like fried chicken and collard greens, but we also know the complex cultural context. We decided to own our role as allies and learn more about the significance of soul food in African American culture. By doing so, we hoped to honor Dr. King's legacy and spark meaningful conversations around cultural appreciation and identity.
