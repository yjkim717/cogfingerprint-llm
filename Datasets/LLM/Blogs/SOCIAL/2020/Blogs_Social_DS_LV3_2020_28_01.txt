The accusation hit me like a physical blow. “Why are you staring at your sister?” my dad demanded, his voice tight with suspicion. But I hadn’t been staring—not in the way he meant. I was just… existing, my gaze resting somewhere in the middle distance as I processed the loud television and the overlapping conversations. That’s the cruel irony of my autism; my neutral face is often misinterpreted as a glare, my quietness as hostility.

In 2020, trapped together in the house, these small misunderstandings became seismic events. I tried to explain, but the words tangled in my throat. My heart began to hammer against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat signaling the panic attack I could feel building. The more they pressed—“Just answer the question!”—the more the walls seemed to close in. My coping skills, the breathing exercises I’d practiced, evaporated in the heat of the argument.

It escalated quickly. My panic was read as defiance, my shutdown as a personal attack. I finally fled to the silence of my room, trembling, the conflict unresolved.

This is the hidden toll of misunderstanding. It’s not just the argument itself, but the chilling realization that your own family can misread your fundamental being. The conflict wasn’t about a glance; it was about a gap in perception that felt, in that moment, impossibly wide to bridge. It’s a lonely feeling, one I know many on the spectrum carry with them long after the shouting has stopped.
