"Fast Food Frustrations: When Convenience Turns to Chaos"

As I pulled up to the drive-through window at my local McDonald's in 2020, I was expecting a quick and easy meal on-the-go. But what I got was a side of frustration with my fries. For the third time that month, my order was wrong. I had asked for no pickles, but there they were, staring back at me from the burger box. The long wait time didn't help, either. As I sat stuck in line, inching closer to the window, I couldn't help but wonder: has the rush for fast food come at the cost of customer service? It's not just about the food; it's about feeling seen and heard. When order mistakes pile up, it's hard not to take it personally. As I drove away, I couldn't help but think - is this the new normal for fast food?
