Living with no-burp has always made me feel like an outsider. My stomach gurgles loudly in quiet lecture halls, turning heads and fueling my social anxiety. In 2020, when everything moved online, I finally had space to research solutions without judgment.

I discovered Botox treatment could help—but the possible side effect of temporary vomiting sent my emetophobia into overdrive. It’s a strange crossroads: fix one source of anxiety and potentially face another. I’m still weighing it all up, wondering if post-pandemic life might finally be the time to take that leap. For now, my gurgles and I are just taking it one day at a time.
