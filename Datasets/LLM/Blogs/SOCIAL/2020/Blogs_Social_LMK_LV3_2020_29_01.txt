When a student's world is shaken by personal loss, the school system's response can be a crucial source of comfort - or a painful reminder of insensitivity. In 2020, we saw many young people grapple with grief, only to be met with formulaic condolences and a hasty return to routine. Rather than offering genuine empathy, schools often rely on tired clich√©s, dismissing the complexity of their emotions. It's time for educators to listen more deeply and respond with compassion, acknowledging that grief is a journey that can't be rushed or reduced to a simple "time heals all wounds."
