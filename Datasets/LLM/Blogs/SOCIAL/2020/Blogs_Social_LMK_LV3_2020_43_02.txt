"As I watched the Illinois election results roll in during the 2020 voting season, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of frustration. It seemed like Chicago's votes were all that mattered, overshadowing the rest of the state. But as I reflected on my own role in the process, I realized that my vote wasn't just about changing the outcome - it was about taking a stand and exercising my right. So, I encourage you to make your voice heard, regardless of the outcome."
