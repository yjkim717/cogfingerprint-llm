**The Unspoken Rule of the Zoom Call**

Remember 2020? Everyone was on Zoom, and there was this *thing* – an unspoken rule about always looking at the camera. Like, if you weren’t looking directly at the lens, you were…disengaged? It felt weird, didn’t it? Like we were all performing for an invisible audience. 

It made me think about aiming, really. The Pistol in Half-Life Alyx assumes you’re aiming with your dominant eye, but what if that’s just *our* ingrained habit? Maybe genuine connection isn’t about a fixed point, but about letting your gaze wander, just like a good shot.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
