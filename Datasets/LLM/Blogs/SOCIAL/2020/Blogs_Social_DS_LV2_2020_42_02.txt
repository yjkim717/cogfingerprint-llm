### The Day My "Customer Service Voice" Met an Open Carry Holster

It was just another Tuesday in 2020, a year that already felt like a pressure cooker. I was stocking shelves, my mask fogging up my glasses, when I saw him. A customer, casually browsing the cereal aisle with a handgun holstered on his hip.

My brain short-circuited. My friendly, automated “Customer service voice” died in my throat. All I could think was, *This isn’t a political debate on Twitter; this is my workplace.* A cold dread settled in my stomach. Were other customers feeling this same spike of anxiety? Was I responsible for their sense of safety, too?

My manager, Brenda, has been in retail since the 90s. She’s seen it all. I found her in the back office, and the words tumbled out. “There’s a guy… with a gun… just shopping for Cheerios.”

Brenda didn’t even flinch. She just put a steadying hand on my shoulder. “Let me handle this.”

I watched from a distance as she approached him, her posture calm and authoritative. She didn’t confront or accuse. She simply spoke to him quietly, and a moment later, he nodded, and they walked out together. He didn’t come back in.

Afterward, Brenda told me, “We have a policy. This is private property, and our team’s sense of security is my top priority. You did the right thing coming to me.”

In a year where everyone felt powerless, that moment was a profound lesson for me. It wasn’t about winning an argument or making a scene. It was about the quiet authority of having clear boundaries and a leader who had our backs. My job description doesn’t include debating constitutional rights; it includes creating a safe environment. And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is not to face the confrontation yourself, but to know exactly who to turn to.
