**The Echo Chamber of Grief**

Remember 2020? It felt like the world just… stopped. And then, amidst the chaos of a pandemic, Sushant Singh Rajput’s death exploded onto the scene. It wasn’t just a tragedy; it became a lightning rod for something far more unsettling: a full-blown conspiracy theory storm. 

Honestly, I remember scrolling through Twitter, feeling a knot tighten in my stomach. Suddenly, everyone had an opinion, a theory, a ‘truth’ – often wildly disconnected from reality. It felt like a giant echo chamber, amplifying anger and suspicion instead of offering genuine support for a grieving family. 

The media portrayal was, frankly, chaotic. Every detail was dissected, debated, and twisted. It was exhausting. And what really bothered me was the way critical thinking seemed to vanish. People weren’t asking *how* – they were demanding *who* was to blame. 

It felt like a collective retreat from empathy, replaced by a desperate need to find a narrative, any narrative, that offered simple answers to a profoundly complex situation. It was a stark reminder that grief can be a powerful catalyst for misinformation, and that social media, while connecting us, can also isolate us in our own, increasingly polarized, viewpoints.  I still think about it, and it’s a lesson I carry with me.
