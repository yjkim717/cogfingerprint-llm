>Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the provided keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational tone, clear storytelling, and a 2020 context.  I've focused on the feeling of online pressure and self-blame that often arose during that time.  I've included a couple of options – one slightly more melancholic, one a bit more hopeful. Choose whichever best suits the overall tone you're going for.

**Option 1: (More Melancholic)**

## The Algorithm & My Own Fault?

It’s 2020, and honestly, the constant scroll is exhausting. I keep seeing everyone else seemingly *thriving* – perfect homes, endless travel pics (pre-pandemic, of course!), flawless relationships. And then I look at my own feed, a chaotic mess of half-finished projects and cancelled plans. 

I’ve started to feel... corrosive, somehow. Like I'm a little black hole, sucking the joy out of everything. Did I somehow *cause* this feeling of stagnation? It’s a ridiculous thought, I know, but the pressure is real. Every missed opportunity feels like a personal failing, every setback a confirmation that I'm just destined to ruin things. Maybe it’s just the echo chamber of social media, but the self-blame is a constant companion these days. It’s a heavy weight.

**Option 2: (Slightly More Hopeful)**

## Unfollowing the Narrative

Remember 2020? It felt like the world was crumbling in slow motion. I definitely felt it. I got caught in this trap of comparing my behind-the-scenes to everyone else’s highlight reel on Instagram. Suddenly, everything felt like *my* fault. A project didn’t launch? I ruined it. A friendship felt strained? It was because of me. 

It was a destructive spiral. But I realized something: social media wasn’t showing the full picture. We were *all* struggling. So, I started unfollowing the narrative. I stopped measuring myself against curated perfection and started focusing on small wins, on being kinder to myself. It’s still a work in progress, but the corrosive self-blame is starting to fade.

**Notes on these drafts:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "honestly," "I realized something," and contractions to create a more informal feel.
*   **Clear Storytelling:** Each option tells a mini-story of recognizing the problem and, in Option 2, beginning to address it.
*   **2020 Context:** The references to the pandemic and the nature of social media use in 2020 are woven in.
*   **Keywords:** The underlying themes of ruin, destruction, failure, corrosive feelings, and self-blame are present throughout.



I hope one of these works for you! Let me know if you'd like me to adjust anything.
