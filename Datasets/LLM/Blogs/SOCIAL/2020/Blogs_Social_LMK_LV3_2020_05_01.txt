As I set up my LG C9 with my shiny new NVIDIA 3080 in 2020, I was stoked to game at 4K 120Hz. But, to my dismay, G-Sync wasn't an option. I dug deep, only to discover I wasn't alone. Many were struggling with HDMI 2.1 compatibility issues. It got me thinking - is the pursuit of seamless gaming worth the frustration that comes with it? Is perfection worth the tech headaches?
