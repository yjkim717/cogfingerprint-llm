The first time I hit “block,” my thumb hovered over the screen for a full minute. It was late 2020, a year that had already stripped so much away, and here I was, consciously severing another tie. The silence that followed was the loudest thing I’d ever heard—a roaring quiet filled not with peace, but with a heavy, complicated guilt.

I wasn’t blocking a monster. I was blocking the person who used to make me laugh until I cried, the one who knew my coffee order by heart and had a playlist for every one of my bad moods. That’s the cruel heart of **narcissistic abuse**; it’s a poison wrapped in the beautiful, familiar packaging of **friendship**. You don’t miss the manipulation; you miss the person you thought was behind it all.

The pandemic had turned our social lives into a digital fishbowl, and in that confined space, her patterns became impossible to ignore. A compliment would be swiftly followed by a subtle dig about my life choices. My excitement about a new project would be met with a story about her own, far more impressive, endeavor. It was a constant, low-grade emotional tremor, designed to keep me off-balance and seeking her approval. The **emotional trauma** wasn’t from one big explosion; it was the cumulative effect of a thousand tiny paper cuts.

For months, I made excuses. “She’s just stressed.” “2020 is hard on everyone.” I contorted myself into a pretzel to accommodate her moods, thinking flexibility was the key to saving the friendship. But I was the only one bending. My needs were consistently sidelined, my feelings dismissed as oversensitivity. I was pouring all my energy into a black hole, and I was running on empty.

The concept of **boundaries** always sounded so rigid to me, like building a wall. But I’ve learned it’s not about shutting people out; it’s about drawing a line in the sand around your own well-being and saying, “You cannot cross this and still have access to me.” Creating that boundary was the hardest part. It felt cruel, like I was failing at being a “good,” forgiving friend.

But the moment I enacted it—the final, digital “block”—was the moment I finally chose myself. The relief was immediate and physical, a weight lifting from my chest that I hadn’t even realized was there. It was the relief of no longer waiting for the next backhanded compliment, of no longer having to decode a cryptic text, of reclaiming my own mental real estate.

The guilt still visits sometimes, a ghost at the feast of my newfound peace. I miss the memory of her. But I don’t miss the walking on eggshells. I’m learning that a friendship that costs you your peace is not a friendship; it’s a transaction where you are the only one paying. And in a year that taught us all the profound value of peace, that was a price I could no longer afford.
