>## The Weight of "Just Friends" in a Pandemic Year

It's 2020, and connection feels… complicated, doesn't it? Beyond the usual anxieties of putting yourself out there, there’s this layer of cautious distance, of scheduled video calls instead of spontaneous coffee dates. I've been wrestling with that lately.

There's this guy, Liam, who's visiting from out of state. We met briefly years ago, and I’ve always had this quiet… something. Now, with him here, it's bubbling up. But the fear of rejection is a heavy blanket. What if I risk it and he just wants to be friends? 

Honestly, the thought of *just* being friends right now, after building up this little hope, feels almost worse than the rejection itself. It’s a strange kind of limbo, navigating possibility while bracing for the comfortable familiarity of platonic distance. Maybe 2020 is just amplifying all our anxieties.
