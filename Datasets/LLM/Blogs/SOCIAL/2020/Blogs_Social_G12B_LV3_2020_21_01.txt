## The Tightrope Walk of Maybe

Okay, real talk. A friend of a friend – let's call her Sarah – dropped a little bomb on me last week. I tentatively floated the idea of asking her out, and her response? "I'd love to be friends!" with a *but* hanging in the air. Apparently, she’s not sure if she’s ready for dating right now, but a friendship is definitely on the table. 

It's 2020, and navigating connection feels complicated enough already. Add in the potential for the dreaded "friend zone," and the possibility she might already be seeing someone, and suddenly I’m walking a tightrope. Do I respect her boundaries and pull back? Or do I explore this potential friendship, risking awkwardness and maybe even a little heartache down the line? Anyone else ever felt this stuck? What would *you* do?
