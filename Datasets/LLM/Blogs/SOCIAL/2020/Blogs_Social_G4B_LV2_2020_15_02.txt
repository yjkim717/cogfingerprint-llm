**The Ghosts in My Old Messenger Window**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How certain moments, tiny little pockets of time, can just *stick* with you?  I was scrolling through my old Facebook Messenger archive the other day – a truly bizarre experience, like excavating a digital time capsule – and it hit me with a wave of nostalgia for something I hadn’t consciously thought about in years. 

I remembered this game. Not a grand, epic adventure, but a simple side-scrolling platformer. The graphics were gloriously pixelated – blocky trees, chunky mushrooms, the whole nine yards. It was from that sweet spot of gaming history, roughly 1995 to 2004, a time when PC games felt genuinely *new*.  It was a kids’ game, really, but it held a certain charm; a forest setting full of hidden secrets and frustratingly difficult jumps. 

What really brought it back wasn’t the gameplay itself, but *how* I played it. I wasn’t playing it alone. It was late 2002, and my best friend, Liam, and I were spending hours trying to beat it, coordinating our moves through Messenger. We’d type furiously, frantically strategizing, celebrating tiny victories with a string of exclamation points and laughing emojis (yes, emojis existed then!). 

It wasn't about the game *itself*, not really. It was about that shared experience, that feeling of being completely present with someone else, even across a screen. It felt like a little, perfectly contained world we created together. 

Looking back, I realize it’s a really poignant reminder of how much of our social lives – and our memories – are built on these small, imperfect connections. It’s a reminder to appreciate those digital ghosts in our old messenger windows – the echoes of friendships formed and moments shared.
