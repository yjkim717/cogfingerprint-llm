### The Carry That Cost Me My Joy

I still remember my best game. It was late 2020, and my world, like everyone else’s, had shrunk to the size of my apartment. My PC was my portal to another life, and that night, I was untouchable. Every shot landed, every strategy unfolded perfectly. I was single-handedly carrying my team to a victory we had no business winning. The digital battlefield was my stage, and for twenty glorious minutes, I was its master.

Then, there was *the voice*.

Through the crackle of voice chat, a single teammate—let’s call him “Tox”—started his symphony of complaints. Nothing was ever his fault. He’d rush in alone, die instantly, and then screech about our lack of teamwork. The irony was thick enough to cut with a knife. Here I was, performing at my absolute peak, and all I could hear was a constant stream of negativity directed at me and everyone else.

We won. My stats were phenomenal, the objective was secured, and the victory screen flashed brightly. But the high was gone. That incredible, hard-fought win felt hollow. The frustration from Tox’s relentless toxicity had completely overshadowed the triumph.

It made me reflect on our strange, new socially-distanced reality. We were all seeking connection in these virtual spaces, looking for a team to belong to, even temporarily. Yet, one person’s choice to vent their own frustrations could poison the entire well. That match taught me that in 2020, more than ever, being a good teammate wasn’t about having the best stats. It was about the basic, human decency of not ruining someone else’s escape. I carried the game, but he carried the negativity, and in the end, his was the heavier burden. I’d take a loss with a kind team over a win like that any day.
