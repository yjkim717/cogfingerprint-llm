## The Weight of a Blocked Number: When Friendship Turns Toxic

2020. What a year, right? We all had to navigate so much – lockdowns, anxieties about the future, a constant stream of… *everything*.  It felt like the world was collectively holding its breath. And amidst all that, I was quietly battling something intensely personal, something that felt just as heavy as the global uncertainty: a friendship that had slowly, insidiously, become a source of profound pain.

It started so beautifully. We met through a mutual friend a couple of years prior, and initially, everything felt effortless. Shared interests, late-night talks, a genuine sense of connection. I genuinely believed I'd found someone who *got* me. Someone I could lean on. We were each other's rocks, or so I thought.

But over time, things shifted. Subtle at first. Little digs disguised as jokes. Constant need for reassurance, followed by accusations of not caring enough when I couldn’t provide the endless validation they seemed to crave. It was like walking on eggshells, always second-guessing myself, analyzing every interaction for potential triggers. 

Then came the manipulation. The guilt trips. The way they'd twist situations to make *me* feel responsible for *their* emotions. “If you really cared, you would…” followed by a demand that felt increasingly unreasonable.  And the threats, veiled at first, then becoming more direct. Promises of fallout if I didn't comply. It created this constant, low-level hum of anxiety in my chest. I felt trapped, obligated.

I knew, logically, that this wasn't healthy. That a true friend wouldn't systematically erode your self-esteem and make you question your own sanity. But the cognitive dissonance was powerful. I kept clinging to the memory of that initial connection, that feeling of genuine friendship.  I convinced myself that they were just going through a tough time, that I could fix it, that my loyalty was enough. 

The self-harm wasn’t directed at myself, but it was a consequence. The constant stress and emotional exhaustion manifested in other ways – neglecting my own needs, isolating myself further, feeling perpetually drained. It was a slow, silent erosion of my wellbeing.

Finally, after months of agonizing, I blocked their number. It felt… drastic.  Guilty.  Like I was abandoning them. Like I was the bad person. The fear was palpable – what if they lashed out? What if they exposed me?  

But beneath the fear, there was a fragile sense of relief. A small pocket of space where I could finally breathe.

It’s been a few weeks now. The initial wave of anxiety has subsided, replaced by a quiet sadness. I mourn the loss of what *could* have been, the friendship I thought I had. But I'm also starting to recognize that mourning is a necessary part of healing.

Setting boundaries is hard, especially when it involves people you care about. And severing a connection, even a toxic one
