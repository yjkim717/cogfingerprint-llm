### The Year the Walls Talked Back

2020 was the year we all got a little too familiar with our own four walls. At first, it was a novelty. Then, the silence set in. And in that silence, the internal noise became deafening.

I remember staring into my bathroom mirror one morning, the steam from the shower clinging to the glass. As it cleared, I didn't just see my tired face; I felt the weight of every unspoken worry, every suppressed fear. It was like looking into a psychological echo chamber. The world had pressed pause, but the internal struggle was on fast-forward. The news cycle was a relentless drumbeat of anxiety, and the isolation made it feel like we were each trapped in our own private hell.

We were all fighting battles no one could see. For some, that battle left marks—not always visible to the naked eye, but scars nonetheless. The emotional pain of loneliness, the grief for a world that felt like it was slipping away, the constant, low-grade hum of uncertainty. It was a collective trauma we were navigating alone, together.

But here’s what I learned in that brutal year: the first step out of that hell isn't a giant leap; it's a whisper. It's admitting, even just to yourself, "This is hard. I am not okay." It’s sending a text that says, "Hey, are you struggling too?" It’s realizing that our mental health isn't a solitary fortress, but a shared garden that needs tending.

We are more than our darkest moments. 2020 taught me that our scars, both seen and unseen, are not signs of brokenness, but proof of a fierce, internal survival. And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is to let a little light into the room.
