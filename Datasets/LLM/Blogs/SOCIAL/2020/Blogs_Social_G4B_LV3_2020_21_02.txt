**The Static of Feeling Lost**

Remember 2020? It felt like wading through a constant, low-level static.  Partly because of the pandemic, but also… partly because of social media. I was scrolling, desperately trying to *understand* everyone else’s highlight reel, comparing my messy reality to their perfectly curated feeds. 

It was like that physics quiz – trying to grasp this instantaneous, idealized voltage reading when all I felt was a dull, persistent hum of anxiety. The multimeter showed a stable number, but the oscilloscope revealed a chaotic burst of signals.  I was getting the 'RMS' value, the average, but completely missing the *feeling* of the moment.

I realized then that social media was giving me an "instantaneous" view of everyone’s lives, a snapshot without the context of the struggle. It was easy to feel inadequate, like my own voltage was consistently low.  It took actively stepping away, turning off the notifications, and focusing on the quiet, messy moments of my own life to find a sense of balance.  Sometimes, you just need to look beyond the screen to truly understand.
