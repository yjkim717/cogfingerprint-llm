It’s 2020, and I’m three weeks into testosterone. I wasn’t prepared for the first tingles of bottom growth—a strange, new sensitivity that made even simple movements feel significant. Masturbation became a rediscovery, not just of pleasure, but of my own changing body. I’m learning these sensations are a normal, expected part of the journey. It’s a quiet, personal evolution, and I’m just starting to embrace it.
