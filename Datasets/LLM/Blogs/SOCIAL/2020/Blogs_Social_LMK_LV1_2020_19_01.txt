**The Troll Tamer: My Experiment with IT Cell Members on Twitter**

As I scrolled through my Twitter feed in the summer of 2020, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration. Amidst the chaos of the pandemic, the India-China border tensions, and the growing divisiveness in the country, my timeline was filled with vitriolic tweets from IT cell members - a term used to describe the online trolls allegedly employed by the ruling party to shape public opinion.

These individuals, often hiding behind pseudonyms and profile pictures, would spew hate and misinformation with reckless abandon. But what struck me was their eerie uniformity - the same talking points, the same hashtags, and the same condescending tone. It was as if they were following a script.

I decided to experiment. I began engaging with these IT cell members on Twitter, but not in the way one might expect. Instead of directly confronting them, I used a provocative technique - I asked them questions. Not just any questions, but ones that challenged their assumptions and forced them to think critically about their views.

To my surprise, it worked. Some of them began to reveal their biases, while others started to question their own stance. The more I engaged, the more I realized that these individuals were not just mindless trolls, but people who had been fed a diet of misinformation and propaganda.

This experience made me reflect on the role of social media in shaping our discourse. As we rely more and more on paid media to shape public opinion, are we creating echo chambers that reinforce our existing biases? And what about secularism - a value that is supposed to be the bedrock of our democracy? Are we paying lip service to it, or are we truly committed to fostering a culture of inclusivity and respect?

My Twitter experiment was not a solution to these problems, but it was a start. It showed me that even in the midst of chaos, there is always room for conversation, for questioning, and for growth. And as we navigate the complexities of the digital age, it's more important than ever to stay vigilant, to challenge our assumptions, and to engage with others in a spirit of openness and curiosity.
