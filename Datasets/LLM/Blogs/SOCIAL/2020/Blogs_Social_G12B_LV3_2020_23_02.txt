## Why I'm Still Thinking About Killing Stalking (and Yes, I Ship Them)

Okay, let's be real. The ending of *Killing Stalking*… wow. It sparked *so* much debate online, and I’ve been wrestling with it ever since. It's messy, it's disturbing, and it definitely pushes boundaries. I get why people are upset. But I also found myself surprisingly moved. 

Maybe it’s because, despite the darkness, the characters are unbelievably complex. You can't help but feel something for them, even when they're making terrible choices. And yes, I'll admit it – I ship them. I know, I know, controversial! But beneath all the toxicity, there's a twisted, damaged connection. It’s a lot to unpack, but it’s stuck with me in a way few stories do.
