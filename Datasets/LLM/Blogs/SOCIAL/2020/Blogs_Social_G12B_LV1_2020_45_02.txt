## My Travel Tech Fail (and a Lesson in Magnetism)

Remember those early days of Magsafe with the iPhone 12? I was *so* excited. Then, on a trip to Charleston last fall (2020, of course â€“ travel was looking different then!), I had a mini-crisis. My hotel key stopped working. Turns out, my AirPods case, clinging to my phone via Magsafe, was messing with the magnetic stripe! Who knew? It was a bizarre, slightly stressful moment, but a good reminder: technology is amazing, but sometimes you need to think about how it *interacts* with the world around us. Definitely learned to keep those keys separate!



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
