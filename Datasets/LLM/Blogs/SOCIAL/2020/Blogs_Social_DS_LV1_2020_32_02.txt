### The Unwanted Commentary on My Existence

It’s 2020. The world is on fire, and I’m getting a direct message from a distant relative about my haircut.

It’s not the first time. It’s a pattern I know all too well. A lifetime of unsolicited commentary on my appearance, my clothes, my very personality. “That’s a bold choice,” they’d say about my thrift-store jacket. “You’d be so much prettier if you smiled more,” a near-stranger once advised. “Are you sure you want to wear that?” has been the soundtrack to my life.

Each comment, seemingly small on its own, was like a paper cut. You barely feel the first one, but after a thousand, you’re just raw. I started second-guessing my instincts. Was my personal style really just a series of mistakes waiting for public correction? The social pressure to conform, to fit into a neat, easily digestible box, felt immense. It chipped away at my self-esteem, making me feel like my body and my choices were public property, open for debate and improvement.

The lockdowns of 2020 created a strange, unexpected sanctuary. Removed from the daily gauntlet of opinions, I finally had the space to just *be*. I wore what felt good, I didn’t perform a personality for an office, and my smile became a genuine reaction, not a forced courtesy.

Now, as we tentatively step back into the world, I’m holding onto that quiet confidence. The unsolicited advice will likely return, but my perspective has shifted. My appearance isn’t an open forum. My style is my story, and I’m no longer accepting edits from uninvited co-authors.
