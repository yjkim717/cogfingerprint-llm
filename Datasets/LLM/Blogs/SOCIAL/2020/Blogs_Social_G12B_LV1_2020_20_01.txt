>## The Lingering Echo of Grandma's Kitchen

It’s 2020, and suddenly, being disconnected feels… amplified. We're all craving connection, and for me, that craving’s led me back to Mandarin. My grandma, she emigrated from China decades ago, and her kitchen was always a symphony of sizzling woks and rapid-fire conversations I only half-understood. I absorbed some, definitely, just by osmosis, but never really *learned*.

Now, I’m feeling this pull, this desire to reconnect with that part of my heritage. But where to start? Online classes are pricey, and honestly, fitting them into my already crammed schedule feels impossible. I’ve been trying to dip my toes in with Chinese dramas – subtitles on, of course! – but it's slow going.

It’s funny, isn’t it? We’re all searching for ways to feel closer to something, whether it’s family, culture, or just a sense of belonging. Maybe fluency isn't the goal right now. Maybe it's just about understanding a little more of the stories Grandma used to tell, and feeling a little closer to her memory.
