"Blast from the Past: Uncovering a Forgotten Childhood Obsession"

As I watched my kids play Rocket League in 2020, I was suddenly transported back to my own childhood. I vaguely remembered a game that came bundled with Diablo in a old PC gaming magazine. The thrill of unwrapping the CD, installing it, and diving into a world of high-speed action has stayed with me. I'm on a mission to rediscover that game, and relive the kid memories that have been lingering in the depths of my nostalgia. Can you help me uncover the forgotten gem that sparked my gaming passion?
