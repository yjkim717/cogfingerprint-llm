>## Mother's Day & A Little Bit of Different

This year, Mother's Day feels… different. With restaurants still navigating closures, the usual brunch plans are off the table. It got me thinking - maybe "different" isn't bad? We're being pushed to get creative. Maybe a picnic in the backyard, a home-cooked meal, or even a heartfelt, handwritten letter? It’s a chance to show Mom love in a truly unique way.
