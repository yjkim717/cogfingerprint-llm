The Burrito Trap: How I Conditioned Myself into a Cycle of Cravings. 

As I sat on my couch in the summer of 2020, clutching my stomach and regretting the giant burrito I had devoured just hours before, I realized I had a problem. It wasn't just the burrito; it was the pattern that had led me to it. You see, I had inadvertently conditioned myself to crave those cheesy, savory bundles of joy every time a migraine was brewing. It started innocently enough - a comforting bowl of Mexican food after a long day or a late-night burrito run to soothe a headache. But before I knew it, my brain had made a Pavlovian connection between the pain and the pleasure.

Every time I felt a migraine coming on, my brain would start screaming for a burrito. And, more often than not, I'd give in, hoping the food would somehow magically alleviate the pain. But all it did was wreak havoc on my stomach, drain my wallet, and negatively impact my overall health. It was a vicious cycle, and I was stuck in it.

It wasn't until I took a step back and examined my behavior that I realized the extent of my self-conditioning. I had created a harmful association between comfort food and pain relief. Breaking the cycle wasn't easy, but recognizing the pattern was the first step. Now, I'm working on retraining my brain to find healthier ways to cope with migraines. It's a journey, but one I'm determined to take, burrito-free.
