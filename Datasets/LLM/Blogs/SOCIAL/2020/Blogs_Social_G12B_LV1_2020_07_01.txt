## The Unexpected Comfort of Hearing Myself

It’s 2020, and we’re all doing a *lot* of talking into our phones, aren’t we? Zoom calls, voice notes, leaving messages… I've always cringed a little when I listened back to recordings of myself. Vanity, I guess? The usual self-critical spiral.

But something shifted recently. A friend sent back a voice note, genuinely laughing at something I’d said. It was a small thing, but it sparked something. I re-listened to it, and instead of the usual cringe, I felt…content. 

It’s wild, but hearing my own voice, knowing it brought someone joy, actually felt…good. Maybe it’s the isolation of this year, the craving for connection, but I’m finding a surprising comfort in just *hearing* myself, validated by the appreciation of those I care about. It’s a small shift, but a welcome one.
