## That MLK Day Soul Food Question… and a Little Bit of Worry

Okay, so here's a slightly awkward thought we've been wrestling with. It’s 2020, and Martin Luther King Jr. Day is coming up. We absolutely adore soul food – seriously, we cook it regularly and find so much joy in the flavors and traditions. But… is it okay to host a gathering centered around it on *that* day? 

We’ve been doing a lot of thinking about cultural appreciation versus appropriation, and honestly, it’s a tricky line. We don't want to unintentionally disrespect the history and significance of MLK Day or the cultural roots of this incredible cuisine. 

It's not about intention, right? It's about impact. We want to celebrate, to honor, and to learn, not to inadvertently cause offense. We're still figuring this out, and open to hearing your thoughts. What are your experiences navigating similar situations? Let's chat in the comments – genuinely curious to learn from each other.
