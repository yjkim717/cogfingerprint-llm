**Scrolling Through a Strange Year**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2020 was… a lot. Remember how everyone was glued to their phones? Seriously glued. I found myself endlessly scrolling, comparing my suddenly-empty-apartment life to everyone else’s “perfect” quarantine updates. It felt exhausting, a constant chase after an unattainable ideal. 

Then, I started carving out little pockets of time for myself – a quick at-home workout (inspired by a friend’s routine, honestly!), and actually *cooking* something healthy instead of ordering in. It wasn’t about weight loss, really, but about building a small, consistent routine. 

It felt like a tiny act of self-improvement, a way to push back against the noise.  Maybe disconnecting for a bit, and focusing on the small wins, was the best way to navigate the chaos. What about you? How did you find grounding in 2020?
