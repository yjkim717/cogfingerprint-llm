Looking back at 2020, I remember those first weeks on T—the strange, new sensations down there. Was this bottom growth? Was it normal to feel so aware of my own body? I’d scroll forums late at night, desperate for someone to say, “Yes, that’s part of it.” It’s a journey of becoming, and those early, private changes were the first whispers of the man I was becoming. You’re not alone in wondering.
