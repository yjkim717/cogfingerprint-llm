### The Invisible Weight

It’s 2020, and my world has shrunk to the four walls of my apartment. Everyone is talking about the “new normal” of isolation, but for me, this constant, low-grade dread feels strangely familiar. This is just life with chronic migraine.

I’ve learned to function through the pain. I can answer emails while my vision blurs at the edges, and I’ve perfected the art of the “I’m fine” smile during a Zoom call. But that’s the trap, isn’t it? Because I’m upright and productive, a friend will say, “Wow, you look great! Your migraines must be better.”

And I just want to scream.

The assumption that because I’m not curled in a dark room, I must be cured, is its own special kind of pain. My pain is a constant, humming background noise to my entire existence. Pushing through isn’t a sign of recovery; it’s a survival tactic. This year has taught everyone about invisible struggles in a way I never expected. I just wish the lesson extended to understanding that sometimes, the person who seems “fine” is carrying the heaviest weight.
