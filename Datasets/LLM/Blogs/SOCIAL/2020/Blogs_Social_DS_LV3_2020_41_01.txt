It’s 2020, and honestly, we could all use a little musical magic right now. I was scrolling through clips of Kang Daniel and Park Jihyo last night, and I couldn’t help but imagine them sharing a stage. His voice is so soft and comforting, like a warm blanket, while hers is this powerful, soaring force that gives you chills.

What if they did a duet? I pictured them trading verses—his gentle tone pulling you in, then her powerhouse vocals lifting the whole song to another level. In a year where connection feels scarce, the idea of their voices blending, creating something beautiful together, feels symbolic. It’s more than just a performance; it’s a reminder that different strengths can harmonize into something truly breathtaking. Sometimes, the most moving moments come from unexpected collaborations, and right now, that’s a hopeful thought worth holding onto.
