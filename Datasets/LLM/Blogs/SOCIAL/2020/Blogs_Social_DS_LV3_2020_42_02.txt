The bell above the door chimed, a sound I’d heard a thousand times. It was a slow Tuesday in 2020, a year that already felt like it had the volume turned up too high. I was restocking shelves, my mind on case numbers and mask mandates, when he walked in.

He was just a customer, but the weight of the gun on his hip was impossible to ignore. My friendly, “Can I help you find anything?” stuck in my throat. The air in the store changed, becoming thin and sharp. Every interaction felt like walking on glass. I went through the motions, my retail smile plastered on, while my heart hammered a frantic rhythm against my ribs. All I could think was, *Does he have a permit? Is anyone safe?*

It was only after he left, the tension evaporating with the chime of the door, that we did what we’d never done before: we looked him up. A few clicks later, and his criminal history flashed on the screen. The chill that went through me had nothing to do with the store’s AC.

That moment changed everything. It wasn’t just about one man; it was about the silent contract we all assume in public spaces. We drafted a new store policy the next day, a simple line about safety and respect. It felt small, almost insignificant. But in a year where we were all grasping for control, it was a way to reclaim a sliver of it. It made me realize that safety isn’t just a feeling; sometimes, it has to be a rule, quietly written to protect the peace we so easily take for granted.
