The Unseen Cost of a Side Hustle: A Cautionary Tale

As I sipped coffee with my friend in early 2020, I couldn't help but notice the Arbonne catalog peeking out of her bag. She had been deeply invested in the multi-level marketing (MLM) company for months, touting the benefits of their skincare line and the potential for passive income. At first, I was supportive, thinking it was a harmless side hustle. But as the weeks went by, I watched her pour more and more money into Arbonne, buying inventory, attending seminars, and recruiting others to join her team. The financial strain was starting to show, and I worried she'd lose money, not just cash, but time and relationships too. I feared her focus on building her downline was becoming an all-consuming endeavor. As a friend, it's hard to watch someone get caught up in the promise of easy money, only to risk losing themselves in the process.
