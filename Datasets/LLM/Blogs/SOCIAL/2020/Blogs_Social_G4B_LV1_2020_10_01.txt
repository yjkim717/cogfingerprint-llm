**The Quiet Persistence of Wild Things**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How we’re all glued to screens in 2020, chasing connection, but sometimes the most interesting things happen when you step away. I’ve been utterly consumed lately by a baker in a small village in Vietnam – he’s trying to coax wild yeast into life for his bread. Five days of observation, a lot of patience, and frankly, a whole lot of failed starters. 

It’s made me think about social connection too. We’re so used to instant likes and fleeting comments, but genuine connection feels… slower. Like nurturing something delicate, like that yeast. It’s about the quiet persistence of watching, waiting, and letting things develop naturally.  Maybe we need to spend a little more time just *being* with the process, instead of always demanding an immediate reaction.  It’s oddly comforting.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps explore a slightly different angle?
