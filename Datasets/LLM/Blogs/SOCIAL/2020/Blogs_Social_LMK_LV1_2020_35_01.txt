**Reclaiming My Sanity: One Month After Cutting Ties**

It's hard to believe it's been a month since I blocked her on all social media platforms. The decision wasn't taken lightly, but after months of emotional turmoil and toxic interactions, I knew it was necessary. My friend, or rather, the person I thought was my friend, had been manipulating me for what felt like an eternity. The constant belittling, the guilt trips, and the emotional blackmail had taken a toll on my mental health.

At first, the relief was palpable. I felt like I had finally taken back control of my life, and I was determined to move on. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into a month, I started to feel a pang of guilt. Was I being too harsh? Had I overreacted? Should I have given her another chance? The questions swirled in my head, making it difficult to shake off the feeling that I had done something wrong.

It's ironic that in 2020, a year that's supposed to be about empowerment and self-love, I'm still grappling with the aftermath of a toxic friendship. Social media is flooded with messages of self-care and boundary-setting, but putting those principles into practice is a different story altogether. I've come to realize that setting boundaries is not just about protecting myself from others, but also about being kind to myself.

As I reflect on the past few months, I can see the signs were there all along. The way she would constantly need me to validate her emotions, the way she would turn every conversation into a drama-filled spectacle, and the way she would make me feel guilty for not being available 24/7. It was a classic case of narcissistic abuse, and I was the unsuspecting victim.

Cutting ties wasn't easy, but it was necessary. I'm not saying it was a straightforward process; there were many sleepless nights and moments of self-doubt. But with time, I've come to understand that my decision was not about being cruel or heartless; it was about reclaiming my sanity. By blocking her, I was able to break free from the toxic cycle and start focusing on my own healing.

If you're reading this and struggling with a similar situation, I want you to know that you're not alone. It's okay to prioritize your own emotional well-being, even if it means making tough decisions. It's okay to set boundaries and say no to people who are draining your energy. And it's okay to take time to heal and reflect on the experience. One month down, and many more to go â€“ I'm taking it one day at a time, and I'm finally starting to feel like myself again.
