## The Ghost of a Memory, and the Weight of Ruin

I was talking to my grandmother the other day, and she mentioned a film she'd seen as a girl, something haunting and in black and white. It sparked a weirdly specific memory in me – a fleeting image of a child, small and solitary, navigating a landscape of rubble. It wasn't a memory of *seeing* the film, more like a feeling, an echo passed down through generations. 

It got me thinking about how trauma, even secondhand trauma, can embed itself in our collective consciousness. My grandmother lived through the anxieties of the Cold War, the shadow of WWII still long across the landscape. That film, whatever it was, likely reflected those fears, amplified them visually. 

We’re facing our own version of that now, aren't we? 2020 has felt like living in a ruined area, emotionally and socially. And I wonder, what images will *our* children carry with them, what ghosts of this year will linger in their memories, long after the headlines fade?
