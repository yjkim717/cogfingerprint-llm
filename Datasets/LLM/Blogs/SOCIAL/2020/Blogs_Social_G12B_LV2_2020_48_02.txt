Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and a ~106 word count, set in the 2020 context:

## Is Coastline Really Destiny? 

It's 2020, and I've been thinking a lot about where innovation *actually* happens. I remember reading something recently about Boston and the Bay Area – tons of brilliant tech students on the East Coast, yet Silicon Valley still dominates. It got me wondering: is it just about location? 

Maybe it's the network effect, the sheer density of risk-takers, the culture of “move fast and break things.” Or maybe it’s something less tangible.  I feel like we, as creators, sometimes overthink geography.  Ultimately, building something amazing starts with an idea and the grit to see it through, doesn't it?

**Notes on why I wrote it this way:**

*   **Conversational:** Uses phrases like "I've been thinking," "got me wondering," and asks rhetorical questions.
*   **Reflective:**  It's not just stating facts; it's exploring a personal thought process.
*   **Relatable:** It connects to a common question about success and location.
*   **2020 Context:**  Mentioning "it's 2020" grounds it in the time.
*   **Storytelling:**  It starts with a hook (reading something) and builds towards a conclusion.
