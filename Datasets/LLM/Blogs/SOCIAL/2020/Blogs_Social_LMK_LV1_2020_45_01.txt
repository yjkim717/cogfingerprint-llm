"As I navigated the uncharted territory of remote work in 2020, I realized that establishing a routine was key to staying sane. By creating a dedicated workspace and sticking to a 9-to-5 schedule, I was able to separate work from personal life. It wasn't always easy, but it boosted my productivity and reduced the feeling of burnout. By maintaining a normal work routine while working from home, I was able to thrive in the new reality of remote work and achieve a better work-life balance."
