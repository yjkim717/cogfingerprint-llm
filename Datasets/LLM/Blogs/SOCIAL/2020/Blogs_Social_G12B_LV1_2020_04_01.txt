## The Static in the Feed, and the Quiet in My Head

It's… a lot right now, isn't it? 2020. We’re all living it. Pandemic, political upheaval, a constant stream of bad news scrolling past on our phones. Remember when everyone was baking sourdough and doing TikTok dances? Feels like a lifetime ago, almost a different planet.

I found myself, a few months back, just… disappearing. Not physically, obviously. I was still going through the motions – working from home, ordering groceries online, attempting to water my sad little succulent. But *inside*, it felt like the volume had been turned way down. Everything was muted, gray. And the quiet wasn't peaceful. It was heavy. Oppressive.

I’d spend hours just staring at my phone, endlessly scrolling through Instagram, seeing everyone else’s perfectly curated lives. Vacations (that didn’t exist for most of us), delicious meals, smiling faces, seemingly endless optimism. And I'd feel this… ache. A deep, hollow ache that had nothing to do with hunger and everything to do with… well, I didn't really know *what* it was to do with.

It felt like I was sinking. A slow, silent descent into something murky and cold. The joy in things I used to love – reading, painting, even just a sunny afternoon – just… vanished.  I started having these thoughts, dark whispers in the quiet spaces of my mind. Thoughts I won’t go into detail about, but they were unsettling, and they scared me.

I realized I was trying to fill this internal void with the noise of social media. But the noise just amplified the emptiness. It was like trying to fill a bottomless pit with pebbles. 

What helped, surprisingly, was *putting the phone down*. Really putting it down. Going for walks without it. Talking to my sister, even though it was awkward and I didn't want to burden her.  Just acknowledging that I wasn’t okay.

I'm still not okay, not entirely. There are days when the grayness returns, when the quiet threatens to swallow me whole. But I’m learning to recognize it, to reach out, to breathe. And I'm learning that comparing myself to the highlight reels on social media is a recipe for disaster. We're all fighting our own battles, even the ones who look like they have it all figured out.

If you’re feeling like you’re sinking, please, please reach out. You're not alone.
