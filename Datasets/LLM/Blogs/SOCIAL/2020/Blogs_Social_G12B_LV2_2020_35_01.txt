## The Weight of a Blocked Number (and a Lot of Conflicted Feelings)

Remember 2020? The year the world collectively held its breath, the year routines shattered, and the year… well, for me, it was also the year I finally hit block on someone I considered a friend. It feels weird even typing that out, even now, nearly four years later.

I’d always prided myself on being a good friend. Loyal, supportive, the one who showed up. So, when this friendship started to feel…off, I initially brushed it aside. Small inconsistencies, minor manipulations – I chalked it up to quirks, to stress, to everything *but* what it actually was. It was a slow creep, a gradual erosion of my own sense of self.

Looking back, it’s clearer than ever. There were the subtle digs disguised as jokes, the constant need for validation, the way conversations always seemed to circle back to *them* and their problems. Then came the more blatant things: the outright lies, the emotional blackmail, the thinly veiled threats if I didn’t do what they wanted. It was a masterclass in manipulation, and I was, embarrassingly, the student.

The pandemic, ironically, amplified everything. Suddenly, we were all hyper-focused on connection, on reaching out, on supporting each other through a global crisis.  And this friend, despite being a source of so much anxiety for me, leaned in *hard*. Demanding my time, my energy, my ear for endless venting, all while offering very little in return. 

Reaching the point of blocking them wasn’t a dramatic explosion. It was a quiet, exhausted decision born from months of debilitating anxiety and a growing realization that my own well-being was on the line. I remember staring at my phone, my finger hovering over the block button, feeling a ridiculous mix of relief and gut-wrenching guilt. 

Guilt. That’s been the persistent visitor since then.  Did I overreact? Was I being too sensitive? Maybe I should just try to talk it out… again? The insidious voice of the narcissist, even absent, still whispers doubts. 

It’s been a long process of untangling the web of manipulation, of rebuilding my boundaries, of learning to trust my own intuition. Therapy has been invaluable. Talking to other people who've experienced similar situations has been a lifeline.

I’m sharing this not for sympathy, but because I know I’m not alone.  We all have those relationships that drain us, that chip away at our self-worth.  And sometimes, the bravest, most necessary thing you can do is protect yourself, even if it means hitting block and grappling with the messy, complicated feelings that follow.  It’s okay to prioritize your own peace. You deserve it.
