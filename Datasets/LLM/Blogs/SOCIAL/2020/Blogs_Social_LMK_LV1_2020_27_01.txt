As I navigated my early twenties in 2020, I found myself daydreaming about escaping the chaos of city life. With a weekly income ranging from $530 to $650, I wondered if I could afford a small, secluded house. The thought of ditching lot rent and a hefty truck payment was enticing. I considered refinancing options, but the numbers didn't quite add up. Was it feasible to own a peaceful retreat on a modest income? I turned to online forums, seeking advice from those who'd tread a similar path, and learned that with careful planning, my dream wasn't entirely out of reach.
