**The Weight of a Platinum Trophy**

Remember 2020? Online gaming was *everything*. I was obsessed with chasing those platinum trophies – the digital badges of accomplishment. But lately, I’ve been feeling a strange mix of pride and… disappointment. So many games, once buzzing with life on their servers, just… died.

Suddenly, that achievement feels a little hollow. It made me think about how much we value these external markers of success, and how fleeting online connections can be.
