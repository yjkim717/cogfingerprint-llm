**The Day My Little Leo Almost Didn’t Make It**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2020 was *rough* for everyone. But amidst all the uncertainty and Zoom calls, there was a tiny, terrifying moment that hit me right in the gut. It involved my ginger tabby, Leo, and a whole lot of frantic Googling.

He’d suddenly been listless, refusing his food, and just…off. Within hours, he was vomiting and shivering. It was awful.  I honestly panicked, scrolling through endless articles about cat food poisoning and worried sick. 

What really stuck with me wasn’t the diagnosis, but the desperate need to get him hydrated.  I started with small, frequent amounts of water, and slowly, *slowly*, he started to rally. It was a reminder that sometimes, the simplest acts of care – a little water, a warm spot – can make all the difference. 

It was a really humbling experience. It made me think about how connected we are, even to these little creatures, and how much we instinctively want to protect them.  Has something like this ever made *you* stop and appreciate the small things?
