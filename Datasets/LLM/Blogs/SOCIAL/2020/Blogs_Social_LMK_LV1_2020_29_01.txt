"When Grief Meets Insensitivity: A Lesson from 2020"

I'll never forget the day my world shattered in 2020. My mom passed away, and I was expected to navigate the dark waters of grief alongside my schoolwork. But what I encountered was a system that seemed more concerned with attendance records than offering a shoulder to cry on. The school's response to my loss was a generic condolence message, devoid of any genuine empathy. It felt like they were just going through the motions. Meanwhile, my family was struggling to come to terms with the loss, and the school's insensitivity only added to our pain. As I looked around, I saw others suffering in silence, their personal losses met with the same bureaucratic apathy. It's 2020, and we're still not getting it right. It's time for our school system to acknowledge that grief is not just a personal issue, but a societal one too.
