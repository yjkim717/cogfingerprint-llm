It’s 2020, and I’ve been spending more time alone than ever. I decided to finally learn Korean, hoping for a sense of connection. I scrolled endlessly, searching for that one perfect textbook—something complete, with audio and exercises, so I wouldn’t have to juggle a dozen tabs and apps.

It hit me then: I wasn’t just looking for a language resource. I was looking for a single, reliable anchor in a sea of digital noise and isolation. A simple, all-in-one guide felt like a metaphor for what we all craved that year—clarity and companionship, bundled together to help us feel a little less lost.
