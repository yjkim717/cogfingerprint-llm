Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the provided summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone, and set within the 2020 context.  I've included some notes after the post about potential additions/variations.

## The Algorithm of My Life (and a Question About Where to Run It)

2020. The year that felt like a glitch in the matrix, right? For me, it’s been a year of… recalculating. A lot of us have been doing that, I think. Suddenly, the carefully laid plans – the career trajectory, the dream location – felt… fluid.

I’m a software engineer, and for years, I’ve been happily planted in Boston. Owned a little house, commuted (ugh, the commute!), and built a life. Then, remote work hit. And everything shifted.

The question that keeps swirling in my head is: do I stay? Do I sell the house? Do I pack up and move back closer to family, back to a place where the cost of living doesn't feel like a constant, low-level anxiety?

It’s not a simple equation. There's the emotional weight of leaving a place I’ve put roots down. There's the real estate market, which, let's be honest, is behaving like a runaway algorithm of its own. And then there's the RSUs – those stock options that vest, a slow drip of potential financial security. Selling now means potentially missing out, but staying means… what? 

It’s funny, isn’t it? We spend so much time optimizing our code, building systems to make things more efficient. And then life throws us a curveball, and we're left trying to debug *ourselves*.

I'm not sure I have the answer yet. Maybe there isn’t one definitive answer. Maybe it's about finding a balance, a place where the code of my life – my work, my family, my finances – all runs smoothly, even if the server occasionally hiccups.

Anyone else feeling this particular brand of 2020 existentialism? Let’s commiserate (or offer wisdom!) in the comments.

**Notes & Potential Variations:**

*   **Specificity:** I kept the details relatively general to allow for broader relatability. More specific details about the family connection, the Boston neighborhood, or the type of software engineering could add depth.
*   **Emotional Depth:** I aimed for a reflective tone, but a deeper dive into the emotional aspects of leaving a home or the anxiety around financial decisions could be powerful.
*   **Call to Action:**  The comment section invite is a simple call to action. Could be expanded to ask a specific question (e.g., "What's one thing you've reconsidered about your life this year?").
*   **RSU Explanation:** I included a brief explanation of RSUs, assuming some readers might not be familiar. This could be expanded if the target audience is more financially savvy.
*   **2020 Context:**  The references to "glitch in the matrix" and the general feeling of upheaval are intended to ground the post firmly in the 2020 experience.
