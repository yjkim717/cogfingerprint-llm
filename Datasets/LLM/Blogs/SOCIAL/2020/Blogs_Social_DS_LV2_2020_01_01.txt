### The Great Rocket League Identity Crisis of 2020

Remember the before-times? When you’d queue up for a ranked match in Rocket League and have a pretty good idea of who you were up against? There was a rhythm to it, a shared understanding of the grind. Then 2020 happened, and with it, the game went free-to-play.

Suddenly, the arena felt different. A wave of fresh-faced, unranked players flooded the queues. At first, it was charming. "Welcome, newbies!" we all thought. But that charm wore off fast. I’d get into a game expecting a certain level of play, only to be utterly dismantled by an "unranked" player pulling off aerial shots I could only dream of.

It created this weird identity crisis. Was I actually worse than I thought? Was the matchmaking system broken? We started calling it "The Smurfening"—this sneaking suspicion that seasoned pros were hiding behind blank slates, just to style on us regular folks. It wasn’t just about losing; it was about the complete loss of context. A rank used to mean something. It was a badge of your journey. Now, it felt like everyone was wearing a mask.

In a year where so much felt uncertain and out of our control, this tiny digital injustice hit a nerve. It wasn't just about a game anymore; it was about wanting a fair, predictable space. Somewhere the rules still made sense. I guess we were all just looking for a little honesty, even in a rocket-powered car soccer game.
