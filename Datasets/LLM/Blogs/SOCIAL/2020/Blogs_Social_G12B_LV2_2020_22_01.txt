## Beyond the Masks: Truly Supporting Our Nurses

It's hard to believe it's still 2020. Feels like a lifetime ago we were all clapping on our balconies, a wave of gratitude washing over us for our healthcare heroes. And that was…something. A beautiful, collective moment of feeling connected and wanting to *do* something.

But lately, I’ve been thinking. We made a lot of masks, didn't we? So many heartfelt, handmade masks. And while the intention was amazing, I heard from a friend who’s a nurse that they weren't exactly what was needed. The real need, she said, was PPE – the proper protective gear. 

It got me reflecting. Sometimes, our desire to help can manifest in ways that, while well-meaning, aren’t actually the most impactful. It’s a reminder that truly supporting those on the front lines requires understanding *what* they need, not just feeling *moved* to do something. Let’s shift our energy towards advocating for resources, donating to reputable organizations, and amplifying their voices. Because our nurses deserve more than just applause; they deserve protection.

**Suggested Images:**

*   A photo of a nurse looking tired but determined, perhaps with a subtle, thoughtful expression.
*   A split image: one side showing a pile of handmade masks, the other showing a nurse in full PPE. (Used tastefully, not to diminish the initial gesture, but to illustrate the point.)



I hope this meets your requirements. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments!
