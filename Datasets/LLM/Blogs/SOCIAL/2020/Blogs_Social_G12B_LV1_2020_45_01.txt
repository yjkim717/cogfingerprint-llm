## The Sweatpants Paradox: Finding My Focus in 2020

Remember March 2020? The world shifted, and suddenly, my commute wasâ€¦ten steps to my laptop. Initially, I embraced the sweatpants life. Comfort! Freedom! But something felt off. My days blurred. Work seeped into evenings, and evenings never quite felt like *off*. 

It was a weird, constant state of 'on.'

Then, I started experimenting. Sounds silly, but I started getting dressed *properly* each morning. Not a suit, mind you, but real clothes. It sounds so small, but it created a mental shift. It signaled to my brain, "Okay, it's work time." 

Suddenly, boundaries felt a little clearer.  My evenings felt more like evenings. It's not a magic bullet, balancing work and life in this new normal is *hard*. But that little ritual - getting dressed - has been surprisingly powerful in carving out a bit of space and reclaiming some focus amidst the chaos of 2020.
