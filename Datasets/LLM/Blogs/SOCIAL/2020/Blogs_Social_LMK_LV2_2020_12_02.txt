"Locked down and ranked out: my frustrating LoL summer. As the 2020 lockdown dragged on, I found myself diving into ranked League of Legends games to pass the time. But what should've been a fun distraction quickly turned toxic. Trolls and clueless teammates ruined match after match, leaving me frustrated and demoralized. It's not just about winning or losing - it's about sharing the experience with others. But when inexperienced players and deliberate trolls take over, it feels like a chore. Has ranked LoL become a casualty of its own success? I'm not sure, but I'm not giving up yet."
