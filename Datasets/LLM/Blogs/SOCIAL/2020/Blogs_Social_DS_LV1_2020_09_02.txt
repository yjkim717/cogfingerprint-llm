Looking back at 2020, I remember feeling completely overwhelmed by the constant stream of bad news. It seemed like every headline was shouting about financial uncertainty and global instability. That’s when I stumbled upon a different kind of story—one about a man named Ray Poteet who had quietly built his own financial fortress using life insurance policies.

It got me thinking: in a world that felt so out of control, what if we could create our own sense of security? Not just for ourselves, but for our families and communities too. Maybe true wealth isn’t just about accumulating money—it’s about building systems that endure, even when everything else feels fragile.
