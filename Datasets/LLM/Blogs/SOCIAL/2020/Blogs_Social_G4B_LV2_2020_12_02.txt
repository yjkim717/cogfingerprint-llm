**The Year Ranked Became a Nightmare**

Okay, let’s be real – 2020 was… a lot. But beyond the global craziness, there was this weird, persistent frustration bubbling up for me, and I know I wasn’t alone. It centered around League of Legends, specifically ranked mode. 

Suddenly, it felt like a tidal wave of new players, completely unprepared and, frankly, *trolling* – intentionally feeding, griefing, and just generally ruining the experience. It wasn’t about skill anymore; it was about dodging a barrage of negativity. 

Lockdown meant we were all staring at screens more than ever, and it felt like that shared space was being hijacked by people who just wanted to be disruptive.  I remember just wanting to *play*, not battle a constant stream of bad behavior. Anyone else feel this way?
