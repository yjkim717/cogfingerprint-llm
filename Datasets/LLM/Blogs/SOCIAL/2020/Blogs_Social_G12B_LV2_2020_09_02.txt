## The Weight of Numbers (and the Power of Perspective)

It's been a strange year, hasn't it? 2020 has really made you question everything. I was diving deep into the world of financial planning recently, and stumbled upon something fascinating: the story of Ray Poteet and the Infinite Banking Concept. Apparently, he held *121* life insurance policies! The sheer number blew my mind. 

It’s easy to get caught up in chasing big numbers, thinking that's the key to security. But seeing Poteet's dedication, his long-term vision… it shifted my perspective. It wasn’t just about the millions he generated; it was about the disciplined approach. Maybe true financial freedom isn’t about a single, massive win, but a series of thoughtful, consistent choices. Food for thought, right?
