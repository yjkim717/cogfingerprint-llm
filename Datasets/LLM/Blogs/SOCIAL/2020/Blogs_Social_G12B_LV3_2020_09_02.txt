## Building a Legacy, One Policy at a Time

It’s 2020, and honestly, a lot of us are re-evaluating what "financial security" even *means*. We've seen markets fluctuate wildly, and the future feels… uncertain. Lately, I’ve been diving deep into the Infinite Banking Concept, and a story recently surfaced that really resonated with me.

Apparently, financial expert Ray Poteet built an incredible legacy, not through traditional investments, but through accumulating 121 Infinite Banking policies. Yes, you read that right! He strategically used policy loans to generate income and ultimately left his wife a substantial financial cushion. 

The legacy aspect is what struck me most. It's not just about accumulating wealth; it’s about creating a system that provides for your loved ones, even after you're gone. Nelson Nash's "Living Wealth" principles are clearly powerful when implemented with dedication. It’s a reminder that building financial stability can be a proactive, and surprisingly personal, journey.
