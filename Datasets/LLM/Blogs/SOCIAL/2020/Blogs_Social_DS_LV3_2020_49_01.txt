It’s 2020, and like many of you, I’ve spent more time than ever in virtual worlds—especially The Sims 4. Lately, I’ve been thinking about how we build these intricate family legacies, only to hit a strange emotional wall when a Sim passes away. In real life, inheritance isn’t just about funds—it’s about memories, responsibility, and what we leave behind for the next generation.

But in the game? That connection just… vanishes. There’s no automatic transfer of a family estate, no continuation of a story we’ve poured our hearts into. It makes me reflect on how deeply we crave meaning, even in pixels—wanting our digital families to mirror the enduring bonds and legacies we hold so dear in our own lives.
