Okay, so I just finished *Killing Stalking*, and wow. Just… wow. I’m wrestling with something. The shipping felt *weird*, intensely so, and honestly, some of the characters felt… complicated, maybe even a little uncomfortable to read. It’s a brilliantly dark story, full of unsettling twists, but it left me feeling a little shaken.  It made me think about how much we project onto stories and the gray areas we’re sometimes okay with.  Anyone else feel this way? #reading #darkreads #killingstalking
