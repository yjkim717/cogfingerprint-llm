Okay, here's a reflective blog post draft based on your provided summary and instructions, aiming for a conversational tone and relatable storytelling, set in a 2020 context:

## The Weight of "Just Get Better"

It's 2020, and honestly, we're all carrying something heavy these days, aren't we? But sometimes, the weight isn't a global pandemic; it's an invisible one. For me, it's chronic migraines and a persistent, gnawing pain that’s become a frustratingly familiar companion.

What's been surprisingly exhausting isn't *just* the pain itself. It’s the well-meaning, but utterly deflating, comments. The "just get better," the breezy assumptions that if I just *tried* harder, if I just *thought* positively enough, I’d be magically okay.

It's like people see the outside – me, typing this – and don’t see the storm raging beneath the surface.  They don't see the days spent curled up in a dark room, the missed appointments, the constant medication adjustments. It feels isolating, like I'm perpetually explaining something that can't truly be understood. 

I know intentions are good. But sometimes, a little less advice and a little more empathy would go a *long* way. We're all navigating our own battles, visible or not.
