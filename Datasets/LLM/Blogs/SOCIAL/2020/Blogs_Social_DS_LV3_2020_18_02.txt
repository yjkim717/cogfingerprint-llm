It’s 2020, and I’m stuck at home, scrolling through deals online. I spotted a Buddha Bros cart for under $40 and thought, why not? It seemed like an easy escape from the monotony. But man, was that a mistake.

After a few weak puffs, I felt nothing but a dull headache creeping in. No relaxation, no buzz—just this lingering throb behind my eyes. I sat there, completely sober and annoyed, realizing I’d wasted my cash on something fake and unreliable.

That experience was a wake-up call. Sometimes, the simplest choice is the best one. Now I stick to real bud—it’s consistent, trustworthy, and doesn’t leave me with regrets. Lesson learned the hard way.
