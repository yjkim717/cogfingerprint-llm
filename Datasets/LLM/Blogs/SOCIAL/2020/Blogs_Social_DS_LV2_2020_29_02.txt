### The Year We All Faced Our Own 'Nirvana'

Remember 2020? It felt like someone had unleashed a bizarre superpower on the world. I’ve been thinking about it like this: imagine a force—let's call it 'Nirvana'—that doesn't create monsters, but instead manifests our deepest, most personal fears as hallucinations only we can see.

For some, it was the chilling vision of an empty bank account. For others, it was the phantom cough in a crowded room or the crushing loneliness of an indefinitely silent calendar. We were all suddenly in the same storm, but staring down entirely different monsters from the windows of our isolated ships.

And that was the real lesson, wasn't it? While we couldn't stop the "hallucinations," we discovered our own "stand ability." It was the resilience to sit with a friend—via a shaky video call—and say, "I see your fear, and it's real." We learned that being a rock for someone else wasn't about having all the answers, but about having the courage to listen while they described the monster in their room.

In a year that specialized in fear, our greatest power was our simple, stubborn, human connection. It was the one thing the chaos couldn't touch.
