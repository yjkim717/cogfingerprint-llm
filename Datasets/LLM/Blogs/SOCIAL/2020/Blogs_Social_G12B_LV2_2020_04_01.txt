## The Weight of the Scroll: Finding Connection (and Quiet) in a Disconnected World

Remember that feeling in early 2020? That weird, suspended animation? Like the world had collectively paused, and we were all just… waiting? For what, exactly? Nobody really knew. We were told to stay home, to protect each other, and to *connect* online. 

And we did. Oh, did we connect.

Zoom calls with family, frantic meme-sharing with friends, the endless scroll through Instagram and TikTok – it became our lifeline. It felt good, initially. A reassurance that we weren't alone, that the world hadn't ended, that *we* hadn't ended.  I devoured content, desperately seeking normalcy, entertainment, *anything* to distract from the rising anxiety that clung to me like a second skin.

But somewhere along the way, something shifted. That initial comfort morphed into… something heavier. A dull ache in my chest that grew with every notification. A gnawing sense of inadequacy fueled by perfectly curated lives flashing across my screen.

I know I'm not alone in this. 2020 was… a lot.  And the pandemic wasn't just a physical threat; it was a mental health crisis unfolding in real-time. We were isolated, grieving, and terrified, all while being bombarded with information and pressure to project an image of resilience.

It's embarrassing to admit, but there were days when the weight of it all felt unbearable. Days when the internal turmoil felt like a physical force, crushing me. Days when I felt utterly, devastatingly alone, even surrounded by hundreds of online "friends."

I realized then that connection isn’t always about quantity. It’s not about racking up followers or likes. It’s about genuine, meaningful interaction. It’s about vulnerability, about sharing the messy, imperfect parts of ourselves, not just the filtered highlights.

So, I started to pull back. Slowly. Deliberately.  I muted the
