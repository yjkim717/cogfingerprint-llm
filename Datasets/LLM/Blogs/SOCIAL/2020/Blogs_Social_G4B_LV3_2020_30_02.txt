**The Discord Echo**

Anyone else feel like 2020 was *loud*? Not just with the news, but with… everything online. I dove headfirst into gaming to escape, spending way too many evenings in virtual worlds. And that’s when it happened. A single toxic player, just relentlessly spewing negativity, started to unravel my team’s carefully built strategy. 

It wasn’t just about losing; it was the *way* they lost – blaming everyone, dismissing suggestions, just radiating frustration. It was incredibly disappointing, honestly. You could feel the teamwork dissolving, replaced by a tense, guarded silence. 

I remember thinking, “This isn’t fun.” It really highlighted how fragile online communities can be, how a few bad actors can poison the whole experience. It made me realize I needed to step away, to protect my own mental space. Sometimes, the loudest voices aren't the ones worth listening to, especially when they’re dragging everyone else down.
