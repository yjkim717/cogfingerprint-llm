### Is It Just Me, Or Is 2020 Making Us All Dizzy?

Honestly, 2020 has been a whirlwind. But my personal spin cycle started long before the pandemic. For six years, I’ve navigated a world that suddenly tilts—dizzy spells, a heart that races like I’ve sprinted a marathon while just standing in line, and blurry vision that comes out of nowhere.

I was handed a diagnosis of “possible seizures,” but it never quite fit. It felt like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. Stuck at home this year, I fell down a rabbit hole of medical forums (we’ve all been there, right?). That’s where I found POTS.

Reading other people’s stories was like looking in a mirror. The symptoms aligned in a way my old diagnosis never did. It’s scary, but also validating. It makes me wonder how many of us are walking around with mismatched labels, our bodies shouting one thing while our charts say another. Maybe the first step to getting the right help is simply finding the right words.
