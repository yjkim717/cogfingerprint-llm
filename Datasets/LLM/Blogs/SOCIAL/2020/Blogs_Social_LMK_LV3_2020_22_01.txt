As the COVID-19 pandemic continued to sweep the nation in 2020, nurses stood at the forefront, risking their lives to care for the infected. While heartfelt thanks and homemade masks were appreciated, many non-medical civilians wondered what more they could do to support these healthcare heroes. Beyond gestures of gratitude, civilians can offer tangible support by volunteering at local hospitals, delivering groceries to nurse families, or simply being a listening ear. The nursing community, already tight-knit, was further strengthened by these acts of kindness. By showing appreciation in meaningful ways, we can help alleviate some of the burnout and stress nurses faced during this challenging time. As we reflect on the pandemic's impact, it's clear that supporting our nurses is crucial - not just with applause, but with action.
