## Movie Nights and Meltdowns: Navigating Autism and Family Expectations

Okay, so I need to get this off my chest. It’s been swirling around in my head all week, and honestly, I'm still feeling a little frayed. It's about a movie night we had last weekend, and the whole thing just… imploded.

We’d planned it for ages. My family, me, a pizza, and *Discord* on Netflix. Everyone was excited. I even picked it – I’d read the synopsis and it seemed… manageable. I’m autistic, and loud noises, sudden changes, and intense emotional scenes are *not* my friends. I have panic attacks sometimes when things get overwhelming, and that’s something I’m still learning to manage.

About halfway through, there’s this *intense* scene – flashing lights, shouting, really jarring sound effects. I started to feel the familiar tightening in my chest, the buzzing in my ears. I instinctively covered my ears, trying to block it out. My mom, bless her heart, noticed and asked if I was okay. But before I could even really formulate a response, my brother jumped in, saying something like, "Just watch the movie!"

That… that just triggered something. The pressure, the suddenness of it all, the feeling of being *othered*… I shut down. I started to get really agitated, and things escalated quickly.  Yelling ensued.  It was messy, it was uncomfortable, and afterward, I felt terrible.

2020 has been a year of heightened stress for everyone, I think.  But it’s also highlighted how much work we still have to do in understanding neurodiversity within families. I just wish, sometimes, people would remember it’s okay to pause, to check in, and to really *listen* instead of just expecting me to conform to a neurotypical standard of “enjoyment.”
