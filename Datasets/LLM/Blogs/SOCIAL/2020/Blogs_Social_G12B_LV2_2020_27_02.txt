## Trading Scans for Shifting Gears: Thinking About a Big Change

It’s 2020, and honestly, hasn’t everyone been re-evaluating *everything*? I saw a post the other day on Reddit that really resonated. Someone who’s been hustling as a package handler is dreaming of a switch to trucking – CDL, hauling steel, maybe even finding a residential route that lets them be home more. 

It got me thinking. We all have those jobs, right? The ones that pay the bills, but don't exactly set your soul on fire. The pandemic’s really highlighted how precious time is, and how much we crave that balance. It takes guts to consider a career leap, especially something as different as trucking. But chasing that potential for better pay *and* more time with family? That feels like a worthwhile risk to me. Anyone else out there making (or considering) a big shift?
