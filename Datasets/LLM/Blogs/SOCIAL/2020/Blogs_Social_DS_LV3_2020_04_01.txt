Of all the feelings that defined 2020 for me, it was the quiet, gnawing emptiness that was the hardest to describe. The world had collectively pressed pause, and in that sudden, deafening silence, the internal noise became unbearable. It wasn't just loneliness; it was a hollowed-out ache, a void that seemed to swallow sound, light, and hope.

I remember one evening, standing in my kitchen, the glow of my laptop screen the only light in the room. Another Zoom call had ended, another day had blurred into the last. The silence was so heavy I could feel it in my bones. And in that moment, the familiar, toxic whisper returned. It promised a different kind of feeling, a sharp, clean sensation to cut through the numb despair. It was a siren's call to self-harm, a desperate, flawed logic that physical pain could eclipse the churning guilt and emotional agony inside. The guilt was a constant companion—for not being more productive, for feeling so broken when "we're all in this together," for the secret battle I was losing in the privacy of my own four walls.

But 2020, for all its isolation, also forced a strange kind of introspection. Staring at my own reflection in the dark window one night, I saw the sheer exhaustion of the fight. I was so tired of hating myself. The turning point wasn't a dramatic, cinematic moment. It was a quiet decision to send a text. "I'm not okay," I typed to a friend, my hands shaking. It felt like admitting a catastrophic failure.

The response wasn't pity or alarm; it was simple, profound connection. "Me neither," came the reply. "Want to just sit on the phone and not talk?"

That was the crack of light. It taught me that our deepest despair often lies in the belief that we are uniquely broken, fighting a solitary war. But mental health struggles thrive in isolation. By giving a name to the emptiness and the guilt, by speaking the unspeakable, I began to rob them of their power. The path isn't linear. Some days the void still whispers. But now I know it’s a liar. The real relief isn't found in a cycle of pain, but in the courageous, messy, and deeply human act of reaching out, even—and especially—from the depths of despair. Our shared vulnerability, it turns out, is our greatest strength.
