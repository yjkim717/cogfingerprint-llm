**Trading Asphalt for… Electrons?**

It’s weird, right? Last year, a car accident and a hefty insurance payout shifted something in me. I was staring at the prospect of a shiny new car, and it just felt… heavy.  Then, I started thinking about an ebike. Suddenly, the idea of zipping through the city, quietly and sustainably, felt *good*. 

It’s not about escaping the past, but about choosing a different path forward.  Maybe it's about prioritizing a calmer commute, and a little less social media scrolling while I’m on the road.  Anyone else feeling a shift in what truly matters?

Do you want me to tweak this draft in any way (e.g., adjust the tone, add a specific detail, or change the length)?
