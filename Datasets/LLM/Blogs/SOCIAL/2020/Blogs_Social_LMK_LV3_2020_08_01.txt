As I watched my grandfather come to terms with his mortality in 2020, I was faced with a difficult reality: his plan for assisted death. The news sent me reeling, and I struggled to process my emotions. Grief, guilt, and sadness swirled together, making it hard to cope. As I navigated this challenging time with my family, I realized that confronting the impermanence of life can be a catalyst for emotional growth. By sharing our experiences and supporting one another, we can find a way to heal and move forward together.
