>## The Frustration of Shared Worlds (and Lost Turns)

Anyone else feeling a bit… disconnected lately? It’s not just the pandemic, it’s also Civilization VI multiplayer. Since September, it’s been a constant battle against desyncs. You build a glorious wonder, your friend marvels at it, and then… poof. Everyone's timelines have split, and suddenly you’re staring at a completely different map.

We’ve tried everything – verifying game files, tweaking mods, even restarting our routers. It's incredibly frustrating when you're trying to share a collaborative historical experience, and the game actively fights you. It makes you think about how even *digital* shared spaces can feel isolating when the technology just isn't quite holding up. Back to single-player, I guess, for now.
