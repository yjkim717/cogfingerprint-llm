**The "Friendship-Only" Gray Area - Ugh.**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot. Mask mandates, Zoom everything, and a weirdly intense focus on boundaries. I’m still processing it, honestly. Recently, I had a guy I’d been casually chatting with – an acquaintance from a mutual friend’s group – suggest we just be friends. It felt… odd. 

He’d been really sweet during a short visit, but the “no pressure” vibe felt a little pointed. Part of me wanted to chase it, wanting *something* more. But another part was screaming, “Seriously? In 2020?” It’s a messy reminder that navigating social connections feels even more complicated when everyone’s trying to protect their hearts. What do you guys think?
