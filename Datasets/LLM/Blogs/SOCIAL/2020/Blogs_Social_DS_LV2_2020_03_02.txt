As Martin Luther King Jr. Day approached in 2020, my partner and I found ourselves pausing over a pot of simmering collard greens. We’re white, and the idea of hosting a soul food dinner felt celebratory, yet we hesitated. Was this appreciation or appropriation? We realized it wasn’t about the food itself, but the intention behind it—honoring a legacy, not just borrowing a culture. So we cooked, shared stories of resilience, and listened. It became a humble tribute, a small step toward understanding, seasoned with respect and shared humanity.
