The email from the principal was the same generic template they’d used before. “Our hearts are with you during this difficult time.” It was 2020, and my world had shrunk to the four walls of my home after losing my grandfather. The school’s response felt like a hollow echo, completely missing the mark.

My grief wasn't neat. It was tangled with the guilt of a strained relationship and the silence that had grown between us over the years. The system’s false idealism, its one-size-fits-all sympathy, couldn't acknowledge our messy, complicated family dynamics. It just offered a sterile bandage for a wound that needed real, human understanding, something desperately missing in a year already defined by distance.
