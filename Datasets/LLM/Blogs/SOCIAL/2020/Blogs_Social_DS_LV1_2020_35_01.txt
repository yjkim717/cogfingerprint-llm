### The Day I Unfriended My Phone: A 2020 Wake-Up Call

It’s strange the things that become normal. For me, it was the daily knot of anxiety in my stomach whenever my phone lit up with her name. Let’s call her “Chloe.” We’d been friends for years, but somewhere along the line, the friendship had turned into something I didn’t recognize—a constant, exhausting dance where I was always trying to avoid stepping on landmines.

In 2020, when the world outside shrank to the size of our screens, my digital relationship with Chloe became my entire reality. And it was a grim one. A supportive text from me about her job stress would be met with silence for days, only for her to reappear with a dramatic crisis that demanded my immediate, undivided attention. If I was slow to respond, I’d get the guilt-trip: “I guess you’re too busy for me now.” If I shared a small personal win, the conversation would swiftly pivot back to her problems. My joy seemed to irritate her; my struggles were never as significant as hers.

I felt like an emotional vending machine: I was expected to dispense validation, sympathy, and reassurance on demand, but I was never allowed to need anything myself. The manipulation was so subtle, so woven into our history, that I blamed myself. Was I not a good enough friend? Was I being selfish?

The turning point came during one of our countless Zoom calls. I was emotionally drained, talking her through another one of her cyclical dramas, when I had a moment of pure clarity. I was watching myself on the screen—my slumped shoulders, my forced nods—and I didn’t recognize the person I had become. I was a supporting character in my own life, playing a bit part in the never-ending drama of hers.

The next day, with my heart pounding like a drum, I wrote her a short, clear message. I didn’t list her offenses or try to win an argument. I simply stated that the dynamic was no longer healthy for me and that I needed to step away for my own well-being. I wished her well and then I hit “send.”

The aftermath was a storm of texts—accusations, guilt, and finally, the threat of “You’ll regret abandoning me.” It was brutal. But a funny thing happened as I read those words. For the first time, I didn’t feel guilt. I felt relief. The threat was just her final attempt to pull my strings, and I had finally cut the cords.

Letting go of that toxic friendship in 2020 was my real lockdown project. It taught me that a pandemic of one is enough. I learned to stop setting myself on fire to keep someone else warm. And let me tell you, the warmth on this side of the boundary is so much better.
