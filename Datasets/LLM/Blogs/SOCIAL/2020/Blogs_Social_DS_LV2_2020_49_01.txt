You know, in 2020 when we were all stuck inside, I found myself diving deep into my Sims 4 legacy family. I’d spent weeks building up their wealth, designing the perfect family estate, imagining the stories that would unfold for generations.

But when the matriarch passed, it hit me—there was no automatic inheritance. Her life’s work, the family funds, just… sat there. I had to manually transfer every Simoleon to her heir. It felt oddly reflective of real life, where we’re left scrambling to piece together what’s left behind. In a year of so much loss and uncertainty, that simple game mechanic reminded me how fragile our connections can be—and how important it is to intentionally pass on what we value.
