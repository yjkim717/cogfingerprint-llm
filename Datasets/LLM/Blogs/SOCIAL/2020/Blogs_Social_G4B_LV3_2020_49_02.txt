**The Scroll & the Sting**

Remember 2020? Scrolling through social media felt…different. It wasn’t just entertainment; it was a constant barrage of opinions, criticisms disguised as “helpful advice,” and frankly, a whole lot of anger. I found myself bristling at every comment, a familiar frustration bubbling up – a feeling of being unfairly judged within this digital relationship.
