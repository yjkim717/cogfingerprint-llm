**The Weight of a Secret Choice**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a conversation can just…drop like a stone. My grandfather recently told me about his plans for assisted death. Suddenly, all I felt was this thick, prickly resentment. Not for *him*, exactly, but for the way this huge decision was being delivered, like a final, weighty secret. 

2020 was already heavy with uncertainty, and this just layered another impossible emotion on top. I’m trying to navigate the grief of his impending goodbye, alongside this strange, uncomfortable anger.  Anyone else grapple with this kind of complicated sadness?  It feels… isolating.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
