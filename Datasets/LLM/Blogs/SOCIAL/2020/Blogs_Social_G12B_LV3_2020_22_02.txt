## The Invisible Weight: Migraines and the Loneliness of Everyday Life

2020 has been a year of isolation for so many of us, hasn't it? But for those of us living with chronic migraines, that feeling of being cut off from the world isn’t exactly new. It’s a constant companion, woven into the fabric of daily life.

It's the persistent, throbbing pain, of course, but it's so much more than that. It’s the polite inquiries about “just popping some medicine” and getting back to normal. It’s the well-meaning suggestions to “try meditation” or “drink more water,” offered with a frustrating lack of understanding. Because it *doesn’t* just go away. 

Some days, even getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. And explaining that to someone who hasn't experienced it? Nearly impossible. It leaves you feeling… invisible. Like your reality, your pain, doesn't quite register. 

And that, more than the headaches themselves, is what can be so deeply isolating. Knowing you’re navigating a world that doesn’t quite see you.
