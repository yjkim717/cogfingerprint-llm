>Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the provided keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational tone and storytelling style, set in a 2020 context. I've focused on the internal struggle and the impact on a relationship, leaning into the isolation feelings that were so prevalent during that year.

## The Weight of a Move-In (and Everything Else)

It’s weird, isn’t it? How 2020 just… amplified everything. The quiet anxieties, the simmering sadness, the things you usually manage to shove down with a busy schedule or a quick distraction? They just got louder. For me, it was a potent cocktail of depression and an eating disorder, a combination I’d been navigating for a while, but that really hit a fever pitch this year.

And now, on top of everything else, we’re planning a move-in. My partner, Liam. He’s been incredible, truly. Patient, understanding, offering a steady hand when I feel like I’m perpetually drowning. But I can see it in his eyes sometimes – a flicker of… overwhelm? 

I hate that. I really do. I don’t want to be *that* person. The one dragging someone else down, especially when they're offering so much support. The pandemic made everything feel so fragile, so uncertain, and suddenly adding my mental health struggles to the mix felt like a monumental burden.

There are days where getting out of bed is a victory. Days where the voice in my head is relentless, telling me I’m not worthy, that I'm a failure. And then there are the smaller battles, the constant calculations around food, the self-criticism that never seems to shut off. 

Liam deserves a partner who is…lighter. Brighter. Not someone constantly wrestling with shadows. I worry about the move-in, not just because of the logistics, but because I fear I’ll be bringing all this baggage with me, suffocating the space we’re creating together.

I know I need to be honest. To communicate. To ask for help, not just from Liam, but from a therapist too. It’s a work in progress, a messy, imperfect journey. And right now, just acknowledging that – admitting the weight – feels like a small step in the right direction.
