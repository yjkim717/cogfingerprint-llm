**The Weight of Online Opinions**

As I scroll through my social media feeds, I'm met with a constant barrage of curated perfection. Every post, every photo, and every comment seems to be a subtle reminder that I'm not good enough. The criticism can be brutal, and it's not just about my appearance. People feel entitled to comment on my style, my personality, and even my opinions.

It's 2020, and we're more connected than ever, but the toll on our self-esteem is palpable. I've lost count of how many times I've been body-shamed or ridiculed for my fashion choices online. The worst part is that it's not just strangers; sometimes it's people I know, hiding behind their screens, free to spew hurtful comments without consequence.

The impact is real. I've started to doubt my own judgment, second-guessing my choices and questioning my worth. It's as if the constant criticism has seeped into my psyche, making me feel like I'm not good enough, that I need to conform to someone else's standards.

But I'm trying to break free from this toxic cycle. I'm learning to own my personal style, to silence the haters, and to focus on what makes me happy. It's not easy, but I'm working on it. I'm reminding myself that my worth isn't defined by online comments or someone else's opinion. I'm more than my appearance, and it's time I start believing that.
