>## The Glitch in the Matrix (and My Aim)

Okay, so I’ve been completely obsessed with *Half-Life: Alyx* lately. It’s incredible, truly, the VR immersion is unlike anything I’ve experienced. But I hit a weird snag the other day that really got me thinking about something.

The pistol has this cool reflex sight, right? Super helpful for lining up shots. Except... it seems to be built assuming you have a dominant eye. And I, apparently, do not. At least, not clearly. 

Suddenly, aiming felt incredibly awkward. My shots were all over the place. I was getting frustrated, blaming the VR setup, then realizing it was just *me*. It felt like a little glitch in the Matrix, my brain not quite aligning with the game’s intended design. 

It made me think about how often we build things – games, apps, even social media platforms – with a specific user in mind. What about those of us who don’t quite fit that mold? It’s a small thing in a video game, but it's a reminder to be mindful of accessibility and inclusivity in *everything* we create, especially now, in 2020, when we're all talking about being more aware.
