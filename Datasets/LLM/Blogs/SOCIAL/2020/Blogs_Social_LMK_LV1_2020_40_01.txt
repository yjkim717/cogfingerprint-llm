"Mealtimes used to be a struggle for me, especially when my boyfriend would comment on my food choices. His remarks, though seemingly harmless, made me feel self-conscious about eating. I'd restrict during the day, only to binge at night. It was a vicious cycle. In 2020, I realized that his behavior was triggering my bulimic tendencies. I knew I had to break free from this pattern and work towards a healthier relationship with food â€“ and with him."
