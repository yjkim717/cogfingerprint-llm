It’s 2020, and my home has become my office, my gym, and my sanctuary—all at once. At first, I thought blending work and life would be freeing, but soon, the lines blurred into one endless, exhausting day. I was always "on," answering emails from the couch at midnight and taking calls over breakfast.

Then, I reclaimed my mornings. A simple routine: coffee, a walk, and setting clear work hours. It wasn’t just about productivity; it was about preserving my sanity. By creating boundaries, I found balance. Now, when I log off, I truly disconnect. Turns out, the secret to thriving in this new normal isn’t working harder—it’s working smarter, right from home.
