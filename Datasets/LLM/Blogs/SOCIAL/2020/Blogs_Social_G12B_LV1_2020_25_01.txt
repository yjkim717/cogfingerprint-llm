>## The Unexpected Soundtrack to Lockdown

Remember early 2020? The world felt… paused. Suddenly, my social life shrunk to the size of my apartment. Initially, it was unsettling. Then, something shifted. I started experimenting with music production, diving into free DAWs and trying to recreate the sounds I loved – that gritty Nu Metal vibe, the heavy bounce of Trap Metal. 

It was surprisingly therapeutic. Building beats, layering sounds, it became a way to channel all the weirdness and anxiety. Turns out, a little digital audio workstation and a whole lot of free time could be a pretty decent soundtrack to a global pause. Who knew?
