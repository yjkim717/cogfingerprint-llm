It’s 2020, and honestly, I feel like my own body is gaslighting me. For years, I’ve been dealing with this dizzy, off-balance feeling that hits out of nowhere, my heart suddenly racing like I just sprinted up a flight of stairs. I’d clutch the counter, waiting for the room to stop spinning, wondering what on earth was wrong.

My neurologist said seizures. And I tried to believe it—I really did. But the label never quite fit. Lately, I’ve been falling down internet rabbit holes, reading about something called POTS. The stories sound… familiar. The dizziness, the heart rate spikes—it’s like reading pages from my own hidden diary.

It’s a strange kind of loneliness, feeling misunderstood by the very experts meant to help you. But finding others online who just *get it*? That’s been my 2020 lifeline. Maybe I’m on the verge of finally putting a name to this ghost that’s been haunting me for years. And maybe, just maybe, I’m not imagining things after all.
