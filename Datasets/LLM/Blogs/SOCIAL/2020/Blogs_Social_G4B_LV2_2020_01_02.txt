**The Shame of Walking Away**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was trying to find a way to just… *end* things. And I think that impulse, that desire to just forfeit, bled into so many areas of life. I saw it in online gaming, specifically with Rocket League – people quitting tournaments when things got tough. 

Honestly, it bothered me. Not just because of the game, but because it felt like a bigger reflection. It’s tempting to walk away from challenges, to protect our egos. But there’s a weird shame in that, isn’t there? A feeling of letting down yourself and, maybe, the people watching. 

I realized then that real growth came from sticking it out, even when it hurt. It wasn’t about *winning*, it was about the grit, the effort, and the refusal to give in.  What’s one thing you’ve learned about pushing through difficulty lately?
