Living in Springfield during the 2020 election cycle, I’ll admit it’s easy to feel like my vote is just a whisper in Chicago’s roar. The political landscape here in Illinois often seems tilted, and at times, it’s disheartening. But I still show up—not because I believe my single ballot will tip the scales, but because there’s a quiet dignity in participating. It’s my small act of hope, a personal stake in our democracy, no matter how the winds blow.
