"Six Years of Unanswered Questions: My Mystery Symptoms"

As I sit here in 2020, reflecting on the past six years of my life, I'm still trying to make sense of the dizziness, weakness, and seizures that have become my unwelcome companions. It started innocently enough - a faint feeling when standing up, a wobbly spell that would pass. But over time, the episodes grew more frequent and intense, leaving me stumbling through daily life. I've seen my fair share of doctors, but it wasn't until a visit to a neurologist that I began to suspect that my symptoms might be related to something more specific: Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, or POTS. I've been reading up on it, and the more I learn, the more I wonder - could this be the key to understanding my body's bizarre behavior? I'm eager to dig deeper and find answers, and I hope that by sharing my story, I might just find some clarity.
