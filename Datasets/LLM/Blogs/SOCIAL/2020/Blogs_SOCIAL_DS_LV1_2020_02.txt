### The Soap and the Mirror: A Reflection on Numbness

It’s strange the things that break you open. For me, in the thick of 2020, it wasn't a grand tragedy, but a bar of soap.

I was living in a state of emotional suspension. The world was on fire, but I felt… nothing. A heavy, cotton-wool numbness had settled in. My own personal hell wasn't one of feeling too much, but of feeling nothing at all. The scars on my skin, old maps of past pain, were just pale lines. They didn’t hurt; they were just… there. Evidence of a self I could no longer access.

Then, one evening, I was washing my hands. The soap was one of those new transparent, glycerin bars. As the water hit it, it became suddenly, startlingly clear. And as I lathered up, I happened to look down.

Through that slick, wet transparency, every single scar was thrown into sharp, hyper-realistic relief. They weren't faint memories anymore; they were vivid, red, and undeniable. It was like the soap had washed away not just the dirt, but the numbness itself, exposing the raw topography of my pain.

I looked up, into the mirror above the sink. My own eyes stared back, and for the first time in months, I didn’t see a blank mask. I saw the person who carried those scars. The internal suffering I had been trying to mute was now reflected right back at me, clear as day.

That small, silent moment was a turning point. It made me realize that my numbness wasn't a protection; it was a prison. True healing, I understood, wasn't about making the scars disappear. It was about having the courage to finally see them, to acknowledge the pain they represented, and to choose to feel something—anything—again. Even if it hurt.
