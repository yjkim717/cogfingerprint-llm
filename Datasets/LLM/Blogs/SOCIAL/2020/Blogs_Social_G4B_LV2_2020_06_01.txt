**The Weight of Scrolling in 2020**

Remember 2020? It felt…heavy. Like the world was collectively holding its breath. I spent so much time lost in the endless scroll, bombarded with outrage and feeling utterly *worthless* in comparison. It wasn’t just the news; it was the curated lives, the performative activism, the constant feeling of needing to *do* something. 

Honestly, it triggered this deep, unsettling *existential dread*. Like a low-humming *rage* beneath the surface, fueled by a sense of being a burden.  I wasn't alone in feeling this, was I?  It’s a strange feeling, wanting to scream into the void and then feeling even more isolated.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
