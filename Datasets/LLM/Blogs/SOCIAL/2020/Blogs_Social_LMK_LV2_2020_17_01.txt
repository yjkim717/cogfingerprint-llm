"Breaking the Silence: My Struggle with Emetophobia"

In 2020, I hit rock bottom. Years of medical trauma culminated in an overwhelming fear of losing control - specifically, the terror of vomiting uncontrollably. Emetophobia, a condition often shrouded in silence, became my unwelcome companion. As I navigated the dark complexities of my own bodily functions, I realized I wasn't alone. Many suffer in silence, their stories untold. By sharing mine, I hope to shed light on this often-misunderstood phobia and encourage others to speak out, breaking the silence that binds us.
