### The Silence That Echoes

It’s a strange kind of grief, the one that happens while someone is still here.

My grandfather is dying. The doctors say it’s a matter of weeks, maybe less. In any other year, our family home would be a revolving door of casseroles, shared memories, and quiet vigils. But this is 2020. The pandemic didn't just introduce a virus; it perfected the art of isolation.

The cruelest part isn't the physical distance, though. It’s the emotional one. A few months ago, a misunderstanding over a missed video call—a frozen screen, garbled audio—snowballed into something I still don’t fully understand. My attempts to clarify were met with a wall of silence from my mom and aunts. They’ve closed ranks, and I’ve been officially shut out.

Now, I get my updates in sterile, second-hand texts. “His appetite is less today.” “He slept through the afternoon.” I’m grieving for a man who is still breathing, but from whom I am completely severed. I’m mourning the loss of my family unit at the very moment we should be drawing together. The communication breakdown feels absolute. I’m left orbiting this immense loss, close enough to feel its gravity but too far away to touch it.

I’m left with so many questions, but the biggest one is this: How do you say goodbye to someone through a wall others have built? How do you navigate the twin pains of impending death and present estrangement? In a year defined by separation, this personal chasm feels like the most profound isolation of all. I’m just waiting in the silence, hoping it doesn’t become the last thing I hear from him.
