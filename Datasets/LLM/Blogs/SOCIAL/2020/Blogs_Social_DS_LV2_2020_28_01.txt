### The Look That Almost Broke Us

It was March 2020, and the four walls of our living room were starting to feel like the entire world. One night, we decided on a family movie to break the monotony. I was tucked into my favorite corner of the couch, the blanket a familiar weight. I was following the plot, but my gaze was drifting—sometimes at the lamp, sometimes at the pattern on the rug. It’s just how my brain processes things.

That’s when my sister snapped. “Can you stop staring into space? You’re not even watching!”

The accusation hit me like a physical blow. It wasn’t the words, but the complete misunderstanding. I *was* watching. I was absorbing every detail, just not in the way she expected. My heart started to hammer against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of panic. I tried to explain, but the words got tangled with the rising tide of anxiety. I just needed everything to stop—the noise, the expectations, the feeling of being fundamentally *misread* by my own family.

The aftermath was a heavy silence. Later, when I’d calmed down, we talked. I explained that for me, a person with autism, not making direct eye contact with the screen doesn’t mean I’m not present. My sister, in turn, admitted she was stressed and took my distraction personally.

That night taught me a brutal 2020 lesson: being locked in the same house doesn’t mean we’re living in the same emotional world. True connection requires us to learn each other’s languages, especially when they’re spoken without words.
