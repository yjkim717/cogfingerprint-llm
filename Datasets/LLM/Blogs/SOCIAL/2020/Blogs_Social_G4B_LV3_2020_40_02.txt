**The Tightrope of New Love & Old Fears**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was tiptoeing through a masked world, trying to find connection amidst the chaos. I was doing the same, but on a much more personal tightrope. I’d been battling depression and an eating disorder for years, and the idea of letting anyone in felt…terrifying. 

Then I met him. He was kind, genuinely interested, and seemed to *see* me – not the parts I desperately tried to hide. But a deep-seated fear took root: what if he couldn’t handle the mess? What if my anxieties, my struggles, pushed him away and just amplified everything? 

It’s a familiar pattern, isn’t it? This constant worry that vulnerability equals rejection.  I found myself overthinking every text, every glance, building walls instead of bridges.  It’s a hard lesson to learn – that sometimes, the greatest risk isn’t being hurt, but living a life defined by fear.  And honestly, the thought of *not* taking that risk felt far worse.
