## When the Dice Roll a Little… Off.

Okay, so, I've been deep into D&D lately. Like, *really* deep. We're tackling the *Temple of the Mad Dragon* module, and let me tell you, it’s been a ride. But the *real* story isn't the module itself; it's my player’s Dragonborn Cleric, Kaelen. 

Kaelen took a nasty hit early on – a rogue arrow to the head, to be precise – and now he’s… not quite right. He's convinced a black dragon is whispering prophecies to him, guiding his actions. It’s a delusion, born from the trauma, but he *believes* it. 

It’s been fascinating to navigate as a DM. Balancing the humor of a devout follower acting on bizarre instructions with the underlying sadness of a character struggling with fractured mental state has been surprisingly complex. It's made me think a lot about how we portray mental health, even in fantasy. Honestly, in 2020, with everything going on, it feels even more relevant. It's a reminder that everyone's fighting their battles, visible or not.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
