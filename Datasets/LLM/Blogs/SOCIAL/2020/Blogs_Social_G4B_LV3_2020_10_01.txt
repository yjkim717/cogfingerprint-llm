**The Quiet Persistence of Wild Yeast**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2020, with everything feeling so… fractured, I found myself utterly captivated by the simple act of trying to make bread. Not *good* bread, mind you, but bread born of patience and a little bit of wild hope. 

I’d stumbled across a story about a baker in rural Vietnam, painstakingly coaxing yeast from flour and water – a return to a really ancient way of doing things. It felt like a tiny rebellion against the speed and convenience of everything else. 

I started my own experiment, a small, messy attempt to recreate that process here. There were failures, of course – loaves that refused to rise, doughs that were stubbornly flat. But with each setback, I realized it mirrored something bigger: the quiet persistence of community, of connection. Just like that yeast, we’re all slowly, stubbornly trying to find our rise, our fermentation, in a world that often feels rushed and disconnected.
