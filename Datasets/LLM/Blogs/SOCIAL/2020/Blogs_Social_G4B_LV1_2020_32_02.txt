**The Echo Chamber of "You Should..."**

Okay, 2020 was… a lot, right? Between the pandemic and everything else, I was already feeling pretty fragile. And then, the internet decided to pile on. Suddenly, every photo I posted was met with a barrage of unsolicited opinions – “You should wear that differently,” “That’s not really your style,” “Seriously, why are you even posting that?” 

It started as little comments, but it quickly morphed into this exhausting echo chamber. Honestly, it chipped away at my self-esteem. I started second-guessing everything, obsessing over how I presented myself, and feeling this constant pressure to fit someone else’s idea of “good.” 

I realized I was letting strangers dictate my happiness. It’s so easy to get caught up in the noise, but protecting your personal style and your own sense of self is *essential*.  I’m learning to mute the negativity and focus on what makes *me* feel good - and that’s a pretty powerful shift.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
