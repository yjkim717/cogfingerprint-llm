## The Pajama Paradox: Finding My Work-Life Balance (and Sanity) in 2020

Remember when "working from home" felt like a perk? A dream, even? Back in March 2020, as the world shifted, I jumped on the WFH bandwagon with gusto. My initial strategy? Pajamas. All. The. Time. 

And you know what? It was *comfortable*. But it wasn't sustainable. Suddenly, the lines blurred. My living room became my office, my kitchen the cafeteria, and my brain...well, it felt permanently "on."  It was a constant hum of work, even when I wasn’t *really* working.

Then I stumbled upon a simple idea: dress for the job I *want* to have.  Sounds silly, right? But putting on real clothes – even just a nice top and jeans – made a surprising difference. It signaled to my brain that it was work time. It created a boundary. 

It’s been a year of adjustments, a year of learning to navigate this new normal. And for me, reclaiming a little structure, a little separation, has been a surprisingly powerful tool for both productivity *and* my sanity. What about you? What's your WFH survival strategy?
