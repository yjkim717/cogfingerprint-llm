That crumpled bumper was a wake-up call. Staring at the insurance check, I thought about my 16-mile commute. In 2020, with the world slowing down, did I really need another car? The idea of an ebike started as a quirky "what if," but it's grown into something more. It's not just about saving money; it's about reclaiming my time, getting some fresh air, and feeling a little more connected to my community on two wheels instead of being sealed in a box. A small, positive change.
