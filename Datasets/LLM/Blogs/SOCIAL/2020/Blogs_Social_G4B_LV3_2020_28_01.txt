**The Silent Storm in the Living Room**

Remember those early days of 2020? The world felt…still, in a way, even as everything was changing. I was spending a lot of time at home, trying to carve out a little normalcy for my family. And that's when I started noticing something unsettling – a quiet tension simmering beneath the surface. 

My sixteen-year-old, Leo, who’s autistic, had a really strong reaction to a scene in a movie. It seemed small to everyone else, but for him, it triggered a wave of anxiety. Suddenly, the familiar comfort of our living room felt like a pressure cooker. 

It forced us to confront some really difficult conversations, and honestly, it was messy. We struggled to understand each other, to bridge the gap between his experience and our own.  It highlighted how crucial communication truly is, especially when navigating different neurotypes.  It wasn’t about fixing anything; it was about simply *seeing* each other, and acknowledging the storm brewing inside Leo – and within ourselves.
