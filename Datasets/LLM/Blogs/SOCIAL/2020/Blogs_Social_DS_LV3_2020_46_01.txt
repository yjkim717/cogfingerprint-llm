There’s a clip I keep rewatching from some old, grainy film—maybe Tarkovsky, maybe not. A child wanders through a WWII-ruined landscape, everything in stark black and white. It’s 2020, and in my own way, I feel like that kid, navigating the quiet wreckage of a world on pause. No bombs, just empty streets and uncertainty. But in that monochrome solitude, there’s a strange clarity. Sometimes, it’s in the broken places that we see what truly matters—and who we’re walking through it all for.
