**The Unranked Shuffle: When Rocket League Feels…Off**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2020 was *weird*, right? We were all trying to find our footing, both online and in the real world. And that feeling of being a little off translated surprisingly well into Rocket League. Lately, I’ve been spending a lot of time in unranked, and it’s starting to feel… unbalanced.

It’s not the game itself; it’s the *people*. There’s a constant influx of players who seem to be genuinely new to the concept, and while I get that everyone starts somewhere, it’s starting to mess with my enjoyment. The re-ranking system, which was supposed to level the playing field, feels like it’s just shuffling in a bunch of lower-skilled players. 

I find myself questioning the design choices – why can I still see *everyone’s* skill rating? It feels like it highlights the disparity, making it harder to find a genuinely competitive (and fun!) experience.  It’s a little frustrating, honestly.  I just want to play a decent match without feeling like I’m constantly battling a wave of beginners.  Anyone else feeling this way?
