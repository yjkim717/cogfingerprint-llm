"Dress Coded: A Personal Reflection on Sexism in Schools"

I still remember the day I was dress coded in school like it was yesterday. My teacher pulled me aside and told me my outfit was "too distracting" for the boys in my class. I was wearing a perfectly normal tank top and shorts, but somehow, I was deemed immodest. As I looked around, I realized I wasn't alone - many of my female friends had been dress coded too. It sparked a realization: school dress codes are often sexist and unfair. By policing girls' bodies, we're perpetuating a culture of shame and objectification. In 2020, it's staggering that we're still debating this issue. As I reflect on my experience, I'm reminded that it's time for schools to rethink their policies and focus on promoting equality and respect, rather than reinforcing outdated stereotypes. It's time for change.
