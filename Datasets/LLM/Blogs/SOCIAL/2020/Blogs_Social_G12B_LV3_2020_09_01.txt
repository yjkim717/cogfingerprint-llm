## Beyond the 7 Pay: What Happens Next with Infinite Banking?

Okay, so you’ve hit the 7-year mark with your Infinite Banking Concept (IBC) policy. Congrats! It’s a milestone – that sweet spot where things *really* start to open up. I remember feeling a bit lost myself back in 2020, wondering what this meant beyond those initial deposits. Suddenly, higher loan limits and more strategic leveraging felt within reach. It's a reminder that financial planning isn't a sprint, it's a journey – and the best is often yet to come!
