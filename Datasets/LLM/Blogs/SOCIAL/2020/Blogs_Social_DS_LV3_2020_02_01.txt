It’s 2020, and like so many others, I’ve been spending more time in virtual worlds. I picked up a new shooter game, drawn to the promise of a high-tech pistol with a reflex sight. But my aim was all over the place. The game, it turns out, is designed for people with a dominant eye—something I lack.

Frustrated, a friend suggested I try closing one eye. It felt awkward, forced, like trying to write with my non-dominant hand. But my accuracy improved almost instantly. It made me reflect on how often we’re expected to fit a certain mold, both in games and in life. Sometimes, the path to success isn't about changing who you are, but finding a different way to adapt and see things clearly.
