### The Map in My Head is Fading

It’s 2020, and the career roadmap I spent a decade carefully following has been crumpled up and tossed aside. My little Boston rental property—that tidy, three-decker box of an investment—suddenly feels less like an asset and more like a question mark I can’t answer.

For years, the plan was simple: climb the ladder, secure the salary, and let the property appreciate. Location was everything. But now, my entire tech team is a grid of faces on a screen. The "ladder" exists in a nebulous digital space, and the "location" that was supposed to guarantee my property's value feels… optional.

I find myself staring at Zillow estimates and job listings for cities I’d never considered, all while wrestling with a strange new kind of freedom. Do I sell? Do I hold on? The financial uncertainty is a constant hum in the background, but it’s tangled up with something deeper: a relocation dilemma of the soul.

If I can work from a mountain town or a beachside cottage, what does "home" even mean now? That Boston address was part of my identity. Letting it go feels like admitting the old rules are truly gone for good. I’m standing at a crossroads where finance, career, and personal desire all collide, and the signposts are all blank. I’m just trying to draw a new map, one uncertain decision at a time.
