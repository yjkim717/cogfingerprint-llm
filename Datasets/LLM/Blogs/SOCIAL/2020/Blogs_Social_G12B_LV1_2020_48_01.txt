## The Spreadsheet Stared Back (and So Did the Future)

It’s officially late 2020, and I feel like I’ve spent the last six months staring at a spreadsheet. Not a glamorous spreadsheet, mind you. This one’s filled with housing prices, potential rental costs, RSU vesting schedules, and a whole lot of “what ifs.” 

See, I’m a software engineer living in Boston, and the housing market here… well, it’s been wild. We bought our little house a few years back, and to say it's appreciated is an understatement. We’re sitting on a decent chunk of equity. The logical thing, financially, is to sell, right? Especially with the rise of remote work.

Suddenly, being tied to Boston felt… less essential. My company’s embraced remote work with surprising openness, and the idea of escaping the city’s insane cost of living is incredibly tempting. But then the fear creeps in. What if we sell and housing prices skyrocket even further? What if we regret losing the little bit of stability we’ve built?

And then there's the RSU thing. Stock options are a huge part of compensation in this industry, and the vesting schedule is a constant, low-level hum of anxiety. Selling now could mean missing out on a significant chunk of potential future value, but holding on feels like a gamble.

It’s not just about the money, though. It's about the feeling of…rootedness. We’ve built a life here. Friends, routines, a sense of belonging. Trading that for…what? A bigger house somewhere cheaper? A different set of anxieties?

Honestly, the spreadsheet hasn’t given me any clear answers. It’s just a reflection of the uncertainty swirling around, both in the housing market and in the world at large. Maybe that’s just 2020 in a nutshell.
