It’s March 2020, and the world feels upside down. I keep seeing the “thank you healthcare workers” signs in windows, and while I love the sentiment, it started to feel… distant. So, I did something a little awkward: I directly messaged a nurse I know from high school.

“We see you working so hard,” I typed. “But saying ‘thanks’ feels empty. What can we *actually* do for you and your colleagues?”

Her reply was a quiet avalanche. It wasn’t about homemade masks—they couldn’t use them at the hospital. It was about the small, tangible things that preserve sanity. “Could you grocery shop for my elderly neighbour so I don’t have to worry about her after my double shift?” she asked. “Or just text to ask how my *day* was, not just my work?”

It hit me then. The most profound support isn’t always a grand gesture. It’s taking one concrete, personal worry off their overburdened shoulders, freeing them to focus on the monumental task at hand. Our job isn't just to stay home; it's to actively lift them up.
