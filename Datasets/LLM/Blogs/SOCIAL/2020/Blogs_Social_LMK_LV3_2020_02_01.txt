As I dived into Half-Life: Alyx in 2020, I was excited to experience the latest in VR gaming. However, I soon encountered a frustrating issue with the pistol's reflex sight - it seemed designed with a dominant eye in mind. As someone who's always tried to adapt to gaming norms, this realization made me think about the often-overlooked nuances of gaming accessibility. It sparked a reflection on how game design can unintentionally exclude players, highlighting the need for more inclusive gaming experiences that cater to diverse player needs.
