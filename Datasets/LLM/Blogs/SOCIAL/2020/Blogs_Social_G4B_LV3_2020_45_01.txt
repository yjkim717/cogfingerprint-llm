**The Scroll & The Soul: Finding Balance in 2020**

Remember 2020? It felt… relentless, didn’t it? For many of us, “work from home” became the new normal, and suddenly, our living rooms were our offices. But it also meant blurring the lines between work and *life*. I found myself endlessly scrolling through social media, feeling this gnawing sense of needing to *do* something, even when I was utterly exhausted. 

It really hit me that a consistent routine – even a small one – was vital.  Dressing for “work” (even if it was just putting on a real shirt!), setting clear boundaries, and consciously stepping away from the endless feed actually boosted my productivity and, surprisingly, my mental health.  It wasn’t about being perfect, just about intentionally building a space for focus and a little bit of peace amidst the chaos.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a post based on a different summary/keywords?
