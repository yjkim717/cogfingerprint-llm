## Beyond the Masks: What We *Really* Need to Do for Our Nurses

Remember early 2020? The initial wave of panic, the frantic sewing circles churning out homemade masks? I definitely participated, feeling like I *had* to do *something* while the news was filled with stories of overwhelmed hospitals. And honestly, the intention was good. We all wanted to help.

But lately, I’ve been thinking about it. I saw a post the other day, a nurse gently explaining that while the thought was appreciated, those masks weren't a substitute for proper PPE. It hit me hard. We, as civilians, were so eager to *do* something, but were we really considering what nurses actually *needed*?

It’s easy to feel helpless in the face of a crisis, but maybe "helping" isn't always about tangible items. Maybe it's about advocating for better funding, supporting mental health resources for frontline workers, or simply offering unwavering gratitude and understanding.  It's about acknowledging the immense pressure they're under, and recognizing that their safety – and their mental well-being – is paramount. Let's shift our energy from well-meaning but ultimately inadequate gestures to actions that truly make a difference.
