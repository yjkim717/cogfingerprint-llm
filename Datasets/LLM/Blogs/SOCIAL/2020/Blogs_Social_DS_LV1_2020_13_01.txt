It’s 2020, and here in Southern Oregon, I’m learning that being a foster parent means fighting battles you never see coming. My newest kiddo, let’s call her Maya, is a bright, artistic 13-year-old. But lately, she’s started hiding her smile behind her hand. Her teeth are severely misaligned, and the state insurance that covers her foster care? It draws a hard line at orthodontics. "Medically unnecessary," they say. Tell that to a teenager whose confidence is crumbling.

We’ve hit dead ends with local orthodontists for pro bono work—their chairs are full, their budgets tight. So, we did the very 2020 thing and started a GoFundMe. It feels strange, turning to internet strangers for help, but what’s the alternative? Watching a child retreat from the world? This isn’t just about straight teeth; it’s about giving a young person who has already faced too much instability a reason to smile without shame. It’s a stark reminder of the gaps in our safety net, and how community—even the digital kind—has to step in where systems fall short.
