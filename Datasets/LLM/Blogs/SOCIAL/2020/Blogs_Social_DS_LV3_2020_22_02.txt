The invisible weight of a migraine isn’t something you can easily explain over a Zoom call in 2020. While the world outside grapples with a collective crisis, my personal one has been a constant companion for years—a chronic, throbbing pain that others often mistake for a simple headache.

I smile through meetings, type emails through a haze of discomfort, and cancel plans last-minute, all while battling a storm inside my skull. The frustration comes not just from the pain itself, but from the quiet misunderstanding in people’s voices when they say, “But you look fine!” They see me functioning and assume I’m okay, not realizing that showing up is sometimes the hardest part.

Living like this in a year already filled with isolation has been uniquely challenging. It’s a lonely road when your struggle is invisible, and the expectation to “keep going” feels louder than ever. But if there’s one thing 2020 has taught me, it’s that everyone is fighting a battle you can’t always see—mine just happens to pulse relentlessly behind my eyes.
