## The Graphic Tee & The Echo Chamber

It’s 2020, and somehow, even through the global pandemic and the endless doomscroll, I’ve managed to find a new, particularly irritating source of stress: the internet. Specifically, people's opinions about *me* on the internet.

It started innocently enough. I finally bought a bunch of graphic tees – you know, the kind with silly band logos and vintage movie posters. They make me happy. They’re comfortable. They’re *me*. But apparently, that’s become a lightning rod for…feedback.

"Why would you wear *that*?" "That's not really your style, is it?" And the worst, the ever-present, “You’re trying too hard.”

It's a relentless drip, drip, drip of negativity, mostly from people I don’t even know. And it’s weird, because it’s not just the tees. It's the hobbies I've started, the books I'm reading, even the way I express myself online. It's like people are actively looking for things to critique.

Honestly, it's chipped away at my self-esteem more than I'd like to admit. I found myself second-guessing everything. Was I *too* enthusiastic about my new pottery class? Was my excitement about re-watching *The Princess Bride* for the millionth time embarrassing?

Then I realized something. These comments, these unsolicited critiques? They’re not about me. They’re about *them*. They’re about projecting their own insecurities and anxieties onto someone who’s just trying to enjoy their life.

So, yeah, I'm going to keep wearing my graphic tees. I’m going to keep geeking out over things that bring me joy. And I’m definitely working on setting some serious personal boundaries online. Because my happiness isn’t up for debate. It's mine. And 2020 is hard enough without letting strangers dictate it.
