As I reflected on my 2020 vaping mishap, I'm reminded of the Buddha's teachings on mindfulness. I had opted for a cheap, suspiciously priced cannabis vape cart, thinking it was a harmless indulgence. But the anxiety and paranoia that followed were a harsh wake-up call. I realized that cutting corners can have a steep price. Counterfeit carts can be toxic, and the risks far outweigh any perceived savings. Now, I prioritize authenticity and safety, and I'm grateful for the lesson learned. It's a reminder to stay present and aware, even in the simplest of indulgences.
