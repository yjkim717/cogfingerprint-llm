**Thinking About Wheels & Worry**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was just… trying to figure things out. I was still recovering from a pretty jarring car accident, and the insurance payout felt both huge and incredibly stressful. Replacing a car is a massive expense, right? Lately, I’ve been seriously considering an ebike.
