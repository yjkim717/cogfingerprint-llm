It’s wild to think that back in 2020, my biggest project became my own well-being. Stuck at home, I decided to finally commit to a simple, at-home workout routine. No fancy equipment, just consistency. Pairing that with a conscious effort toward healthy eating wasn’t easy at first, but I started small.

What kept me going was tracking my personal progress, not perfection. I’d celebrate being able to do one more push-up or choosing a salad over takeout. That tiny spark of achievement became my daily motivation. It wasn’t about a dramatic transformation, but about feeling stronger and more clear-headed. In a year of so much uncertainty, this small, personal journey gave me a sense of control and a genuinely positive outlook. It taught me that the most profound changes often start within our own four walls.
