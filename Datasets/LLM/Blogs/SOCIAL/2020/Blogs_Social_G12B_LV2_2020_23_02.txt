## The Lingering Echo of *Killing Stalking*

Okay, I just finished *Killing Stalking*, and wow. It's… a lot. The art is gorgeous, undeniably, but the story itself? So complex, so *problematic* in places. I'm wrestling with some real conflicted feelings. The shipping discourse is wild, and honestly, I get it. It's hard to shake the emotional response to these characters, even knowing their actions. It’s a story that sticks with you, even when you wish it didn’t.



Anyone else feel this way?
