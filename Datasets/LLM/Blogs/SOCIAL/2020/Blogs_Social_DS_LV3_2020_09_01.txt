It’s 2020, and I’m reflecting on the financial journey I started eight years ago. Back then, I was laser-focused on meeting those MEC requirements and navigating the 7-pay criteria. Now, as I look at my deposit limits and consult with my IBC professional, I realize it’s not just about compliance—it’s about building a secure future for my family. It feels empowering to finally see the long-term vision coming to life, step by careful step.
