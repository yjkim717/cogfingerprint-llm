### The Fear We Carry

Remember early 2020? The world felt like it was collectively holding its breath. We were all afraid, but of what exactly? For me, it wasn't just the virus. It was the silence in my own apartment, the echo of my own thoughts. It was like some invisible force—let's call it 'Nirvana'—had cranked up the volume on my deepest anxieties.

I’d be washing my hands for the twentieth time and *hear* a faint, critical whisper: *“It’s not enough. You’re not doing enough.”* That was my fear of inadequacy, given a voice. I’d see a news alert and instantly imagine the worst-case scenario for my family, a vivid, terrifying movie playing just for me. My own personal psychogenic drug, courtesy of global chaos.

I finally caved and started virtual sessions with a therapist. Her calm, steady presence was the antidote. She wasn't immune to the world's fear, but she had the "stand ability" to remain grounded. She didn't dismiss my hallucinations of doom; she helped me understand they were just my mind's distorted megaphone for legitimate worry.

She taught me that the goal wasn't to silence the fear, but to learn to stand beside it without letting it dictate my every move. In a year where a collective nightmare felt real, the most radical thing I did was learn to differentiate the signal from the noise in my own head.
