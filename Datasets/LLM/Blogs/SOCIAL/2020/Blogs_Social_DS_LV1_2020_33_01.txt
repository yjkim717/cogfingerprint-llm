It’s 2020, and I’m staring at a screen, realizing my dream of 100% completion in my favorite online game is gone forever. The servers shut down last week. It’s a strange feeling—like a piece of the world I loved just vanished.

It reminds me of how we chase connections, both in games and life. When the platform disappears, what’s left? Maybe it’s not the trophies that matter, but the memories we made along the way.
