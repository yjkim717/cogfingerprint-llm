It’s funny how a single image can haunt you. Lately, I keep thinking about that grainy, black-and-white film from the 1950s—the one with the child wandering through a ruined landscape, a quiet echo of a war they never knew. In 2020, as our own world felt fractured by a different kind of battle, that scene resonated deeply. It wasn't just about the past; it was about the quiet, solitary walks we all took, navigating the emotional rubble of a pandemic. Sometimes, the oldest stories hold up the clearest mirror, reminding us that resilience often looks like a small figure, simply putting one foot in front of the other, moving forward.
