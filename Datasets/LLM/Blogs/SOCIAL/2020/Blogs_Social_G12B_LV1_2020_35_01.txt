>Okay, here's a blog post inspired by the provided keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational tone and clear storytelling, set in a 2020 context. I've focused on the emotional journey and internal conflict, rather than explicitly diagnosing or labeling the friend.  I've included a suggested title and a couple of potential image ideas at the end.

**Title: The Weight of Letting Go (and the Lingering "What If?")**

It’s funny, isn't it? How friendships can just… unravel. Especially in a year like 2020. We were *already* all feeling isolated, craving connection, clinging to whatever lifeline we could find. And sometimes, those lifelines aren’t what they seem.

I'm still processing something that happened a few months ago, and I felt compelled to write about it, partly to make sense of it myself, and partly, maybe, to let others know they’re not alone if they’ve been through something similar.

I had a friend – let’s call her Sarah – who I’d known for a few years. We’d been through a lot together, or at least, that's how it felt. She was always the one with a crisis, the one needing a shoulder to cry on, the one who needed *something*. Initially, I was happy to be there. I'm a naturally empathetic person, and I genuinely wanted to help.

But over time, it started to feel… different. The crises became more frequent, more dramatic. There were sudden, urgent texts at all hours. “I need you *now*! Something terrible has happened!” And you'd rush to respond, your heart pounding, only to find out it was… something relatively minor, blown completely out of proportion. Or, worse, a fabrication.

I remember one specific incident that really shook me. She made a veiled threat, hinting at self-harm if I didn't do something she wanted. The guilt was overwhelming. I felt responsible for her well-being, and the thought of anything happening to her was terrifying.  I did what she asked, because in that moment, I just wanted the anxiety to stop.

It was a slow realization, a creeping sense of unease that built up over months. I started noticing the manipulation, the way she'd twist situations to make me feel guilty or obligated. The lies became more blatant. The constant need for reassurance, the fishing for compliments, the subtle digs disguised as jokes... it was exhausting.

Finally, I reached a breaking point. I realized I was sacrificing my own mental health, my own peace of mind, to prop up someone who wasn't truly interested in supporting me. It felt incredibly isolating, especially during the pandemic when genuine connection felt so vital.

So, I blocked her. It was the hardest thing I’ve done in a long time.  And now? The guilt hasn't completely vanished. There's a constant hum of "What if I could have done something more?" And the fear that maybe, just maybe, I made the wrong decision. But alongside that, there’s a growing sense of relief, a reclaiming of my own boundaries, and a quiet hope that I can finally focus on nurturing relationships that are built on mutual respect and genuine care.

It’s a messy, complicated
