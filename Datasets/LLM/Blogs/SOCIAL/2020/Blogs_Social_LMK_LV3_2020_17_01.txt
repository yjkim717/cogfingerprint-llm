"In 2020, I found myself isolating not just from the world, but from my own anxiety. Living with emetophobia, the fear of vomiting, had become a suffocating reality. The thought of losing control terrified me. As I navigated the challenges of lockdown, I realized I wasn't alone in my fears. Connecting with others who shared similar experiences was a lifeline. Sharing our stories, we found solace in the understanding that our struggles, though isolating, were not unique. In vulnerability, we discovered a sense of community and healing."
