## The Unsent Email and a Whole Lot of Question Marks

It’s 2020, and we're all navigating a new normal with Google Classroom. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with something… unsettling. A student insisted they’d submitted all their late work, but my system clearly showed otherwise. It wasn't about the assignments themselves, but the *disconnect*. Did they genuinely not realize? Were they confused by the platform? Or was something else at play? 

It left me feeling deflated, questioning how to bridge this gap. It’s a reminder that technology, while helpful, doesn't replace clear communication and a focus on fostering true understanding – especially when academic integrity feels a little shaky.
