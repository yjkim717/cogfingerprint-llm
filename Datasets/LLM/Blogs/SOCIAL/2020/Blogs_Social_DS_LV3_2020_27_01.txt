At 21, my $25k salary felt like a mountain to climb. That new truck payment and lot rent? They were my anchors, grounding me in a reality where every dollar had a purpose. It was 2020, a year that taught us all about isolation, but my dream was a small, solitary homeâ€”a sanctuary. Budgeting became my map, not a restriction. It was the quiet, determined work of building a life, piece by piece, on my own terms.
