**The Weight of a Dream House**

Remember 2020? Everything felt… weighty. We were all trying to hold onto dreams, build new ones, and just *stay* afloat. I was completely lost in *The Sims 4*, obsessing over creating the perfect legacy family. And it hit me: the game just doesn’t get inheritance right. 

It’s frustrating, right? Watching your Sims’ parents die and then staring at a beautiful, empty lot, knowing *none* of those hard-earned lot funds transfer. It felt like a tiny, digital reflection of the real-world anxieties we were all facing – the feeling of losing something precious and not having a clear path forward.  #Sims4 #LegacySims #GamingReflections

How does this draft feel? Would you like me to tweak it, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
