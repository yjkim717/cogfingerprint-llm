It’s 2020, and my stomach gurgles like a backed-up sink. I’ve lived with "noburp" my whole life, a weird quirk that fuels my social anxiety. The gurgles are loud, unpredictable, and honestly, a little embarrassing in quiet rooms.

Now, I’m staring down a potential solution: Botox. The irony isn’t lost on me. The very treatment that could free me from this is my biggest fear, thanks to my emetophobia. It feels like a cruel joke. Do I choose a lifetime of gurgles or face my deepest dread for a chance at normalcy?
