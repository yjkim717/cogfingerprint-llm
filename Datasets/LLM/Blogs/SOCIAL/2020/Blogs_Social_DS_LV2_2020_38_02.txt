Of course, here is a reflective blog post written from the perspective of a Game Master in 2020.

### The Best-Laid Plans of GMs and Men

Well, that didn’t go as planned.

I’d spent weeks building a sprawling city, a corrupt government, and a shadowy conspiracy for my players to uncover. The stage was set. The clues were planted. All they had to do was follow the trail.

So, of course, they decided to buy a tavern.

Instead of investigating the noble’s murder, they were haggling over the price of vintage ale. Instead of tailing the secret police, they were hiring a bard and naming the place “The Tipsy Beholder.” My intricate plot was gathering dust while they debated barstool aesthetics. My first instinct? Panic. Then, a familiar, tempting thought: just *make* them go to the crime scene. A sudden city-wide curfew? A fire in their new cellar?

But 2020 has taught all of us a thing or two about letting go of plans. This year, every meticulously crafted calendar, every vacation, every simple get-together, has been erased or rewritten. We’ve all had to throw our scripts out the window.

So, I took a deep breath and did the same. I let them run the tavern.

And a funny thing happened. Their tavern became the hub for the city’s gossip. The bard heard rumors from drunken guards. Their new cook was an informant for the thieves' guild. Their choice didn’t derail the story; it just built a new, more vibrant track toward it, one I never could have designed alone.

Being a GM is a lot like navigating this year. You can’t control the chaos, but you can build alongside it. The real story isn’t the one you pre-write in isolation; it’s the one you discover together, one unexpected choice at a time. And sometimes, the most epic adventures start by pulling a pint for a regular.
