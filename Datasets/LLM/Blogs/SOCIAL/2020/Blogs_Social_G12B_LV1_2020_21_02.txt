## The Ghosts in My Feed & Why I'm Taking a Break

It's 2020. Need I say more? The world feels like a constantly fluctuating AC voltage – never steady, always shifting. And I’ve been staring at my social media feeds, feeling a little like a multimeter trying to grasp the *instantaneous* feeling of it all.

You know, like when you’re measuring AC voltage, a multimeter gives you the RMS value – the effective one. But the actual voltage is constantly spiking and dipping, a chaotic waveform.  It made me think about scrolling. I'm seeing snapshots, curated moments, the 'RMS' of everyone's life. But the *instantaneous* feelings – the anxieties, the quiet struggles, the genuine boredom – those get lost in the constant stream.

I’ve been feeling a disconnect, a sense of being overwhelmed by the collective “effective happiness” on display. So, I’m stepping back for a bit.  Maybe I'll recharge, like a capacitor storing energy, and come back with a better sense of how to navigate this digital landscape without getting lost in the fluctuating signals. Wish me luck!
