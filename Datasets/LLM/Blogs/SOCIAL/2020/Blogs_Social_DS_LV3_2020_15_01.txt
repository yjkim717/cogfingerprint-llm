It’s funny how certain books from childhood stick with you, even when the details get fuzzy. I was scrolling through an online book forum recently—one of those 2020 lockdown pastimes—and someone was desperately trying to recall a story where the main character, in some dramatic scene, swung an axe and accidentally embedded it in his own leg.

That post took me right back to middle school, probably assigned for some class project. I can’t remember the title either, just that visceral, cringe-worthy moment. It makes me think about how stories shape our early understanding of consequence and vulnerability. We were just kids, safely exploring life’s sharp edges through the pages of a book. I wonder if that character learned a hard lesson; I know we readers certainly did.
