**The Dress Code That Felt… Wrong**

Okay, let’s be real – remember those awkward years of adolescence? I’m thinking back to 2018, specifically, and a couple of times I felt completely sidelined because of school dress codes. It wasn’t about fashion, not really. It was about feeling like my body was being constantly scrutinized, judged, and frankly, sexualized. 

I remember one time getting called out for a skirt being “too short,” and another when a crop top was deemed inappropriate. It felt so ridiculous, like the rules were designed to make us feel uncomfortable, not safe. 

Looking back, it’s wild how these seemingly small moments can really impact your body image and your overall school experience. It made me question everything, and I know I wasn't alone in feeling that way. What are your memories of navigating rules like these?
