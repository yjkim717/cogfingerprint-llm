**The Unexpected Comfort of a Burrito (and a Bigger Question)**

2020… it felt like a year of searching for anchors, didn’t it?  For me, it started with migraines, those brutal headaches that just… shut everything down. And then, strangely, a craving. Not for anything healthy, or even particularly good, but for a burrito. A *big* burrito. 

It began as a small comfort, a way to soothe the pain. But it quickly spiraled. I was ordering them constantly, spending a small fortune, and honestly, feeling worse afterward. It became this awful, predictable habit – a Pavlovian response to a headache. 

It made me think about social media too. We build these online ‘comforts’ – scrolling, liking, reacting – and they can become automatic, almost addictive.  Are we seeking genuine connection, or just a quick, fleeting feeling of ease?  Maybe it’s time to rethink what we’re feeding ourselves, both physically and digitally.  It's about finding those mindful self-care practices, not just chasing the next instant hit.
