It’s 2020, and I’m scrolling through documentaries when a familiar melody hits—one I’ve heard in a techno track somewhere. That beat, that sample—it’s like a ghost from a pre-pandemic rave, tugging at memories of crowded dance floors and shared energy.

Now, in isolation, I’m obsessively searching for it online, posting in forums, asking strangers for help. It’s funny how a simple melody can bridge time and space, connecting me to a past self and to others now, all through screens. In a year of distance, these small, shared cultural threads feel more vital than ever—reminding us that even alone, we’re tuned into the same rhythms of life.
