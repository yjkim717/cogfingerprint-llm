It’s 2020, and I think we’re all breathing in some kind of hallucinogenic gas. Okay, not literally—but doesn’t it feel like our deepest fears have been pulled out of us and set loose? The uncertainty, the isolation, the endless news cycles… It’s like a Stand called Nirvana has infected the whole world, making us face things we never wanted to see.

I’ve watched friends spiral over “what ifs,” and I’ve been there myself—convinced the worst was just around the corner, reacting in ways that felt completely out of my control. It’s terrifying when fear takes the wheel. But then I think about the psychotherapist in that story—the one who stays grounded while everyone else is lost in their hallucinations. And it hits me: maybe that’s the lesson here.

We can’t stop the fear from manifesting. Life will always have its uncontrollable moments. But we can learn to observe those fears without letting them define us. It’s about finding that quiet center, that fearless part of ourselves that says, “I see you, fear, but you don’t own me.” In a year that’s felt like one collective bad trip, maybe our job is to be our own calm in the chaos—to breathe deep, and remember we’re still here, still standing.
