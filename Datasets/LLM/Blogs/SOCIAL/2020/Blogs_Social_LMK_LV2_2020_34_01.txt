"Unpacking the Unwritten Rules: My Journey with Dress Codes"

As I look back on my school days, I'm reminded of the countless times I was pulled aside by a teacher or administrator for violating the dress code. It was 2020, and I was in high school, navigating the challenges of adolescence. But it wasn't just the rules that stuck with me - it was the way they made me feel. Being dress coded was never just about the clothes; it was about being policed, scrutinized, and shamed. I wasn't alone in this experience. Many of my friends, mostly girls, faced similar struggles. We were told our shoulders were too distracting, our shorts too short. It was a never-ending battle. As I reflect on those experiences, I'm left wondering: what's the real purpose of dress codes? Is it to promote a safe learning environment or to perpetuate sexism and body shaming? I'd love to hear your story - share your ridiculous dress code experiences with me.
