**Lost in the Glow of a Birthday Wish**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was just… existing, trying to find a little light. Scrolling through social media felt particularly intense. Then, I stumbled across a wave of birthday posts for Lee Taemin – genuine adoration, homemade edits, the whole shebang. It was a tiny, beautiful reminder of the power of connection. 

Seeing those fans, so clearly inspired by his artistry, sparked something in me. It wasn’t about the K-Pop itself, but the feeling of being part of a collective wish, a shared moment of joy.  Sometimes, a little online positivity is exactly what you need to feel less lost.
