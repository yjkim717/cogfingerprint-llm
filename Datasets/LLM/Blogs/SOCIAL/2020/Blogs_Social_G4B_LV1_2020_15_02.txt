Okay, here’s a blog post reflecting on social connection in 2020, aiming for around 233 words and a conversational tone, inspired by the imagery and gameplay elements of the provided game summary:

**Lost in the Trees (and the Algorithm)**

It feels a little silly to compare my 2020 to a pixelated platformer, but honestly, sometimes that’s the only way I can make sense of it. I was spending so much time scrolling – not through a game, but through endless feeds, desperately searching for…something.  Like collecting keys to unlock a feeling of connection. 

Remember those early 90s platformers? You’d just *go*, jumping and dodging, driven by this simple goal. I felt like I was doing the same thing with social media, constantly moving, trying to find a level where I felt genuinely seen. The forest setting – that dense, overwhelming feeling of everything looking the same – that was pretty accurate.  

Everything felt filtered, polished, and utterly distant.  I was collecting likes and comments, little digital keys, but they didn’t actually *open* anything. It was exhausting. 

There were moments, of course. Brief flashes of sunlight breaking through the trees – a genuinely supportive message, a video call with a friend. But then the algorithm would shift, and I’d be back in the scrolling, the relentless pursuit of validation. 

This year forced a pause, a retreat into the "forest."  It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it reminded me that real connection isn’t about collecting virtual keys; it’s about actually *being* present, even if it’s just a quiet, pixelated moment with someone you care about.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps generate something with a different focus?
