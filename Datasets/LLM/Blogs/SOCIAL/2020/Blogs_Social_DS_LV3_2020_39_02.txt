The silence stretched for a month. No texts, no calls, just the deafening quiet of being ghosted by someone I loved. When he finally reappeared in late 2020, his voice was a familiar comfort, a warm blanket in a year that felt so cold and isolated. The relief was immediate, a wave washing over the constant ache of confusion.

But as we tentatively started talking again, a new, colder feeling settled in my chest. The trust was fractured. My mind kept replaying those thirty days of radio silence, and it started to feel less like a simple mistake and more like a form of emotional bullyingâ€”a power play that left me questioning my own worth.

Now, this fragile reconciliation hangs in the balance. I want to believe in second chances, in the person I fell for. But every time my phone lights up, a part of me flinches. Is this the start of a real recovery, or am I just waiting for the next unexplained disappearance? The comfort of his presence is now forever tangled with the fear of it happening all over again.
