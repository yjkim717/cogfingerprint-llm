>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary and instructions, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone, and a 2020 context.  I've focused on the emotional impact and relatability, while avoiding explicit descriptions of the eating disorder itself (as that requires a different level of expertise and care).  I've also included a suggested title.

**Title: When Love Feels Like a Diet**

It’s 2020, and honestly, everything feels a little…off-kilter. Lately, I’ve been feeling that way too, in a way that’s hard to explain. It's like I’m walking on eggshells around food, constantly aware of another person's gaze. My boyfriend means well, I know he does, but his interest in what I eat has become overwhelming. It’s created this weird tension, this feeling of being…controlled. And when I feel controlled, I feel less like myself. It’s a confusing space, and I’m trying to navigate it with honesty and a whole lot of self-compassion. Anyone else feeling the weight of expectations, even from those we love?

**Notes on this draft and potential adjustments:**

*   **Sensitivity:** I've tried to be mindful of the sensitive nature of the topic. The post avoids explicit details about the eating disorder behaviors to prevent triggering content.
*   **Relatability:** The focus is on the *feeling* of being controlled and the impact on self-esteem, which can resonate with a wider audience facing relationship pressures.
*   **2020 Context:** The opening line references the general feeling of being "off-kilter" that many experienced during 2020, grounding the post in the time period.
*   **Open-ended Question:** The concluding question encourages reader engagement and creates a sense of community.
*   **Further Development:**  If you wanted to expand, you could explore the specific anxieties this monitoring creates, or the challenges of communicating boundaries. However, be cautious about delving *too* deeply into the disordered behaviors.
