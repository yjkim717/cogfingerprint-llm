### The Echo in the Empty Room

I think 2020 broke a lot of us in a quiet way. Not just the obvious stuff—the fear, the loss, the relentless news cycle. I’m talking about the silence that settled in after the world hit pause. The kind of silence that’s so heavy, it has its own sound. For me, it was the sound of my own thoughts, echoing in an empty apartment, growing louder and more distorted with each passing day.

Before all this, I was an expert at outrunning my own mind. A busy schedule, coffee with friends, a crowded room—these were my shields. But in the isolation, those shields vanished. I was left alone in a room with the one person I’d been trying to avoid: myself. The emotional pain I’d been numbing for years suddenly had my undivided attention. It was like a dormant beast waking up, and it was hungry.

My inner demons, which I’d once managed to keep in the background, became my only company. They weren’t dramatic or monstrous; they were a constant, critical whisper. *You’re not doing enough. You’re completely alone. This pain is all you deserve.* In a moment of overwhelming despair, I turned that voice into a physical mark—a single, stark line of self-harm. It wasn’t a cry for help; no one was there to hear it. It was a desperate, flawed attempt to make the internal hell feel tangible, something I could maybe understand and control.

Looking at that scar now, I don’t see strength or shame. I see a relic from the time I got lost in the silence. Healing didn’t start with a grand revelation, but with a tiny crack in the isolation—a text message replied to, a virtual support group joined. It was the terrifying, necessary step of admitting that my personal demons were too loud to fight alone. The silence is still there sometimes, but now I know it doesn't have to be empty. It can be filled with my own voice, asking for help.
