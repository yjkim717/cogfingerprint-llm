)_The Echo of a Challenge_

Remember that feeling? Back in *World of Warships Legends*, during the Wichita campaign, the Hardmode missions weren’t just extra; they were *events*. They genuinely pushed you, demanded real strategy. Now, with the weekly Havocs and this constant sense of needing to log in *right now* to avoid missing out, it feels… different. Less rewarding, more like a race against the clock. I miss that optional, hardcore challenge. Maybe bringing back a taste of those old Hardmode missions could ease the pressure and remind us why we loved this game in the first place? Just a thought._
