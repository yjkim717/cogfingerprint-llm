Of all the things I thought I’d be doing in the chaotic swirl of 2020, coordinating magical assaults in a digital fortress with a team of strangers wasn’t one of them. Yet, here we are. With the world outside often feeling like a fortress of its own—one built on uncertainty and isolation—the small, glowing screen of my phone became an unexpected portal to connection. It was in those frantic, 2-minute battles that I learned a lesson that’s stuck with me far beyond the game: true strength isn’t about being the lone hero; it’s about knowing how to be a great teammate.

I remember one battle vividly. Our team was a random assortment—a couple of Aurors like me, a Professor, and a Magizoologist. We were up against a nasty mix of Dark Wizards and fierce beasts. In my early days, I’d just dive in, casting hexes wildly and dueling the first foe I saw. It was chaotic, and we lost… a lot. But this time was different. I’d been reading up on strategy. Aurors, I learned, aren’t just damage dealers; we’re the focus brokers, the strategic linchpins.

So, I paused. Instead of hoarding my focus, I passed it to our Professor. A few seconds later, a shimmering shield enveloped us all. That small act—that trust—changed everything. Our Magizoologist, now safe to revive fallen teammates without fear, gave a digital thumbs-up. I started targeting my hexes strategically, weakening the foes our Professor was strong against, and leaving the beasts for our Magi. We moved not as five individuals, but as a single unit, a well-oiled machine. When the final foe fell, the victory felt collective, earned.

It’s funny how a game can hold up a mirror to life. In a year where we’ve all been grappling with how to support each other from a distance, that fortress battle was a microcosm of what we need. It’s not enough to just be present; you have to be actively engaged in the success of others. Are you the person hoarding your resources, or are you the one sharing your "focus" to empower the people around you? Are you applying your strengths where they’re needed most, or just where it’s easiest?

In 2020, our real-world "fortresses" were our homes, our Zoom calls, our socially-distanced friendships. The "hexes" were the daily anxieties and challenges. And our "teammates" were everyone from the delivery driver to the family member we checked in on. That little game taught me that victory, whether pixelated or personal, is almost always a team effort. It’s about looking at your team, assessing what’s needed, and asking, "How can I help?" Because when we play to each other's strengths, we all become stronger. And that’s a spell worth casting anytime.
