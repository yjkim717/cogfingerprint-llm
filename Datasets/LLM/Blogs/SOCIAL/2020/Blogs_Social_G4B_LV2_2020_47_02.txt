**The Ghost in the Algorithm**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How we build these little digital shrines to music, desperately clinging to fragments of a song we can’t quite place. I was scrolling through Reddit last year – 2020, remember? – and stumbled across a guy utterly consumed by a techno track. He just *knew* it was special, carried this haunting melody, and was begging the internet to help him identify it. 

It resonated with me, oddly. Like chasing a ghost in the algorithm. We’re so connected, yet sometimes feel profoundly alone in our personal sonic memories.  That feeling of recognizing a snippet and instantly being transported back to a specific moment… it’s powerful.  Maybe that’s why we keep searching – not just for the song itself, but for that shared feeling, that little piece of ourselves reflected back.
