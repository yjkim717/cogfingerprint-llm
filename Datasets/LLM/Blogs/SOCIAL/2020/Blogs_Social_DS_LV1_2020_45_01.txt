It’s 2020, and my kitchen table is now my office. At first, I thought working in pajamas was the ultimate perk. But after a few blurry weeks, I realized I was missing the structure that got me through the day. So, I started a simple ritual: I get dressed for work, just like before. That small act of preparation creates a mental boundary. It tells my brain it’s time to focus, and later, it helps me truly clock out. It’s not about the clothes; it’s about protecting my sanity and my home.
