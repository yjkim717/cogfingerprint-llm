**The Unexpected Wisdom of a Random Crowd**

Honestly, 2020 felt like a year of grasping at straws. The pandemic, the markets… everything felt chaotic and unpredictable. Then I stumbled across this fascinating experiment – a subreddit dedicated to just *guessing* at stock market trends, fueled by ‘wisdom of the crowds’ and a little machine learning. 

It sounded a bit crazy, right? But watching those collective predictions, seeing the sheer volume of opinions, it sparked something. It made me think about how often we dismiss the collective intelligence of everyday people. We tend to rely on experts, on ‘the data,’ but maybe there’s power in simply tapping into the combined intuition of a diverse group. 

It wasn’t about predicting the future, of course. But it was a reminder that sometimes, the most insightful answers aren’t found in complex algorithms, but in the quiet murmur of a surprisingly large crowd.  What do *you* think?
