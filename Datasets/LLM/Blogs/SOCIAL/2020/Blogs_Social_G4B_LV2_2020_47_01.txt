**The Ghost of a Melody**

It’s funny how a single song can transport you. Lately, I’ve been chasing a ghost – a slow, melancholic rock tune, probably from a German band circa the 90s. It’s at the very tip of my tongue, a fragment of a memory. 2020 felt isolating, and this song… it feels like a warm hug from a forgotten time.  Anyone else have that feeling of grasping for a lost piece of their past?
