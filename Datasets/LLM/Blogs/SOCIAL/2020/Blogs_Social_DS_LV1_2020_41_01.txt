It’s late 2020, and I’m scrolling through my phone again, the blue light a constant companion in this strange, isolated year. I stumble across a fan’s dream: a duet between Kang Daniel and Park Jihyo on his song “Touchin’.” The idea just clicks.

In a time when we’re all physically distanced, the thought of two powerful voices harmonizing feels like a metaphor for what we’re missing. It’s not just about the music; it’s about connection. That virtual hope for a collaborative performance became a small beacon. It reminded me that even when we’re apart, we can still create shared moments of joy and anticipation. We build these connections through screens, through music, through collective imagination. That little fantasy was more than a wish for a song—it was a testament to our need to reach out and feel a little less alone, together.
