**The Quiet Battles We Don’t Talk About**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2020. We were all collectively trying to navigate a new kind of isolation – lockdowns, masks, the constant worry. But for me, and I suspect for many others battling chronic migraines, the isolation felt…different. It wasn’t about a physical distance; it was a deep, internal one. 

I’d often go out, look ‘fine’ – a carefully constructed mask of normalcy – and then spend the rest of the day battling a throbbing headache and a crushing sense of being misunderstood. People would ask, “Are you okay?” and I’d force a smile, saying “Yeah, just a little tired,” when honestly, I felt like I was drowning. 

There’s this weird pressure to explain, to justify the pain that isn’t always visible. It’s exhausting. It’s lonely.  It’s a constant reminder that sometimes, the hardest battles are fought in silence.  I started seeking out online communities, just to find people who *got it*.  It made all the difference.
