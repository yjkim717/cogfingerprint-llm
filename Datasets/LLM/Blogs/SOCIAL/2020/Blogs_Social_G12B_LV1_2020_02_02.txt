## The Metaverse and My Secret Second Life (Probably Nothing to Worry About)

Okay, so I saw this post online about Facebook potentially linking throwaway accounts to game bans. My immediate reaction? Eye roll. Seriously, another wave of internet panic. 

It feels like every few months there's a new "they're watching you!" scenario. Remember when everyone was convinced cookies were the end of privacy? 

Look, I get it. The idea of a single digital identity controlling access to *everything*, especially as VR and the "metaverse" start to feel more real, is unsettling. But a widespread, automatic game lockout triggered by a random Facebook account? Feels a bit extreme, doesn't it? Let's hope it's just another round of online anxiety.
