Of all the things 2020 threw at us, I never expected my own brain to turn against me in such a specific, delicious way. It started innocently enough. After a brutal migraine would finally lift, I’d reward myself with a burrito—a comforting, post-headache treat.

But my brain, brilliant and traitorous, began connecting the dots. The first twinge of a headache now triggers an intense, Pavlovian craving for a carne asada burrito. It’s not just a want; it’s a deep, physiological need my body screams for.

So now, in a year defined by isolation and anxiety, my main side-effect is a recurring, expensive burrito habit. My wallet is thinner and my digestion is… protesting. I’ve accidentally conditioned myself, and I’m not sure how to undo it. It’s a bizarre, deeply personal lesson in how our routines can rewrite our instincts, one migraine—and one burrito—at a time.
