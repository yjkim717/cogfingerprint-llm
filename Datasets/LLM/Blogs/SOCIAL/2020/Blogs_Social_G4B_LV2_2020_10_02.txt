**The Gift That Keeps on Giving… Grumbling**

Okay, real talk. 2020 was… a lot. We were all stuck inside, glued to our screens, and desperately seeking connection. And that’s where the unsolicited audio gifts started. Seriously, it was a *thing*. 

I’m a sound engineer, and I love my gear. But there’s a huge difference between genuinely wanting to share a passion and flooding someone’s inbox with a pair of Bluetooth headphones. It’s happened a few times – well-meaning friends and family, bless their hearts, thinking they know exactly what I need. 

Honestly, it’s a surprisingly sensitive topic. As a professional, my workflow and sound quality are *everything*. Receiving a random piece of audio gear, especially if it’s not exactly what I’m looking for, can feel… well, a little dismissive. It’s like they’re saying, "I know *something* about your job." 

I ended up writing a little piece about it, just to explain that a thoughtful recommendation or a contribution to a specific project is *way* more appreciated than a pile of gear.  It’s about respecting someone’s expertise, you know? 

Let’s be honest, the best gifts are the ones that get used, not just sit in a drawer.  What about you? Have you ever received a gift you just didn't need?
