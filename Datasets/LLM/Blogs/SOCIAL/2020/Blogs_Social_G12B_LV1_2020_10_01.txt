>## The Quiet Rebellion of Sourdough

It's funny, isn't it? In the midst of 2020, when the world felt like it was collectively holding its breath, I found myself obsessing over…dough. Specifically, sourdough. 

It started as a whim, a desire to *do* something tangible when everything else felt so impossibly large and overwhelming. I'd seen the Instagram feeds, the perfect loaves with their rustic crusts. But beyond the aesthetics, there was something deeply appealing about tapping into a process so ancient, so intrinsically connected to our ancestors. 

My starter, lovingly named "Hope," was… temperamental, to say the least. Days of bubbling excitement followed by weeks of disheartening stagnation. It felt a bit like life, honestly.  I kept reading about wild yeast, the invisible communities thriving everywhere, just needing a little coaxing. 

It reminded me of a story I’d read about a baker in Vietnam, trying to cultivate wild yeast to feed his village. Something about that simple act of resilience, of finding sustenance and connection in a time of uncertainty, really resonated.  Maybe sourdough wasn't just about bread; maybe it was a quiet rebellion against the chaos, a tiny act of creation in a world that felt increasingly out of control.
