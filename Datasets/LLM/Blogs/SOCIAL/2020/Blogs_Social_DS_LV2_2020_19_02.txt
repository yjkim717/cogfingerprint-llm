### The Noise We Choose to Hear

It’s a strange, heavy feeling, scrolling through my phone in the quiet of another lockdown evening. The world has shrunk to the size of my screen, and lately, that screen has been filled with one name: Sushant Singh Rajput.

I didn’t know him. Not personally. But like many of you, I felt a connection through the characters he brought to life. There was a certain light in his eyes, a relatable energy. And now, that light is gone.

But what’s been almost as heartbreaking as the loss itself is the circus that has followed. The initial, gut-wrenching shock of his suicide was quickly buried under an avalanche of conspiracy theories. My social media feeds have become a battleground of wild accusations, from professional rivalries to sinister murder plots. It’s a gripping, dramatic story, and we’re all hooked.

And I get it. In a year defined by a pandemic and so much uncertainty, a clear-cut villain is easier to process than a complex, painful truth. A conspiracy gives us a target for our anger. It gives us a sense of control.

But at what cost?

In our collective rush to find a "reason," we’ve completely sidelined the real, human reason: depression. We’re talking about everything *except* the silent, internal battle he must have been fighting. We’re dissecting his life, his relationships, his career moves, but we’re refusing to acknowledge the illness that ultimately took him.

It makes me wonder, as a society, are we just uncomfortable with the raw, unglamorous truth of mental health? Is it easier to imagine a villain than to accept that sometimes, the pain is invisible, and the fight is lost from within?

By turning his tragedy into a whodunit thriller, we are not honoring his memory. We are, perhaps unintentionally, stigmatizing the very struggle that led to his death. We are adding to the noise that drowns out the quiet, desperate pleas for help from others who are suffering in silence.

Maybe the most respectful thing we can do is to quiet down, listen, and finally start a real conversation about the pain we can’t always see.
