The Unseen Struggle: A Family's Misunderstanding

As I sat in stunned silence, I couldn't help but think of the countless times I'd been in similar situations. My name is Alex, and I'm 16 with autism. My family and I were in the midst of another heated argument, one that started with a simple glance. Or so they thought.

My sister was studying, and I happened to be walking by, my eyes scanning the room as I often do when I'm anxious or deep in thought. My family, however, misinterpreted this as me staring at my sister, and the yelling began. "What are you looking at?" "Stop staring at your sister!" The words cut deep, not just because of the tone, but because they revealed a deeper misunderstanding.

As someone on the autism spectrum, social interactions can be a minefield. My brain processes things differently, and sometimes my actions are misinterpreted. In that moment, I wasn't trying to be creepy or invasive; I was simply navigating my surroundings in my own way.

This incident highlighted the tension that can arise when neurodiversity isn't understood or accepted. My family's reaction was rooted in a lack of comprehension, and it fueled my social anxiety. It's a vicious cycle: the more they're frustrated with me, the more anxious I become, and the more I struggle to interact with them. As we navigate 2020, a year that's pushed us all to be more empathetic and understanding, I wish my family could see that my autism isn't something to be yelled at â€“ it's a part of who I am.
