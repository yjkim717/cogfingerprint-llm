Remember those early pandemic days when every text felt loaded with possibility? I was 19, endlessly scrolling through a crush’s Instagram from three states away. My biggest fear wasn’t the virus, but the dreaded friend zone. That digital limbo was its own kind of quarantine. Taking a shaky breath, I finally typed, “Want to Zoom sometime, just us?” It was a leap into the unknown, a tiny rebellion against distance. Sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is just ask.
