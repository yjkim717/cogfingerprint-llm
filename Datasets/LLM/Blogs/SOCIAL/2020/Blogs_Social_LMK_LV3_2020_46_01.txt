As I watched Andrei Tarkovsky's films during lockdown in 2020, I was struck by the haunting imagery of ruined landscapes. A particular scene resonated - a child walking alone through a desolate, war-torn area. It felt eerily familiar, reminiscent of WWII footage. The black-and-white cinematography added to the sense of timelessness. It made me reflect on the lasting impact of conflict on our world and the resilience of the human spirit. This classic film, possibly from the 1950s, is a powerful reminder of the importance of peace and rebuilding.
