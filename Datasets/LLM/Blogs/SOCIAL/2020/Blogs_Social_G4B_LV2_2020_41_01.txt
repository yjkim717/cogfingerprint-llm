**Dreaming in Korean – A 2020 Wish**

Okay, real talk. 2020 was… a lot, wasn’t it? A year of feeling a little disconnected, scrolling endlessly, and craving genuine connection. And honestly, a big part of that craving was for a specific kind of performance. 

I found myself constantly fantasizing about a duet – a truly *unique* one. I kept imagining Kang Daniel and Park Jihyo singing together. You know, Daniel’s smooth, powerful vocals paired with Jihyo’s delicate, soulful tone? It just felt… electric. 

It’s silly, I know, just a random internet daydream. But it really highlighted something I was feeling: the beauty of contrasting talents blending together.  Maybe it’s a longing for seeing different perspectives, different voices, truly heard.  Anyone else have a random ‘dream collab’ that’s stuck with them? Let me know in the comments!
