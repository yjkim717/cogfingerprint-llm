>## The Ghosts in the Digital Trophy Room

Remember the thrill of earning a Platinum trophy? That rush of accomplishment, the digital badge gleaming on your profile? Lately, I've been thinking a lot about those moments, and a creeping sense of unease has settled in. Games, even beloved ones, eventually get shut down. Servers disappear. And with them? Those hard-earned trophies, rendered forever out of reach. 

Itâ€™s a strange feeling, like a memory fading. A digital ghost haunting your trophy room. Makes you wonder, does anything truly last in this online world? It's a reminder to savor the *experience*, not just the accolades.
