### The Lesson I Never Signed Up For

It was 2020, a year of so many big, visible problems. But for my daughter, the most confusing battle was fought in her middle school hallway over a strap on her tank top.

A teacher pulled her aside, saying her outfit was a "distraction." At thirteen, she was being told her body was a problem for someone else’s education. My heart broke. I was instantly thrown back to my own school days, being scolded for a skirt that was "too short" while the boys around me wore whatever they wanted.

This isn’t about clothing; it’s about a deeply ingrained gender bias that teaches girls their value is tied to how they are perceived, while letting boys off the hook. It’s a subtle, systemic way of sexualizing children, and in a year where we were all re-evaluating fairness, it felt more unjust than ever. When will the lesson be about respect, and not about our daughters' shoulders?
