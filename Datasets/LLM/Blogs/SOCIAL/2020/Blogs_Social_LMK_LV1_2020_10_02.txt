"The Gift That Made Me Cringe: A Sound Engineer's Dilemma"

As a sound engineer, I'm no stranger to great audio gear. I've spent years honing my craft, working with top-notch equipment, and obsessing over the perfect sound. But when it comes to my daily life, I'm a bit of a cheapskate. I've always been happy with my trusty $20 headphones - they're lightweight, decent sounding, and get the job done.

So, when my fiance surprised me with a pair of high-end Bluetooth headphones in 2020, I was taken aback. At first, I was touched by the thoughtful gift - it was clear she'd put a lot of effort into choosing something special. But as I unwrapped the sleek packaging and revealed the pricey cans inside, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of discomfort.

The headphones were top-of-the-line, with advanced noise-cancellation and crystal-clear sound. They were exactly the kind of thing I'd drool over at audio gear websites, but never thought I'd actually own. As I looked at the price tag, I felt a pang of guilt - it was more than I'd ever spent on headphones before.

I know it sounds strange, but I felt like I'd been given a gift that was somehow...too good for me. I'm a sound engineer, not an audiophile with deep pockets. I'm used to working with a wide range of equipment, not just the most expensive stuff. My fiance meant well, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd rather she hadn't spent so much. Still, I've been using the headphones regularly, and I have to admit - they're pretty amazing. Maybe I've just been spoiled...
