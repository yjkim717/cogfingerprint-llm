### The Boxes in My Hallway and the One in My Chest

There are cardboard boxes stacked in my hallway, filled with my books and his records, a tangible sign that our life is merging into one. It’s 2020, and in a world that feels like it’s falling apart, we’re trying to build something. But the biggest box isn’t made of cardboard; it’s the one sitting squarely on my chest, labeled “Handle With Extreme Care.”

Inside that box are all my unlovable parts. My depression, which sometimes makes the simplest conversation feel like wading through mud. My eating disorder, a secret language of numbers and rules my body understands but he doesn’t. And this constant, humming anxiety that I’m too much work, that my mental health is a burden he never signed up for.

As we tape up the moving boxes, I’m terrified I’m taping my struggles shut, too—pretending they aren’t there so he won’t see the mess. What if he moves in and realizes the person he loves comes with a manual he never wanted to read?

But here’s the fragile hope I’m clinging to: maybe love isn’t about being easy to love. Maybe it’s about being brave enough to say, “This box is heavy. Can you help me carry it?” Maybe our new home isn’t just a shared space, but a shared strength. I’m trying to believe that my struggles aren’t what will push him away, but that our honesty about them is what will truly let him in.
