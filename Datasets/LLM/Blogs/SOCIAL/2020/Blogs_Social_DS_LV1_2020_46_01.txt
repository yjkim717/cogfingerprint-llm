The memory of that film is like a ghost in my mind. I must have been a teenager when I stumbled upon it on some late-night broadcast—a stark, black-and-white world from the late '50s. It felt less like a story and more like a haunting, a Tarkovsky-esque dream.

The entire film was a quiet meditation on a ruined landscape, a clear WWII pastiche. There were no grand battles, only the aftermath. I remember one long, unbroken shot of a small child, impossibly young, picking his way through a skeleton of a city. He wasn’t crying or calling out; he was just walking, a tiny figure in an ocean of rubble. The silence was heavier than any explosion. It wasn’t about who won or lost, but about the sheer, crushing weight of what was left behind. I’ve forgotten the title, but that boy’s journey has never left me.
