>## The Drive-Thru & The Pandemic: A Descent into Fast Food Frustration

Okay, let's be honest, 2020 has been *a lot*. And sometimes, when you're staring down the barrel of another Zoom meeting or a mountain of laundry, the idea of cooking a real meal feels utterly impossible. That’s when the siren song of the drive-thru hits. 

Recently, I succumbed. McDonald’s, specifically. And what followed wasn't a comforting, guilty pleasure, but a slow, simmering frustration. It started with a twenty-minute wait in the line, which, I get, pandemic staffing shortages are real. But then came the order. Wrong fries. Missing sauce. A lukewarm McFlurry. 

It felt… symbolic. Like a tiny, greasy microcosm of the larger chaos of the year.  Is it just me, or did the pandemic amplify these little annoyances? The overwhelmed employees, the rushed processes - it all felt amplified. I wasn’t angry, just…deflated.  I ate the slightly-off burger, sighed, and drove home, feeling strangely defeated by a fast-food meal.  Just another little slice of 2020.
