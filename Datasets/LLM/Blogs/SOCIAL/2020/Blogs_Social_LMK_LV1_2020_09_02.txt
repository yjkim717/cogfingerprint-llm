"As I sat down with a Living Wealth representative in 2020, we dove into the world of Infinite Banking, a concept pioneered by Nelson Nash. The idea resonated with me - using dividend-paying whole life insurance to create a personal banking system. Ray Poteet, a well-known advocate, has successfully implemented this strategy. We discussed how policy loans can be used to finance big purchases, and how this approach can help build wealth over time. It was eye-opening to see how this strategy can be a game-changer for those looking to take control of their financial lives."
