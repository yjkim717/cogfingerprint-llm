"Living with the Unknown: My Journey with Dizziness and Seizures"

As I sit here in 2020, reflecting on the past six years, I'm still trying to make sense of my body's mysterious signals. Dizziness and weakness have been my unwelcome companions, leaving me questioning my every move. My neurologist has diagnosed me with seizures, but I'm not so sure. The more I research, the more I'm convinced that there's more to the story. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) keeps popping up in my searches, and I'm starting to think it might be the missing piece. I've always felt like I'm missing a vital pot - a crucial piece that connects the dots between my symptoms. I'm not alone in this journey; many others are navigating similar uncharted territories. Let's share our stories and find solace in the unknown together. Perhaps, in the process, we'll uncover a clearer diagnosis and a path towards healing.
