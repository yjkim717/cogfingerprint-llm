## The Vape Scare That Made Me Re-Evaluate My Choices

Okay, so I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter online lately, and it’s honestly a little unsettling. A friend shared a Reddit thread the other day about someone's really rough experience with a fake vape cart – a counterfeit ‘Buddha Bros’ one, apparently. They talked about zero effect, followed by a killer headache and just feeling…off. 

It got me thinking. We're all trying to navigate this whole vaping landscape, especially with everything else going on in 2020. The rise of these fake carts is seriously worrying. It's a reminder that sometimes, sticking with what you know – good old-fashioned cannabis – might just be the safest bet. Lesson learned: buyer beware, and maybe I'll stick to flower for a while!
