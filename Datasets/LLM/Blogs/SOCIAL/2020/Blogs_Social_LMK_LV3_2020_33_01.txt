As a trophy hunter, I've often found myself stuck on a game's platinum trophy due to outdated online features. In 2020, it's frustrating to see games with once-thriving multiplayer communities now dwindling. I propose separating online trophies from others, making it easier to achieve that coveted platinum. This simple change would breathe new life into the gaming community, allowing us to focus on the games we love without the added stress of nearly extinct online features. It's time to rethink our approach to online trophies and make platinum hunts more enjoyable.
