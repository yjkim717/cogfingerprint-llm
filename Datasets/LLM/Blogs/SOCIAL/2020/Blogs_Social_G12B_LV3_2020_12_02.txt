## The Ranked Reset and the Return of the… Chaos?

Anyone else feeling a *weird* vibe in League these days? It's 2020, and I swear, with every season reset, a tidal wave of returning and casual players washes over ranked. Don't get me wrong, it's great to see people picking up the game again, but lately, it’s felt like a significant increase in… well, *disruptive* behavior.

I’m talking about the blatant trolls, the intentional feeders, the folks who seem to genuinely believe griefing is a viable strategy. And the frustrating part? It feels like there’s little accountability.  A quick report and then back in the queue, ready to wreak havoc again. 

It’s making climbing feel less about skill and more about enduring a lottery of teammates.  Anyone else experiencing this?  Just venting, because sometimes you just need to acknowledge the chaos!
