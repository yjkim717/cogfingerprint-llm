"Toxicity in Online Gaming: A Frustrating Reality"

As I dived into the world of Rocket League in 2020, I was thrilled to experience the rush of competitive gaming. However, my excitement was short-lived. I found myself matched with seasoned players, known as "smurfs," who were crushing it in unranked matches. It was infuriating to be outperformed by players who were intentionally playing below their skill level, just to troll and dominate newcomers like me.

The ranking system, designed to match players of similar skill levels, seemed broken. I couldn't help but wonder, how long does it take to get re-ranked? The uncertainty was frustrating, and the experience left a sour taste. Smurfing not only ruins the fun for new players but also creates a toxic environment. It's disheartening to see players intentionally ruining the experience for others.

As the gaming community continues to grow, it's essential to address these issues. A fair ranking system and measures to prevent smurfing can make a huge difference. Until then, we'll have to endure the frustration and hope that our gaming experiences improve.
