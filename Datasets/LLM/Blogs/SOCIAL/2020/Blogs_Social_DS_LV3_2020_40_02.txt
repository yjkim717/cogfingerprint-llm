The first time I felt the darkness creeping in after we moved in together, I tried to swallow it. It was 2020, and the world outside was already a pressure cooker of uncertainty. The last thing I wanted was to add my own **depression** and the ghost of an old **eating disorder** to our tiny, shared apartment. I thought I was protecting us, this fragile new thing we were building.

But the silence became its own monster. My **relationship stress** wasn't about fights; it was about the weight of my unspoken fears. I’d retreat, convinced my sadness was a burden he’d eventually tire of carrying. I was so terrified of pushing him away that I built a wall instead.

The turning point was a quiet Tuesday. He simply said, "I can't help if I don't know what's happening in there." It was a plea for **communication**, not an accusation. That’s when I realized true **emotional support** isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about having a shared language for the pain. Letting him in didn’t push him away; it gave him a map to my inner world. It taught me that love isn't about being someone's easy burden, but about trusting them enough to help you carry the heavy one.
