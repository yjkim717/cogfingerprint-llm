>## Remember When We All Cried Over Hakoda?

Okay, seriously, who *didn't* ugly cry during Hakoda's reunion with Katara in *Avatar: The Last Airbender*? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? Back in 2005, that show completely captivated us. And rewatching it now, in 2020, with everything feeling so...heavy, those emotionally charged scenes hit even harder.

It wasn’t just Hakoda’s raw vulnerability, but the way it showcased family, resilience, and hope in the face of absolute adversity.  Sokka's reactions, too! It perfectly captured the power of found family.  Suddenly, all the anxieties of 2020 felt a little less overwhelming, knowing those characters faced seemingly impossible odds and *still* found strength.  Anyone else feel the same?
