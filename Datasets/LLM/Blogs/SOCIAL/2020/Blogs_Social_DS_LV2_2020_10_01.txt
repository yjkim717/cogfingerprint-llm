The scent of woodsmoke hangs thick in the air as I scrub my last mixing bowl. It’s 2020, and while the world feels like it’s closing in, out here in the Vietnamese highlands, my world has become this small village and a singular, stubborn mission: to catch a wild yeast.

Mrs. Lan, our neighbor, watched me leave a jar of flour and water on the windowsill yesterday. She called it “con ma,” a little ghost. I tried to explain it was the opposite—the breath of life for bread. A food none of the elders here have ever tasted.

My phone’s signal flickers in and out, my only tether to online baking forums and their scientific advice. But their sterile instructions feel a world away from the monsoon damp and the chorus of frogs at dusk. This isn’t just about fermentation; it’s a quiet act of hope. In a year of so much separation, I’m trying to create a simple, shared joy from the very air we breathe. If I can just coax this invisible magic to life, maybe we can break bread together, a first taste of a wider world.
