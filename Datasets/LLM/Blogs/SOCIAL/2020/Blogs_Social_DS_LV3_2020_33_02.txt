There’s a certain kind of modern frustration that feels uniquely 2020, and for me, it’s personified by the glowing golden arches of my local McDonald’s drive-through. In a year where leaving the house felt like a calculated risk, the simple pleasure of a hot, correct fast-food order became a tiny, comforting victory I desperately craved.

Yet, every visit was a gamble. I’d pull up, masked and hopeful, reciting my simple order like a prayer. But the intercom voice was always a prelude to disappointment. The bag felt suspiciously light, and sure enough, my fries were cold, my burger was missing the cheese, or I’d ended up with someone else’s Happy Meal.

Sitting in that stagnant line, watching the minutes tick by, felt like a metaphor for the year itself—a slow, unpredictable crawl toward an outcome that was almost certainly wrong. In a time when we all craved a little reliability, that drive-through became a masterclass in letdowns. It wasn’t just about the cold fries; it was about one more thing that just didn’t go right.
