**The Feels of the Field: When Ranked Feels…Wrong**

Okay, let's be real – 2020 was *weird*, right?  The world felt a little off-kilter, and sometimes, even my favorite online games felt a little…unfair. I’m talking about Rocket League, specifically, this weird trend called “Smurfening” – where super-skilled players, often using alt accounts, would flood unranked games just to dominate. 

I remember feeling this intense frustration. You're grinding for ranks, putting in the hours, and then *bam*, you get matched against someone who’s clearly playing at a completely different level. It’s not a fun challenge; it’s just… demoralizing. 

It made me think about something bigger than just a game. It's about the social aspect of online communities. We crave that sense of connection, of competing fairly, of feeling like our efforts are valued. When the playing field isn’t level, it chips away at that feeling. 

I even saw a thread online discussing “rank re-ranking,” basically suggesting a system to separate players based on skill. It felt like a reasonable plea - a way to preserve the joy of climbing the ranks.  Maybe 2020 was a year where we all started to realize that a little bit of fairness goes a long way, both in games and in life.
