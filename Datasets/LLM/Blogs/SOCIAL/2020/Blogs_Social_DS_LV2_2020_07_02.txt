It’s wild to think that just a few weeks ago, my biggest daily decision was whether to hit snooze one more time. Then 2020 happened, and my world—like so many others—shrunk to the four walls of my apartment. The anxiety was real, a constant low hum in the background.

I knew I had to do *something*. So, I rolled out a yoga mat in my living room. No fancy equipment, just a commitment to move for 20 minutes a day. I paired it with actually cooking meals instead of endless snacking.

One week in, and the shift is subtle but profound. The fog has lifted. I feel stronger, not just in my body, but in my mind. In a time of so much uncertainty, this simple routine has become my anchor. It’s a small act of control, a daily reminder that I can still choose to feel good, even now.
