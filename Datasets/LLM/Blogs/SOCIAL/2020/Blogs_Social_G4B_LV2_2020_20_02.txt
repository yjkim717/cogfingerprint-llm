**Scrolling Through a Sea of Faces**

Remember 2020? The world felt…contained, right? We were all just staring at screens, building connections through pixels. I spent so much time scrolling through social media – seeing everyone’s “perfect” lives, their travel photos, their carefully curated happiness. 

It made me realize how lonely that constant comparison could be. Like I was searching for this “all-in-one textbook” for life, trying to absorb everyone else’s experiences and instantly become fluent in their joy. 

Honestly, it was exhausting. I started to intentionally step back, focusing on the real connections around me.  Maybe the best way to learn anything – even a new language – is to simply *be* present, not to endlessly consume.

Would you like me to adjust the tone, length, or focus of this draft in any way?
