It’s 2020, and my grandfather just told me he’s chosen assisted death in two days. The news hit like a gut punch—anger, sadness, and confusion all at once. I wanted to resent him for the suddenness, for leaving us so little time to process. But in our last talks, I saw his peace with the decision. It’s made me reflect on how we handle end-of-life choices as a society. Are we listening enough to those who are suffering, even when their decisions break our hearts?
