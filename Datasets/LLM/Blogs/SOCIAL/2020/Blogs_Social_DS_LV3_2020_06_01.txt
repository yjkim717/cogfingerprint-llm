This past year, 2020, has left me grappling with a deep-seated frustration. It’s as if the world has revealed its true face—one where so many of us feel expendable, stripped of purpose. I look around and see systems that treat people as worthless, and it’s hard not to view the powerful as parasites feeding on our struggles. In moments like these, I question everything, wondering if we’re all just cogs in a machine that’s forgotten its heart.
