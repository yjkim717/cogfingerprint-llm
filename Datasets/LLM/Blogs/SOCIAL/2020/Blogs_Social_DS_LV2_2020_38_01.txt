The year 2020 was a strange time for our weekly D&D game. Stuck inside, our virtual table became a sanctuary. That’s when our Dragonborn cleric, after a nasty head trauma in-game, became utterly convinced the baby black dragon we’d found was an avatar of Tiamat.

We didn't correct him. In a year of so much real-world uncertainty, leaning into his delusion felt… right. It transformed a simple module into a profound story about faith and found family. We protected that "divine" dragon with our lives. It was a beautiful lesson, born from chaos: sometimes the most meaningful connections aren't based on truth, but on the stories we choose to believe in together.
