**The Quiet Power of Policy Networks**

It’s weird how stories spread online, right? I stumbled across a Reddit thread the other day about Ray Poteet, and it really got me thinking. Apparently, this guy built an *incredible* web of life insurance policies – a “living wealth” system, as some call it – and was loaning against them for decades. 

Nelson Nash’s ideas about “infinite banking” suddenly felt less like abstract theory and more like a tangible, almost secretive, wealth-building strategy. It’s fascinating to consider a network like Poteet’s, fueled by repayments and designed to outlive the original owner. Makes you wonder about the power of community and long-term thinking, doesn't it? #infinitebanking #wealthbuilding #raypoteet

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focus on a specific aspect or adjust the length?
