The 2020 ranked season was supposed to be my year—I could feel it. But instead of climbing the ladder, I’ve been trapped in a cycle of frustration. It’s not just about losing; it’s the helplessness when a teammate decides the game is over at five minutes, or another spends more time typing insults than playing.

I’ve realized it’s a shared struggle. We’re all just lockdown players seeking an escape, yet some turn that virtual arena toxic. The punishment system feels like a band-aid on a broken arm. But in these chaotic matches, I’ve found solidarity in the few who still try, who remind me why I log in—not for flawless victories, but for those fleeting moments of teamwork that make it all worthwhile.
