As I scrolled through Reddit in 2020, a user's frustration resonated with me - "Why even vote in Springfield when Chicago decides Illinois' fate?" This sentiment echoed my own concerns about election influence. I realized that voters outside of Chicago felt their voices were drowned out by the city's dominant voting bloc. This sparked a reflection on the value of our vote and the need for fair representation across Illinois.
