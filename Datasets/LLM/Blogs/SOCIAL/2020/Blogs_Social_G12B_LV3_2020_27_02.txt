## Thinking About Trading Packages for a Big Rig? My Honest Thoughts.

So, I’ve been doing this package handling gig at FedEx for a while now, and lately, the idea of switching gears has been swirling in my head. Trucking, specifically. The thought of getting a CDL and hitting the road…it's got a certain appeal, especially with all this talk about driver shortages. 

What really draws me in is the possibility of residential delivery routes – the chance to be home daily. It’s 2020, and honestly, the idea of stability and being close to family feels more valuable than ever. I'm just starting to look into salary expectations and what it *really* takes to get started. Anyone out there made the leap? I'd love to hear your stories!
