"As I watched the news in 2020, I was reminded of a haunting black-and-white film from my childhood. Andrei Tarkovsky's cinematic style came to mind, particularly his use of derelict objects. The film I recalled was likely influenced by the devastation of World War II. A haunting scene stuck with me: a child wandering through rubble-strewn streets. It's a powerful metaphor for the loss of innocence. In today's world, where conflict and destruction still exist, this image resonates deeply, making me reflect on the human cost of war and its lasting impact on our collective psyche."
