It’s 2020, and here I am in my little corner of rural Vietnam, trying to coax wild yeast into existence. My sourdough starter—just flour and water, bubbling hopefully—feels like a metaphor for this year. We’re all isolated, waiting for something to rise.

A neighbor suggested pineapple juice, a trick her grandmother swore by. I tried it, watching tiny bubbles form like distant connections in a disconnected world. It’s funny how this humble jar mirrors our lives: patience, care, and a little sweetness to help things along.

In a time when we can’t share bread in person, sharing stories and tips online feels like breaking virtual loaves together. Maybe that’s the real magic—not just capturing wild yeast, but nurturing community, one bubble at a time.
