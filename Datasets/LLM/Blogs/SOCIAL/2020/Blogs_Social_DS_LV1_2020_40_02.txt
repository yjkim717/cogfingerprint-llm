### The Boxes in My Hallway and the One in My Head

It’s 2020, and my apartment is a maze of half-packed boxes. In a week, my boyfriend and I are finally moving in together. It’s supposed to be exciting, the next big step. But as I look at this chaos, all I can feel is the heavier, invisible box sitting in my mind, labeled “My Issues.”

See, my brain doesn’t always play nice. I have depression, and it often brings its friend, my eating disorder, along for the ride. Lately, they’ve been loud. A quiet dinner can turn into an internal battlefield over a bite of pasta, and a rainy Sunday can feel like a life sentence of grey.

And he sees it. He’s endlessly patient, asking if I’ve eaten or if I need to talk. But his kindness sometimes feels like a spotlight, and I just want to hide. I’m terrified I’m becoming another chore on his list. Are my dark clouds starting to rain on our relationship? Is my “stuff” the third, unwelcome roommate moving in with us?

I’m learning that love isn’t about being a perfect, problem-free partner. It’s about trusting someone enough to say, “This box is really heavy, and I could use a hand carrying it.” Maybe our home won’t be a place where my struggles disappear, but where we face them together, one unpacked box at a time.
