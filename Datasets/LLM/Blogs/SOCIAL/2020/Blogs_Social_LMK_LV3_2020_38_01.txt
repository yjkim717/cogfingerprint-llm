"As I sat around the 2020 D&D table, I was inspired to create a campaign that delved into the psyche of a Dragonborn Cleric struggling to distinguish reality from delusion. The 'Temple of the Mad Dragon Priestess' module took shape, where the cleric's head trauma convinces them a baby black dragon is Tiamat's avatar. I'd love to hear from fellow DMs - how would you guide this character's journey, and what twists would you add to shake their conviction?"
