## The Weight of Family Fortune (and Why Sims 4 Misses the Mark)

Okay, fellow Simmers, let’s talk about something that’s been bugging me. I've been pouring hours into my Sims 4 legacy challenge, building this sprawling family estate over generations. My Sims have worked hard, built businesses, and amassed a serious fortune. But here's the frustrating part: when they kick the bucket, it feels… anticlimactic. 

It just doesn't *feel* right that all that hard-earned wealth doesn't seamlessly transfer to the next generation. Remember Sims 2? The way you'd inherit furniture, family heirlooms, a sense of established history? That felt so much more satisfying, like a true family legacy. It's 2020, and I'm still wishing for a more robust inheritance system in The Sims 4. Anyone else feel this way?
