**Scrolling Through a Different Kind of Struggle**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2020. We were all glued to our screens, watching the world change, but I was also battling a different kind of anxiety – a really basic one. I was 21, making just over twenty-five grand a year, and feeling utterly overwhelmed by bills. 

Everyone online seemed to be sharing stories of career pivots and remote work bliss, but my reality was a tightrope walk between a small house, a surprisingly hefty truck payment (don’t judge!), and the ever-rising cost of… well, *everything*. Scrolling through Instagram felt like a constant reminder of a life I couldn’t quite reach. 

It wasn’t glamorous, and it wasn't about comparing myself, but it was real. And honestly, acknowledging that struggle – the quiet, persistent one – felt like a small victory in a year filled with so much uncertainty.
