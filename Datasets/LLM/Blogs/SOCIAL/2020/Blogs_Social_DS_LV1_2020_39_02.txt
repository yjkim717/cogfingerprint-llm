The silence stretched for a month. Thirty-one days where my texts were met with nothing but that cold, blue ‘delivered’ receipt. I’d been ghosted, completely blocked out, and the anxiety was a physical weight on my chest. Was it me? What had I done?

Then, out of the blue in late 2020, a message. He was back, explaining that he’d been in a dark place, bullied at his remote job until he just shut down. My heart broke for his pain, and we reconciled.

But here’s the messy part no one talks about: the aftermath. My relief is tangled with a constant, low-grade fear. Every time he takes a few hours to reply, my mind jumps back to that month of silence. Is he pulling away again? Is his explanation just emotional manipulation to keep me compliant?

Trust, once fractured, doesn’t just snap back into place. In a year already filled with so much isolation, this personal abandonment cut deep. I’m trying to rebuild, but I’m terrified the foundation is forever cracked.
