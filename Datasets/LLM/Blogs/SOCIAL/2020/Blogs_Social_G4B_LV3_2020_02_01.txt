**The Unexpected Frustration of Online Connection**

Remember 2020? We were all glued to our screens, trying to *connect*. But I found myself wrestling with a weird frustration – a feeling that so many video calls felt…off. It was like trying to aim a pistol with your non-dominant eye; the whole thing just felt awkward and inaccurate.  

I realized it wasn’t the people on the other end, but the way we were *attempting* to communicate.  A quick glance at the screen, a distracted response – it disrupted genuine connection. It made me think about how important it is to truly *see* someone, to meet them where they are, not just visually.
