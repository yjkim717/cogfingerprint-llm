**Finding My Footing in 2020**

Well, 2020 sure threw us all for a loop, didn’t it? With the world suddenly shrinking to the size of my apartment, I felt a bit lost. The constant news cycle was draining, and my motivation was at an all-time low.

So last week, I decided to fight back in a small way. I cleared a corner of my living room for some simple at-home workouts and committed to one proper, home-cooked meal a day. It wasn't about a dramatic transformation, just about feeling a little better.

The real turning point was yesterday. I dusted off my old bike and went for a ride around the neighborhood. The sun on my face and the simple act of moving forward—it was like a switch flipped. For the first time in months, I felt genuinely good. It’s amazing how a little routine and some fresh air can reconnect you with yourself, even when the world feels distant.
