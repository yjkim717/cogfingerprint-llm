**A Chilling Encounter at the Corner Store: A Reflection on Open Carry and Community Safety**

As I reflect on the events of 2020, one incident that still sends shivers down my spine is when a customer walked into our small neighborhood market, gun in hand. It was a typical Saturday afternoon, with the usual bustle of people grabbing their essentials on their way home from work. That's when we saw him - a man, openly carrying a firearm, strolling into our store as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

At first, we were taken aback. Our staff exchanged nervous glances, unsure of how to react. But when the customer approached the counter, our worker, wisely, asked to see his firearm licence. That's when things took a turn. After running a quick background check, we discovered that the customer had a questionable history, and our staff, with a calm yet firm tone, asked him to leave the premises.

The incident left us shaken, sparking a debate about open carry laws and retail safety. As a community-focused business, we strive to provide a welcoming environment for our customers. However, this incident highlighted the complexities of balancing customer rights with the need to ensure a safe shopping experience. It's a delicate issue, and one that requires careful consideration. As we move forward, we're committed to finding ways to prioritize both our customers' rights and their safety, while also promoting a culture of responsible gun ownership.
