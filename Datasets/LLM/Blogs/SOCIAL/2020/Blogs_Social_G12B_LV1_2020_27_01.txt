>## The Weight of Tiny Dreams (and Big Bills)

Okay, so maybe buying a tiny home in the middle of nowhere at 21 wasn't the *most* financially responsible decision I've ever made. Looking back from late 2020, with the world still feeling a little shaky and my bank account even shakier, I'm realizing that. 

It seemed so idyllic, though! A little patch of land, a cozy space to call my own, escape the city…and a hefty truck payment to haul everything out there. Plus, the lot rent is a sneaky expense that adds up. My annual income is hovering around $25,000, and suddenly, every dollar feels precious. 

I'm constantly juggling. Budgeting has become my second language. Seriously, I’m tracking every avocado. It’s humbling, to say the least.  I’m even exploring refinancing my truck loan – anything to breathe a little easier. It’s a learning curve, a constant hustle, but I’m determined to make this dream work.  It's a reminder that even the most beautiful visions need a solid financial foundation. Anyone else navigating a similar adventure? Let me know – I could use the support!
