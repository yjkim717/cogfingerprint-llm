### The Sound of My Own Static

I remember the silence of 2020 as being the loudest thing I’d ever heard. It wasn't a peaceful quiet; it was a heavy, suffocating blanket. The world had pressed pause, but my mind was stuck on fast-forward, a frantic channel with nothing on. In that forced isolation, the only person left to talk to was myself, and frankly, we weren't on speaking terms.

My personal hell wasn't out there; it was in the four walls of my apartment and the echoing chambers of my own head. I’d stare at my reflection, and it felt like looking at a stranger. There’s a special kind of exhaustion that comes from just *being* when the background noise of life—the coffee runs, the office chatter, the crowded subway—vanishes. You’re left with the raw, unfiltered version of you, and for me, that version felt numb.

I started to understand self-harm not as a dramatic, singular act, but as a quiet erosion. It was the constant, low-grade criticism I’d replay in my mind. It was picking at the edges of old emotional scars until they felt fresh again, just to feel *something* other than this pervasive numbness. I thought about that line from the summary you read—the transparent soap, the inability to hide. That was it exactly. In isolation, every flaw, every fear, every past mistake felt visible, like a brand. There was no makeup, no busy schedule, no casual "I'm fine" to hide behind.

My mental health became a project I couldn't procrastinate on anymore. This confrontation was brutal. Some days, the only victory was getting out of bed. But in that stillness, a strange thing happened. The reflection started to change. I began to see the numbness not as a void, but as a protective layer that had outlived its purpose. The deep reflection, as painful as it was, became the first step toward scraping it away.

2020 forced me into a room with myself, and for a long time, I hated the company. But eventually, in the deafening quiet, I learned to stop fighting the person I found there and started, slowly, to listen. It was the beginning of turning down my own internal static.
