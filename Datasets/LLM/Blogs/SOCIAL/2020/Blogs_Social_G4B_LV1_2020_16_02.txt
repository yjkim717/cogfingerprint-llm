**The Weight of Unspoken Things**

It feels a little silly writing this now, looking back at 2020, but there’s a heaviness I can’t quite shake. The world was locked down, everyone glued to their screens, and I was battling a completely different kind of isolation. It centered around my family, specifically my grandfather. 

He was fading, and with each passing week, the silence between us grew thicker. It wasn’t a dramatic shouting match, not a screaming argument – just… quiet. A refusal to really *talk* about what was happening. My family seemed to be wrestling with their own grief, and honestly, I felt like I was being deliberately shut out. 

It was terrifying. The anxiety was a constant hum, layered with the sharp sting of feeling rejected. I knew, logically, that they were likely struggling, but that didn’t make the feeling of being adrift any easier.  I spent so much time just *feeling* it, trapped in a loop of worry and a desperate need for connection. 

Looking back, I realize that sometimes, the hardest battles aren’t fought with words, but with the spaces between them.  It’s a lesson I’m still trying to learn, even now.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps generate a post focusing on a specific aspect of the summary (e.g., the anxiety, the feeling of rejection)?
