### The Silence That Hurts the Most

It’s a strange kind of grief, the one that happens before someone is even gone.

My grandfather is dying. The doctors said it’s a matter of months, maybe weeks. In a year defined by global isolation, you’d think our family would be clinging to each other. Instead, I find myself on the outside, looking in through a pane of glass I can’t break.

The phone calls to my aunt go straight to voicemail. My texts to my cousin are met with one-word replies. The family group chat, once buzzing with memes and updates, has gone silent for me. At first, I thought it was the general chaos of 2020—everyone is stressed, right? But the pattern became a wall. I was being shut out.

And the worst part? The quiet voice in my head that whispers, *“What did you do wrong?”* This feeling of inadequacy is a heavy blanket, smothering the logic that says this is their issue, not mine. I’m grieving the man he was, while simultaneously grieving the family I thought we were. The communication breakdown feels like a second, more personal pandemic.

I’m learning that estrangement isn’t always a dramatic, door-slamming event. Sometimes, it’s a slow, quiet drift into emotional isolation, made infinitely more painful by a ticking clock. There are no answers in this silence, only the hollow ache of unfinished business and the desperate hope that, somehow, he knows I tried. I’m left to mourn not just a man, but all the words we’ll never get to say.
