>## Leveling Up Together: Finding Connection in a Digital Apocalypse

It's funny, isn't it? In 2020, when the world feels increasingly isolated, we often turn to digital worlds for connection. I saw a post on Reddit the other day from someone looking for a co-op zombie game to play with their 66-year-old friend, a long-time WoW player. It struck a chord. 

It reminded me of my own grandfather, finding joy in online games. It's not just about the gameplay; it's about shared experience, teamwork, and a little bit of escapism. Finding a way to bridge generations through gaming? Now *that's* something worth celebrating. Itâ€™s a reminder that social connection can bloom in unexpected places.
