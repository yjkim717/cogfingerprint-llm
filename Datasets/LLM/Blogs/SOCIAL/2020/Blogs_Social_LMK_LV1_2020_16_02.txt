**Feeling Lost in the Family Chat**

As I sat staring at my phone in 2020, scrolling through the family group chat, I couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. It had been weeks since I'd heard from my grandfather, and I was starting to feel like I was being shut out. We'd always been close, bonding over our shared love of old movies and Sunday roasts. But since his health had taken a turn for the worse, everything had changed.

I'd sent him messages, checking in and letting him know I was thinking of him, but he'd stopped responding. At first, I thought it was just because he was busy with doctor's appointments and family visits, but as the days turned into weeks, I started to feel a growing sense of isolation. It wasn't just that I wasn't getting a response from him - it was like I was being excluded from the rest of the family too.

As I watched my family members sharing updates and photos, I felt like an outsider looking in. It was like they were all connected, and I was on the outside, looking in. I knew they were all dealing with their own stress and worry about my grandfather's health, but it still hurt to feel so disconnected. I felt like I was losing my sense of belonging, and it was taking a toll on my mental health. I just wished they could understand how their silence was affecting me, and that sometimes, all I needed was to feel seen and heard.
