### The Scariest Week of 2020 (And It Wasn't the Virus)

Let’s be real, 2020 was a masterclass in anxiety. But the moment that truly hollowed me out had nothing to do with case counts or lockdowns—it was watching my new kitten, Milo, listless on the floor.

One day he was a whirlwind of paws and purrs; the next, he was vomiting and scarily lethargic. My heart dropped. A frantic Google spiral screamed "emergency care," but in that panicked haze of 2020, even a vet visit felt like a monumental, terrifying task.

So, I did what I could. I remembered reading about dehydration and tried offering him flavored water from a tuna can. I sat with him for hours, just watching, my phone buzzing with world news I completely ignored. His tiny world was my entire focus.

When he finally took a tentative lick, it felt like a victory greater than any sourdough loaf I’d baked that year. It was a stark reminder that sometimes, the most profound connections and fears happen not on a global scale, but right there on your own living room floor.
