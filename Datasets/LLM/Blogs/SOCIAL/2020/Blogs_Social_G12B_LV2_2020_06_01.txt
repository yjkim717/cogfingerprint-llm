Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable, and conversational tone, set in the context of 2020. I've aimed for around 123 words.  I've included a potential title suggestion at the top.

**Title: The Weight of Days (and a Whole Lot of Uncertainty)**

Remember 2020? I honestly still feel like I'm processing it. It wasn't just a year; it was… heavy. There were days, weeks even, where the simplest questions felt monumental. *What’s the point?* I’d find myself wondering, staring at the news, at my laptop, at… everything. 

It felt like the world was collectively holding its breath.  Suddenly, routines vanished, and with them, a strange sense of purpose seemed to evaporate too.  I know I wasn’t alone in feeling a little… lost. A little worthless, even. It’s okay to admit that, right? Hoping we can all look back and remember it wasn't a reflection of *us*, but a reflection of a truly bizarre time.
