## A Smile, a Little Confidence, and a Whole Lot of Worry

It's 2020, and life feels…complicated, doesn't it? Between everything else, we’re navigating the challenges of foster parenting. We welcomed a beautiful child into our home, and quickly realized they carried a quiet sadness, a hesitancy to smile broadly. It stemmed from their teeth – a need for orthodontic care that felt completely out of reach.

We’re not alone, of course. So many foster children lack consistent insurance, and specialized care like orthodontia often falls through the cracks. It’s heartbreaking to see a child’s self-esteem chipped away by something so fixable. I’m reaching out, really, to anyone in Southern Oregon who might know of pro bono orthodontic services. It's about more than just straight teeth; it’s about building confidence and helping this little one feel whole. Because every child deserves to smile without reservation.
