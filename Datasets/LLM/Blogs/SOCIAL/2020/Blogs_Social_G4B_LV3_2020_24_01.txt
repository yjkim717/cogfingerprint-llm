**The Frustration of a Shared Screen**

Remember 2020? Everything felt…fragile. We were all huddled together, virtually, trying to connect. I dove back into *Civilization VI* multiplayer, a supposed escape, but it quickly became frustrating. I kept experiencing these awful “desyncs”— moments where my game would stutter, and my opponents’ moves felt delayed, like we were on completely different timelines. 

It felt like a tiny, pixelated representation of the wider world – a disconnect mirroring the anxieties of the year.  I dug through forums, searching for a September update fix, desperate to just *sync up* and play together. It was a reminder that even in a digital world, shared experiences can be deeply unsettling.
