"After being involved in a car accident in early 2020, I received an insurance payout and started rethinking my daily commute. I'm considering ditching my car for an ebike, not just to reduce my carbon footprint but also to save on fuel and parking. I'm eyeing models in the $1-2k range. Has anyone else made the switch? What ebike models do you recommend for a daily commute?"
