"The Shocking Truth About Measuring AC Voltage"

As I was helping my fellow student with an electronics project in 2020, I realized how easy it is to get confused between RMS voltage and instantaneous voltage when measuring AC voltage. We were using both a multimeter and an oscilloscope, but getting different readings. At first, we thought one of the tools was faulty. But, as it turned out, the discrepancy was due to a fundamental misunderstanding of what each device measures. The multimeter was giving us the RMS voltage, a representation of the AC voltage's effective power, while the oscilloscope was showing the instantaneous voltage, the actual voltage at a given point in time. It was a "aha" moment when we grasped the difference. This experience taught me the importance of understanding the tools we use and not taking measurements at face value. It's a lesson that has stuck with me and one that I believe can benefit anyone working with electrical measurements.
