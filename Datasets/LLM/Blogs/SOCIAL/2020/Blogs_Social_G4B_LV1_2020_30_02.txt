**The Ghosts in the Grid: When Legends Became a Letdown**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? And I was trying to find some escape in World of Warships Legends. It seemed like a decent enough game – a bit tactical, a little stressful, and honestly, a nice distraction. But recently, I’ve been wrestling with something really frustrating, and it’s spilling over into my thinking about online gaming in general.

I had this one match last week, a complete disaster. My team just… didn’t play together. It felt like everyone was prioritizing their own score over actually, you know, *winning*.  And the toxicity! Seriously, the trash talk was brutal. I saw it all on Reddit afterward – screenshots and angry comments about the matchmaking. 

It’s not just one game, either. It’s a pattern. It reminds me of how isolating the year felt – everyone locked in their own little corners, sometimes just adding to the negativity.  I started wondering if online games, even with their potential for connection, were sometimes just amplifying the worst parts of human behavior. 

I'm trying to remember why I started playing in the first place – the challenge, the strategy.  Maybe I need to take a step back and remind myself that it's just a game, and not let a few toxic players ruin the experience.
