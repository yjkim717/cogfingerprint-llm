## Does My Voice Even Matter?

It's November 2020, election season is in full swing, and I'm feeling…a little deflated. Living outside of Chicago in central Illinois, you hear it a lot: "Chicago runs the state." And honestly, looking at the bigger picture, it’s hard to argue. It feels like all the political energy, all the attention, swirls around the city. 

I voted, of course. But a quiet doubt lingers. Does my vote – does *any* vote outside of Chicago – really carry the same weight? It’s a frustrating thought, especially when you're passionate about issues impacting rural communities like mine. Maybe it’s just cynicism creeping in, but it’s a feeling a lot of us out here share.
