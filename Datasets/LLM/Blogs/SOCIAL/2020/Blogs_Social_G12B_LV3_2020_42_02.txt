## The Weight of a Look, the Chill of a Feeling

2020. It’s a year etched in all of our memories, isn't it? A year of heightened anxieties, of distance, of… a lot of things feeling *different*. For me, it was also the year I started really noticing the subtle shifts in people’s behavior, the unspoken tensions that seemed to hum beneath the surface of everyday interactions. And honestly, it's something that's stuck with me.

I work in retail. It's a job that brings you face-to-face with a constant stream of humanity. Usually, it’s fine. A quick exchange, a polite smile, and on to the next customer. But recently, I had an experience that shook me up more than I care to admit.

A man came into the store, openly carrying a handgun. Now, open carry isn’t new, and I understand the arguments around it. But something about *this* felt… off. He had this intense, almost haunted look in his eyes. Later, I learned through whispers from coworkers that he’d had run-ins with the law previously, something involving… well, let’s just say substances aren’t involved. 

It wasn’t a threat, not explicitly. But the weight of that moment, the sudden chill that ran down my spine, the feeling of utter powerlessness – it’s something I haven’t been able to shake. It wasn’t just about the gun. It was about the underlying sense of unease, the feeling that things were fracturing, that the simple act of going to work could suddenly feel precarious.

It made me think about all the other anxieties we're carrying around these days, the unspoken fears that color every interaction. And it made me wonder, how do we navigate a world where feeling safe feels increasingly… complicated?
