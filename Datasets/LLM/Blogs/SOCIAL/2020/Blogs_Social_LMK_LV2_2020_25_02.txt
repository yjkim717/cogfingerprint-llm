As I sat gaming on my PC in 2020, I faced a frustrating issue - my CM Punk Caw texture mod wouldn't load in WWE DoR 2 on Dolphin Emulator. I joined online forums, seeking help from fellow gamers. We bonded over our shared struggles, exchanging tips and tricks. These online interactions reminded me that even in isolation, gaming can be a social activity, fostering connections and community.
