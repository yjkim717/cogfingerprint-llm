## Still Wishing for a Proper Family Fortune in The Sims 4

It's 2020, and I’m *still* playing The Sims 4. Don't get me wrong, it’s gorgeous, the Create-a-Sim is unmatched, and the packs are often delightful. But there’s this nagging thing that always pulls me back to Sims 2: inheritance.

Seriously, remember how satisfying it was to see your Sim child inherit their parents' house, complete with furniture and a little nest egg? It felt like a proper legacy! Now, in Sims 4, it’s just… gone. You build, you thrive, your Sims die, and poof! Everything vanishes (unless you manually transfer funds, which feels clunky and less organic).

I’ve sunk *so* many hours into building dream family estates, and it just stings that that generational wealth doesn’t really… persist. It makes me long for those simpler, but somehow more meaningful, days of playing Sims 2 and watching my families prosper across generations.  Anyone else feel this way?

I hope this fits the brief! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
