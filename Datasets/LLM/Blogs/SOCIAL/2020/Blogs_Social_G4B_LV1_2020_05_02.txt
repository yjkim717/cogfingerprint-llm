**Pixels and Ghosts: Remembering the Static**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot. Between the pandemic and everything else, I was craving a little escape. That’s when I stumbled across this *weird* memory – a game from 2000, completely lost to the internet ether. It was utterly bonkers. 

Imagine *Rocket League*, but with vehicles tethered to massive, crumbling platforms. And the player? They were called Wachowski. Seriously. It felt like a fever dream, a low-poly collision of arcade action and something…else. 

It made me think about how quickly we forget the digital detritus of our childhoods. Like a ghost in the machine, this game lingered, a reminder that even the strangest, most fleeting online experiences can stick with you.  Anyone else have a forgotten pixelated obsession they’re trying to piece together?
