### My Brain’s Expensive Glitch

So, 2020 happened. And in the middle of the global chaos, my brain decided to play its own weird little game. It all started during a brutal lockdown migraine. The only thing that sounded remotely bearable was a bean and cheese burrito from the place down the street.

I ate it. The headache, miraculously, began to recede.

I didn’t think much of it until the next migraine hit a week later. My mind didn’t just want a burrito; it *screamed* for one. I had accidentally created the world’s most specific Pavlovian response. Headache = Burrito. Relief = Burrito. It didn’t matter if the pain was a world-ending migraine or just a tension headache from too much Zoom—the craving was the same.

The consequences were… significant. My digestive system started a quiet protest, and my food delivery app became a financial black hole. I’ve spent 2020 trying to de-program myself, to teach my brain that an aspirin and a glass of water can also be effective. But it’s a stubborn student. It turns out that in a year where so much felt out of my control, the one reliable comfort I could engineer was wrapped in a tortilla. A costly, cheesy, and utterly bizarre comfort.
