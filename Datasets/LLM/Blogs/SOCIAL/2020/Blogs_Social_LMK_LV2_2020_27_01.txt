As I scrolled through my social media feed in 2020, I stumbled upon a 21-year-old's plea for advice on affording a small, isolated house on a variable income. It struck a chord. In an era of rising housing costs and financial uncertainty, the desire for simple living and financial freedom is relatable. The young adult's query sparked a reflection on our societal values - are we prioritizing experiences and freedom over material possessions? Can we rethink what 'affordability' means? As we navigate the complexities of personal finance, it's time to reassess what truly makes us happy and fulfilled.
