It’s November 2020, and today, Lee Taemin and I share a birthday. In a year that’s felt so heavy, watching him *move* with such passion is genuinely inspiring. His dedication reminds me that even when the world slows down, growth doesn’t have to. I’ve spent months indoors, but seeing his hardworking spirit pushes me to pursue my own goals, however small. It’s comforting to find connection like this—through a screen, through art. So here’s to Taemin, and to all of us finding little sparks of motivation in unexpected places. Happy birthday to us.
