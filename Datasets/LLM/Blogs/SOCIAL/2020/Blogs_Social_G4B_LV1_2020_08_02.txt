Okay, here’s a reflective blog post inspired by the cat owner’s experience and set in 2020, aiming for a conversational tone and around 158 words:

**Scrolling Through a Feeling of…Nothing?**

Okay, 2020. The year of Zoom calls and toilet paper shortages, but honestly, sometimes I felt like I was just endlessly scrolling through other people’s *perfect* lives on social media.  It was exhausting.  I’d see pictures of amazing vacations, flawless meals, and engagement announcements, and a weird little knot would tighten in my stomach. 

It felt like my own life was muted, a grey filter compared to everyone else’s vibrant feeds. Like watching a really compelling movie, but you’re stuck behind a screen.  I started taking breaks, deleting the apps for a few hours, just to… breathe. 

It reminded me of that frantic cat owner I read about – desperately trying to hydrate and soothe a sick pet. Sometimes, we need to focus on our own well-being, not compare ourselves to everyone else’s highlight reel.
