**The Time My World Felt Like It Was Glitching**

Okay, so 2020 was… a lot, right? But amidst all the pandemic anxiety, I had this really weird, unsettling experience. For about six years, I’d been battling this constant dizziness, blurry vision, and a weird, creeping weakness.  I kept getting diagnosed with seizures – a neurologist was pretty sure of it. 

Honestly, it was terrifying.  I felt like my body was malfunctioning, and no one could quite figure out *why*.  It wasn’t until I started digging deeper, talking to other people online, that I realized maybe it wasn’t seizures at all. It felt isolating, like no one truly understood what I was going through.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, you have to trust your own instincts and keep searching for answers, even when it feels impossible.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
