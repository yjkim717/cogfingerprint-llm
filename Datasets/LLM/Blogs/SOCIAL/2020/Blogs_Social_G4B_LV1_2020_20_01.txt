**Lost in Translation (and Loving It)**

It’s 2020, and honestly, my Chinese feels…distant. I’m wrestling with this familiar feeling – wanting fluency in my heritage language, but not sure where to start. My parents still have these amazing, rapid-fire conversations, and I feel like I’m missing out. 

I’ve been trying to nudge it back into focus, experimenting with online classes and attempting more family chats. It's not about perfection, but about reconnecting with a part of myself.  Maybe a little immersion, a little practice – just keeping the lines of communication open feels like a victory.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or changing the tone slightly?
