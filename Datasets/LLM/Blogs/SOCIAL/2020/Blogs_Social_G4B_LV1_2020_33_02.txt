**The Drive-Thru Blues of 2020**

Okay, real talk – 2020 was… a lot. And honestly, my McDonald’s routine became a surprisingly fraught part of it. Remember those endless drive-thrus? We were all trying to grab a quick bite while navigating a pandemic, and my local McDonald’s seemed determined to make it a challenge. 

I swear, I started receiving completely wrong orders – a McFlurry instead of a burger, a salad with no dressing. It wasn’t just a one-off, either. It felt like a constant stream of errors, and the delays, already stretched out by COVID protocols, just piled on the frustration. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? We were craving a little normalcy, a little fast food comfort, but it felt like even that was messed up. It made me think about how stressed everyone was, just trying to get through the day, and how easily a simple order could become a mini-crisis.  Anyone else experience this bizarre drive-thru struggle?
