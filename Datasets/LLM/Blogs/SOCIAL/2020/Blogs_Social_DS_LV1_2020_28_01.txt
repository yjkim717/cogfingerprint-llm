### The Day the Ceiling Tiles Saved Me

It was March 2020. The world was locked down, and our house had become a pressure cooker. The four of us—me, my parents, and my sister—were on top of each other 24/7. I’m autistic, and the constant, unpredictable noise and movement were slowly fraying my nerves.

The explosion happened over something stupid. I was zoning out, my brain overloaded, and my gaze had landed on the intricate pattern of the ceiling tiles. My sister, already on edge, snapped, “Why are you staring at me? Stop it!”

Before I could even process the accusation, my dad was yelling at me to “be respectful.” My mom was trying to play peacemaker, but her voice just added to the chaotic noise. They all saw a defiant teenager. What they didn’t see was the internal avalanche their misunderstanding triggered.

The anger that boiled up in me wasn’t just about the false accusation. It was the culmination of weeks of being misunderstood, of my quiet moments being labeled as intentional slights. I didn’t have the words in the moment to explain that I was counting ceiling tiles to prevent a panic attack, not trying to intimidate my sister.

That fight was a brutal lesson. It forced me to realize I needed better coping skills for when the world—or my own family—gets it wrong. Now, I try to name the feeling before it boils over. “I’m overwhelmed,” or “I need a minute.” It doesn’t always work, but it’s a start. Sometimes, the biggest conflicts come from the smallest misunderstandings, especially when your brain just works differently.
