**The Weight of “Helpful”**

Remember 2020? It felt like everyone was dispensing advice – therapists, influencers, even well-meaning friends – like it was going out of style. I found myself in a tricky situation with a friend, Sarah, who, bless her heart, just couldn’t let go of offering her perspective on my relationship. 

It wasn’t malicious, not really. But her constant stream of “you should…” and “have you considered…” was building this immense pressure. Suddenly, a simple disagreement flared into a full-blown, frustrated argument.  I realized I was feeling incredibly angry, not just about the advice itself, but about the lack of respect for my choices. 

That conversation with Sarah was tough, but vital. We talked about boundaries – what felt comfortable for me, what didn’t. It highlighted a really important truth: genuine friendship isn’t about offering solutions, it’s about being a safe space to simply *be*.  Sometimes, the most supportive thing you can do is just listen, and let someone navigate their own messy, beautiful relationship journey.
