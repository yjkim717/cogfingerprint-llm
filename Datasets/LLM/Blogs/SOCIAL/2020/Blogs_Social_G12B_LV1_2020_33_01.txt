## The Ghosts in the Trophy Room

Remember back in 2020, when everything felt…precarious? It wasn't just the pandemic; it was this creeping feeling that even our digital escapes weren’t entirely stable. I’d gotten really into trophy hunting on the PlayStation, chasing those elusive platinum awards. But I started noticing something unsettling. Games I loved, games with vibrant online communities just a year prior, were suddenly…empty. Servers shutting down, leaving online trophies forever out of reach.

It felt strange, like chasing ghosts. You could see the achievement, the reward, but the path to get there was disappearing. It made me wonder if online trophies should be a separate category entirely – a reminder of the fleeting nature of digital connection, and the communities we build (and sometimes lose) online. It’s a weird thought, but it stuck with me.
