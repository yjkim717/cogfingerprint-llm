The cursor blinks, a tiny, mocking heartbeat in the dim light of my laptop. It’s 2020, and my living room has become a trench in a war I never enlisted in. Outside, a pandemic rages; inside, a different kind of virus spreads through my social media feed. It’s orchestrated, relentless. The IT Cell.

I used to engage. I’d fact-check, share articles, and try to build a logical argument against the tidal wave of disinformation. It was like trying to hold back the ocean with a teacup. The trolls, many of them likely paid to sow discord, aren’t interested in discourse. Their goal is to dismantle, to polarize, to chip away at the secular foundations I thought were bedrock.

Then, one evening, I snapped. A particularly vile account, spewing hatred under the guise of patriotism, targeted a friend. In a moment of sheer frustration, I didn’t go for the argument. I went for the jugular. I scrolled through his profile, found a grainy photo suggesting his family’s humble economic background, and crafted my reply—a sharp, personal jab about poverty.

I hit ‘post.’ The immediate reaction was a twisted sense of victory. The troll went silent. But my own triumph curdled in my stomach almost instantly.

I had become the very thing I was fighting against.

I used someone’s potential economic hardship as a weapon. I had looked at what might be a real person trapped in a system that pays them to hate, and I attacked their circumstance instead of their ideology. In trying to defend secularism, I’d compromised my own ethics. I’d reduced a complex human being—one who might be acting out of financial desperation as much as any conviction—to a stereotype. I was no longer challenging a troll; I was bullying a person.

That moment was a cold splash of reality. This digital war is a grimy, soul-eroding business. The real poverty isn't just economic; it's a poverty of empathy, a deficit of basic human decency that both sides risk falling into. The trolls monetize division, and in my anger, I was adding to the transaction.

Now, I close the laptop a little more often. I disengage. It feels like a surrender sometimes, but I’ve realized that my integrity is a patch of ground I cannot afford to cede. The fight for a sane, secular India is crucial, but it cannot be won by mirroring the ugliness of its detractors. Some battles are lost the moment you choose to fight them on your enemy's terms.
