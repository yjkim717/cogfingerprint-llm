**The Unexpected Weight of a Secret**

It’s strange, isn’t it? How a simple conversation can shift everything. This year, 2020, felt like a constant negotiation with uncertainty, and then my grandfather shared a plan – a quiet, heartbreaking plan to end his life. Suddenly, grief wasn’t the only emotion swirling. Resentment, a sharp, unwelcome guest, arrived too. 

How do you process a loss when you’re also grappling with anger?  It’s about acknowledging the tangled mess of feelings, letting yourself feel the sadness *and* the confusion, and finding a way toward acceptance, even if it’s just a tiny step forward.  It’s a messy, solitary journey, and one I’m navigating with a deep, aching heart.
