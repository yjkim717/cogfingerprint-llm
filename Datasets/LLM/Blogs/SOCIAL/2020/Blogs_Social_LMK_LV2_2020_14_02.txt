The Unlikely Link Between Migraines and Burrito Cravings

As I sat on my couch in the midst of a debilitating migraine in 2020, I reached for the one thing that I thought would bring me comfort - a burrito. It wasn't the first time I'd done this, and at the time, I didn't think much of it. But looking back, I realize that I'd inadvertently conditioned myself to crave burritos during my migraines.

Classical conditioning, a concept I learned about in psychology class, is a powerful force. In my case, it meant that every time I got a migraine, my brain associated the pain with the relief I felt after eating a burrito. The problem was, this "relief" came at a cost. My stomach would pay the price for the greasy, heavy food, and my wallet wasn't too happy about the frequent takeout orders either.

It's funny how our brains can create these associations without us even realizing it. Now, I'm working on breaking the cycle and finding healthier ways to cope with my migraines. It's not easy, but I'm determined to outsmart my brain and develop new, more positive habits.
