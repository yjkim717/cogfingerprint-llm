The Frustrating Tip-of-Tongue Feeling: A 2020 Reflection

Have you ever had one of those moments where a song is stuck on the tip of your tongue, but you just can't quite place it? I certainly have. In 2020, I found myself scrolling through social media, when a memory hit me - a techno track that sampled a documentary's background score. I was determined to identify it, but the more I searched, the more elusive it became. As I connected with others online who shared similar experiences, I realized the universal frustration of a forgotten tune. Sometimes, it's the collective effort that helps us uncover the music hiding in our memories.
