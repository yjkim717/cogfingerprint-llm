>## When Your Players Rewrite the Lore (and You're Totally Okay With It)

Okay, so I’m wrestling with something in my current D&D campaign, and I figured I'd share – maybe someone else has been here too! We’re running *Temple of the Mad Dragon*, and one of my players has built a Dragonborn Cleric with a *very* interesting backstory. Let's just say a significant head trauma incident has led him to believe a baby black dragon is a divine avatar. 

Initially, I was panicking. My carefully constructed narrative, built around Io, the dragon goddess? Completely derailed! But then I realized... why fight it? This player’s investment is *massive*. 

It’s 2020, and we're all learning to adapt, right?  I've been thinking a lot about how much more engaging it is when players genuinely own their characters and shape the story. So, I’m pivoting.  I'm brainstorming alternative deities, something that might *explain* his skewed perception, and leaning into the weirdness. It’s a chance to build something truly unique. Sometimes, the most memorable moments in D&D aren't the ones you planned, but the ones born from player creativity. Anyone else ever had a player completely flip the script?
