**The Weight of Unspoken Words**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a language can feel like a piece of you, yet become so…distant. I started seriously thinking about my Chinese heritage language in 2020, after years of just hearing it at family dinners. It felt like trying to grasp smoke – a beautiful, familiar scent, but ultimately elusive. 

I’d pick up a textbook, determined, only to be hit with the reality of how little time I actually had. Between the pandemic and everything else, it felt impossible to really *learn*. It’s a frustrating feeling, this awareness of a part of yourself you’re letting fade.  Anyone else feel that tug, that quiet ache for a language and culture they’re trying to reconnect with?

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
