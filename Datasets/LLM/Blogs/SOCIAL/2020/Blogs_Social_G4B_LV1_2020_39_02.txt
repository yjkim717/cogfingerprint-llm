**The Silence That Hurt the Most**

Okay, 2020 – a year for a lot of weirdness, right? But I want to talk about something that felt *really* unsettling, even amidst the pandemic chaos: ghosting. I witnessed it firsthand with a friend, and it honestly left me reeling. 

A couple I know went from a pretty solid relationship to… nothing. Just silence. A month of complete radio silence. It sparked this huge debate about what happened – was it a fight? A misunderstanding? Or something deeper? 

It’s terrifying how easily connection can just evaporate, especially when you’re craving it. It made me think about the importance of *communication*, even when it’s hard. And honestly, the lingering worry about whether they could ever rebuild that trust after such a sudden breakdown was heartbreaking.  It reminded me that healthy relationships need constant tending, not just occasional check-ins.
