**Scrolling Less, Feeling More**

Honestly, 2020 felt…heavy. The world was paused, and while there were silver linings, a lot of it was spent staring at a screen. I was scrolling, comparing, feeling this low-level anxiety about *everything*. It was exhausting. 

Then, I started experimenting with a tiny shift – a simple at-home workout routine (thanks, YouTube!), and consciously trying to build in healthier meals. It wasn’t about dramatic weight loss, it was about feeling *better*. 

I realized how much mental well-being tied into it. Moving my body, even for 20 minutes, cleared my head. And choosing a nourishing meal instead of grabbing something quick felt…good. 

It made me think about the constant pressure of social media. Maybe the real self-improvement isn’t about projecting a perfect image online, but about finding little moments of peace and prioritizing our own needs – offline.  What small shifts have you made lately?
