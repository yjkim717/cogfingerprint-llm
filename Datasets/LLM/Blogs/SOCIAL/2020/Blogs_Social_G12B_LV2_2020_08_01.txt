## The Weight of Saying Goodbye (and Maybe a Little Bit More)

It's a strange time to be navigating grief, isn’t it? 2020 has thrown so much at us, and now, my family is facing something incredibly difficult: my grandfather’s decision to pursue assisted death. It’s a choice I respect, truly, but it’s also stirred up a tangled knot of emotions I wasn’t expecting. 

There's the raw, aching grief, of course. But alongside that, a quiet, unsettling hum of… something else. Resentment? Maybe. It feels unfair, this finality.  I'm trying to just *feel* it all, to let the waves wash over me without judgment.  It’s a messy process, and I suspect it will be for a while.  Anyone else wrestling with complicated feelings around loss lately?
