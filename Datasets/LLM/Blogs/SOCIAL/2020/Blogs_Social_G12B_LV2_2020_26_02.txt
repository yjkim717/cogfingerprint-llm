## The Digital Nod & The Missing Assignment

Anyone else feeling utterly drained by the nuances of online teaching? I had a moment this week that just…stuck with me. A student insisted they'd submitted an assignment in Google Classroom, but it wasn't there. Not in the regular submission folder, not in their drafts. Just…gone. 

It’s 2020, and we’re all juggling so much. I genuinely *want* to believe students, but this felt…off. It sparked a bigger thought: are we, as educators, inadvertently rewarding a certain kind of digital performance – the quick "yes, done!" – over actual engagement? It's a question I'm still wrestling with. What are your experiences navigating these tricky digital interactions?




Hope this hits the right tone! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
