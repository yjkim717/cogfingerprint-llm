Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary and brief, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 347 words, set in 2020:

**The Weight of "Just One Thing"**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily a friendship can shift from feeling like a lifeline to feeling… suffocating. I’m not talking about a simple disagreement, or a phase. I’m talking about a slow, insidious erosion of your own sense of self. 

I went through something pretty intense last year – 2020, remember? The year everything felt permanently off-kilter – and it involved a friendship that ended up feeling like a carefully constructed trap.  It started with genuine care, a shared love of obscure indie films and late-night chats about feeling lost. But it quickly morphed into something… else. 

She was *good* at it, this friend. At twisting your words, at subtly diminishing your accomplishments, at making you feel like you were the problem whenever something went wrong. It wasn’t shouting or blatant arguments; it was a constant drip, drip, drip of “gaslighting” – denying things she’d said, rewriting memories, making me question my own sanity. 

I found myself desperately wanting to be the supportive friend, the one who could fix her problems, who could offer a listening ear. I’d spend hours offering advice, only to have it met with defensiveness or, worse, a pointed remark about how *I* wasn’t understanding *her*. 

Honestly, a part of me was terrified of letting go. It felt like abandoning her, like I was failing her. But the more I tried to help, the more depleted I felt. It was like I was constantly draining my own energy, and she was just… taking. 

Looking back, I realize I was trapped in a cycle of "just one thing" – one more conversation, one more attempt to help, one more sacrifice of my own well-being. It was a heartbreaking lesson in recognizing when a friendship is actively harming you, and having the strength to prioritize your own emotional safety, even when it feels incredibly difficult. 

It’s a feeling I still wrestle with, to be honest. But I’m learning that sometimes, the kindest thing you can do for someone – and for yourself – is to step away.
