Of all the sounds that should signal safety, the squeal of my children’s laughter in our own backyard is at the top of the list. But in the summer of 2020, that sound became a trigger for my own heart to clench. It was the year our neighborhood, like so many others, became our entire world. And it was the year I learned that the social contract we all assume exists can be terrifyingly fragile.

It started with a low growl from behind the neighbor’s fence. Then came the first incident—a blur of fur and teeth that sent our elderly cat scrambling up a tree, unharmed but forever shaken. We called animal control. They were polite, over the phone. They said they’d talk to the owners. We felt heard.

The second attack was different. My son was kicking a soccer ball. The dog, a hulking creature I’d only ever seen straining at its chain, found a gap in the wooden fence. It wasn’t a warning this time; it was a full-on charge. I’ve never moved faster in my life, scooping my terrified boy into my arms as the dog snapped at the air where he’d been standing. The primal fear in that moment is a stain on my memory.

We called again. The report was filed. The owners were given another warning. The social media post I made, pleading for responsibility, was met with a mix of support and accusations of being a “bad neighbor.” The system, it seemed, was designed to manage paperwork, not prevent tragedy. It protected the rights of the negligent owners more than the safety of my child playing on his own grass.

In a year defined by a global pandemic, we were all hyper-aware of invisible threats. But this danger was visible. It was tangible. It barked and lunged daily, a constant reminder of a different kind of breakdown. We were all isolated, looking out for each other, yet I felt utterly alone in this fight. The trust I had in the simple mechanics of community—that people would be responsible, that authorities would act—was eroding.

I started looking at every walk, every trip to the mailbox, as a calculated risk. The freedom of our little world shrank to the dimensions of our four walls. The final straw wasn’t another attack on us, but the sight of that same dog chasing a young girl on a bicycle down the street while the owners watched from their porch, unmoved.

That’s the real damage, I’ve come to realize. It’s not just the fear of teeth and claws. It’s the slow, corrosive realization that your sense of security is conditional, dependent on the decency of strangers and a system that often seems too bogged down to protect it. In 2020, we learned to guard against a virus with masks and distance. But how do you guard your family against apathy?
