The screen glowed in my dimly-lit apartment, the familiar hum of my laptop the only sound in a world that had gone unexpectedly quiet. It was spring 2020, and our D&D campaign had just migrated online—a digital life raft for five friends scattered across the city during lockdown. I’d spent weeks crafting what I thought was a perfect narrative arc: the noble council was about to be betrayed, and the players would uncover the conspiracy just in time to become heroes.

Then Liam’s rogue decided to pickpocket the king’s advisor instead of following my carefully laid clues.

My DM heart sank. All my planning—poof. Gone in one chaotic dice roll. I faced the classic GMing dilemma: do I let the logical consequences unfold (jail time, hostile NPCs, a derailed storyline) or fudge things to keep the game moving smoothly? In that moment, frozen with indecision, I realized something profound about player choices. They aren’t obstacles to our stories; they are the story.

I took a breath—both in-game and in life—and let the chips fall. The rogue got caught, yes. But what followed was an impromptu trial scene that had everyone leaning into their roles, creating moments of unexpected humor and tension. We discovered that our best memories weren’t from following my script, but from navigating the beautiful, messy consequences together.

In a year when so much felt beyond our control, that virtual table became our sanctuary. It taught me that the magic of connection isn’t in perfect management, but in how we adapt, listen, and build something collectively—even when it’s not what we first envisioned. Sometimes the most meaningful adventures begin exactly where our plans fall apart.
