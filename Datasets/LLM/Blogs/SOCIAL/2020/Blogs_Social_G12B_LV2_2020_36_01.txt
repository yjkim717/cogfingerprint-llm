## The Unexpected Magic of Finding Your Crew: Reflections on Wizards Unite in 2020

Remember that feeling in early 2020? The world felt… uncertain. We were all navigating a new kind of quiet, a strange, unsettling stillness. For me, and I suspect for many others, *Wizards Unite* arrived at a particularly opportune moment. It was a bright, shimmering distraction, a chance to step away from the headlines and into a world of magical artifacts and shadowy creatures.

But it wasn’t just the gameplay that kept me hooked. It was the *people*.

I’d dipped my toes into augmented reality games before, but nothing quite like this. Suddenly, my neighborhood walks weren't just about getting exercise; they were about keeping an eye out for traces of magic. And even more unexpectedly, they were about connecting with others. 

Initially, I was a lone wolf Auror. I'd diligently tap on traces, battle beasts solo, and generally try to level up my skills in relative solitude. But fortresses…fortresses were a different story. Those things were *tough*. You needed a team.

That's when I stumbled into a local Wizards Unite group on Facebook. Hesitantly, I joined. I expected a forum full of hardcore strategists, people who knew all the optimal spell combinations and could recite the entire Beastiary by heart. And there were definitely a few of those! But what surprised me most was the camaraderie.

We started coordinating. Someone would post, "Fortress at [Local Park]! Need 4 Aurors, level 15+." And within minutes, a small crew would assemble. We'd race to the location, sharing tips on which spells to use – a frantic discussion about the merits of the Focus Charm versus a well-placed Bat Bogey Hex became a recurring theme.  (Seriously, mastering the Bat Bogey Hex felt like a genuine achievement!)

It wasn't just about winning, although that felt pretty amazing when we finally brought down a particularly stubborn guardian. It was about the shared experience. Chatting about our days while battling a Grindylow, laughing when someone’s phone glitched out at a crucial moment, celebrating a successful vanquish – these little moments built a sense of community I desperately needed.

2020 was isolating, let’s be honest. We were physically distanced, but *Wizards Unite* offered a way to feel connected. It was a reminder that even in a world that felt increasingly fragmented, there were still opportunities to find your tribe, to collaborate, and to share a little bit of magic.

The game might have faded for some, but for me, those memories of coordinating with my fellow Aurors, strategizing over fortresses, and simply sharing a laugh while hunting for traces are a reminder of a time when a little bit of augmented reality brought a surprising amount of real-world connection. It proves that sometimes, the most magical things aren't the spells you learn, but the people you find
