### The Silence That Echoes

So, he’s back.

After a month of radio silence—a ghosting so complete I checked the obituaries—my boyfriend is sitting across from me, explaining how being bullied at work sent him into a spiral. In 2020, a year already overflowing with anxiety, his disappearance felt like the universe’s cruel punchline.

A part of me aches for the pain he must have felt. The other part, the part that spent thirty days staring at a silent phone, is screaming, *“And what about my pain?”*

That’s the real gut-punch of ghosting, isn’t it? It’s not just the absence; it’s the emotional whiplash. You’re left stranded in a confusing limbo, your trust shattered while your heart desperately tries to rationalize the silence.

Now he’s asking for another chance, and I’m caught between compassion and self-preservation. Can you rebuild trust on a foundation of such profound disregard? I want to believe people can change, that stress makes us do irrational things. But my heart has built a new wall, and I’m not sure I have the strength—or the will—to tear it down.
