Reconnecting with my heritage language, Mandarin, has been a journey of self-discovery. As I navigate the complexities of language learning, I'm reminded that fluency is not just about grammar and vocabulary, but also about embracing my cultural identity. In 2020, surrounded by the world's chaos, I've found solace in immersing myself in Chinese media and conversing with loved ones. By doing so, I'm not only improving my language skills but also strengthening my connection to my roots. It's a journey that has taught me the value of heritage and the beauty of cultural expression.
