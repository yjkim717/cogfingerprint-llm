**The Quiet Comfort of a Hand on My Shoulder**

It’s weird, isn’t it? In 2020, with everyone talking about sex and connection, I found myself feeling… overlooked. Like a simple cuddle, a hand on my shoulder during a Zoom call, was somehow failing to meet some unspoken expectation. I started wondering if I was “missing” something, if I wasn't *enough*. 

But then I realized, sometimes the deepest connection isn’t about fireworks. It’s about acknowledging someone’s quiet emotional needs, offering a moment of warmth and simply *being* there. It’s a subtle language of comfort, and honestly, it felt pretty good.
