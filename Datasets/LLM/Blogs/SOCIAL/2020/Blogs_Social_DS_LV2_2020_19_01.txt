### The Person Behind the Troll: A Lesson from the Digital Trenches

It was the summer of 2020, and my timeline was a warzone. Locked down and plugged in, I found myself constantly dragged into arguments about secularism, fake news, and everything in between. The trolls were relentless—a swarm of IT cell members, all repeating the same talking points, all trying to shout louder than reason.

I used to fight fire with fire. I’d counter their propaganda with facts, their venom with logic. And I’d always lose. Not because my facts were wrong, but because I was playing a game they had already won. I was talking to a brick wall of pre-written scripts.

One evening, after a particularly exhausting thread, I decided to try something different. A troll had posted a slick, emotionally charged graphic. Instead of debunking the claim, I just asked a simple question in the replies: “Bro, how much are they paying you for this shift? Must be exhausting to keep this up all day.”

The reaction was not what I expected. The usual vitriol didn’t come. After a pause, a reply popped up: “500 rupees. And yes, it is.”

My cursor blinked. 500 rupees. About seven dollars. That was the price tag on this digital discord. I felt my anger fizzle out, replaced by a strange, heavy pity. We got talking. He was a college grad from a small town, a role that had vanished in the pandemic. This was just a job—a way to pay the bills. He didn’t necessarily believe everything he posted; he was just following a playlist.

That conversation changed everything for me. I stopped seeing a monster behind every troll and started seeing a person, often one trapped in a precarious economic reality. The real battle wasn’t against the individual, but against the system that commodified their desperation.

Now, I don’t engage with the argument. I engage with the context. I ask about their day, their job, their life. Sometimes, the account goes silent. But sometimes, you get a glimpse of the complex human behind the propaganda avatar. It’s a quieter, more patient form of resistance, but it’s the only one that has ever made me feel like I’m actually connecting, instead of just shouting into the void.
