Okay, here's a blog post draft based on that summary and aiming for a reflective, conversational tone, suitable for 2020:

**The Echo Chamber of "You Should…"**

Okay, let’s be real. 2020 was… a lot. We were all navigating a world of masks, Zoom calls, and a weirdly heightened sense of everyone’s opinions. And honestly, a big part of that feeling of unease came from the constant, low-level hum of unsolicited advice. 

I started noticing it a lot – little comments about my hair, my outfits (still rocking sweatpants, by the way), even just casual judgments about what I was “doing” during lockdown. It wasn't always mean, but it was *always* there. “You should be exercising more!” “Have you tried this new recipe?” “Why aren’t you [insert activity]?” 

It started to feel exhausting. Like I was trapped in an echo chamber of “you should…” and it was slowly chipping away at my self-esteem. I realized I was spending so much energy defending my choices, explaining my feelings, and just generally trying to justify my existence. 

It made me think about identity – who I am versus who I think I *should* be.  It’s easy to get lost in the noise, to let other people’s expectations define you.  I’m still working on it, but learning to politely (or sometimes not so politely!) push back on those unwanted opinions has been a surprisingly powerful act of self-care.

Would you like me to:

*   Adjust the tone or length?
*   Focus on a specific aspect of the summary?
