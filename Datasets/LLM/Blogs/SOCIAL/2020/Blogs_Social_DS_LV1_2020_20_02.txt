**My Quest for the "All-in-One" Korean Textbook**

It was the summer of 2020, and my tiny apartment had become my entire world. Stuck inside, I decided to finally learn Korean. My desk, however, looked like a stationery store explosion. I had a textbook for grammar, a separate workbook, and my phone was clogged with different apps for audio. It was overwhelming.

I just wanted one single, affordable resource—a trusty companion that had it all: clear explanations, exercises to cement the lessons, and audio so I could finally nail the pronunciation of “밥”. I spent days searching for that mythical "all-in-one" book, dreaming of a streamlined study session. In a year that felt so fragmented, the simple desire for one integrated guide felt like a small, personal rebellion against the chaos.
