It’s 2020, and my Google Classroom notifications are buzzing nonstop. I noticed a student kept marking assignments as “done”—but no files attached. At first, I was frustrated. Then I remembered: we’re all just trying to keep up in this chaotic remote-learning world. A gentle email later, they apologized and submitted the work. It reminded me that behind every digital slip-up is a person, doing their best in a tough year. Connection matters, even online.
