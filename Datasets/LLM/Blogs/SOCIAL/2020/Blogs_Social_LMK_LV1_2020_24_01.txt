"After the September update, my Civ game nights with friends turned into frustration. Multiplayer desyncs became the norm, pausing the game randomly. We tried the usual fixes and even disabled mods, but nothing worked. It was like our carefully planned conquests were being derailed by a ghost in the machine. Has anyone else experienced this desync issue? I'm still searching for a solution to get our gaming sessions back on track."
