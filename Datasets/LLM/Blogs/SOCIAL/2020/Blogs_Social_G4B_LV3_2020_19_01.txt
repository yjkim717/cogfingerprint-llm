**The Echo Chamber and the Worry**

It feels a little surreal to even write this, looking back to 2020. The internet was already a wild place, but something felt particularly…charged. I found myself spending a surprising amount of time locked in online debates, specifically with people connected to what we often called the “IT cell.” 

Honestly, it was frustrating. A lot of it centered on Twitter, and the strategy seemed to be consistently pointing out perceived financial difficulties. And you know what? It *worked*. It would immediately derail the conversation, pushing people back into defensive postures. 

But it also left me with a really nagging feeling. Was this really a productive way to engage? Was reducing someone’s economic anxieties the best way to find common ground? It felt…manipulative. 

I grappled with the ethics of it all. Was I contributing to a further polarization of Indian society? Was I, in a way, becoming a kind of digital ‘troll’ myself, even when I didn't intend to be? 

The whole experience highlighted a deeper worry – that our online spaces, meant to connect us, could so easily become echo chambers, reinforcing existing divisions and fueling unproductive arguments. It was a difficult lesson learned in a very difficult year.
