## The Weight of What We Fear: A Strange Therapy & Our Online Echo Chambers

2020. The year anxiety became a shared global experience. We were all navigating uncertainty, glued to screens, and increasingly, confronting our own internal landscapes. It got me thinking a lot about fear – where it comes from, how it manifests, and how easily it can be amplified.

Recently, I stumbled across this fascinating concept (totally fictional, mind you!) about a Stand – a kind of psychic power – called "Nirvana." Apparently, it works by releasing a gas that forces people to experience their deepest fears as incredibly real hallucinations. A psychotherapist, immune to the effect, uses it to confront patients directly, forcing them to grapple with their anxieties. Wild, right?

It struck a chord. Because isn’t that, in a way, what social media does sometimes? We curate feeds, we consume endless streams of information (and misinformation), and we’re constantly exposed to potential threats – real or perceived. We build echo chambers of fear, reinforcing anxieties and amplifying negativity.

Think about it: the constant barrage of bad news, the curated perfection of others’ lives, the online arguments… it can all feel overwhelming, like a psychic gas slowly chipping away at our mental well-being. 

Maybe Nirvana's bizarre therapy offers a distorted mirror to our current reality. Perhaps we need to be more conscious of the "psychogenic gas" we’re inhaling online, and actively cultivate spaces that foster courage and resilience instead of feeding our fears. Food for thought, wouldn’t you say?
