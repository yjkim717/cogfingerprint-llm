As I played Sims 4 in 2020, I couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment when my Sims' estates were settled. The game's legacy play mode had me invested in building a virtual family's history, but the inheritance system fell flat. When a Sim passed away, their wealth and possessions were simply divided among their heirs without any realistic drama or tax implications. It was a missed opportunity to add depth to the game mechanics, leaving me to wonder: what's the point of building a legacy if it's not tested by the complexities of real-life inheritance?
