>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided summary and instructions. I've aimed for a conversational, reflective tone with a relatable angle, fitting a 2020 context.  I’ve included a title suggestion too.

**Title: Could the Internet *Really* Predict the Future?**

Remember that feeling in early 2020? Like everything was shifting, uncertain? We were all collectively holding our breath, trying to make sense of it all. It got me thinking – are we, as a global community, smarter than we think?

I stumbled across an interesting idea recently: leveraging the “wisdom of the crowd,” but with a modern twist. Imagine a subreddit, a corner of Reddit, where people pool their predictions on everything from election outcomes to, yes, even stock market fluctuations. But instead of just averaging guesses, they're using machine learning to analyze the data. 

It’s a wild thought, right? Harnessing the collective intelligence of the internet, refining it with algorithms… Could we actually get closer to understanding what's coming? It feels a little sci-fi, but in a world that threw us curveballs left and right this year, maybe there's something to it. Maybe the answer isn’t found in a single expert, but in the combined insights of *all* of us.
