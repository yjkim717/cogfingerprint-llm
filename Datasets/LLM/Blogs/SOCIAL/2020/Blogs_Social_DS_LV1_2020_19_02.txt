### The Noise We Choose to Hear

I remember scrolling through my phone in the spring of 2020, the world already feeling heavy and strange. Then, the news broke about a beloved celebrity’s death by suicide. A genuine, collective sadness washed over me. It was a quiet, personal moment of grief for a life cut short.

But that quiet didn’t last.

Within hours, my feed was no longer a place for mourning. It had become a digital battlefield. Wild conspiracy theories sprouted like weeds, each one more convoluted and cruel than the last. The tragedy was no longer a tragedy; it was a political pawn, a piece of "evidence" in a dozen different, unhinged narratives. The person at the center of it all was being erased, replaced by a caricature designed to fit a storyline.

I found myself just staring at the screen, horrified. What are we doing? When did we lose our capacity for simple, human empathy? It felt like a fundamental part of our societal wiring had short-circuited. We were so desperate for answers that fit our worldview that we were willing to strip a human being of their dignity, even in death.

That moment was a stark wake-up call for me. It wasn't just about one celebrity; it was a symptom of a much larger sickness. We’ve become so addicted to the drama, to the us-versus-them of it all, that we’ve forgotten how to think critically. We don't pause to ask, "Does this make sense?" or, more importantly, "Is this kind?" We just hit share, adding to the noise.

The real conspiracy, I started to believe, isn’t in some shadowy plot. It’s in our collective abandonment of compassion and reason. In 2020, a year that asked so much of our humanity, that lesson felt more urgent than ever. We have to choose to be better listeners, more critical thinkers, and more compassionate neighbors. The noise will always be there, but we get to decide whether we amplify it or turn it down.
