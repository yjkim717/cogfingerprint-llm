Of all the things 2020 threw at me, I never expected a Pavlovian response to be one of them. But here we are. It started innocently enough—a brutal migraine would strike, and the only thing that seemed to help was the comforting, carb-heavy embrace of a massive burrito. The pain would fade, replaced by savory satisfaction.

After a few cycles, my brain did the weirdest thing. It started connecting the dots. Headache = burrito reward. Soon, the *end* of a migraine would trigger an intense, undeniable craving. My body wasn't just seeking relief; it was demanding its prize.

The consequences have been… significant. My wallet is thinner, but I am not. My "burrito budget" became a real, alarming line item. My digestive system has staged more protests than I can count. And my jeans? Let's just say they’ve issued a formal complaint.

I’ve accidentally trained myself, and now I'm in a battle against my own conditioning. It’s a strange, deeply personal struggle born from a year where we all sought comfort in strange places. For me, it just happens to be wrapped in a tortilla. Who knew self-discovery could be so… cheesy?
