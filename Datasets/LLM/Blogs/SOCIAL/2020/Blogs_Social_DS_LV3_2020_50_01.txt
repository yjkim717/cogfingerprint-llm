### The Unwanted Advice: Protecting My Peace in 2020

It was the summer of 2020, and my world had shrunk to the size of my apartment. With lockdowns in full swing, my social life had migrated to a series of glowing screens. My closest friend, Sarah, and I had a standing Zoom date every Thursday. At first, it was a lifeline—a space to share our anxieties about the world and the eerie quiet of our city.

But slowly, our conversations started to shift. I began tentatively sharing the struggles in my long-term relationship. The pressure of being confined together 24/7 was creating friction, tiny cracks I was trying to navigate. Sarah, with the best of intentions, became a relentless advice columnist. Every sigh I offered was met with a “You should…” or a “If I were you…” She’d diagnose our problems, prescribe solutions, and analyze his texts with the certainty of someone who’d never actually met him during a pandemic.

I felt my own thoughts being crowded out. My private conflict was becoming a public committee of one. I was grateful for her care, but I felt my personal autonomy slipping away with every unsolicited strategy. I wasn’t looking for a fix; I was looking for a friend to just listen.

The turning point came on a particularly humid evening. I was sharing a small, happy breakthrough my partner and I had, and she immediately interrupted with, “Okay, but here’s what you need to do next to really lock it in.” I took a deep breath, my heart hammering against my ribs.

“Sarah,” I said, my voice softer than I intended. “I am so incredibly thankful for you. But right now, I don’t need advice. I just need you to be my friend and hear me. I need to figure this out for myself.”

The silence on her end felt eternal. Then, she simply said, “Okay. Tell me more.” It was a little awkward at first, a new boundary being drawn in the digital space between us. But it was necessary. Protecting that emotional boundary wasn’t about pushing her away; it was about preserving our friendship—and myself—from the weight of unwanted guidance. In a year where I had so little control, it was one thing I could hold onto.
