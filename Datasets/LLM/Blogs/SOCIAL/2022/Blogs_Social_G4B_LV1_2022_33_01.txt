**The Quiet Battle in My Head**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a weird, persistent feeling – a low-grade self-consciousness that just… sticks. It’s not a dramatic, “I hate my face” kind of thing, but a constant awareness of how I’m *perceived*.  I keep noticing my jawline, especially when I look in the mirror – that little double chin thing seems to magnify itself in certain angles. 

It’s frustrating because I know I’m a pretty average guy in terms of weight, and I’m pretty sure genetics are playing a huge role in this whole thing. But knowing that doesn't stop the internal voice from whispering about how I’m misunderstood.  Social media feels particularly brutal sometimes, with everyone projecting this perfect, filtered version of themselves.  It’s a lonely battle, trying to accept yourself when you feel like you're constantly measuring up against an impossible standard.  Anyone else feeling this way?
