**Title: When Insurance Feels Like a Maze: My Battle with MetLife & Melanoma**

It’s funny, isn’t it? You pay into things your whole adult life – hoping you’ll *never* need them. But then life throws you a curveball, like my melanoma diagnosis earlier this year. Surgery was tough, the recovery even tougher, and honestly, navigating the short-term disability claim with MetLife has been a whole other layer of stress.

I stumbled across a Reddit thread recently where someone was sharing a similar struggle, and it just resonated so deeply. It’s this feeling of constantly proving yourself, of having your medical information dissected and questioned. You’re already battling something serious; shouldn't getting the support you're entitled to be a little smoother? 

2022 has been a year of unexpected challenges for so many of us. It’s a reminder that even with the best intentions, systems aren't always built to truly *help* when we need them most. Sending strength to anyone else out there navigating a similar maze.
