## The Scale Doesn't Tell the Whole Story (And Social Media Doesn’t Help)

Okay, let's be real for a minute. I finally did it. I hit the weight goal I’d been chasing for… well, longer than I care to admit. And you know what? It didn’t magically fix everything.

I’ve been battling body image issues since I was a kid. Honestly, it feels like it’s always been there, a low hum of self-criticism. There were years of feeling “too much” – too big, too loud, too noticeable. And let's not even get started on the… *comments* I received growing up. Some people just seem to feel the need to point out what they perceive as flaws.

Reaching this weight goal was a huge accomplishment, physically. I feel healthier, stronger, and more energetic. But the voice in my head? It’s still there. It’s quieter, sure, but it's still whispering things like, “Is it enough?” or "Are you *really* worthy?".

And social media? Don’t even get me started. Scrolling through Instagram, seeing these seemingly perfect bodies, filters flawlessly smoothing everything… it’s a minefield. I'm trying to unfollow accounts that trigger those negative feelings, focusing on body neutrality and celebrating *all* bodies. It's a work in progress.

I think I'm finally realizing that weight loss is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. The real work is about dismantling those deeply ingrained beliefs, learning to love myself, flaws and all, and silencing that inner critic. It’s a journey, not a destination, and I’m just trying to be kinder to myself along the way. Anyone else feel this? Let's chat.
