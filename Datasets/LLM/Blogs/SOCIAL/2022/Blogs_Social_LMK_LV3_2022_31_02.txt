The dominance of English - a double-edged sword for language learners like me. On one hand, it's amazing to connect with people worldwide through a common language. On the other, it can be disheartening to see native speakers default to English, even when I'm trying to practice Finnish or Hindi. I've experienced this firsthand while chatting with language exchange partners or attending cultural events. As soon as they find out I'm comfortable with English, the conversation drifts away from my target language. It's like my efforts to learn and practice are invisible. But I'm not giving up. I believe that language learning is about more than just mastering grammar rules - it's about cultural exchange and connection. So, I'll keep practicing, and I hope you'll join me in embracing the beauty of linguistic diversity. Let's celebrate our differences and keep the conversation going - in all languages.
