It’s 2022, and I’m sitting here at 2 a.m., listening to Luna—my 11-month-old cat—belt out what sounds like a feline opera from the living room. She just finished her first heat cycle, and honestly, I thought the round-the-clock meowing would ease up by now. But here we are.

It’s more than just noise; it’s this new, persistent vocalization that tugs at my heart. Is she confused? In discomfort? I find myself scrolling through pet health forums, wondering if I’m doing enough.

In these quiet, bleary-eyed moments, I realize how deeply our pets’ behaviors connect to our own emotional rhythms. We worry, we empathize, we lose sleep—because their well-being becomes part of our story. And maybe, just maybe, Luna’s telling me she needs a little extra patience and care as she navigates this phase.
