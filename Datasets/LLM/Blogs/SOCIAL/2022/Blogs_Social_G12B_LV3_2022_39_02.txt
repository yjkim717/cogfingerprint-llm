## The Unexpected Frustration of Digital Familiarity

Okay, so I’ve been diving back into Monster Hunter Rise on my PC, and it’s been… surprisingly frustrating. Not because the hunts are hard (though they are!), but because I’m battling my own controller setup. I’m used to playing on my Switch, and transferring that muscle memory to the PC has been trickier than I anticipated. 

Even with Steam Input and a Pro Controller, the button mappings just *don’t* feel right. It’s a little thing, really, but it’s pulling me out of the flow. It’s made me think about how we expect digital experiences to seamlessly translate, and how often they don't. It’s a reminder that even something as simple as a button press can disrupt the feeling of being truly immersed. Anyone else ever have this weird disconnect?
