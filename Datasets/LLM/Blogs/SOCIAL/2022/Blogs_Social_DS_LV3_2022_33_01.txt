It’s 2022, and I’m standing in front of my phone camera, trying to record a simple video for friends. But I can’t stop staring at the screen—not at my smile or my eyes, but at the curve of my jawline. There it is, that slight softness under my chin, the “double chin” that seems to appear no matter how I angle my phone.

Logically, I know my weight is normal. I eat well; I move my body. But logic doesn’t silence the nagging voice that whispers, “You should look different.” I feel intensely self-conscious, as if everyone else is analyzing my appearance as harshly as I am.

Sometimes I wonder if it’s just my genetics—the blueprint I was handed. My mom has the same gentle curve in old photos. Is this simply how my body is shaped? Yet, knowing that doesn’t always ease the frustration. In a world of curated selfies and perfect angles, accepting my own reflection feels like a quiet, daily rebellion. Maybe you know the feeling, too.
