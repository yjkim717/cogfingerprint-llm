**Heating Rock and Shaking Ground: A 2022 Reflection**

Remember the gas price spike back in 2022? It had everyone talking about energy, and I fell down a rabbit hole. I stumbled upon two terms that sound the same but are worlds apart: oil shale and shale oil.

One method, for oil shale, involves literally setting the rock on fire *underground*—a process called in-situ retorting—to melt out the fuel. The other, hydraulic fracturing for shale oil, uses immense pressure to crack rock open and release what’s already there.

Learning this made me pause. We’re engineering marvels, heating solid rock and fracturing the earth miles below us. But at what cost to the water table and the landscape? It feels like we’re in a frantic race, developing incredible technologies to solve one problem, while the environmental questions loom larger each year. It’s a conversation we all need to be a part of, because the ground beneath our feet is quite literally part of the debate.
