## The Mirror Lied (and Maybe My Brain Did Too)

Okay, real talk. I’ve been doing a lot of staring at myself in the mirror lately, and not in a good way. It's 2022, and you’d think we’d be past this constant self-scrutiny, right? Apparently not. 

It started subtly. Just a fleeting thought, a quick comparison. My brother, Liam, is… well, he’s always been effortlessly fit. We’re both tall, but he just *builds* differently. I’ve always been a bit softer, a bit rounder. But something shifted recently. I started noticing a… double chin. A real, honest-to-goodness double chin. 

The thing is, I haven’t *really* gained that much weight. I know I’ve been a little less active, stress eating my way through some work deadlines, but I honestly thought I was holding my own. Seeing it reflected back at me, though? It’s thrown me.

It's crazy how much our perception can be skewed. I’m starting to wonder how much of this is genetics – we both share the same parents, after all. But I also think it’s a lot of my own brain playing tricks on me, fueled by Instagram filters and the constant pressure to look a certain way.  I'm trying to be kinder to myself, to remember that a mirror isn’t the full story. It’s a work in progress, though. Definitely a work in progress.
