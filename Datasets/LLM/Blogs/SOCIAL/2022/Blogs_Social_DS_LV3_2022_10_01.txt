It was the spring of 2022, and I found myself hunched over a laptop in Hanoi, trying to wrap my head around the six distinct tones of Vietnamese. My friend, Linh, would patiently correct me—the difference between “ma” (ghost) and “mà” (but) felt like a linguistic tightrope. I remember the day I tried to compliment her mother’s cooking, only to accidentally say the food was “old” instead of “delicious” because my tone slipped. We burst into laughter, and in that moment, I realized language isn’t just about vocabulary and grammar; it’s about connection.

Vietnamese, with its descriptive words and straightforward structure, began to feel less like a puzzle and more like a key. Each tone, each regional pronunciation nuance, was a doorway into understanding not just a culture, but the people within it. In a world still reeling from isolation, learning this language became my bridge—a reminder that even our stumbling attempts to connect can build something beautiful. It’s in the shared smiles over mispronunciations that we truly find common ground.
