Navigating the Ozempic Shortage: A Personal Struggle. In 2022, the Ozempic shortage left many of us with diabetes scrambling to manage our condition. As someone who relies on this medication for both diabetes and a neurological condition, I felt the pinch firsthand. With prescriptions being rationed, I had to get creative to make my supply last. I began stretching my doses, a strategy that wasn't without its challenges. It required careful planning and a willingness to adapt. While it wasn't ideal, it allowed me to maintain some level of stability in managing my chronic conditions. This experience highlighted the human side of medication shortages, where clinical solutions often fall short. My story is just one of many, underscoring the need for healthcare systems to address such shortages proactively, ensuring those with chronic conditions aren't left to fend for themselves.
