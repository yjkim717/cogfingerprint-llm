"Uncomfortable Connections: When a Teacher's Interest Goes Too Far"

As I scrolled through my messages one evening in 2022, a familiar name caught my eye - my ex-science teacher, Mr. Johnson. We hadn't been in touch since I graduated, but he had somehow managed to stay connected through social media. At first, his texts were harmless, asking about my college plans or commenting on my posts. But as time went on, his messages became more frequent and invasive. He'd reference private details about my life that only he knew from when I was his student, making me feel uneasy. He even suggested we grab coffee, which made my skin crawl. I realized that our relationship, or rather, his interest in me, had crossed a boundary. I felt uncomfortable and unsure how to respond. I decided to be direct and tell him I wasn't interested, prioritizing my own comfort and boundaries in the process.
