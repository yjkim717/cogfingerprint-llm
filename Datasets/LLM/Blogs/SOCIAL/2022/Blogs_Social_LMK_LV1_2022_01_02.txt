"I'm still hooked on Rocket League on Xbox! As I was grinding for that new skin, I realized I'm not alone. I started trading credits for blueprints with fellow players and it's been a game-changer. The social aspect is so underrated - we're not just playing, we're building a community, one trade at a time."
