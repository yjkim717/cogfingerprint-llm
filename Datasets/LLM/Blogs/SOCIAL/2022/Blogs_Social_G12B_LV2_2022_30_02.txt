## Is It Just Me? The Weight of Constant Little Setbacks

It’s 2022, and we're all supposed to be radiating positivity, right? Manifesting our dream lives? Honestly, some days I feel like the universe is actively trying to *prevent* me from doing just that. It's not dramatic, earth-shattering stuff. Just… a relentless stream of little inconveniences. A delayed train, a missed email, a project that hits a snag. 

Scrolling through social media, everyone else seems to be effortlessly thriving. Vacations, promotions, perfect avocado toast. And me? I’m battling a printer that won't print and a persistent feeling that I'm just… slightly out of sync. I know it’s probably just perspective, but some days, it feels like the world is just… tilted against me. Anyone else ever feel that way?

**Notes & Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Specificity:** I kept the examples ("delayed train," "missed email") fairly general to allow readers to easily project their own experiences. You could add a *brief* specific example if you want to ground it more.
*   **Social Media Focus:** I explicitly mentioned social media to directly address the comparison aspect of the summary.
*   **Ending Question:** The question at the end is designed to encourage engagement and make the post feel less like a monologue.
*   **Tone:** I aimed for a slightly melancholic but ultimately relatable tone.
*   **Length:** Roughly 123 words.
