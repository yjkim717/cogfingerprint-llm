"The Hidden Costs of Landing a Job". I still remember the frustration I felt in 2022 when I finally landed a job at Walmart, only to be hit with unexpected expenses. A mandatory physical exam and ID renewal added up quickly, putting a dent in my already tight budget. It's disheartening to think that securing a job shouldn't have to break the bank. As a job seeker, I wasn't prepared for these extra costs. It's a harsh reality many face, and it's time we acknowledge the financial burden of employment and work towards making job searching more accessible to all.
