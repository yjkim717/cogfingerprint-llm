"Unlocking My True Style: A Journey Through Kibbe Body Types. As I delved into the world of personal styling, I found myself stuck between three captivating categories: Soft Classic, Theatrical Romantic, and Soft Gamine. Understanding my Kibbe body type was more than just a classification - it was a path to self-discovery. By embracing my unique morphology, I uncovered a new sense of confidence and learned to dress in harmony with my body. In 2022, I'm embracing this newfound understanding, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me."
