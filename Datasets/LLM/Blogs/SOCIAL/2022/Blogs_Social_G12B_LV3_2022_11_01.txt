## The Invisible Weight: When Cancer Hits Your Wallet

Scrolling through Reddit last night, I stumbled upon a post that just…hit different. A user bravely sharing their cancer journey, and the gut-wrenching reality of the financial fallout. It wasn’t the diagnosis itself that shook me, but the sheer *weight* of the medical debt they’re facing, even *with* insurance.

It’s 2022, and we’re told healthcare is a right, but the stories like this one paint a starkly different picture. The burnout from juggling treatment, appointments, and relentless bills? It’s almost as debilitating as the cancer itself. 

It’s a painful reminder that so many are just one medical emergency away from financial ruin. Let's talk about this. Let's acknowledge the invisible burden so many carry and demand better. Because battling illness shouldn't mean battling bankruptcy too.
