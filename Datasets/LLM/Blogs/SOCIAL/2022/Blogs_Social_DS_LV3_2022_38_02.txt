It’s 2022, and my portfolio looks like a graveyard of "what was I thinking?" I’ve been quietly exploring a risky corner of the market—Chapter 11 bankruptcy stocks. They’re dirt cheap, and I’m not alone; indexing into a basket of them feels like betting on phoenixes rising from the ashes.

I picture myself telling friends at a café, "Yeah, I invest in bankrupt companies." It sounds wild, but there’s a strange thrill in spotting potential turnarounds before anyone else. It’s not just about the money; it’s about seeing hope where others see failure. In a world full of uncertainty, sometimes the biggest opportunities hide in the most overlooked places.
