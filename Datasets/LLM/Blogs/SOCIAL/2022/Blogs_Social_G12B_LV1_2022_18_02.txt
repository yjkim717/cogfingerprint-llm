>## That Suspicious Tracking Number Feeling

Okay, so I'm officially adding "online marketplace detective" to my resume. I bought a graphics card on Offer Up last week – a *steal*, I thought! – but the tracking number… it’s just… *stuck*. It’s been sitting at the same USPS facility for five days. 

Honestly, it's got me spiraling. Is this a legit deal, or have I fallen for a shipping scam? The anxiety is real. Anyone else ever had this happen? I'm seriously contemplating reaching out to USPS, but I don’t want to seem paranoid. 2022 feels like a year where you need to question *everything*.
