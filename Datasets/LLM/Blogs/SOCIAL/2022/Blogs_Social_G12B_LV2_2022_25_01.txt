## Beyond the Default: Wishing for More Character Customization

Okay, so I was lost down a rabbit hole of wrestling game mods the other day – totally harmless, I promise! – and it got me thinking. These modders are creating incredible custom face paint and tattoos for these "Create-a-Wrestlers" (CaWs), mimicking how you can tweak textures in other games. 

And it just sparked this wider thought: why *don't* we see more of that kind of granular customization everywhere?  Like, in social media avatars, even? We’re all crafting these online personas, but sometimes the options feel… limiting. Wouldn't it be amazing to really dial in the details, the little flourishes that make a digital you feel *truly* you? It’s a silly thought, maybe, but it feels like there's room to move beyond the default.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any revisions.
