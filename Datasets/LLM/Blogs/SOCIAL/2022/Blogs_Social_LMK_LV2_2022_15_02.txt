"Is the Wilderness Still a Wild West in RuneScape?" 

As I ventured back into the Wilderness in 2022, I couldn't help but wonder: is it still a hotbed for PKing? The 2022 update had me questioning the safety of this once-notorious PvP hub. I recalled the good old days when a wrong step could mean certain doom, and your precious items were up for grabs. The update brought changes to the death penalty, leaving me curious about the current state of affairs. Are PKers still lurking, waiting to strike? I dove into the community discussions and discovered that while the update did bring some changes, the Wilderness still has its risks. The death penalty may be more forgiving, but the thrill of PvP remains. For those willing to take the risk, the Wilderness still offers a unique experience. So, is it safe? Not entirely, but that's what makes it exciting.
