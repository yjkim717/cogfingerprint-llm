It’s 2022, and I’m trying to learn Finnish. I practice a hesitant “Mitä kuuluu?” with a local, only to be met with a cheerful “I’m good, thanks!” in flawless English. My heart sinks a little. This keeps happening—with Hindi, with Swedish—and the discouragement is real. It feels like English is this giant, friendly wall that politely blocks the door to genuine connection.

But then I tried Mandarin, and something shifted. In Beijing, a street vendor patiently corrected my tones, her eyes crinkling with a smile. In Seoul, a new language-exchange friend celebrated my clumsy Korean sentences over bubble tea. In Tokyo, an elderly man gestured enthusiastically as I stumbled through directions.

It hit me: the goal isn’t perfection. It’s the shared laugh, the mutual effort, the cultural exchange that blooms in those imperfect moments. Some languages build bridges more easily than others, but every attempt is a step toward someone else’s world. And that’s a journey worth taking.
