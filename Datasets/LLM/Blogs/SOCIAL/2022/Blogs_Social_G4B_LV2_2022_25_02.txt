**The Quiet Panic of the Scroll**

Remember 2022? It felt… loud. Not in a chaotic way, but a constant hum of everyone else’s highlight reel. I’d find myself scrolling, feeling this low-level panic – a weird comparison game where my life just didn’t measure up to the perfectly curated feeds.  

I started noticing it most with online gaming – watching streamers, seeing others dominate in PC games. It’s easy to get caught up in that competitive energy, but it felt isolating.  I realized I was craving *real* connection, not just observing it through a screen.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best connections are the quiet ones.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
