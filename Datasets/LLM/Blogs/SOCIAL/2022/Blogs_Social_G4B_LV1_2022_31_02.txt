**The English Echo**

Okay, real talk. 2022 was…rough for my French. I’d been diligently using Duolingo, trying to build a little routine, but then it happened. Almost every online group I joined, every forum I dipped into – *everything* was in English. 

It started as a convenience, really. English is so dominant online, right? But suddenly, I was practicing *less* French. The constant translation, the feeling of being perpetually ‘on the outside’ looking in… it was incredibly discouraging. 

I realized I needed to actively seek out spaces where my native language wasn't the default. It’s a frustrating reminder that building fluency isn’t just about apps and flashcards; it’s about connection and overcoming that language barrier.  Anyone else feel this struggle?
