**The Ripple Effect of a Little Extra**

Remember last year when I was obsessing over my RO unit? Seriously, the whole “RO filter, water TDS, reef tank” thing felt like a tiny, contained world. But it got me thinking about something bigger – how even small adjustments can create a ripple effect. 

I was worried about pushing my 5-gallon storage tank, and honestly, it felt like a mini-crisis.  It made me realize how we often get so focused on the immediate need that we forget the broader impact of our actions.  Just like a little extra water in a tank, a small change can shift everything.  What little ripples are *you* creating lately?

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post based on a different summary?
