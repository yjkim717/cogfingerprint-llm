## When Happy Songs Feel Sad: The Power of Visual Reinterpretation

Isn't it fascinating how a song can evoke one feeling, while its music video paints a completely different picture? Lately, I've been obsessed with videos that take a traditionally upbeat track and layer it with melancholy. It's a brilliant form of visual storytelling, a reinterpretation of the song's meaning. Seeing sunshine and smiles paired with a somber narrative just *hits* differently. It makes you question, feel, and really *listen* in a new way. Anyone else noticing this trend in 2022?
