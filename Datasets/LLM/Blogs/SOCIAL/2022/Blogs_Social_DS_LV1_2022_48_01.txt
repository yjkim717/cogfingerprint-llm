It’s funny how my hair tells its own story. When I chopped it short last year, my natural auburn was rich and deep. Now, as it’s grown past my shoulders, it’s faded to a reddish-brown, like a memory softening with time. I’ve been thinking—maybe it’s the sun, or just life, but I don’t want to dye it. In a world where we’re always changing ourselves, I’m learning to embrace the evolution, even the parts that lighten and fade. It’s all part of growing.
