Looking back at 2022, I remember scrolling through endless screenshots of custom WWE characters online. The creativity was incredible—except everyone’s “original” superstar had the same handful of tattoos and face paint. It hit me then how much we crave unique identity, even in virtual spaces.

We’re social creatures, after all. Expressing ourselves—our allegiances, our art, our imagined alter egos—is fundamental. A deeper creation suite wouldn’t just be a new feature; it would be a digital canvas for our individuality. In a year where we connected so much through screens, giving players the tools to truly paint their own stories would have made those virtual communities feel more personal, more *us*. It’s a small thing, but sometimes the pixels matter most.
