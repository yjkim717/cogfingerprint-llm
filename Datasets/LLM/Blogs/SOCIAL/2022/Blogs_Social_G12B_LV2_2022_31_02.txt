>## The Lingua-Franca Walls

It's a weird feeling, isn't it? Trying to build a bridge to another culture, to truly connect, and finding yourself constantly met with a wall of… English. I’ve been chipping away at Finnish and Hindi lately, genuinely excited to explore their nuances and connect with speakers on a deeper level. But so often, even when I clearly indicate I'm learning, the response is automatic – a flurry of English, assuming that's the easiest route.

It's not malicious, I know. It’s just… pervasive. And honestly? It’s a little discouraging. It feels like the world defaults to English, especially online, and it’s a subtle barrier to genuine language exchange. 

I’m not blaming anyone, but it got me thinking about the power of assumption. How easily we fall into the trap of expecting everyone to speak *our* language, rather than making an effort to meet them halfway. Maybe a simple "Do you prefer English?" goes a long way. It’s a small thing, but those small things can really shape the learning journey.
