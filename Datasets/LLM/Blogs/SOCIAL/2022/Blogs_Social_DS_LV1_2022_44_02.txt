### The Night the Set Fell (And Why It Made the Show Better)

I almost didn’t go to the opera that night in 2022. I was tired, the city felt chaotic, and the idea of sitting still for three hours of Wagnerian-inspired music felt like a chore. But something pulled me there, and I’m so glad it did.

The production of *Ariane et Barbe-Bleue* was stunning. The cast’s voices were phenomenal, filling the hall with this powerful, complex sound that you could feel in your bones. The real star, though, was the lead soprano’s interpretation of Ariane. She wasn’t just a damsel; she was a force of nature, her character development a masterclass in quiet strength and determination. It was a portrayal that felt incredibly resonant, a story about a woman trying to free others in a gilded cage.

Then, in the second act, it happened. A piece of the elaborate set—a large, painted flatscreen meant to be a castle wall—sagged abruptly with a groan of straining wood. It didn’t collapse, but it listed dramatically to one side. The singers didn’t miss a beat. The soprano, in character, simply stepped away from the tilting monstrosity with a wry, almost defiant glance, as if to say, “Even the walls themselves cannot stop this story.”

And that was the magic.

In that moment, the perfect illusion of theatre shattered, and we were left with something more real: a group of people, on stage and in the audience, sharing a slightly flawed, utterly human experience. The venue’s acoustics, which I’d critiqued earlier for being a little too sharp, suddenly felt intimate. The minor malfunction didn’t break the spell; it reforged it into something collaborative. We were all in it together.

It was a beautiful reminder for a post-lockdown world still learning to reconnect. Perfection is overrated. True connection—in art, and in life—often happens in the imperfect, unscripted moments where we all just lean in and carry on, together. The show, beautifully, must go on.
