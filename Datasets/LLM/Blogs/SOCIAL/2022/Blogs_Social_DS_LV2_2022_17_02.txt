There I was, halfway through nursing school in 2022, armed with hand sanitizer and a secret I carried everywhere: emetophobia. My heart would race at the mere thought of germs, of someone getting sick. Then, during a pediatric rotation, it happened—my gloved hand brushed against a little girl who’d been vomiting just minutes before.

The rest of the day was a blur of anxiety. I washed my hands raw, my mind spiraling. But in that fear, I realized something profound: my own struggle with anxiety might just make me a more compassionate nurse. After all, I understand visceral fear. Maybe my greatest weakness could become my hidden strength in caring for others.
