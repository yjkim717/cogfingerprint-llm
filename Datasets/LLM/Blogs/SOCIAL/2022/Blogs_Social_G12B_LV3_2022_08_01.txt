## Do These Animatronics Look Familiar? My Brain is Playing Tricks!

Okay, hear me out! I was scrolling Reddit the other day and stumbled upon the *wildest* comparison. Someone pointed out that the FNAF characters Moondrop and Sundrop kind of resemble that viral dress illusion from 2015 – you know, the blue/black or white/gold one? It got me thinking about how our brains interpret color and design, and how easily perception can be skewed. It’s a fun little rabbit hole, and a reminder that what we see isn’t always what *is*!
