It was supposed to be a summer of healing. After my melanoma surgery in 2022, my focus was on recovery and the follow-up radiation my doctor insisted was crucial. I wasn't asking for a vacation—just the medical leave I'd paid for.

Then the denial letter from MetLife arrived. "Not medically necessary," it stated, coldly dismissing my oncologist's professional judgment. The shock was a different kind of sickness. I had followed all the rules, paid my premiums, and now the safety net I trusted had vanished.

This experience was a brutal lesson in the gap between policy and people. It’s a lonely, infuriating fight that makes you question the very system designed to protect you. My health battle became a financial one, and no one should have to face both at once.
