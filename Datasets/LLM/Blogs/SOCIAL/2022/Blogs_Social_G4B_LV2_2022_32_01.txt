**The Echoes of Yesterday**

Scrolling through Instagram last week felt… heavy. Perfectly filtered bodies, endless “glow-ups,” and the constant pressure to *look* a certain way. It hit me with a force I didn’t expect – a reminder of a battle I’ve been fighting for years.

I started noticing it in childhood, really. Comments about my weight, the subtle comparisons, and a growing sense of self-consciousness that just wouldn’t go away. Then, as an adult, the cycle continued, fueled by trying (and failing!) to lose weight. It felt like I was chasing a phantom ideal. 

Honestly, 2022 feels like a turning point. I’m starting to realize that the most important thing isn’t fitting into a certain size, but accepting *myself*. It’s about acknowledging the echoes of those past experiences and choosing kindness – especially towards myself.  It’s a journey, definitely, but a worthwhile one.  Anyone else feeling this shift?
