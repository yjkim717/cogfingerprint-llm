### The Echo in the Empty Room: When "It Gets Better" Isn't Enough

I was on a video call with a friend the other day, the kind where you try to keep your camera angled just right so the crack in the wall behind you doesn’t show. I was venting, again, about a freelance check that was late, a car repair that cost more than the diagnosis, the familiar, grinding anxiety that feels like a low-grade fever you can’t shake.

And she said it. The phrase we’ve all heard a thousand times, meant as a life raft but feeling more like an anchor: “Hang in there. Things will get better.”

I smiled, I thanked her, and we hung up. But after the screen went dark, I just sat in the silence of my apartment, the truth of 2022 settling around me like a heavy blanket. This isn’t a bad month; this is the landscape. This is the financial tightrope so many of us have been walking since… well, since forever, it seems. And the well-intentioned mantra of “it gets better” has started to sound less like hope and more like an echo in an empty room.

Because what do you do when “better” feels like a mythical creature? When you’ve been swimming against the current for so long that exhaustion is a core part of your identity? It’s not just the bank account balance; it’s the mental toll. It’s the chronic disappointment of a job application that goes nowhere, the sinking feeling when an unexpected bill arrives, the quiet shame of having to say “I can’t afford it” for the tenth time. It’s a specific kind of grief—mourning a future that feels perpetually out of reach.

I’m not writing this for answers. I don’t have a neat, bow-topped solution to sell you. If I did, believe me, I’d have used it myself. I’m writing this for everyone who has ever nodded along to that advice while screaming inside. I see you.

Maybe the shift, the tiny one we can manage right now, isn’t about blindly believing in a distant “better.” Maybe it’s about granting ourselves permission to be furious, sad, and bone-tired with the struggle. Maybe it’s about validating our own exhaustion instead of papering over it with toxic positivity.

So, if you’re like me, standing in your own version of this quiet room, let’s make a new pact. Let’s stop waiting for a “better” that some distant horizon owes us. Let’s acknowledge that this is hard, that it’s unfair, and that we are still here, fighting another day. Our resilience isn’t measured by our unwavering belief in a happy ending, but by our courage to face another Monday, even when we’re running on fumes. And sometimes, that has to be enough.
