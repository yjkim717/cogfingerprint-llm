"I'll be honest, I've always felt like I've been flying under the radar. Growing up, I was the kid who didn't quite fit the mold - always struggling to stay on top of assignments, getting distracted in class, and feeling like I was just 'getting by'. As an adult, those same struggles persisted, and I often found myself wondering if I was just being lazy or if there was something more going on. After years of prodding my psychologist, I'm finally taking the leap and getting a psychiatric evaluation to explore the possibility of ADHD. It's funny, I've always felt like I've been letting people down - my parents, my teachers, even myself. But I'm starting to realize that maybe I just had low expectations placed on me. It's 2022, and I'm taking control of my narrative. I'm ready to finally get the answers I've been searching for."
