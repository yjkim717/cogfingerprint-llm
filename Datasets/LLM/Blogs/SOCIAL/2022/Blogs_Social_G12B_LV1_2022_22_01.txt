## The World Gets Too Bright

It’s a weird habit, I know, but I often close one eye. Not dramatically, just a quick, almost unconscious thing. It started years ago, a way to dial down the visual noise. Lately, though, it’s become tied to anxiety. Being in a crowded cafe, or even just a brightly lit grocery store, and *not* being able to close that eye? It feels…jarring. Like a dial has been cranked up too high, and I can't find the off switch. 2022 has been a lot, and sometimes, just one eye closed feels like a tiny bit of control.
