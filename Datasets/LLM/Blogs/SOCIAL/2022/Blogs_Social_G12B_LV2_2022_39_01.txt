## The Endless Pursuit of Pure… Anything?

Okay, so confession time: I’ve been obsessing over my reef tank water lately. Specifically, my Hague RO unit. I was wondering – and probably overthinking – if running it beyond its 5-gallon storage limit impacts the purity. Sounds silly, right? 

It got me thinking, though. Don’t we *all* do that? Chase that ideal, that perfect outcome? Whether it’s a spotless home, a flawlessly curated social media feed (guilty!), or, in this case, the absolute purest RO water for my corals. 

2022 has been a year of realizing that "perfect" is a myth. Good enough, consistent effort, and enjoying the *process* - that’s where the real satisfaction lies. My corals are thriving, and honestly, a slight TDS fluctuation isn't the end of the world. Anyone else feel me on this?
