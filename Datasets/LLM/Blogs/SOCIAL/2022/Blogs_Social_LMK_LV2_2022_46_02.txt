"Stuck in the Loop: The Elusive TV Jingle" - As I sat watching TV in 2022, a familiar yet frustrating tune caught my ear. A catchy jingle played at the end of a show, but I couldn't quite place it. It sounded like a warped version of a pre-existing song, stuck in a garbled static loop. I've heard it in other random contexts too, and it has become an earworm. Like a character from 'A Serious Man', I'm on a quest to uncover the jingle's origin. Can you help me identify it?
