"As I sipped my morning coffee in 2022, I couldn't help but chuckle recalling the Bluey episode we'd watched the night before with my kids - the one where Bandit mistakes Veranda Santa for the real deal! The next morning, our own 'Veranda Santa' escapade ensued, with presents mysteriously appearing on our porch. The kids were thrilled, and I was grateful for the simple joy of a fun Christmas tradition that brought us all together."
