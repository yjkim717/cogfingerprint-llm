## The Juggling Act: Starbucks, Wegmans, and the Weight of Past Experience

So, here I am, deep in the job hunt. It’s 2022, and the market feels…interesting, to say the least. I'm currently rocking it at Starbucks – the caffeine fumes are practically part of my DNA at this point! But I’ve also got an interview lined up at Wegmans, a place I’ve always admired. 

The thing is, I'm not starting from scratch. I've got a solid five years of experience under my belt, most of it spent at Safeway. Will that help or hurt? I keep wondering if mentioning my previous role will paint me as someone who isn't fully committed, or if it showcases a dependable work ethic. It's a weird feeling, balancing the present and the past while trying to build toward the future. Anyone else ever felt like they were explaining their whole career story in a single interview?



Hope this hits the mark!
