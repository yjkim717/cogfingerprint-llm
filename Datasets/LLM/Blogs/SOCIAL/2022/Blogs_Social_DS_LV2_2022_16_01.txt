You know that feeling when you’re so excited for something, you’re willing to jump through a few hoops? That was me with the Overwatch 2 beta. I saw the preorder, the promise of early access, and I thought, “Why not? It’s Blizzard—they’re reliable.”

So I dropped the $40. I envisioned myself diving into new maps, testing new heroes before anyone else. But then reality hit. The beta access was murky, the instructions unclear. Suddenly, my purchase felt less like a ticket to an exclusive event and more like a shady deal in a back alley.

Now I’m sitting here with content I can’t even use until October, $40 lighter, and a bitter taste in my mouth. It’s a stark reminder that in 2022, even trusted names can make you feel like just another number. It’s not just about the money; it’s about that broken trust, that moment when excitement turns into disappointment. Has this ever happened to you?
