As I watch my child enthusiastically play Pokémon Go, I'm reminded that sometimes it's worth looking beyond Niantic's frustrating policies. In 2022, this game still brings my kid immense joy, and that's all that matters. Seeing them explore our neighborhood, excitedly catching Pokémon, is a delight. It's a simple pleasure that highlights the importance of embracing the little things in life, even in the face of gaming frustrations.
