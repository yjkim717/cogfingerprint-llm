### The Myth and Magic of Movie Stars in 2022

Remember when a single name on a poster could make you buy a ticket, no questions asked? Tom Cruise. Julia Roberts. Will Smith. For the longest time, that was the golden rule in Hollywood: big star equals big box office. But scrolling through the 2022 box office hits, that old formula feels… different.

This summer, I took my nephew to see *Top Gun: Maverick*. The theater was packed, buzzing with an energy I hadn't felt in years. Was it the thrilling flight sequences? Sure. But the real draw was seeing Tom Cruise, a bona fide movie star, doing what he does best. It was a powerful reminder that star power isn't dead; it's just evolved.

In an era dominated by superhero franchises where the character is often bigger than the actor, it’s easy to think the age of the movie star is over. But here’s the thing I’ve been reflecting on: a true star doesn't just open a movie; they elevate it. They create a promise of a certain experience. We don't just go to see a "Tom Cruise movie"; we go for the commitment, the practical stunts, the sheer cinematic event he guarantees. That’s a unique kind of social contract between an artist and their audience.

Studios might not be able to bank on a star alone to save a bad script anymore—and that’s a good thing! But when genuine talent meets a great project, that star power becomes the catalyst. It’s the spark that gets people off their couches, away from their ten streaming subscriptions, and into a shared space to experience a story together. In a fragmented world, that collective excitement is a kind of magic no algorithm can replicate.
