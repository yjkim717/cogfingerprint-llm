**The Quiet Year of Scrolling**

Honestly, 2022 felt…weirdly quiet on social. Remember the frantic energy of 2021? The constant need to *be* online, to post, to react? It just…subsided. Maybe we all burned out. 

I found myself scrolling less, actually *looking* at the things in front of me. There was a strange peace in it. Seeing everyone’s highlight reels felt less urgent, less like a competition. I even unfollowed a few accounts that consistently made me feel inadequate. 

It wasn’t a dramatic change, just a gentle shift.  A realization that connection doesn't have to be measured in likes and comments. Sometimes, the most valuable moments happen offline, away from the blue light.  What about you? Did you find a little space in 2022?

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a blog post on a different topic?
