>## The Edge of Everything: Graduation, Goodbyes, and a Whole Lot of Butterflies

Okay, deep breaths. That’s what I’m telling myself, anyway. Graduation is looming, and with it, a giant, sparkly, terrifying leap. I’m moving across the country – a dream I’ve nurtured for years – but the excitement is tangled up with a knot of anxiety I didn’t quite anticipate.

It’s not just the logistics of packing up my life into boxes (though, seriously, *where* do all my books go?). It’s the leaving. Leaving behind the familiar comfort of my college town, my friends who feel like family, and a really wonderful, blossoming relationship. 

Suddenly, all those late-night study sessions, the inside jokes, the easy laughter… it feels like a precious ecosystem I’m about to abandon. And him? We’re navigating the tricky waters of a long-distance relationship, and the uncertainty is a low hum of worry in the background.

Is this the right decision? The one I've been planning for so long? My brain argues yes, of course! This is *my* dream, right? But my heart keeps whispering doubts, painting vivid pictures of missed moments and fading connections. 

I know change is inevitable, and growth often comes from discomfort. But stepping off this familiar ledge and into the unknown? It’s a lot. Anyone else feeling the same mix of exhilaration and sheer panic as they head into a new chapter? Let’s commiserate – and maybe share some coping strategies! Because right now, I’m all ears (and desperately seeking a good playlist for road trips).
