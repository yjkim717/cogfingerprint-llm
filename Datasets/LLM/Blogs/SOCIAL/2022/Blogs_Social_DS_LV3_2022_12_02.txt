It’s 2022, and my sweet 11-month-old cat, Luna, has me feeling like a worried parent. Her recent heat cycle ended, but the restless meowing and clingy behavior haven’t faded. Every night, her plaintive cries echo through our quiet apartment, and she follows me from room to room as if searching for something she can’t name.

I’ve spent hours scrolling through pet forums, wondering if this is normal or something deeper. Is it lingering instinct, or is she trying to tell me she’s in discomfort? I finally booked an appointment with our veterinarian—because sometimes, the most caring thing we can do is admit we don’t have all the answers. Our pets rely on us to listen, even when they can’t speak our language.
