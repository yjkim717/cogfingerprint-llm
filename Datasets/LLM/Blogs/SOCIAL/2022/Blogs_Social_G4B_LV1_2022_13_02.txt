**The Scroll & The Smile**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How much of our lives play out in little squares on a screen? I was scrolling through Instagram last week, feeling that familiar pang of “everyone else is having more fun” – you know the one. Then, I stumbled across a Reddit thread about someone completely rethinking their Invisalign journey. They’d moved, weren’t happy with the results, and were desperately trying to figure out refunds and switching providers. 

It made me think about how easily we can get caught up in the highlight reels of social media.  We chase the perfect image, the perfect trip, the perfect *everything*. But sometimes, real life – and real dental work – requires a little more patience, a little more honesty, and a willingness to adapt.  Maybe it’s time to step away from the scroll and focus on what actually makes *my* smile, and *my* life, shine.
