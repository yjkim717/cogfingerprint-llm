>## The Hand Sanitizer and the Fluttering Heart

Okay, so, nursing school is… a lot. Like, everyone says it is, but you don't *really* grasp the intensity until you're in the thick of it. And this week? This week hit different.

We’re on clinical rotation, and it’s amazing, truly. The hands-on experience is invaluable. But I’m also battling something I’ve wrestled with for years – emetophobia. It's a fear of vomiting, and it can manifest in some pretty intense anxiety around germs and contamination.

Today, I had a quick, accidental brush of hands with a patient while helping them reposition. It was like *bam* – my heart started pounding, my palms were sweating, and the overwhelming urge to sanitize everything surged through me. I practically sprinted to the nearest hand sanitizer dispenser. 

It was silly, I know. A tiny touch. But the anxiety is real. I'm learning so much clinically, but also learning a lot about managing my own mental health in a high-pressure environment. Anyone else dealing with anxieties in their field? Send coffee and coping strategies, please! #nursingschool #anxiety #mentalhealth #clinicalrotation #2022
