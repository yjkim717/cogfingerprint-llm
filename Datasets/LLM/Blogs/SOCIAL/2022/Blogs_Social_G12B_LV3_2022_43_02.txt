## The Unexpected Kindness of Online Communities

It’s funny how the internet, often painted as a chaotic space, can also reveal unexpected generosity. I saw a post on Reddit today – someone selling a brand-new RTX 3080 Ti, hoping to brighten someone's Christmas. Seriously? In 2022, with all the supply chain woes and inflated prices, this act felt… hopeful. It’s a reminder that even amidst the noise, genuine kindness and a desire to help others still exist online. Maybe we all need a little more of that.
