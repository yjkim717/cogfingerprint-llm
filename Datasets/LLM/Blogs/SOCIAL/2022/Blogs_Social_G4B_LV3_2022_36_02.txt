**The Weight of a Good Book Recommendation**

Remember those days, scrolling through endless Instagram reels, desperately searching for that *one* thing to capture someone’s interest? I was totally there in 2022, wrestling with the perfect gift for my niece. She devoured books like they were oxygen, and I wanted to find something that truly resonated. 

Someone recently asked me about recommending Tamora Pierce’s *Circle of Magic* series – a brilliant idea, but also a little daunting. Is it *really* seven-year-old appropriate? It’s that feeling, isn’t it? The weight of wanting to introduce a child to a story they’ll cherish, while also respecting their developmental stage. 

Ultimately, it’s about finding the right fit, isn’t it? A little bit of research, a whole lot of love, and trusting that the right book will find its way to the right reader.
