It was Election Day 2022, and I stood in my local polling place, holding that familiar paper ballot. I’d always used a standard ball-point pen, but this time, I noticed the black marker left out on the table. On a whim, I picked it up.

The difference was immediate. Each filled oval was solid, dark, and certain—no faint lines or hesitant strokes. It felt more deliberate, like my choices were being declared with confidence rather than whispered in ink. In that quiet booth, I realized how small tools can shape big moments. Unless your ballot says otherwise, that simple switch can turn civic duty from a chore into a clear, empowering act. Our voices matter, and sometimes, they deserve to be written in bold.
