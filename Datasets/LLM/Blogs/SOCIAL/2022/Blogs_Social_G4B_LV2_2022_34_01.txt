**Scrolling Through a Feeling**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 was *a year* for social media, wasn’t it? I felt like I was perpetually scrolling, absorbing a tidal wave of perfectly curated lives and brand announcements. It got me thinking about something I’d been wrestling with: how do you build a brand when everyone’s already shouting?

I recently chatted with a freelance designer who’s really focused on helping local businesses – breathing new life into their visuals and online presence. It’s a fantastic niche, and it really got me thinking about the *why* behind branding. It’s not just about logos and pretty colours, is it? 

It’s about connecting. It’s about telling a story. And in a world saturated with noise, that story needs to cut through.  I realized I was spending so much time chasing trends on Instagram, I almost forgot what *genuine* connection looked like. 

I’m trying to shift my own approach – to be more intentional about the content I share and the businesses I support.  Maybe that’s the key: focusing on authentic engagement, rather than just broadcasting. What about you? How are you navigating the social space this year?
