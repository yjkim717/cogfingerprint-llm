It’s 2022, and I’m six months into my new role as a UPS driver. I remember thinking this was my ticket—steady income, a clear career path, and finally being able to breathe a little easier financially. But let me tell you, the reality hits differently.

Every morning starts with a mental checklist, not just for packages but for my own sanity. The GPS, the deadlines, the unspoken pressure to move faster—it’s a constant hum in the background. And then there’s management, watching every move, every second. It’s like walking a tightrope between efficiency and burnout.

Some days, I come home drained, wondering if the stability is worth the strain. But then I remember the regulars on my route—the elderly woman who waits for her medication, the young parents relying on baby supplies. In a world still finding its footing post-pandemic, this job isn’t just about deliveries; it’s about connection. And somehow, that makes the stress a little more manageable.
