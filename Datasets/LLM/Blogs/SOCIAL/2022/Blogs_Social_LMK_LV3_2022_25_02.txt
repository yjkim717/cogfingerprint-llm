As I settled into my new life in South Carolina in 2022, I realized my online gaming habits were about to take a hit. With international friends relying on me for lag-free PS2 emulation sessions, I knew I needed a reliable fiber optic internet provider. After some research, I discovered that having the right internet connection wasn't just about speed - it was about staying connected to a global community. I finally found a provider that met my needs, and my gaming sessions were back to normal, bridging distances and cultures with ease.
