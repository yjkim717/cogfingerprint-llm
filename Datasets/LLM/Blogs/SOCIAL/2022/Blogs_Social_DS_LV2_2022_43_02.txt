It’s December 2022, and I’m scrolling through listings when I spot it: a sealed EVGA RTX 3080 Ti, priced to move at $800. The seller isn’t just offloading hardware—they’re hoping to make someone’s holiday build a reality. In a season often clouded by consumerism, this small gesture feels like a quiet rebellion. It reminds me that tech isn’t just about specs; it’s about the connections we forge, one local meetup at a time. What a gift, in every sense.
