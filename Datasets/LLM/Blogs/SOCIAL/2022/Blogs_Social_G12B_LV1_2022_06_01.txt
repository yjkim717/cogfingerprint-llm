>## The Buzz About Letting Go (and Replacing Bee Traps)

Ugh, the things you learn about yourself through homeownership. This summer's been a lesson in persistence – and a surprising amount of frustration with carpenter bees. I thought I’d handled them last year with some treatment, but clearly, those little wood-boring bandits were playing the long game. My porch is looking… less than ideal, thanks to their efforts.

So, I’m rebuilding a bee trap. It’s a small project, but it feels symbolic, you know? Sometimes, you have to accept that things you’ve tried just aren’t working and actively rebuild.  It's a little lesson in letting go of old strategies and embracing a fresh approach, both with DIY projects and, honestly, in life. Anyone else feeling this vibe in 2022?
