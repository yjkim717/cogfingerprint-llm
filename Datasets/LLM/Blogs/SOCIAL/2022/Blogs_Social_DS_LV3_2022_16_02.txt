It’s 2022, and I’ve noticed a strange trend in online forums lately. You’ll find a thread full of genuine questions, and then—*bam*—someone swoops in, declaring themselves an expert on the topic. I’m not talking about people sharing helpful knowledge; I mean the ones who’ve clearly never held a job in the field or even read the source material.

Suddenly, a thoughtful discussion morphs into a pointless argument. They ignore basic facts, toss in a little trolling for good measure, and derail the entire conversation. It’s exhausting. I’ve started asking myself: are we here to learn and connect, or just to hear ourselves talk? It feels like we’re losing the art of listening in the noise.
