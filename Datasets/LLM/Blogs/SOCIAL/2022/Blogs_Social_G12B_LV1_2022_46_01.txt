## The Poster That Haunts My Memory (and Maybe Influenced Don't Look Now?)

Okay, so this is a weird one. I’ve been on a deep dive into 60s/70s British cinema lately, spurred on by a rewatch of *Don't Look Now*. It got me thinking about those films that just *lodge* themselves in your brain, not always for their plot, but for a specific aesthetic. 

I’m trying to track down a film I vaguely remember seeing as a kid – probably sometime in the late 90s. It was British, definitely from the 60s or 70s, and it had the *most* striking poster. I recall a bold, almost brutal combination of red, white, and black. It felt… unsettling. 

Someone mentioned it might have been a precursor to *A Clockwork Orange* in some way, or at least shared a similar vibe. It's a long shot, but the memory keeps popping up. Does anyone else have a film lurking in the back of their mind, a visual echo from a forgotten festival screening? I'd love to hear about it!
