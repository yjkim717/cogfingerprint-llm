Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and a 2022 context. I've included a title suggestion at the top.

**Title: When "Checking In" Feels a Little *Too* Much**

It's 2022, and the lines between professional and personal feel blurrier than ever, especially with the constant hum of notifications. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about boundaries – specifically, those tricky ones that exist after a relationship ends, particularly when a power dynamic was involved.

I’ve heard stories, and honestly, experienced a little of it myself, where someone continues to reach out *after* things are over. Not in a harassing way, necessarily, but in a way that just… feels off. Constant texts, seemingly casual invitations, and the unsettling feeling that they remember *way* more about your life than they should. 

It’s confusing, right? You want to be polite, grateful even. But that persistent contact, especially when it treads into personal territory, can create this low-level anxiety. It makes you second-guess everything. It's a reminder of that initial imbalance. 

Maybe it's time we all got a little better at recognizing when "checking in" crosses a line and starts to feel…uncomfortable. What are your thoughts? Have you ever felt this way?
