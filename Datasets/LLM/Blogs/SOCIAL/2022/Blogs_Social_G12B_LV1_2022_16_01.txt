>## The Beta Blues and a Growing Disconnect

Okay, so I need to vent. Anyone else feeling a little… raw about the Overwatch 2 beta situation? I know, I know, it's just a game. But it feels like something bigger than that, and I'm seeing a lot of others echoing the same sentiment.

I was genuinely excited for Overwatch 2. The promise of new heroes, a revamped PVE mode, and a fresh coat of paint on a game I loved? Sign me up. I preordered, like many of us did, trusting Blizzard would deliver. Then the beta access system… well, it was a mess. A confusing, opaque mess.

Suddenly, it felt like a lottery. Hours spent refreshing the Battle.net launcher, hoping for that elusive invite, while others seemed to be strolling in without a second thought. And the worst part? The feeling that the whole thing felt… shady. Like prioritizing those who spent money over genuine enthusiasm.

It’s left me feeling a bit disconnected, not just from the game, but from the company itself. It’s 2022, and clear communication shouldn’t be this difficult.  It’s a frustrating reminder that sometimes, loyalty isn't always rewarded. Just my two cents. Anyone else feeling this way?
