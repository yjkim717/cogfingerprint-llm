It’s funny how the smallest details can spark big conversations. In 2022, a Reddit user spotted something in *Futurama*—a character’s mouth forming “poop” instead of “brains.” It made me think: how often do we miss the subtle, human moments in our own lives, especially after years of digital interaction? We’re so focused on the big picture, we overlook the quiet truths. Maybe it’s time to pay closer attention, not just to animation, but to each other. After all, the real easter eggs are the connections we almost scroll past.
