## Lagging Behind, Connecting Across Oceans

It's 2022, and the world feels smaller than ever. I recently stumbled down a rabbit hole on Reddit, seeing someone desperately searching for a fiber optic internet provider in South Carolina, all to play video games with friends living across the Atlantic. It really struck me. 

We talk about globalization, about being "connected," but the reality is, reliable internet access – *good* internet – is still a huge barrier. Imagine missing crucial moments in a game, or choppy video calls with loved ones, just because your connection can’t keep up. It’s a frustrating reminder that while technology promises to bridge distances, it also highlights the digital divides that still exist. Makes you appreciate a stable connection, doesn't it?
