## The Unexpected Comfort of Operatic Villains

Okay, hear me out. Lately, I've been obsessed with opera. Seriously. And not the fluffy, romantic stuff. I'm talking *Don Giovanni* and *Tosca* – stories brimming with deception, betrayal, and questionable morals. Sounds dark, right? But honestly, there’s something incredibly cathartic about witnessing such grand displays of flawed humanity. In a world that felt increasingly chaotic in 2022, getting lost in these operatic dramas, watching characters wrestle with their demons (and often lose spectacularly), was strangely… comforting. It’s a reminder that messiness is just part of the human experience.
