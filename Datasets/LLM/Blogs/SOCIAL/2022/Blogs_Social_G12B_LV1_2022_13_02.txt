## The Unexpected Detour on My Straight Smile Journey

Okay, so things haven’t exactly gone as planned with my Invisalign. Remember how excited I was last year? The promise of a perfectly aligned smile felt… attainable! But 2022 has thrown me a curveball. Let's just say the results weren't what I’d hoped for, and a looming cross-country move felt like the *perfect* time to reassess.

Switching providers felt huge, a bit scary even. There's a definite feeling of admitting something didn’t work out. And then there’s the whole "black triangle" issue – a detail I wish I'd researched more thoroughly upfront. My current orthodontist wasn't addressing it, and honestly, the bonding work felt… rushed. 

I'm now with a new provider, and while it's a fresh start, the financial aspect is still a little raw. Navigating refunds and understanding the new treatment plan has been a learning experience. It's a reminder that even seemingly straightforward choices can have unexpected twists and turns. Anyone else ever had a major course correction in a self-improvement project? I'd love to hear about it!
