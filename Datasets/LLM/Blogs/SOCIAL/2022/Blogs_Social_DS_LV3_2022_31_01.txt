It was a rainy Thursday in 2022 when Jamie and I finally voiced the **threesome** fantasy we’d both been quietly turning over in our minds. Over coffee, we leaned into that vulnerable, necessary **communication**—sharing excitement, but also the flutter of **nervousness**. What if one of us felt left out? What if it changed our dynamic?

We agreed: this wasn’t about filling a void, but exploring shared **fantasies** together. Setting boundaries felt less like drawing lines and more like building trust. And when the evening finally happened, it wasn’t the physical closeness I remember most—it was the laughter, the checking in, the shared glances that said, “You good?” 

In the end, the real **enjoyment** came not from the act itself, but from navigating it as a team, and realizing our bond was only stronger for the honesty it took to get there.
