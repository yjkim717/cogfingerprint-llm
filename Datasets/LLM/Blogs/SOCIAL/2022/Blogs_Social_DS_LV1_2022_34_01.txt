### The Coffee Shop Wake-Up Call: Why My Freelance Business Had to Evolve

It hit me while I was waiting for my oat milk latte. I was in a local coffee shop I’d loved for years, but for the first time, I really *saw* it. The faded logo on the chalkboard. The Instagram feed on their wall, last updated in 2019. The decor that whispered "2012." It was a fantastic small business, but it was having a quiet, one-sided conversation with a world that had moved on.

And I realized my freelance design business was doing the exact same thing.

For years, I’d just been a "logo designer." A client would come to me for a mark, I’d deliver it, and that was that. But in 2022, that feels like selling someone a single tire and calling it a car. A beautiful logo means very little if a business’s social media is a ghost town, or if their physical space doesn’t match the vibe they’re selling online.

That coffee shop moment was my wake-up call. I wasn’t just a designer; I was a problem-solver. These local businesses weren’t just asking for a new icon; they were asking for a lifeline to a new generation of customers.

So I pivoted. Now, I offer comprehensive branding. We start with the visual identity—the logo, the colors—but we don’t stop there. We talk about how that brand lives on social media. We even discuss how their interior decor can tell their story. It’s not just about looking pretty; it’s about building a cohesive, authentic world that people *want* to be part of.

It’s no longer about just making a thing. It’s about helping a business find its voice again. And honestly, that’s so much more rewarding.
