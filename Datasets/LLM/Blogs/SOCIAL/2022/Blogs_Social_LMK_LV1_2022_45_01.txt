As I sat in my doctor's office in the spring of 2022, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration and anxiety. The Ozempic shortage had just been announced, and I was worried about how I would manage my diabetes. To make matters worse, I've also been dealing with a neurological condition that makes it hard to stick to a strict medication routine. My doctor and I came up with a plan to ration my injections, stretching out the time between doses to make the medication last longer. It's not ideal, but it's the best we could do given the circumstances. I'm not alone in this struggle - I've connected with others online who are going through the same thing. We're sharing our own rationing plans and supporting each other through this challenging time. It's a difficult situation, but together, we're finding ways to make it work.
