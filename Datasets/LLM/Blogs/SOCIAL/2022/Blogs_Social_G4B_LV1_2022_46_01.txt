**Lost in the Grain: Remembering a 60s Dream**

Anyone else feel like a lot of cool cinema gets… lost? I was just digging through old film magazines – mostly digital scans, of course – and stumbled across a mention of Nicholas Roeg and a film called “The Poet Kid.” It’s a hazy recollection, really, from the late 60s/early 70s. 

The description hinted at a film so experimental, so visually arresting, it might have subtly shaped later masterpieces like ‘Don’t Look Now.’ It’s funny how a single, forgotten film festival screening could plant a seed. Makes you wonder about the unseen influences shaping our favorite movies today.  #filmhistory #lostfilms #nicholasroeg

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
