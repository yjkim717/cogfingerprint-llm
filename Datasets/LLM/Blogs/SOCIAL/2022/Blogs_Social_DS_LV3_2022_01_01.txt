It’s 2022, and I’m scrolling through Rocket League decals, feeling a little baffled. There’s this England flag, crisp and clean, but stamped with the iconic Nike swoosh. It looks cool, I’ll admit, but it also makes me pause. Why does one country’s symbol get this branded treatment while others don’t?

It feels like a strange, selective kind of national pride, filtered through corporate branding. In a game played by a global community, these small choices speak volumes. Shouldn’t our in-game flags be about pure representation, not which ones have a powerful sponsor? It’s a tiny pixel in the grand scheme, but it taps into a bigger social question about inclusivity versus commercial influence. I just want to rep my flag, my way, without a logo attached. Is that too much to ask?
