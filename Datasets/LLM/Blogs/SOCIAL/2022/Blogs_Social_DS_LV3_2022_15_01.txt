It was the third time in as many days that I’d found my kitten, Luna, halfway out of her dreaded “cone of shame,” batting at her spay incision with a look of pure mischief. My heart sank. The carefully placed stitches were strained, the healing site looking angry and raw again.

In 2022, it felt like the world was collectively trying to heal, and here I was, failing at helping this tiny creature do the same. The vet’s post-op instructions were clear, but Luna’s relentless energy was a force of nature. I’d tried everything: calming sprays, extra cuddles, a fortress of pillows to block her from jumping. Yet, the delicate process of tissue repair was constantly under threat.

It became a lesson in patience, for both of us. I learned that healing isn't linear and can't be rushed, whether for a small incision or a weary spirit. It requires a gentle, watchful presence—and sometimes, a very secure cone. Seeing that final, clean scar weeks later was a quiet victory, a testament to the resilience that comes from a little bit of protection and a whole lot of care.
