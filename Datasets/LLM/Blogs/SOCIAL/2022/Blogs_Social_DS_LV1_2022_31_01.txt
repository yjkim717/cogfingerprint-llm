**Navigating Our First Threesome: More Than Just a Fantasy**

So, 2022 is the year we finally decided to talk seriously about a threesome. It’s a fantasy we’ve both shared, but bringing it into the light of our living room felt entirely different. The conversation wasn't just hot; it was nerve-wracking.

We’re a versatile couple, and that’s usually our strength, but suddenly it felt like a new source of anxiety. What if one of us gets jealous? What about performance pressure with an audience? We spent more time talking about our feelings than the logistics. It was less about finding a third and more about reinforcing the trust between us, first.

It’s funny how a fantasy can lead you to the most grounded, important conversations about your relationship. The threesome itself is still a plan, but the process has already brought us closer.
