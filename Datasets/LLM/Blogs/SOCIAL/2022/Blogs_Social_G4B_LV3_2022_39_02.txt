**The Ghost of Monster Hunter on PC**

There’s something deeply frustrating about clinging to a familiar comfort, isn’t there? I’ve been wrestling with it lately, trying to get my *Monster Hunter Rise* save from Switch onto my PC. It’s a beautiful game, but the controls just *don’t translate* the same way. It’s like a ghost of my progress, stubbornly refusing to play by PC rules. 

It’s made me think about how we all build little worlds around ourselves – routines, games, even social circles – and how jarring it can be when they don’t quite fit the new space we’re in.  Anyone else feel this shift lately?
