The Long Wait is Over: My Journey to an ADHD Diagnosis

As I sit here in 2022, reflecting on the twists and turns of my journey, I'm reminded of the countless times I felt lost and frustrated. For years, I'd been struggling to understand why my brain seemed to work differently. After persistent requests, my psychologist finally referred me to a psychiatrist for an ADHD evaluation. The wait had been agonizing, but I was hopeful that I was one step closer to understanding myself. As an adult, it's daunting to consider that you might have ADHD, but the uncertainty was starting to take a toll. I'm relieved to have finally taken the first step towards getting answers. My story is not unique, but it's mine, and I'm sharing it in the hopes that it resonates with others who may be on a similar path.
