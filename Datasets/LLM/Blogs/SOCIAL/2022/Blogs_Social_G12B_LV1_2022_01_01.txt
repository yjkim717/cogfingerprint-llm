## Seriously, Where's the England Flag? (Rocket League Rant)

Okay, so I've been properly hooked on Rocket League again lately. It's just *so* satisfying, right? And then they dropped the Nike collaboration with the country decals… and I’m a bit baffled. Everyone’s rocking their USA, French, or German flags. Gorgeous designs, I’ll admit. But where’s the love for England? 

I was genuinely expecting an England flag decal, especially with the Commonwealth Games happening in Birmingham this summer. It felt like a missed opportunity. It's more than just wanting a cool car – it’s about representing your country, you know? It’s a small thing, but it adds to the community feel.  Maybe next time, Psyonix! Until then, I'll just be over here, slightly disappointed and still boosting like crazy. #RocketLeague #Nike #England #FlagDecals #CommonwealthGames2022
