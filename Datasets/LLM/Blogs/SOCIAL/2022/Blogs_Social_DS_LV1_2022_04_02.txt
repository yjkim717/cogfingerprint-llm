### The Grit in the Gears: When Your Fantasy World Feels Too Real

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2022, when the real world felt like it was spinning a little too fast, I found my escape in building worlds where the problems were… bigger. Literally. My niche became roleplaying as giants—not the friendly, fairy-tale kind, but the ones trapped in a world not built for them, simmering with angst and a deep-seated distrust for the smaller beings who either feared or sought to control them.

The stories we crafted were always about escape. Breaking out of a corporate lab, fleeing a kingdom that saw you as a weapon. And it hit me one night, mid-scene: we weren’t just writing fantasy. We were projecting. That feeling of being too large for your circumstances, of your every move being watched and judged, of desperately wanting to break free from a system that feels like a cage… it was all a little too familiar. Our giants were just metaphors for the parts of ourselves that felt too big, too awkward, and too powerful for the boxes life tries to put us in. It was never just a game; it was therapy with a fantasy skin.
