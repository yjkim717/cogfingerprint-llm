## My Cat's Gone Chatty (And a Little Cheeky!)

Okay, fellow pet parents, I need to vent – and maybe get some advice! My usually quiet cat, Luna, has become a little… dramatic. She just finished going through her heat cycle, and now she's *talking*. Like, a lot. And not just the polite little “hello” meow. We’re talking full-blown howling sessions and playful (but persistent!) nipping at my ankles.

It’s a little baffling. She’s eating normally, playing like usual, everything seems fine physically. But the vocalizations! It's definitely new behavior. Anyone else experienced this post-heat craziness? I’m hoping it's just a hormonal blip, but it's certainly keeping me on my toes in this crazy year of 2022! Send help (and maybe earplugs!).
