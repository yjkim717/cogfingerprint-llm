It’s 2022, and my inbox has become a digital echo chamber. Working from home, I used to crave that little “ping”—a sign of connection in my quiet apartment. Now? My screen lights up like a slot machine every time someone hits “reply-all” just to say “got it” or “thanks.”

I get it; we want to be polite, to show we’re engaged. But each of those well-meaning replies pulls my focus away, turning a simple department update into a tidal wave of notifications. It’s not just about efficiency—it’s about preserving our collective sanity.

So I’m wondering: what if we saved “reply-all” for when it truly matters? Maybe then our virtual water cooler could feel less like a firehose and more like the supportive space we all need.
