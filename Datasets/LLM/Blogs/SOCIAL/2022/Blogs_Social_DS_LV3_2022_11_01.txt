The diagnosis was just the beginning. In 2022, I was told I had melanoma, and my world shrank to doctor's appointments and treatment plans. I had insurance, so I thought I was prepared. I was wrong.

The co-pays, the specialist fees, the medications not fully covered—it was a financial hemorrhage. I watched my life’s savings, the safety net I’d so carefully built, dissolve before my eyes. The stress became a constant, heavy companion, rivaling the fear of the disease itself. You plan for many things in life, but no one prepares you for the sheer cost of survival. It’s a battle fought on two fronts: one against the illness, and another against the crushing weight of medical bills.
