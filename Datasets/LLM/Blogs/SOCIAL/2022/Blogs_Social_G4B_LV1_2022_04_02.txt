**The Loneliness of Epic Scale**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Scrolling through Reddit in 2022, searching for *something*. I found myself fixated on a thread about fantasy roleplay – specifically, stories built around giants. Not the cuddly, benevolent kind, but towering figures steeped in ancient grudges and devastating conflict. 

I wanted to build a world, a story, a *feeling* of immense scale. But the more I searched, the more I realized it felt… lonely.  Like broadcasting a desire for a truly epic, angsty tale into a void.  It’s easy to find fluff, easy to find sunshine.  But connecting with someone who wants to genuinely explore that darkness, that vulnerability beneath the layers of fantasy? That felt impossible.  Maybe I need to lower the stakes, or just accept that some stories are best kept within my own head.
