## The Slow Burn of Just *Being* Heard

It’s taken a long time, honestly. Years of feeling…off. Like I was perpetually running a few steps behind everyone else, constantly misreading social cues, and battling a brain that felt like a browser with a million tabs open. I'd mentioned it to my therapist a *lot* – the constant overwhelm, the difficulty focusing, the feeling of always being “on” but never quite *present*.

For a while, the response was largely supportive but focused on coping mechanisms. Which, don’t get me wrong, were helpful. But they didn't quite scratch the itch. Then, last fall (2022), something shifted. My psychologist gently suggested I speak with a psychiatrist who might consider an ADHD evaluation. 

It felt like a tiny crack of light in a long tunnel. Finally, someone was suggesting a deeper dive, rather than just managing the symptoms. It's still early days, but just *being* taken seriously feels… validating. Maybe, just maybe, understanding what’s going on is the first step towards truly thriving.
