**The Unexpected Hum of Connection**

Remember last year? I was completely absorbed in building a new PC – a Ryzen 5 3600x, really trying to dial down the noise after a clumsy repositioning. It was oddly meditative, focusing on the details, just like tweaking my social media settings. 

But the whole thing made me think about connection. We chase louder, brighter online experiences, constantly upgrading our feeds, searching for that perfect ‘cool’ cooler, right?  Yet, sometimes the biggest issues arise when we’re not listening – when the subtle hum of genuine interaction gets drowned out by the flashy notifications. 

Just like that PC fan, I realized I was prioritizing volume over substance.  Maybe it’s time to adjust, to find a quieter, more reliable way to connect, to truly *hear* what’s being said.
