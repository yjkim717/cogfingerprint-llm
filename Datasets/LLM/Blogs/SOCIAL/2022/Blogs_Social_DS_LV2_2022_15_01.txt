### The Cone, The Stitches, and Me: A Lesson in Patience

Remember that frantic feeling in 2022, scrolling through pet forums at 2 AM? That was me. My new kitten, Luna, was two weeks post-spay, and her incision just didn’t look right. I was convinced I’d failed her.

The vet had said healing takes 10-14 days, but here we were, and the site was still pink and slightly puffy. I was obsessed, checking it every hour, dreading the moment I had to wrestle the dreaded “cone of shame” back on her wriggling body. Every time she licked, my heart sank. Was I being an overbearing “cat parent”?

When we finally went for her stitch removal, the vet smiled. “It’s healing perfectly,” she said. “You just have to trust the process.”

That was the real lesson. In our hyper-vigilant world, we’ve forgotten that some things—like healing—simply need time and gentle care, not constant interference. Luna taught me to ease up, to trust her body’s wisdom, and that sometimes, the best thing you can do is just be patiently, quietly present. The cone, it turns out, was for my anxiety as much as her stitches.
