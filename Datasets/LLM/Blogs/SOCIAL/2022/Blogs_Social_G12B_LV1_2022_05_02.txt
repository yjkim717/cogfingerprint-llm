## That Time My Brother Almost Lost $5,000 (and a Lesson in Online Vigilance)

Seriously, you guys, I need to share this. My brother nearly got caught in a *wild* scam just last month. It started with a Venmo payment â€“ a whopping $5,000, supposedly from eBay to cover a sale. He was thrilled, then confused, then *really* worried when a guy with a thick Indian accent started calling, pressuring him to send the money elsewhere immediately. 

Turns out, it was a sophisticated phishing attempt, likely linked to eBay somehow. Thankfully, he remembered my constant nagging about being careful online and called eBay directly. They confirmed it was a fake. 

It's scary how convincing these things can be, especially when money is involved. This whole ordeal really hammered home the importance of double-checking *everything*, even when it seems legitimate, and especially when someone's pushing you for a quick decision. Seriously, 2022 has proven to be a year where you just can't be too careful online!
