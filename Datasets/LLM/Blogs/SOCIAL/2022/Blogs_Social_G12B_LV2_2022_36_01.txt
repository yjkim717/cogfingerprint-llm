## Where's Jane's Tote? A *Six* Merch Mystery

Okay, fellow *Six* obsessives, let's talk merch. I was browsing the online store the other day, stocking up on Queenly goodies, and something felt…off. All the queens were represented – Anne, Catherine, Elizabeth, Mary, and even Katherine Howard had their own tote bags! But Jane Seymour? Nowhere. 

It got me thinking. Why the Jane-shaped hole in the collection? Was it a licensing thing? A creative choice? It just feels like a missed opportunity to celebrate a quiet, yet powerful queen. Anyone else notice this and have theories? Let's discuss!
