### The High Cost of Hype

Remember the Overwatch 2 beta hype in 2022? I sure do. I was one of the first in line, happily dropping $40 on that Watchpoint Pack. It wasn't just a preorder; it felt like buying a ticket to an exclusive party. For a few weeks, it was great—new maps, a fresh hero. Then, the beta just… ended. No fanfare, no "thanks for testing," just radio silence from Blizzard.

It felt like the digital equivalent of showing up to a concert to find the venue dark and locked. That $40 didn't just buy me early access; it bought a hefty dose of disillusionment. It’s a stark reminder of how one-sided these relationships can feel. We, the players, invest our money and passion, while corporations often see us as just another data point.

It’s made me more cautious. Now, before I buy into the next big hype train, I ask myself: am I supporting a game, or just funding a marketing strategy? The line has definitely blurred.
