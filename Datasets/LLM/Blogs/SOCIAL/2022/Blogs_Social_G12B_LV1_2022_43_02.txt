## The Unexpected Holiday Hustle

It's December 2022, and the online marketplaces are buzzing. I recently listed a brand-new, sealed EVGA RTX 3080 Ti – a bit of an impulse buy earlier in the year that never quite got used. Seeing the demand, and the prices still inflated, felt… strange. Part of me wants to just hold onto it, but the thought of making someone’s Christmas, especially a serious gamer, is a nice feeling. Maybe a little hardware happiness is the perfect gift this year.
