## The Problem with "Things Will Get Better" (When You're Knee-Deep in the Struggle)

Remember when everyone was saying "2022 was going to be *the* year?"  The year we bounced back. The year we shook off the pandemic fog. The year… well, the year things would *finally* get better.

And honestly? It’s felt a lot like a continuation of the same struggle, just with a higher price tag on everything. Inflation hitting hard, the news cycle constantly churning out anxiety-inducing headlines, and that persistent feeling of… just *exhaustion*.  I know I'm not alone in feeling it.

I've always been a hopeful person. I genuinely *want* to believe that things will get better. But lately, I’ve been wrestling with a phrase I've heard echoing throughout my life: "Things will get better." 

It started young, really. A childhood marked by instability. Promises of a better future that never quite materialized. Then, navigating the adult world – the soul-crushing reality of minimum wage jobs, the slow, relentless climb out of debt, the constant juggling act of just *surviving*. Each time I faced a setback, someone, often with the best of intentions, would offer that little nugget of reassurance.

And I appreciated it, I really did. In the moment. But over time, it started to feel… hollow. Like a well-worn phrase offered without genuine understanding of the weight I was carrying.

It’s not that I *don't* want things to get better. It’s that the constant repetition of the phrase, without any tangible action or support, can feel incredibly invalidating. It can feel like your struggles are being brushed aside, minimized, or even dismissed.

This year, especially, it's felt particularly grating. We’re all tired. We've all been through so much. Telling someone facing financial hardship, or battling burnout from working multiple jobs just to stay afloat, that "things will get better" feels… insufficient.  It’s like telling someone drowning to simply “breathe.”

I'm realizing that hope isn't a passive thing. It's not just a mantra to repeat until things magically improve. It’s an active process. It's about taking small steps, seeking out support, and building resilience, even when it feels like you have nothing left to give.

It’s about acknowledging the difficulty of the present, instead of glossing over it with platitudes. It's about validating the real, raw pain of struggling.

Maybe instead of saying "Things will get better," we could try saying, "This is hard. I see that. And I'm here for you." Or, "What can I do to help *right now*?"

Because true hope isn't about ignoring the darkness; it’s about finding the strength to
