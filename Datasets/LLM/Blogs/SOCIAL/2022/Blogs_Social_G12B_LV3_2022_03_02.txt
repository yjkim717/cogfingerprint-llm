## The Shiny Charm and a Little Bit of Hope

It’s wild to think Pokemon Go is still a thing in 2022, isn't it? I remember the initial craze, the downtown chaos, the sheer joy of battling in parks. Lately, though, Niantic’s decisions have left me… frustrated, to say the least. Constant changes, events that feel designed more for spending money than fun – it’s a lot.

But then I look at my kid, eyes glued to their phone, genuinely *excited* about a raid, beaming when they hatch a new Pokemon. And last night? We caught a shiny. A *shiny*! The shared squeal of delight, the high-five – it was pure, unadulterated joy. Suddenly, all the gripes about Niantic faded away. It’s a little window into my own childhood nostalgia, and a beautiful connection with my child. Maybe there's still some magic left in this game after all.
