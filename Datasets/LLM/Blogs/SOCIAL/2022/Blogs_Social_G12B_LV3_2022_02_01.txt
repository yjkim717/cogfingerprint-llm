## Did Anyone Else Notice This?! (Futurama & the Power of Detail)

Okay, internet, I’m officially spiraling in the best way possible. A Reddit thread blew my mind – apparently, there's a *potential* Easter egg in Futurama where Cubert seems to say "poop" instead of "brains"! Seriously?! It's a tiny detail, easily missed, but it speaks volumes about the show's brilliance and how we, as viewers, constantly search for hidden meanings. It's a reminder that even in the silliest animation, there’s always something new to discover. Anyone else catching this in rewatches?
