**The Weight of a Shared Secret**

2022 felt… heavy, didn't it? Like everyone was carrying something unspoken. I found myself thinking a lot about friendship lately, and specifically, the kind of burden it can become. 

I remember a friend, Sarah, who was brilliant and beautiful, but whose world was often a chaotic storm of anxiety and intense emotions – a struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder, as I later learned. We were incredibly close, and then… things spiraled. Hurtful words, broken promises, a constant feeling of walking on eggshells. 

It culminated in a terrifying night, a dark space where I realized I had to make a heart-wrenching decision.  Do I try to salvage what we had, knowing it might lead to more pain? Or do I protect my own mental health and step away? 

The guilt was immense. The fear, paralyzing. Trust, once a cornerstone of our bond, felt shattered.  It’s a messy, complicated truth – sometimes, even the deepest friendships can’t withstand the weight of someone else’s struggle, and that doesn't make you a bad friend. It just makes you human.
