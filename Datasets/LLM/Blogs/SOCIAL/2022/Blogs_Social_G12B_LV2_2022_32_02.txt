**Title: The Juggling Act: Will My Coffee & Groceries Experience Matter?**

Okay, real talk. I had an interview recently – a *really* good interview, actually – at Wegmans. And I'm already overthinking everything, as usual. It got me thinking about career paths and how seemingly unrelated jobs can actually build something valuable.

See, before this, I was slinging lattes at Starbucks. And before *that*? I spent a couple of years working in the produce section at Albertsons. Totally different vibes, right? Coffee culture versus grocery store hustle.

But here's the thing: both taught me so much about customer service, working under pressure, and being part of a team. I’m wondering if mentioning both experiences in my follow-up email will help or hurt my chances. Will they see it as a lack of focus, or a testament to my adaptability? 

Anyone else ever felt like their work history was a bit… scattered? I’d love to hear your stories! It's comforting to know I'm not alone in this career-questioning journey. #jobsearch #careerthoughts #wegmans #starbucks #albertsons #worklife
