You just never know when karma’s coming in The Sims. I spent a whole afternoon plotting sweet revenge on Eliza Pancakes in Willow Creek, setting up the Extreme Violence mod for the perfect autonomous takedown. But the second I looked away? She turned the tables and obliterated my Sim instead.

It’s funny—even in a game, that instant payback felt eerily personal. Maybe 2022’s lesson is this: whether virtual or real, never underestimate the quiet ones. They’re often the most dangerous when provoked.
