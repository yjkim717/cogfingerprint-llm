As I filled up my water bottle from the storage tank, I couldn't help but wonder: what happens when I run my RO unit beyond its storage capacity? I've been using it to purify water for my family, but I've heard mixed opinions about overfilling the tank. Does it affect the water quality? I decided to dig in and find out.

In 2022, with the increasing awareness about water conservation and purification, I was curious to know if my trusty RO unit was doing more harm than good. Reverse osmosis is known to remove impurities and reduce TDS (Total Dissolved Solids) in water, but what happens when the storage tank is overfilled? After some research, I discovered that running the RO unit beyond its capacity can lead to stagnant water, which can re-contaminate the purified water. Who knew? Now, I'm more mindful of my water usage and make sure to empty the tank regularly. It's a simple habit that gives me peace of mind and ensures my family drinks clean, safe water.
