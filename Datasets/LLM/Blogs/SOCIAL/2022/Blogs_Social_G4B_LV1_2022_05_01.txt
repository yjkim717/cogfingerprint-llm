**The Echo Chamber of “Got It?”**

Remember those endless “reply-all” email chains? Seriously, they felt like digital ghosts, haunting my inbox in 2022. I was working from home, trying to actually *do* work, and suddenly I’d be bombarded with a hundred “Got it!” responses to something utterly trivial. 

It got me thinking – is it ever okay to just acknowledge something without actually engaging? I started questioning the whole department procedure around notifications. Was I being overly sensitive, or was it just… exhausting? 

I even hesitated to bring it up with my manager, worried it would be framed as a problem with *me*.  It’s a weird feeling, wanting to push back on a system that’s supposed to make things easier.  Maybe a little quiet resistance is sometimes the best response.
