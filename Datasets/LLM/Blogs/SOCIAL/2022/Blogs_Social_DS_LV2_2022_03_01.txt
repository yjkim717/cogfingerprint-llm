There’s something magical about the chaos of Christmas morning, especially when Bluey-inspired traditions take over. This year, our kids woke us at dawn for "Veranda Santa"—a hilarious, veggie-tossing frenzy in the front yard. In that sleep-deprived, giggle-filled moment, I realized: it’s not about perfect gifts or quiet mornings. It’s these messy, joyful connections that truly matter. Who knew a cartoon could redefine our holiday spirit and remind us what parenting is all about?
