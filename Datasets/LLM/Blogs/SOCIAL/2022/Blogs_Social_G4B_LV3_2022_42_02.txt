**The Walmart Dream, and the Reality Check**

It feels like just yesterday I was buzzing about finally landing a job at Walmart – a real step up, a chance to build something. But 2022 threw me a curveball. Suddenly, the paperwork felt endless, a mountain of forms demanding everything from birth certificates to proof of address. And then there were the healthcare costs… a surprising, hefty chunk I hadn't budgeted for. 

It wasn't just the money, though. It was the frustration of feeling like I was constantly chasing something, proving my identity, and battling unexpected hurdles. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the things we *want* don’t automatically come with a clear path.  Anyone else feel this way lately?
