**Finding Space to Just *Be* – Thanks, Rick Riordan**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 felt like a year of constant pressure, right?  We were all trying to do *everything*, and it’s exhausting. But lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about representation, particularly when it comes to women and how we’re often told to manage our experiences. 

That’s why I was so genuinely thrilled by Rick Riordan’s new book. Seeing a teenage girl authentically grapple with leadership *and* menstruation – without it feeling like a side note or something to be ashamed of – was a huge relief. It’s so vital to have stories that acknowledge the full spectrum of a woman’s life, the messy, the powerful, and everything in between. 

It reminded me that sometimes, simply being seen – truly seen – is a revolutionary act.
