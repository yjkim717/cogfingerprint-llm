## The Ghosts of Cinema Past – And a Mystery!

Something fascinating popped up on Reddit the other day. Someone's trying to track down a lost British film from the late 60s/early 70s – a real cinematic echo of films like 'Don't Look Now' and 'A Clockwork Orange.' Apparently, it starred a young poet and had a striking red, white, and black poster. 

It got me thinking about how powerfully film can haunt us, these forgotten gems influencing later works without us even realizing it. It's a reminder that so much creative history lies just beneath the surface, waiting to be rediscovered. Anyone out there have a clue?
