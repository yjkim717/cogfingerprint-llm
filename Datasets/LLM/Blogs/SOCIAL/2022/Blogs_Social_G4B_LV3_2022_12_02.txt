**The Quiet Shift: When Social Feels…Off**

Remember 2022? We were all cautiously emerging from lockdown, trying to rebuild those connections we’d missed. Social media felt *urgent* – a constant stream of updates, a pressure to be ‘on.’ But lately, I’ve noticed something subtle, a quiet shift in my own experience. 

It's like observing a cat after a long heat – a sudden, noticeable change. My interactions feel…forced, almost. I’m posting, commenting, liking, but it's not sparking the same joy. It’s a little like my cat after she’s finished being in heat – a bit anxious, a bit withdrawn. 

I’m realizing that sometimes, the most authentic connection isn’t found in the scroll, but in a genuine, offline moment. Maybe it’s time to step back, breathe, and reconnect with *myself* before diving back into the social current.
