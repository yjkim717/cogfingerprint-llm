>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided summary and instructions. I've aimed for a conversational, reflective tone, and included a bit of personal connection.  I've also included a suggested title.

**Title: Finally, a Heroine Who Bleeds (and Leads!)**

Okay, I’ll admit it: I've been devouring everything Rick Riordan has written since *Percy Jackson* first splashed onto the scene. But his latest, *Daughter of the Deep*, has genuinely struck a chord. It’s not just another thrilling adventure (though it *is* thrilling!). It's the way he handles Maisie, the protagonist, that’s really resonating with me.

Specifically, the portrayal of her experiencing menstruation while navigating a dangerous quest felt… revolutionary. So many young female characters in fantasy are presented as either flawlessly strong or burdened by their cycles. Riordan just *shows* it. It's a normal part of her life, acknowledged, and doesn't derail her leadership or her bravery.

As someone who grew up reading stories where periods were either a source of shame or a plot device, seeing this handled with such normalcy is genuinely refreshing. It's a small thing, maybe, but it speaks volumes about how far we’ve come in representing young women, and I’m so glad to see it in a genre I love.

**Notes and Considerations:**

*   **Social Context (2022):** In 2022, there was a growing awareness and discussion around representation of periods in media, so this post aligns with that zeitgeist.
*   **Relatability:** I included a personal connection ("As someone who grew up...") to make it more engaging.
*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Okay, I'll admit" and "It's a small thing, maybe" to create a more relaxed feel.
*   **Keywords:** The keywords are naturally woven into the text.
