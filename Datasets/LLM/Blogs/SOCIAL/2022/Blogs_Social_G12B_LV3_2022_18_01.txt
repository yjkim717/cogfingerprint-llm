## The Mimic's Ascent: My Kenku Monk and the Quest for Flight

Okay, so I’m diving into a new D&D campaign, and I'm *thrilled*. I’m playing a Kenku Monk – a feathered thief with a penchant for mimicking sounds – and the dream? Flight. Specifically, achieving it through the Monk's subclass. It feels wonderfully thematic, right? A creature defined by imitation, finally aspiring to something beyond what it’s naturally given.

But here’s the thing: that early-level grind is *real*. Those first few levels feel incredibly limited. It’s a bit frustrating watching my Kenku struggle when I know the potential is there. Still, it's a nice challenge, a reminder that growth in D&D (and, honestly, in life!) isn’t always instant. Hoping for some serious aerial acrobatics down the road! Anyone else ever felt that early-level struggle with a character build?
