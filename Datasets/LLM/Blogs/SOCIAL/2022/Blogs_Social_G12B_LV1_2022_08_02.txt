>## The Silent Panic of a Cat (and a Human)

It's strange how easily anxiety can transfer. Last week, my cat, Leo, started dry heaving. Just… *retching* without anything actually coming up. My heart leaped into my throat. Google searches led me down a rabbit hole of hairballs, potential obstructions, and worst-case scenarios. 

It felt ridiculous, this level of panic over a cat. But seeing him distressed, feeling that helpless worry... it mirrored the quiet anxiety I’ve been carrying around about, well, everything, lately. 2022 has been a year, hasn’t it?  A vet visit and some calming words later, Leo's doing better. And maybe, just maybe, so am I.
