## One Eye Shut, Just Trying to Breathe

It's a weird habit, I know. But sometimes, especially in crowded places – a bustling farmer's market, a packed concert, even just a busy coffee shop – I find myself closing one eye. It sounds odd, but it’s a coping mechanism I developed years ago to deal with sensory overload. 

2022 has been... a lot. And the constant visual stimulus, the noise, the sheer *volume* of everything, can trigger a low-level anxiety. Shutting one eye somehow filters it all, narrows my focus. It's a small, silly thing, but it helps me ground myself and just... breathe. Anyone else have their own little quirks to navigate the world?
