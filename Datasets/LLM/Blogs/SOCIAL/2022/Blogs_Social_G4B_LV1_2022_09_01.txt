**Scrolling Through a Feeling**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 was *a year* for social media, wasn’t it? I spent way too much time scrolling, and I’m not even ashamed to admit it. It started with genuine connection – seeing friends’ adventures, sharing silly memes, and feeling a little less alone. But then… it shifted. 

I found myself comparing my ‘highlight reel’ to everyone else’s, feeling this low-level hum of inadequacy.  It’s weird, right? We curate these perfect online versions of ourselves, and it’s exhausting. 

Recently, I started consciously logging off. I replaced a few mindless scrolls with actually *doing* things – fixing an angle stop valve in the bathroom (thanks, Dad’s blog post!), and even just sitting with a cup of tea.  It’s a slow process, but I’m realizing that true connection isn’t found in a like or a comment, but in the quiet moments of real life.  Anyone else feeling this?
