At Go Fest, I grumbled about Niantic’s latest “feature” while hunting a shiny Axew. Then I saw it: a pack of kids nearby, absolutely losing their minds over a common Pidgey. Their pure, unbridled joy was a gut punch. We adults get so wrapped up in the grind and the shiny odds, we forget the magic that hooked us in 2016. Sometimes, the most valuable event spawn isn't a rare Pokémon, but a much-needed perspective check. The kids, it turns out, are still playing the real game.
