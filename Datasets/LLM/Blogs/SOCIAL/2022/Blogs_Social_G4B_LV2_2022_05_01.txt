**The Echo Chamber of ‘Got It!’**

Anyone else feel like 2022 was *the* year of the automated “Got it!” notification? Seriously, my department seemed to be drowning in them. It started as a quick acknowledgement, but quickly morphed into a relentless barrage – especially with ‘reply-all’ emails. 

I found myself obsessively clicking “Got it!” just to silence the little pings, a weird, passive-aggressive dance with my inbox. It felt…empty. Like I was validating everything without actually *doing* anything. 

Recently, I started noticing how much this constant stream of digital affirmation actually stifled genuine department communication.  It felt like we were prioritizing speed over substance and honestly, it was impacting my manager’s feedback – making it harder to have real conversations. 

I’m trying to be more mindful about how I respond, focusing on thoughtful engagement instead.  Anyone else battling this digital echo chamber?
