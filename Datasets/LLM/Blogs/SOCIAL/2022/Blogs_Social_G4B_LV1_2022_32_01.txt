**Scrolling Through a Filtered World**

Okay, real talk. 2022 felt… exhausting sometimes. Partly because of the constant scroll, you know? Instagram, TikTok – it’s a highlight reel of everyone else’s “perfect” lives, and it’s brutal for someone already battling a messy inner world. 

I’ve spent a lot of time lately just feeling this deep, persistent self-consciousness. It’s weird, because I *know* most of what I see online isn’t real. But it still seeps in, whispering about weight loss and how I don’t measure up. 

It’s a legacy of stuff from childhood, honestly – a lot of critical voices and a feeling of never quite being enough. And then, layered on top of that, just the casual, sometimes not-so-casual, harassment I’ve experienced online. It’s fueled a pretty serious case of social anxiety, making even leaving the house feel like a huge hurdle. 

I'm slowly learning to build my own positive reflection, one that isn’t based on likes or filters. It's a process, definitely.
