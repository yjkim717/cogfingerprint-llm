It’s 2022, and I’m deep into my third year of working from home. You’d think I’d have the whole remote communication thing down by now, but there’s one habit my team just can’t shake: the dreaded reply-all.

Every time a department-wide email goes out, my inbox pings with a chorus of “Thanks!” and “Got it!” from colleagues. Individually, it’s polite. Collectively, it’s digital noise, drowning out what actually matters.

I started wondering: are we replying to be helpful, or just to be seen? In a remote world, maybe that “acknowledgement” is our way of waving from behind the screen, a small social signal that says, “I’m here.” But at what cost? All these notifications create a strange tension between staying connected and staying focused. I’m not sure what the right etiquette is anymore, but I know my sanity could use fewer pings and more meaningful exchanges.
