**Pokémon Go & The Unexpected Joys**

Okay, let's be honest, 2022 felt like a year of frustrating updates from Niantic. Seriously, the Go Fest chaos? Ugh. But amidst all the gripes, I rediscovered why I fell in love with Pokémon Go in the first place. 

My little Leo – he’s seven – was absolutely *ecstatic* when we finally snagged a shiny Axew. Seeing his face light up was pure magic. It reminded me that this game, despite the occasional corporate stumble, still holds a genuine spark of joy.  It’s a shared experience, whether you’re a kid buzzing with excitement or an adult just trying to keep up.  Maybe that’s the real power of Pokémon Go, isn’t it?
