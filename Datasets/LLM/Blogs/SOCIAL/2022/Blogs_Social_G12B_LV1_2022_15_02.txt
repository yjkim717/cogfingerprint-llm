Okay, here's a blog post inspired by the Runescape wilderness/PvP theme, framed as a reflective piece on social anxieties and online spaces, aiming for a conversational tone and a ~173 word count, set in 2022.

## The Phantom Threat of the Opt-Out

It's funny the things that trigger a weird kind of anxiety these days. I was playing Runescape the other night – yeah, I know, a little embarrassing – and got thinking about the Wilderness. For those unfamiliar, it’s this lawless zone where PvP is *forced*. You can try to opt-out, but there’s always this unsettling feeling you’re vulnerable.

And it hit me: doesn’t that feel a bit like social media?

We curate these online personas, meticulously crafting what we show the world. We "opt-out" of drama, of negativity, of truly raw vulnerability. But the potential for a sudden, unexpected clash – a harsh comment, a misunderstanding blown out of proportion – it’s *always* there.

It’s exhausting, this constant low-level alertness. You’re trying to enjoy the scenery (the memes, the connections) but perpetually scanning for the lurking predator. Maybe I’m just projecting, but the Wilderness felt like a pretty apt metaphor for navigating the digital world in 2022. Anyone else feel that way?
