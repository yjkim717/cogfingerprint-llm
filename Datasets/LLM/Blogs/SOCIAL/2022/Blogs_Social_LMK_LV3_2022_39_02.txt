As I dove back into Monster Hunter Rise on PC, I found myself missing the control settings I had mastered on my Switch. Synchronizing the controls between platforms proved to be a challenge. I realized I'm not alone in this struggle. Many gamers face compatibility issues when switching between PC and console. Finding the right controller settings can make or break the gaming experience, highlighting the need for better cross-platform compatibility in 2022.
