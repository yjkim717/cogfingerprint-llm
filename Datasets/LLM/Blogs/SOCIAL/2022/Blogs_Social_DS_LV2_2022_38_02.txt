It’s 2022, and I’m scrolling through Reddit late one night, falling down a rabbit hole about Chapter 11 bankruptcies. Someone’s pitching this wild idea: buy a bunch of these beaten-down stocks, pennies on the dollar, and just wait for a miracle.

Honestly, it feels like a metaphor for my own year—hoping for turnarounds in so many parts of life. We’ve all been through the wringer, haven’t we? And here we are, still betting on second chances, in the market and in ourselves.

But as I stare at the screen, I wonder: is this investing, or just another form of wishing? Maybe it’s both. Sometimes, the biggest risk is believing things can get better.
