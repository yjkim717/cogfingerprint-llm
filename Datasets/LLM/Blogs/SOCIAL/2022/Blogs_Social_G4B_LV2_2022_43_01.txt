**The Echo in the Hallway**

Remember those long hallways in our schools? Sunlight streaming through the windows, bending and scattering as it hit the walls? It made me think about light refraction – how it changes direction. It’s a strange, subtle thing, isn’t it? 

Lately, I’ve been feeling a bit like that light, bouncing around in the digital hallway of social media. So much *reflection* of other people’s lives, so much striving for a perfect image.  It’s easy to get caught up in the brightness, but sometimes, like that sunlight over a long distance, it just fades. 

I’m trying to focus on my own path, letting go of the need to perfectly mirror what I think others want to see. It’s a work in progress, but finding my own true light feels…essential.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps create a post focused on a different theme?
