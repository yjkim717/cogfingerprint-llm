## The Line Between Inspiration and… Something Else?

Okay, so I’ve been *really* deep in photobashing lately – layering textures and details from various sources to build up my digital paintings. It's a game-changer for speed and realism. But something’s been nagging at me. I stumbled across Shotdeck recently, a site packed with movie screenshots, and it got me thinking about the ethics of it all.

Suddenly, “artist referencing” felt…complicated. Is using these readily available images fair use? These sites *monetize* them, which feels like another layer of the question. I’m not ripping off anyone's *art*, but am I still skirting too close to the line? 

It's a murky area, and honestly, it’s a conversation the digital art community needs to have. Maybe I’ll be experimenting with more original textures, just to be safe. What are your thoughts on this? Let me know in the comments!
