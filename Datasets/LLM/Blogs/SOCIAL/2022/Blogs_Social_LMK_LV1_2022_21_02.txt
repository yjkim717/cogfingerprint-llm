As I dove back into Risk of Rain 2 in 2022, I couldn't shake off the feeling that Void Fields was more of a hurdle than a challenge. The damage over time effect it inflicts feels oppressive, especially when paired with the already intense time pressure to escape. It's like the game is piling on the stress without giving me a chance to catch my breath. I find myself frantically grabbing for any healing items I can get, but they often feel like a temporary fix. The Void Fields mechanic, while intriguing in theory, ends up feeling punishing rather than engaging. It's a shame, because I love the thrill of exploring new areas and facing tough enemies. But Void Fields just makes me feel like I'm being worn down, rather than being tested. Maybe I'm just not playing it right, but for now, it's a gameplay mechanic that feels more frustrating than fun.
