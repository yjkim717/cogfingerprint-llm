It’s funny how a simple question about my reef tank’s RO filter spiraled into a bigger life lesson this week. A fellow hobbyist asked if pushing our water filters beyond their designed capacity was a smart move.

Staring at the hoses and canisters, I didn't just see a water purification system. I saw a metaphor for 2022. We’ve all been running non-stop, trying to stretch ourselves thin, filtering out the endless noise of bad news and digital chatter. But just like that RO unit, our own efficiency plummets when we’re overworked. The system—and we—need a moment to recharge and reset.

It was a potent reminder that respecting our own limits isn’t a failure; it’s what keeps the water—and our well-being—truly clean.
