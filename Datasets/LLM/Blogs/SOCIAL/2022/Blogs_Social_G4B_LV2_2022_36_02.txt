**Scrolling & Soul-Searching: Finding Connection in 2022**

Let’s be honest, 2022 felt… a lot. Between the constant stream of social media and the lingering feeling of needing to *do* something, it’s easy to get lost in the digital echo chamber. I found myself scrolling endlessly, comparing my life to carefully curated highlight reels. 

Recently, I realized I was missing the point. Real connection isn’t about likes or comments; it’s about a genuine conversation, a shared laugh, a listening ear. It reminded me of those old *Circle of Magic* books – simple stories that transported you to another world, focusing on the characters’ relationships. 

This year, I’ve made a conscious effort to put down my phone and actually *be* present with the people I care about. Small things, really – a coffee date, a phone call, a handwritten note. It’s a quiet revolution, but it feels profoundly right.
