It was one of those late-night conversations that starts with a random thought and ends somewhere profound. My partner and I were debating whether light loses its brightness when bouncing between perfect mirrors forever. It got me thinking—aren’t our relationships a bit like that?

In 2022, with so much noise and distance between us, it’s easy to feel like our connections dim over time. But maybe, like light in a perfect mirror, the energy doesn’t have to fade. It’s the small, intentional reflections—checking in, listening, showing up—that keep the brightness alive.

So here’s to being better mirrors for each other, keeping the light bouncing, strong and steady, no matter the distance.
