**Lost in the Music, Found in Feeling**

2022 felt… a lot. Scrolling endlessly, comparing, reacting. It was exhausting. Then I rediscovered opera. Specifically, plunging into the darkness of ‘Don Giovanni.’ There’s something profoundly cathartic about witnessing such intense drama unfold. It’s not just entertainment; it’s a release. A chance to feel the full weight of human emotion – joy, sorrow, rage – without judgment.  It reminded me that sometimes, getting lost in a powerful story can help you find yourself again.
