## The Weight of Unheard Concerns

It’s a strange feeling, watching someone you love struggle with something you can’t even *sense*. My dad’s been complaining about a constant ringing in his ears – tinnitus, the doctor called it – and a general feeling that things just aren't as clear as they used to be. Simple conversations are becoming a challenge, and the frustration is building.

We finally managed to get an appointment with an ENT specialist, and honestly, it left me feeling worse. The consultation felt rushed, dismissive almost. A quick look, a few mumbled suggestions about white noise, and then we were ushered out. It felt like our concerns weren't truly *heard*.

It’s 2022, and we're constantly told about the importance of mental health, of advocating for ourselves. But what about advocating for a parent? It feels heavier, somehow. It’s made me realize how vital it is to find someone who not only has the medical expertise, but also the compassion to truly listen. The search continues.
