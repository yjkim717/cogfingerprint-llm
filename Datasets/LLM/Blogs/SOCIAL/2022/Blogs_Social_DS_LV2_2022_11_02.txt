It’s 2022, and I’m recovering from melanoma surgery, trying to focus on healing. Then the mail comes: MetLife denied my short-term disability claim. Seriously?

I thought insurance was a safety net, something to catch you when life throws the unexpected. Instead, I’m juggling medical bills and anxiety, feeling completely let down. It’s not just about the money—it’s the emotional blow when you’re already vulnerable.

Has anyone else felt this sting? It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, the system isn’t built with people in mind. Here’s to hoping for better days and real support when it matters most.
