It’s funny how hair tells its own story. When I started growing out my natural auburn color in 2022, I didn’t expect the ends to fade into this reddish-brown—like memories softening with time. I’ve been trying to protect it, not with dye, but with gentler routines, almost like guarding a piece of my past. It’s a quiet reminder that even what’s natural changes, and maybe that’s okay. Anyone else feel like their hair holds a little piece of their journey?
