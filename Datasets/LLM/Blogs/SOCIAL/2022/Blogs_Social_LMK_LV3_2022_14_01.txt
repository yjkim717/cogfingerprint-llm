"Witnessing the Ocarina of Time beta showcase speedrun was a thrill in 2022! The gaming community came together, showcasing incredible skill and entertainment. Watching the VOD, I was struck by the camaraderie and competitive spirit. It reminded me that gaming isn't just about playing - it's about shared experiences and community bonding. The event left me eager for the next showcase, and I'm grateful to be part of this vibrant gaming culture."
