**The Mirror Said "Okay," But My Brain Didn’t Listen**

It’s weird, right? Like, really weird. I spent most of 2022 battling this feeling that I was *too much*. Not in a good way, but in a way that made me question everything about my appearance. I’m a healthy weight, honestly – a normal weight – yet I was constantly fixated on how I looked in the mirror. 

I remember scrolling through social media, seeing everyone seemingly effortlessly confident, and feeling this sharp pang of self-consciousness.  Every comment, even a well-intentioned one, felt like a judgment.  It’s crazy how easily the internet can amplify those little voices of doubt. 

I realized I was wrestling with a distorted weight perception, fueled by comparison and a whole lot of self-doubt.  I even started wondering if there were genetic differences at play, making me more susceptible to these feelings. It's a reminder that our brains can trick us, and sometimes, the most important battle is the one within ourselves.
