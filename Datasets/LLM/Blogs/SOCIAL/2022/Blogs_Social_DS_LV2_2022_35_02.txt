### The Friend I Can't Unfriend

My phone buzzes. It’s a notification from an app I should probably delete. A name pops up—let’s call her Sam. My stomach does that familiar, unpleasant flip-flop.

We were close once, the kind of friends who shared everything. Then, a few years back, the texts changed. The funny memes were replaced by grainy, heartbreaking photos of self-harm. Her BPD and anxiety were screaming in a way I didn't know how to quiet. I felt terrified, helpless, and, if I'm honest, a little resentful that I was being handed a burden I wasn't trained to carry. The friendship frayed, and we drifted into silence.

Now, in 2022, her profile is a minefield of a different kind. The raw pain has been replaced by aggressive, offensive religious posts that target people like me. It’s a complete one-eighty.

And yet, my finger hovers over the "Unfriend" button. Why is this so hard?

I think it’s because unfriending her feels like I'm finally admitting I failed her back then. That I wasn't the anchor she needed. It feels like I'm closing a door on the person she was, the one who was suffering and reaching out in the only way she knew how.

But I’m learning that protecting my own mental health isn't a betrayal. It’s a necessity. The friend I knew is still in there, but the person posting now causes me real anxiety. Maybe the kindest thing I can do for both of us is to quietly let go, to wish her peace from a distance, and finally click that button. For me.
