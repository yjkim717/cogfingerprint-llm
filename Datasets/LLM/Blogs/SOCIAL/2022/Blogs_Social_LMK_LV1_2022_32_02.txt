"Switching Gears: Navigating a Job Interview While Already Employed"

As I sat down for my Wegmans interview in the spring of 2022, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nerves. I had been working at Starbucks for a while, and while I loved my team, I was eager for a change. But, as I began to chat with the interviewer, I started to worry about my employment history. Would my relatively short tenure at Starbucks raise some red flags? I had taken the job on a whim, and it had been a great fit, but I knew that job-hopping wasn't typically viewed as a desirable trait. I was upfront about my reasons for leaving and my desire for a new challenge, and to my surprise, the interviewer was understanding. It got me thinking - is it really that unusual to want to transfer jobs? And should our employment history define our worth as a candidate?
