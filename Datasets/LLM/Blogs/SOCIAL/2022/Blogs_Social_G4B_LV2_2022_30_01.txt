**The Quiet Ask on Reddit**

It’s funny how easily a simple question can pull you into a digital current. I was scrolling Reddit last month, noticing a golfer buzzing about a potential August Titleist hybrid release. Just a hopeful query, really – “Anyone else hearing whispers?” – but it sparked something. 

It reminded me of how much we crave connection, even (or maybe *especially*) when it’s just a shared anticipation.  We’re all looking for a little validation, a feeling of “I’m not alone” in our hobbies and passions.  Isn’t that the beauty of social?
