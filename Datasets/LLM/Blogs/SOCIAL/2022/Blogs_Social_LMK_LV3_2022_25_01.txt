"As gamers, we've all spent hours perfecting our Characters-at-Will (CaW) in our favorite video games. But have you ever wanted to take customization to the next level? Allowing players to create custom face paint and tattoos for their CaW could be a game-changer. Just like texture mods, this feature would give players a chance to express themselves and add a personal touch to their gaming experience. In 2022, with the rise of creation suites, it's exciting to imagine the possibilities - and the social connections that come with sharing and discovering new, community-driven designs."
