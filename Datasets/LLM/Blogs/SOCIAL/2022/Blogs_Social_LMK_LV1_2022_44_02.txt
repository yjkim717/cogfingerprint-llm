**A Haunting Performance: West Edge Opera's 'Ariane et Barbe-Bleue' Review**

As I stepped into the dimly lit theater, I couldn't help but feel a thrill of anticipation. West Edge Opera's 2022 production of Paul Dukas's 'Ariane et Barbe-Bleue' was highly touted, and I was eager to experience it for myself. Directed by the visionary Jonathan Khuner, this rare and enigmatic opera promised to be a treat for the senses.

From the opening notes, it was clear that this production was something special. Rene Rapier, as the titular Barbe-Bleue, brought a depth and nuance to the role that was both captivating and unsettling. His voice soared through the auditorium, conjuring the dark, mystical world that Dukas had created.

But it was the cast as a whole that truly brought this opera to life. The ensemble worked together seamlessly, their voices blending in a rich, sonorous sound that was both beautiful and haunting. The chorus, in particular, was noteworthy, their eerie whispers and wails adding to the overall sense of unease that pervaded the performance.

Khuner's direction was, in a word, masterful. He had a clear vision for the production, and every element – from the set design to the lighting – worked together to create a cohesive, immersive experience. The staging was clever and intuitive, with the actors moving through the space with a fluidity that added to the drama.

As the night wore on, I found myself becoming increasingly enthralled by the world on stage. 'Ariane et Barbe-Bleue' is not an easy opera to pull off, but West Edge Opera had succeeded in bringing this complex, psychologically charged work to life in a way that was both authentic and innovative.

In the end, it was a truly unforgettable experience, one that lingered long after the curtain call. If you're an opera lover, or simply looking for a unique and thought-provoking night out, I highly recommend seeking out West Edge Opera's 'Ariane et Barbe-Bleue' – even if it's on video or recording, as the memory of this performance is sure to haunt you for a long time to come.
