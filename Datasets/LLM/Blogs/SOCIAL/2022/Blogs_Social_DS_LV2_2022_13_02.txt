It’s 2022, and I’m staring at my Invisalign results with a sigh. After months of trays and appointments, there they are: tiny "black triangles" between my teeth, a detail my provider shrugged off. Now, with a move looming, I’m stuck wondering—do I switch providers and risk more costs, or push for a refund to try bonding instead?

It’s more than just teeth; it’s trusting a process and feeling let down. Have you ever invested time and money into something, only to face unexpected flaws? It’s frustrating, but it’s also a lesson in speaking up. Here’s to hoping my next step brings the smile I envisioned—and maybe a little justice, too.
