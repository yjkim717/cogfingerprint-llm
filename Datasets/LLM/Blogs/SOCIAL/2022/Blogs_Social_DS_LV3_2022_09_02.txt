It’s 2022, and my partner and I are standing at the edge of a dream—owning our first home. But there’s a catch: our credit score needs a boost, and the financed Toyota in the driveway is weighing it down. The logical step? Pay it off in cash.

Yet, here’s where it gets tricky. We’ve saved diligently, but the thought of moving that cash through the banking system makes us uneasy. With the IRS always watching, it feels like a spotlight we’d rather avoid. It’s a strange paradox—trying to prove we’re financially responsible to a system that scrutinizes every deposit, while all we want is a fair shot at mortgage approval.

This journey isn’t just about numbers; it’s about trust. Trust in ourselves, and in a financial world that often feels stacked against everyday people. We’re navigating this maze together, hoping our leap of faith leads to keys in our hands and a place to call our own.
