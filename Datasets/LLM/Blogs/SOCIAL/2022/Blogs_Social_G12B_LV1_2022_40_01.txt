## Finding My Ground in a New City

Moving to Colorado Springs felt like stepping onto a fresh yoga mat – exciting, but a little wobbly. I'm craving connection, both on and off the mat. So, I’ve been exploring studios and local yoga groups, hoping to find a community that resonates. It's more than just poses; it's about shared breath and building friendships in this beautiful new place. Wish me luck on my journey!
