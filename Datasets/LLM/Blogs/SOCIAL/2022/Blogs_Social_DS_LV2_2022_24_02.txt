Remember that heated online debate in 2022 where someone called a politician a "clown"? I nearly joined in, then paused. That insult could've meant jail time here in Germany. Yet I've seen carefully worded comments that cut deeper than any schimpfwort. It makes you wonderâ€”should we punish words or the real harm behind them? Sometimes the most damaging language wears a polite disguise.
