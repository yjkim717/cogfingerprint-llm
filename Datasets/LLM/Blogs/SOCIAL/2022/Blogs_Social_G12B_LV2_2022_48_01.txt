## The Slow Fade of Auburn: A Hair Story (and a Little About Letting Go)

Okay, real talk. My hair is doing *something*. It’s always been a sort of auburn, a warm, reddish-brown that I’ve always kind of loved. But lately, as it grows, it’s shifting. Fading, almost. Becoming more…brown. It’s subtle, but noticeable.

Honestly, a part of me wants to fight it. I've been researching ways to *prevent* this color change, clinging to that initial auburn vibrancy. But then I thought, why? Why am I so determined to hold onto something that’s naturally evolving?

It feels like a tiny metaphor for life, doesn't it? Trying to resist change, even when it’s gentle, even when it might be beautiful in its own way. Maybe embracing the shift, the reddish-brown, is the more interesting story. Maybe letting go is the real beauty here. 2022 has taught me that much, anyway.
