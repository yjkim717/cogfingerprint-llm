"The Dark Side of Virtual Worlds: A Sims Story. In my 2022 'Kill as Many Sims' campaign, I attempted to take down Eliza Pancakes in Willow Creek. I installed an extreme violence mod to spice things up, but my Sim's autonomous killing skills were lacking. Despite my best efforts, Eliza remained alive, and I was left frustrated. This experience made me ponder the line between virtual violence and real-life empathy. As we increasingly interact with AI-driven characters, are we desensitizing ourselves to the value of life?"
