Remember that 2015 dress debate—black and blue or white and gold? It’s funny how we can look at the same thing and see it so differently.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about that with Moondrop and Sundrop’s interchangeable designs. It’s a reminder that in 2022, we’re still navigating a world where perspective is everything. Whether it’s a product or a person, what we see depends on our own lens. Maybe the real beauty lies in embracing that diversity of view, not in arguing over who’s right.
