The first time I held a feverish child during my pediatric rotation, my mind didn’t go to diagnostics—it went straight to the invisible army of germs I’d just invited onto my skin. My heart hammered as I practically bathed in hand sanitizer afterward, the sharp scent a temporary shield against my rising anxiety.

In that moment, I wasn't just a student nurse; I was a human grappling with a very 2022 reality. After years of pandemic headlines, the fear of contamination felt deeply personal. But then I looked at the child’s mother, her trust in my care a silent anchor. It hit me: nursing isn't about building a sterile fortress. It's about learning to manage the fear, so our compassion isn't trapped behind a wall of purell. The real work happens in the messy, human space between us.
