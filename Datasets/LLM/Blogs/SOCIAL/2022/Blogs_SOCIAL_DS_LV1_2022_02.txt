**The Voice on the Phone: A 2022 Wake-Up Call**

It’s funny how a single phone call can shatter your sense of security. In 2022, my brother almost fell for one of the most elaborate scams I’ve ever seen.

He’d sold an old camera on eBay, and days later, got a call. The person, speaking with a distinct Indian accent, claimed to be from eBay support. They said there was a problem with the return and that my brother needed to “verify his identity” by accepting a $5,000 transfer to his Venmo account. The instructions were sketchy—full of urgency and pressure to act fast.

Thankfully, he called me first. We realized it was a classic “overpayment” scam; they’d send stolen funds and then demand most of it back, leaving him liable. The experience was a stark reminder that in our hyper-connected social world, trust is our most vulnerable asset. It’s not about being paranoid, but about pausing, questioning, and leaning on each other for a second opinion before clicking that button.
