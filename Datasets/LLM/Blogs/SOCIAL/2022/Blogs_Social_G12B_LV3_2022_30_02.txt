## When the Universe Feels Like It's Got It Out For You

Anyone else ever feel like you're just… a magnet for the bad stuff? I saw a post on Reddit the other day that really resonated. Someone was pouring out this feeling of constant adversity, of things just *happening*, even when they were actively trying to stay positive. And the frustrating part? The well-meaning, but ultimately dismissive, replies. "Just think positive!" "It's all about luck!" 

It's 2022, and we're all navigating a lot. Isolation has been a huge thing, and sometimes those setbacks feel amplified when you're feeling alone. It's easy to tell someone to change their mindset, but it's another thing entirely to *live* it when you feel like you're constantly battling a stream of negativity. Maybe we can all be a little more empathetic to those sharing these struggles – a listening ear can be more powerful than any pep talk.
