The Remote Work Conundrum: When 'Reply All' Becomes a Nuisance

As I sit here in my home office, sipping my morning coffee, I'm reminded of the double-edged sword that is remote work. On one hand, I'm grateful for the flexibility and lack of commute. On the other, I sometimes feel like I'm missing out on the nuances of office communication. Take email etiquette, for instance. I've noticed that my colleagues often hit 'reply all' to emails, clogging up my inbox with unnecessary responses. It's not just annoying; it's also distracting. What irks me most is when they respond to our manager's emails, copying the entire department. Can't they just acknowledge the email to the manager directly? It's a small change, but it would make a big difference in our departmental culture. By being more mindful of our email habits, we can foster a more considerate and efficient communication style, even from afar.
