Walking into my local polling place last Tuesday, I felt that familiar mix of civic duty and slight anxiety. The election worker handed me my paper ballot with a friendly smile, but then I hesitated—black marker or ball-point pen? I’d always used a pen, but this time I grabbed the marker.

What a difference! The bold, clean lines left no room for doubt. No faint streaks or smudges, just a clear, confident vote. It struck me how such a small choice can make democracy feel more tangible and secure. In these uncertain times, that little bit of certainty at the polls meant everything.
