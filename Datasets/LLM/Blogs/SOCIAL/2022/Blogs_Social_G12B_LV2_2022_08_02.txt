## That Morning Panic & A Furry Little Reminder

This morning was…intense. I woke up to my cat, Leo, dry heaving. Just *seeing* that little shudder sent a jolt of panic through me. It's that feeling, isn't it? When your pet’s health throws a wrench in your day, and you're already rushing out the door. Luckily, a quick online search and a vet call calmed me down, but it was a good reminder to slow down and appreciate those little moments – and always prioritize our furry family! Anyone else relate to the pet-induced morning chaos?



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
