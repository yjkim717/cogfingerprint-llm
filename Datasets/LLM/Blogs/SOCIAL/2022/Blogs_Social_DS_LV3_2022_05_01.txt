It’s 2022, and I’m three years into working from home. You’d think I’d have it all figured out, right? But my biggest productivity killer isn't my dog or my kids—it’s my inbox.

Every time a department-wide email goes out, the "reply-all" avalanche begins. A simple "Thanks!" or "Got it!" from dozens of colleagues triggers a symphony of pings. My focus shatters, pulled away by another notification. I find myself lost in a sea of acknowledgments, searching for the one email that actually requires my attention.

I’ve started wondering: what if we collectively agreed to stop? What if we created a simple procedure where only the sender gets a direct reply for routine confirmations? It feels like a small change, but in the quiet hum of my home office, reclaiming that mental space could be revolutionary. It’s not just about a cleaner inbox; it’s about preserving our ability to do deep, meaningful work.
