It’s 2022, and I’m scrolling through comments full of hate speech and misinformation—yet it’s the personal insult in a heated argument that could land someone in jail. It makes me wonder: why do we treat a harsh word as a crime, while systemic lies spread freely? Maybe it’s easier to punish individual anger than untangle the deeper harm. Are we focusing on the symptom, not the disease?
