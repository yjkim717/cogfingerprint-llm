As I strolled through the 2022 film festival, I was transported back to the British cinema of the 1960s. A striking poster caught my eye - bold red, white, and black hues that seemed to dance on the wall. I couldn't help but wonder which film it was promoting. The imagery felt reminiscent of Nicholas Roeg's 'Don't Look Now' and Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange'. Was this a precursor to their iconic works? The nostalgic connection sparked a curiosity about the power of visual storytelling and its influence on the directors who followed. The past continues to shape our cinematic present.
