You know that feeling when you’re just trying to keep up, but life keeps throwing ticking clocks and invisible damage your way? Lately, I’ve been thinking about how much that reminds me of a certain game challenge—the Void Fields. It’s this brutal test where you’re constantly taking damage over time while racing against a clock, and honestly? It’s started to feel a lot like my 2022.

Between work deadlines, social commitments, and just trying to stay healthy, it’s like I’m always low on healing items and making panicked item selections. I rush from one thing to the next, hoping I’ve chosen the right “gear” to survive the day. But sometimes, the damage stacks up faster than I can recover.

Maybe the real lesson here isn’t about conquering the Void Fields, but recognizing when the grind stops being worth it. Are we managing our time, or is time managing us? Here’s to choosing our battles—and knowing when to step back and recharge instead.
