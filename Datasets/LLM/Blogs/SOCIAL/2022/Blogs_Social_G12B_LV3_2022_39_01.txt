## The Hague RO and the Reef Tank Question: Pushing the Limits?

Okay, fellow reefers, I've been wrestling with something lately. My Hague RO unit is fantastic, consistently delivering that super-low TDS water we all crave. But I’m wondering… what happens if I run it beyond its 5-gallon storage capacity? Does it still perform flawlessly? It's a bit of a gamble, isn't it? I'm hesitant to risk compromising that pristine water quality – the health of my corals depends on it! Anyone else experimented with this? Let's chat!
