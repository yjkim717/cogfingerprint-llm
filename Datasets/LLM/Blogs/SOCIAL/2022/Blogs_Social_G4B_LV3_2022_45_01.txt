**The Worry in the Waiting Room**

It feels a little strange admitting this, but lately, I’ve been wrestling with a quiet kind of anxiety. It’s not a huge, dramatic fear, but a persistent worry – the kind that settles in when you hear about the Ozempic shortage.  You know, the one where getting a prescription feels like a small victory, and the thought of it running out is…well, unsettling.

I’ve been managing my diabetes for years now, and Ozempic has been a lifesaver.  Recently, the news started swirling about limited supplies, and honestly, it sparked a feeling of unease. I’m not alone, I’ve seen it mirrored in online forums – a collective holding of breath. 

I’ve started shifting my injection schedule, spacing them out a little, just to ensure I don’t suddenly find myself without what I need. It’s a small, practical step, but it feels strangely comforting. It’s a reminder that even in these moments of uncertainty, there’s a way to regain a sense of control.  Anyone else feeling this ripple of concern? Let's talk about it.
