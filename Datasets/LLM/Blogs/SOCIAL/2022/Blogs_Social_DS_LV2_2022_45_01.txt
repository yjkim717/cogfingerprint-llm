### The Calendar on My Fridge

There’s a calendar on my fridge, but it’s not for birthdays or dentist appointments. It’s marked with a series of dates, eight days apart, in bright red pen. It’s my new reality, a quiet little rebellion against the Ozempic shortage.

In 2022, my health feels like it’s stuck in a bizarre tug-of-war. My doctor and I have a plan, my insurance company is… considering it, and the pharmacy just gives me a sympathetic shrug. So, I’ve had to get creative. Stretching a single pen to last over eight days instead of seven isn’t a medical recommendation; it’s a personal calculation. It’s the math of anxiety, dividing hope by scarcity.

Every time I push that injection button, I’m not just managing my blood sugar. I’m bargaining with an invisible system, trying to buy myself just a little more time until my next refill. It’s a strange, lonely feeling to be so dependent on a tiny vial of liquid and the complex logistics of getting it.

That red-pen calendar is more than a schedule; it’s a map of my patience. It’s a reminder that sometimes, staying healthy means playing a waiting game you never signed up for.
