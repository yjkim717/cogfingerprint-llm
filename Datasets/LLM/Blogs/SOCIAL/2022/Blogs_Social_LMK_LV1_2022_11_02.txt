"Dealing with a melanoma diagnosis is tough enough, but navigating Metlife's short-term disability claim process has been a whole different kind of challenge. As I faced the uncertainty of my treatment and recovery in 2022, I expected my insurance provider to be a source of support. Instead, I've encountered delays, denials, and frustrating bureaucracy. It's disheartening to feel like I'm fighting for the benefits I've paid for. My experience has left me wondering: are insurance companies like Metlife truly invested in their customers' well-being, or just their bottom line? I'm not alone in this struggle."
