As I scrolled through online D&D forums in 2022, a player's query caught my eye: could a kenku monk subclass truly soar to new heights, literally? They wanted to simulate flight, but worried about its low-level viability. I sympathized - as a fellow player, I've been there too. The community chimed in, sharing tips on balancing creative builds with game mechanics. It was a great example of how social platforms can foster collaborative problem-solving and inspire new adventures.
