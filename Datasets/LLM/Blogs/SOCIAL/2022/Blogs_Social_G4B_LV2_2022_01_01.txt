**The Little Things That Make You Mad (and Why It Matters)**

Okay, real talk – 2022 felt like a year of little frustrations piling up, didn’t it? I found myself getting genuinely annoyed by something surprisingly small: Rocket League decals. Specifically, the *lack* of an England flag decal. Seriously, it’s a popular game, and a huge chunk of the player base are proud Brits! 

It’s weird, right? It’s just a sticker, but it felt like a missed opportunity, a tiny oversight that highlighted a bigger issue – how easily we get invested in these digital spaces and expect a little bit of representation. 

It made me think about how much power social media – and games like Rocket League – have to shape our sense of belonging.  Maybe it’s silly to get worked up about a decal, but it reminded me that even small things can spark a feeling of being seen and valued.  Anyone else have a similar ‘pet peeve’ that suddenly felt *really* important?
