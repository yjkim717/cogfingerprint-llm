**The Static in My Head**

It’s weird, right? Like, 2022 and I still have this little trick. Scrolling through Reddit, or just walking down the street – sometimes the sheer *amount* of visual stuff just gets to me. It’s like my brain is overloaded. So, I’ll subtly close one eye, just for a second, to create a little quiet. It’s silly, I know, but it helps dial down the anxiety and the feeling of being completely overwhelmed.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different version with a specific focus (e.g., more detail about Reddit, a different tone)?
