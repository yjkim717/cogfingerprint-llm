That familiar jingle crackling through the static—it’s like a ghost from my childhood TV days. I’ve heard it in movies, in songs, even in the white noise between stations. It’s funny how these snippets of sound become part of our collective memory, tying strangers together with a shared hum.

In 2022, with so much digital noise, it’s comforting to find these little anchors to the past. They remind me that, despite everything, we’re all tuning into the same fleeting moments of nostalgia, searching for the origin of a feeling we can’t quite name.
