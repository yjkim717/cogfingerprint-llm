**My Invisalign Journey Hit a Bump (and a Black Triangle)**

So, 2022 was supposed to be the year I finally got my dream smile. I started Invisalign with so much hope, but as my treatment progressed, I just wasn't happy. A stubborn "black triangle" gap appeared between my front teeth, and my new aligners felt like they weren't fixing it.

The real kicker? I'm moving across the country next month. Panic set in. Can I even switch providers mid-treatment? Will I have to pay another huge fee? And what about a refund for the work I'm not thrilled with? I'm left wondering if I should just push for a little cosmetic bonding to fix the issue and call it a day. Has anyone else navigated this provider-switching maze? I could really use some advice from those whoâ€™ve been there
