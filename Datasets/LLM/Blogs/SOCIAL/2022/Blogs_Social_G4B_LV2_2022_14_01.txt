**Lost in Hyrule, Found in a Stream**

Remember 2022? It felt like everyone was glued to their screens, right? I was too, endlessly scrolling through Reddit, mostly just…existing. Then I stumbled upon this incredible Ocarina of Time speedrun VOD.  It wasn’t just the skill – seriously, breathtaking – but the *community* behind it.  Watching that team’s dedication and the shared joy was a reminder that online spaces can actually be profoundly connective. It was a little dose of pure, earnest excitement.  Sometimes, you just need a good speedrun to feel seen.
