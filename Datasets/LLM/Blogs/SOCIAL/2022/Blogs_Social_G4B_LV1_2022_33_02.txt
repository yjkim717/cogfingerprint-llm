**The Overtime Blues & The Lawn That Just Wouldn’t Quit**

Okay, real talk. 2022 felt… intense. I was drowning in a ridiculous amount of overtime at work – basically fueled by the need to save for a house, which, let’s be honest, felt like a distant dream. But then, my family started ramping up the expectations around the yard. Seriously, the lawn became a full-time job! 

It was a perfect storm of stress. Scrolling through Reddit late at night, I kept seeing people talk about burnout, and I was *feeling* it.  The constant pressure to be productive, to be ‘adulting’ properly, was creating this huge rift with my family. We were arguing about weeds and I just wanted a moment of peace. It’s a weird feeling, wanting to rest but feeling like you’re failing at everything.  Anyone else feel this way?
