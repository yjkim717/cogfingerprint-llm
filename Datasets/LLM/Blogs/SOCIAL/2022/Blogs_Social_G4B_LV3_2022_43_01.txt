**The Echo in the Crowd**

Remember those weird thought experiments we used to do as kids, like imagining light bending through mirrors? Lately, I’ve been thinking about something similar when it comes to social media. It’s like a series of reflections – our carefully curated posts refracting the light of our lives, and each time they bounce, a little bit of brightness seems to fade. 

Is the constant striving for “perfect” online presence actually dimming our genuine selves? It’s a debate we all need to have, isn’t it?  Maybe it’s time to step back, appreciate the original light, and find connection beyond the echoes.
