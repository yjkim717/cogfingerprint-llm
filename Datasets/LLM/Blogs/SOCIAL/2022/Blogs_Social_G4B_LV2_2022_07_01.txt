**The Shame of the Reunion (and Hell’s Kitchen)**

Remember those high school reunions? The ones you secretly dread? It’s weird, right? Like, everyone’s suddenly *so* polished, projecting this carefully curated version of themselves. It reminded me a bit of Elizabeth on *Hell’s Kitchen* – a total blind spot, making spectacularly bad choices. 

Honestly, it’s easy to judge from the outside, but I think we all have moments of obliviousness, of just not *seeing* the bigger picture.  It got me thinking about how we present ourselves online too.  Maybe it’s time to embrace a little more honesty, a little less performance, and a whole lot more grace – for ourselves and for everyone else.

Would you like me to tweak this or create a different version?
