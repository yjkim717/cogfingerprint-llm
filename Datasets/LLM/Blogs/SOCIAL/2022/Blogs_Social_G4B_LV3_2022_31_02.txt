**The Echo in the Translation**

Remember 2022? It felt like everyone was speaking *some* kind of English, didn’t it? I was wrestling with Spanish, stubbornly trying to build a foundation, and honestly, I hit a wall. It wasn't the grammar or the vocabulary – I was putting in the hours. It was the constant, nagging feeling that I was defaulting to Google Translate, building my sentences around a potential English echo.

There was this frustrating discouragement creeping in. Why bother painstakingly learning a new language if I could just…translate? It felt like a communication barrier, not a bridge. I started questioning the whole point, wondering if my efforts were just a polite gesture, not a genuine connection. 

It’s a weird feeling, isn't it? Like you're fighting against an invisible current of global English dominance.  But lately, I’ve been trying to shift that perspective. Recognizing that the struggle *is* the point – the vulnerability of trying, the joy of a small, successful conversation without a screen.  Maybe language learning isn't about fluency, but about embracing the beautiful, messy process of connection.
