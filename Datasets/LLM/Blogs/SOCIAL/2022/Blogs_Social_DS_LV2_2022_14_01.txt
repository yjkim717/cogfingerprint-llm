It’s 2022, and honestly, I’ve been feeling pretty disconnected lately. But last night, I watched a speedrun VOD of the Ocarina of Time beta—and wow. It was this amazing testament to shared nostalgia, a little digital campfire where strangers in a chat reminisced together. It reminded me that even now, we can find these pockets of genuine connection in the most unexpected places. Sometimes, community is just a click away.
