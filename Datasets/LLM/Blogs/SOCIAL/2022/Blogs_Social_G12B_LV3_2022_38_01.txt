## That Little Spray Bottle Dilemma (and a Lesson in Gardening – and Life!)

Okay, fellow gardeners, let’s be honest: we’ve all been there. You're mid-tomato-saving mission, battling those pesky pests with *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt, for those in the know!), and suddenly you’re wondering… can I *really* reuse this spray bottle? I recently had this exact thought! After a quick search, I learned it's best to keep things separate – fertilizer/water and Bt shouldn't mix. It's a small thing, but it reminded me that sometimes, keeping things distinct, even if it feels like extra work, protects the whole process. A little organization goes a long way, wouldn't you agree?
