**The Unexpected Fight**

It's weird, isn't it? How quickly life can throw you a curveball. Last year, I was dealing with a melanoma diagnosis and, understandably, navigating the emotional fallout. Then came the scramble for short-term disability – a lifeline I desperately needed.  

My experience with Metlife felt… isolating.  A denied claim, fueled by a mountain of medical information, felt like a personal rejection. It made me think about the hidden struggles people face, the quiet battles fought behind social media smiles.  It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, needing help isn’t a sign of weakness, but a testament to our shared humanity.
