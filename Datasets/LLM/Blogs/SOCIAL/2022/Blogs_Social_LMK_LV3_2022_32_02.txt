Navigating a Career Shift: Does Having a Job Hurt Your Chances?

As I polished my resume and prepared for a job interview at Wegmans, a nagging worry crept in - would my current role at Starbucks be a blessing or a curse? In today's competitive job market, having a steady job is often seen as a sign of stability, but does it also raise the bar for potential employers? I couldn't help but wonder if my existing employment would make me a more or less attractive candidate. As I sat down for my interview, I took a deep breath and focused on showcasing my skills and passion. In the end, it's not about whether you're currently employed, but how you present your story that matters. By highlighting my transferable skills and enthusiasm, I was able to confidently make the case for my career transition.
