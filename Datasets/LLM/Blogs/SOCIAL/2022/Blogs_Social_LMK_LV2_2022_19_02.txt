"As an artist in 2022, I've often found myself wondering: can I use reference images from sites like Shotdeck without infringing on copyrights? The line between inspiration and infringement is blurry. I'm not alone in seeking clarity on fair usage policies. Can I use these resources for learning and still monetize my art? The more I create, the more I realize the importance of understanding the laws surrounding image referencing and copyrighted material."
