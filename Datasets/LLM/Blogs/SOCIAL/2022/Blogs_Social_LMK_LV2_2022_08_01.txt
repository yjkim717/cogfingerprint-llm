As I gazed at the eerie designs of Moondrop and Sundrop from FNAF, I couldn't help but be transported back to 2015. Remember the "dress illusion" that took social media by storm? The one where people vehemently disagreed on whether the dress was blue and black or white and gold? It's fascinating how our brains can be tricked into seeing things differently. It got me thinking - how often do our perceptions shape our online interactions, and what can we learn from these viral phenomena?
