As I scrolled through online gaming forums in 2022, I couldn't help but feel frustrated with the echo chambers that dominate online discourse. In the gaming community, expertise is often overshadowed by unsubstantiated claims and close-minded argumentation. It's disheartening to see passionate gamers dismiss opposing views without consideration. The internet culture that once fostered open discussion now breeds polarization. I'm left wondering: can we reclaim online spaces for constructive debate, or are we forever trapped in our own curated bubbles?
