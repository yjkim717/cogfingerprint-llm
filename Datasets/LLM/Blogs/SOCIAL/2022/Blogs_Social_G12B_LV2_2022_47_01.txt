## The Echo of a Melody

It’s funny how a fleeting memory can hijack your brain. I've been chasing a ghost of a song all week – a haunting cello solo paired with a voice, vaguely reminiscent of Tomtopera, but… not *Lacrimosa*. I’m trying to capture it in my sequencer, but it feels just out of reach. Anyone else ever get completely consumed by trying to recreate something they can't quite place? It's a beautiful frustration, isn't it?
