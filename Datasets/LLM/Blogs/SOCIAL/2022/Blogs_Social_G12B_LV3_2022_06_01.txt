## The Never-Ending Battle with Buzzing Homeowners (and Carpenter Bees!)

Okay, friends, let’s talk frustration. This year, I’ve been locked in a *serious* ongoing battle with carpenter bees. Seriously, these little guys are relentless! They’ve decided my porch – a place I envisioned as a relaxing summer haven – is prime real estate for their tunnels.

I’ve tried the traps, diligently replacing them every few weeks, but it feels like a Sisyphean task. Each new one appears only to be met with another industrious bee, ready to carve out new wood. It's a constant reminder that even the most carefully planned spaces can be invaded, and sometimes, the best you can do is just keep fighting the good fight. Anyone else dealing with similar pest predicaments this year? Send help (and maybe some bee-deterrent tips!).
