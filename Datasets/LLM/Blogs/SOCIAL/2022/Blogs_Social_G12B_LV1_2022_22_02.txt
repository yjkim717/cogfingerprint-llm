>## The Echo in the Walls

It’s been a long summer, and I’ve discovered a rather unsettling truth about my old house: it’s got tenants I didn't invite. Tiny, scurrying tenants. Rats and mice, to be precise. Initially, I went for the usual – traps, even considered the poison route. But something felt…wrong. It felt like just escalating a problem, not solving it.

It made me think about online spaces too, actually. How often do we just react to negativity with more negativity? A comment war, a pile-on, more noise. Maybe, like dealing with these critters in my walls, a deeper look – at the *why* – is needed before we just unleash more reactive force. Easier said than done, of course. But a little reflection feels worthwhile.
