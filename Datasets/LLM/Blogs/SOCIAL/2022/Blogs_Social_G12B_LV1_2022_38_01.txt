## The Little Bottle, the Big Lesson

Okay, confession time: I'm a slightly obsessive gardener. This year, battling tomato hornworms, I dove headfirst into *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt). It worked like a charm! But then I was staring at my spray bottle, wondering, "Do I *really* need to scrub this spotless?" 

It felt silly, honestly. A tiny thing. But it got me thinking about how much we overthink, striving for perfection even in the garden (and life!). Maybe a little residue isn't the end of the world. Maybe letting go of the perfect clean is a good thing. 2022 has been about embracing a little messiness, hasn't it?
