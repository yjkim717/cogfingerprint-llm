### The Long Road to a Brown Uniform

They don’t tell you about the mirrors. Or the seniority reset that makes you feel like you’re starting from scratch every single day. When I finally landed this UPS cover driver gig in 2022, I thought I was on the path to stability. The reality? It’s a rollercoaster.

One day you’re navigating tight suburban streets, flinching every time a side mirror *taps* a branch, knowing it’s coming out of your check. The next, you’re back in the warehouse, muscles aching from package handling, wondering if you’ll even get 30 hours this week.

The most exhausting part isn't the physical labor; it’s the mental game. You see drivers with seniority get the good routes, the stable schedules, while you’re at the mercy of a management system that feels, frankly, a little corrupt. It’s designed to keep you hungry, to keep you compliant.

But you cling to the dream of that full-time vest. You learn the routes, you double-check every address, and you smile for the customers. Because that uniform represents more than a job—it’s a future, and I’m determined to earn mine, one broken mirror at a time.
