For years, I carried the weight of a chronic depression diagnosis, feeling like I was fighting a battle with an invisible, shifting enemy. Therapy helped, but something always felt… unaddressed. I’d mention my lifelong struggles with focus, restlessness, and a brain that felt like a browser with 50 tabs open, but it was often gently steered back to the familiar territory of low mood.

Finally, after my own persistent research and gentle but firm requests, my psychologist agreed a fresh perspective was needed. She referred me to a psychiatrist. That referral wasn’t just a formality; it was a lifeline. For the first time, I felt a flicker of genuine hope. This was a chance for an unbiased evaluation, someone to look at the whole picture—not just through the lens of depression, but to honestly explore the possibility of ADHD. It was the first step in feeling truly seen, and the beginning of understanding myself, not just my symptoms.
