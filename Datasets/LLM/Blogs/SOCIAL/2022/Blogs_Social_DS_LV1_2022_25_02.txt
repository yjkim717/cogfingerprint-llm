Moving across the country in 2022 was daunting, but what truly kept me grounded was the virtual bridge I built with friends. Settling into my new South Carolina apartment, my first mission was securing fiber optic internet—not for streaming, but for reviving our old PS2 game nights.

Using PCSX2 and ZeroTier, we bridged thousands of miles, laughing over lag-free matches as if we were in the same room. It struck me then: in a world still reeling from isolation, technology wasn’t just about speed; it was about preserving the irreplaceable hum of connection, turning distant screens into shared spaces where friendships thrived.
