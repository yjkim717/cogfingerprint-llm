It’s 2022, and my old Crown Vic P71 has become a stubborn friend. After a fresh battery and tune-up, it still cranks slowly, refusing to start—the odometer just blinks dashes back at me. It’s funny how machines mirror life sometimes: even with all the right maintenance, some days you just don’t turn over. We’re all a little worn, a little slow to ignite, but there’s still hope under the hood. We just need the right spark to get going again.
