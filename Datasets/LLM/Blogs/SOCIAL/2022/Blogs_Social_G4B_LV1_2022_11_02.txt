**The Quiet Fight: When Insurance Doesn’t Understand**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How quickly life can throw you a curveball. I was scrolling through Reddit last month and stumbled across a story that really hit home – a woman battling melanoma and facing a claim denial from Metlife for short-term disability. 

The core of it? They said her surgery wasn’t “sufficiently documented.” It’s frustrating, isn’t it, when you’re just trying to navigate a complex system and feeling like your medical information isn’t being heard. It makes you think about the quiet battles people are fighting, unseen and often unsupported.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focus on a different angle, or adjust the length?
