## The Ghost of Driving Feel

It's 2022, and I've been wrestling with a strange feeling lately. I traded in my trusty '95 BMW 325i a while back – a car that *felt* alive, you know? The steering, the weight, the way it responded – it was a connection. Now, driving my VW Golf R is… different. Efficient, sure, packed with tech, absolutely. But something’s missing. That raw, visceral link to the road. 

It got me thinking about how much we’ve lost in the pursuit of progress. Are we sacrificing genuine driving feel for convenience? I'm on a quest now, searching for modern cars that somehow manage to recapture that analog magic, that feeling of truly *driving*. Wish me luck!
