It’s funny how a virtual wilderness can mirror real-life social anxieties. I remember logging back into RuneScape in 2022, hearing whispers about the Wilderness being "safer" now. I’d opted out of PVP, thinking I was immune. Then, I ventured out for some cursed energy, my guard down. Out of nowhere, a PKer appeared. My heart hammered—a purely social fear of being someone else’s content. I died, of course. But the real sting was the death mechanics; I still lost my items. It was a stark reminder: even when you opt out of direct conflict, you’re never fully safe from the ecosystem’s rules. We navigate spaces thinking we’re insulated, but the world has a way of pulling us back into the fray. It’s a lesson in digital—and human—nature.
