### The Day Off That Wasn't

It’s 2022, and the “hustle culture” glorified online feels less like a badge of honor and more like a trap I can’t escape. My name’s Alex, and I’m currently writing this from my cubicle at 8 PM on a Thursday. Again. This has been my reality for months—a blur of deadlines, video calls, and cold coffee.

All week, I clung to a single beacon of hope: Saturday. Not for brunch or a hike, but for the sacred, simple act of doing nothing. My brain and body are screaming for a true reset.

But then I got home last night. My parents, who moved in after retiring, were waiting. “Perfect!” my dad said, clapping his hands. “You’re free Saturday. The backyard jungle isn’t going to tame itself.”

My heart just sank. The one day I had to stave off total burnout was already claimed for manual labor. I love them, but there’s this unspoken expectation that because I’m their child and they’re here, my time is communal property. Their retirement is a permanent weekend, while mine is a mythical creature I can’t seem to capture.

It’s more than just yard work. It’s the feeling that in the quest to provide and be a “good” adult child, my own work-life balance has completely evaporated. That elusive boundary between personal time and family obligation feels like the most exhausting job of all. When does the hustle end so life can actually begin?
