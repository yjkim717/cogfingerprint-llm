## The Weight of "It Gets Better"

I’m staring at a half-eaten bowl of ramen. Again. It’s not unusual. It’s been… a staple, let’s say, for the better part of the last year. And honestly, looking at it, I just feel… heavy. Not hungry, just heavy.

2022. What a year, right? We were all promised things would normalize. We were told the worst was behind us. But for some of us, it just kept piling on. It’s funny, isn't it? How collective trauma can exist alongside incredibly personal, isolating struggles. Everyone’s talking about the Great Resignation, inflation, and the housing crisis. And I’m acutely aware of *all* of it because I’m living it.

It started subtly. A creeping anxiety about bills. Then, the layoff. My company, a small marketing firm, “restructured.” Corporate speak for “we needed to cut costs, and you were on the list.” I was blindsided. Ten years. Ten years dedicated to building something, to proving myself. Gone. Just like that.

The initial shock gave way to a frantic scramble. Applications. Networking. The soul-crushing rejection emails. The endless interviews where you’re essentially selling your worth to strangers who barely make eye contact. I felt like a hamster on a wheel, running faster and faster but getting nowhere.

And everywhere I turned, I heard it. “Things will get better.”

Well-meaning friends, family, even random people offering platitudes at the grocery store. "Just keep your chin up!" "This is a temporary setback!" "It'll all work out!"

At first, I appreciated the sentiment. I really did. I needed to hear *something* positive. But now? Now, "things will get better" feels like a burden. It’s a weight added to the already crushing pile of debt, the constant worry about making rent, the gnawing sense of failure.

It's not that I don't *want* things to get better. Of course, I do. I yearn for stability, for a job that feels meaningful, for the ability to buy a decent grocery shop without calculating every single item. But the sheer exhaustion of constantly battling uphill feels… debilitating.

I find myself resenting the optimism of others, even though I know they don't mean any harm. It feels dismissive of the very real, tangible struggles I’m facing. It’s like saying, "Just *think* positive, and your eviction notice will disappear."

I've been trying to shift my perspective. Instead of focusing on some vague, distant "better," I’m trying to find small pockets of solace in the present. A walk in the park. A phone call with my mom. A really good cup of coffee (when I can afford it). Tiny victories.

Because maybe "things getting better" isn’t a
