>## The Pixelated Passing of the Torch

It's wild how much Pokémon Go has changed since 2016. Remember the early days? The sheer *wonder* of catching a Pikachu in Central Park? Now, Niantic events like Go Fest feel more like endurance tests than joyful explorations. Honestly, sometimes I question why I even bother.

But then I look at my kid, completely engrossed, eyes glued to their phone, excitedly shouting about a shiny Axew they just hatched. Suddenly, the server lag and the complicated event mechanics fade a little. It’s a pixelated passing of the torch, I guess. Maybe the game isn't *for* me anymore, but seeing their genuine delight? That's a reward worth sticking around for.
