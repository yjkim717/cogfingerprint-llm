**The Unexpected Jolt**

Okay, real talk. Nursing school is intense – the books, the exams, the sheer weight of responsibility. But lately, something’s been bubbling beneath the surface for me: anxiety. It sounds dramatic, I know, but it hit me last week during a clinical rotation. 

Just a quick, gentle hand-to-hand contact with a little patient while taking his temperature. And suddenly, my heart was pounding, my palms were sweating, and I felt this wave of… well, *panic*. It’s connected to a deeper thing – a weird, persistent emophobia about physical touch. 

I immediately questioned myself. Was I overreacting?  It’s so isolating feeling like this when you’re training to care for people.  I'm learning to be kinder to myself, realizing that acknowledging these feelings is the first step to managing them.  Anyone else experience this?
