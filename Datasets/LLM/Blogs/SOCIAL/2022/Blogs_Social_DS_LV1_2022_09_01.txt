### The Unseen Heroes of Our Homes

It’s funny how we only think about the things that keep our homes running when they stop working. I learned this the hard way last year.

It started with a faint, persistent drip from the kitchen sink’s angle stop valve. I ignored it, thinking a little water never hurt anyone. Then, one Tuesday, I came home to a small pond forming on my hardwood floor. The old supply line had finally given up. As I frantically tried to find the main water cut-off, I realized I’d been treating my home like a set-it-and-forget-it appliance.

Later that week, my trusty toaster and the space heater decided to stage a protest, tripping an ancient breaker in my electrical panel that refused to reset. A double-whammy of breaker failure and plumbing issues was my wake-up call.

That chaotic week in 2022 taught me a profound social lesson: our homes are a shared responsibility, even if we live alone. Proactive maintenance isn’t just about preventing disasters; it’s about peace of mind for ourselves and protecting the sanctuary we share with family and friends. I’ve since swapped out those aging valves and had my panel inspected. It’s the best investment I’ve made in my home’s safety, and my own sanity. Don’t wait for the drip to become a flood.
