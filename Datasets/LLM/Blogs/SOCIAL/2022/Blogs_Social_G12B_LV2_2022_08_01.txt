## That Dress, and Now Animatronics? Seriously?!

Okay, remember that blue and black/gold and white dress that broke the internet back in 2015? It felt like *everyone* was arguing about it! Well, I just stumbled upon a hilarious comparison online – the Moondrop and Sundrop animatronics from *Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach* are giving off the same vibes! It’s wild how our brains interpret color differently. It's a fun reminder that even something as simple as a dress, or a robot’s color scheme, can spark a surprisingly passionate debate. Anyone else seeing it too?
