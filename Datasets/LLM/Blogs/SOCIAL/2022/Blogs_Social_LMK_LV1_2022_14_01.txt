"As I scrolled through my social feeds in 2022, I stumbled upon a VOD of a recent Ocarina of Time beta showcase speedrun event. The teamwork and skill on display were incredible. Watching the team tackle the challenging beta version was mesmerizing. If you're a fan of speedrunning or just curious about the community, I highly recommend checking it out - it's a great showcase of team ability and dedication."
