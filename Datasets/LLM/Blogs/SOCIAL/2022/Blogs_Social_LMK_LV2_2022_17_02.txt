As I stood there, frozen, a sick child handed me a thermometer - an innocent act that sent my anxiety into overdrive. I'm a nursing student, and the irony wasn't lost on me. Emetophobia, my constant companion, whispered worst-case scenarios. I thought of all the germs, the exposure risk, and my mind reeled. Hand hygiene became an obsessive ritual. It was 2022, and I was learning to navigate the fine line between being a compassionate nurse and managing my own anxiety. It was a tough lesson, but one I'll never forget.
