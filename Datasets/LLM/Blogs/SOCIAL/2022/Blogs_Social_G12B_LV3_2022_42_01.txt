## Finally, a Period in YA Fiction That Doesn't Feel... Weird.

Okay, serious talk. As a reader, especially one who grew up navigating the often-awkward landscape of young adult fiction, I’m genuinely thrilled about Rick Riordan’s *Daughter of the Deep*. It’s not just a fantastic adventure (seriously, the mythology is *chef’s kiss*), but the way he handles a very normal, very female experience – menstruation – is refreshing. 

No cringey metaphors, no dramatic fainting spells, just a realistic portrayal of a young leader, Sonora, dealing with her period while saving the world. It’s a small thing, maybe, but in 2022, seeing female characters treated with such respect and normalcy feels like a huge win. It’s a reminder that powerful women don't need to be defined by their struggles with biology.
