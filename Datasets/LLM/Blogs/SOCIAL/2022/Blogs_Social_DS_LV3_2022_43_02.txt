That frantic holiday season of 2022, I finally snagged a sealed EVGA RTX 3080 Ti. But in the quiet after the rush, a realization hit. That thrill of the hunt? It wasn't about the card. It was the shared excitement, the local meetups, the stories swapped with fellow enthusiasts. So, I'm passing it on for $800. Sometimes, the real prize isn't the object, but the human connection you find along the way.
