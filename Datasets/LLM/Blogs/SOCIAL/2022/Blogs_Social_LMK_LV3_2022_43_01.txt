"Have you ever stood between two mirrors, watching the endless reflections stretch out before you? It's a mind-bending experience that sparks curiosity about the behavior of light. As we ponder the infinite corridor of reflections, we wonder: does the light lose its intensity as it bounces back and forth? In 2022, our understanding of optics and physics reveals that, yes, repeated reflections do diminish light's intensity, but only slightly. The imperceptible loss reminds us that even in the most mesmerizing illusions, the laws of physics govern the beauty we see."
