The Easter egg hunt is real, folks! As a die-hard Futurama fan, I was thrilled to stumble upon a hidden gem in 2022. While re-watching an old episode, I noticed Cubert's lip movements didn't quite match the dialogue. Upon closer inspection, it appeared he was mouthing a hilariously alternate line. I felt like I'd uncovered a treasure. Has anyone else discovered this undiscovered Easter egg? The internet, let's get the conversation started!
