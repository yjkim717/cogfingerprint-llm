**Remembering Sade from Hell’s Kitchen**

It’s funny how a single moment on TV can stick with you, right? I was scrolling through Reddit last year, completely lost in the chaos of *Hell’s Kitchen*, and kept thinking about Sade – the chef who got eliminated. Gordon Ramsay had supposedly promised to follow up, and I wondered where she was. 

It just highlights how quickly the online world moves, and how easily we forget the stories of those who briefly entered the spotlight.  Anyone else have a favorite "where are they now?" TV moment?
