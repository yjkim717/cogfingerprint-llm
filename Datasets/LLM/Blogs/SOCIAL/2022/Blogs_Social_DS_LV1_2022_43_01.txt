Remember that late-night debate with my partner about whether light loses its brightness bouncing between perfect mirrors? We got so deep into theoretical physics, completely missing the metaphor right in front of us.

It got me thinking about our own social circles. We often act as perfect mirrors for our friends, reflecting back their same opinions and energy. But is that really a good thing? In 2022, with the world feeling so divided, I wonder if this constant, unchanging reflection just traps us in echo chambers. Maybe we need a little "light loss"—a bit of friction, a different perspective—to keep our understanding of the world bright and evolving. After all, a little imperfection might be what saves us from the dark.
