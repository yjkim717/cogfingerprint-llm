## Is It Just Me? The Weight of Constant Little Mishaps

Okay, I need to vent. 2022 feels… relentless. It’s not huge disasters, it’s the *constant* stream of little things going wrong. Spilling coffee, missing the bus, forgetting appointments – a daily barrage. And the frustrating part? When I mention it, I get the “Just look on the bright side!” response. 

Like, I *know* good things happen. I see them. But sometimes, it feels like the universe has a personal vendetta against me. It's exhausting trying to keep up with a seemingly endless cycle of minor setbacks. Am I the only one experiencing this? Seriously, tell me I'm not alone in feeling perpetually unlucky.
