## The Echo of Connection: Why Online Interactions Sometimes Feel… Dim

Remember that Reddit thread about light bouncing between mirrors, fading with each reflection? It got me thinking about social media in 2022. We’re constantly reflecting – sharing, reposting, reacting – sending our thoughts and feelings across digital spaces. But does something get lost in all that bouncing? 

Like that light, maybe our genuine connections dim a little with each layer of online interaction. A heartfelt post gets shared, commented on, then reshared… does the original emotion still resonate as strongly? It’s a weird thought, but maybe we need to focus on the *source* of the light – those real, unfiltered moments – rather than chasing endless reflections. What do you think?
