## The Unexpected Weight of "Approved"

It's funny, isn't it? How life can throw you a curveball when you least expect it. Last fall, I was diagnosed with melanoma. Stage one, thankfully, and the surgery seemed to go well. Recovery was tough, a lot of appointments, scans... the whole shebang. I thought I had everything covered – good insurance, a supportive family. 

Then came the short-term disability claim through MetLife. I needed a little breathing room to heal, both physically and mentally, while I missed work. Approved, they said. Relief washed over me. Until it wasn't. A denial. Apparently, some fine print loophole. 

It's been a frustrating, exhausting battle since. It's more than just the money; it's the feeling of being let down when you’re already vulnerable. It’s a stark reminder that even with all the safety nets, navigating healthcare and insurance in 2022 can feel like fighting an uphill battle. Still fighting, still hoping for a fair outcome.
