There’s something magical about those quiet, early mornings just before Christmas. Last year, inspired by Bluey’s “Veranda Santa” episode, I left a few cherry tomatoes and a carrot on the porch. My kids’ sleepy-eyed wonder, believing Santa’s reindeer had visited, filled our home with the purest laughter. It was a simple reminder that parenting magic isn’t in the elaborate plans, but in these spontaneous, joyful moments. The holidays are truly made of these little, shared giggles at dawn.
