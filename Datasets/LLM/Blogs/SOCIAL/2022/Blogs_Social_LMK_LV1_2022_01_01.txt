The branding inconsistencies I stumbled upon in Rocket League left me scratching my head. As I watched pro players showcase their sleek cars, I noticed something odd - the Nike branding on decals varied across countries. For some nations, the iconic swoosh logo was proudly displayed alongside the country's flag, while for others, it was noticeably absent. I recall seeing the Union Flag decked out with Nike's branding, but other country decals didn't have it. Was this a deliberate design choice or an oversight? I dug deeper and found that Rocket League's collab with Nike had some interesting exceptions. It seemed that certain country decals were exempt from the branding. I'm still puzzled - was it a cultural consideration or a commercial decision? Whatever the reason, it's got me thinking about the complexities of branding in the world of gaming and beyond.
