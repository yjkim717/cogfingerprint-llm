As I scrolled through social media in 2022, I noticed how often people use the word "fine" to respond to "how are you?" It got me thinking - what does "fine" really mean? Is it a genuine expression of being okay, or just a way to avoid vulnerability? The word's etymology reveals a complex history, with connotations shifting between mediocre and excellent. In today's digital age, "fine" has become a default response, masking true emotions behind a veil of linguistic nuance.
