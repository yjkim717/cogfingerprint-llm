**The Day My “Boss” Vanished**

It’s weird how quickly trust can erode online, isn’t it? I recently read about a Redditor in Oklahoma who was completely “ghosted” by an employer – hours worked, no pay, just…gone. It really hit me. We live in an age of instant connection, but also incredible isolation. Makes you wonder about the value we place on fleeting digital relationships and the surprising vulnerability of relying on someone you’ve never actually met.  It's a stark reminder to always protect ourselves.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post focusing on a different angle (e.g., the rise of “gig work” issues)?
