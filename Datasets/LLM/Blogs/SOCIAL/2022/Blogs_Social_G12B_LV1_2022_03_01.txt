## The Great Vegetable Hunt of 2022

Remember that *Bluey* episode "Veranda Santa"? It sparked something in me this Christmas. Last year, fueled by holiday spirit (and a desire to sneak more veggies into my kids' diets), I orchestrated a morning surprise. While they slept, I carefully nestled little potatoes and garlic cloves amongst their toys.

The look on their faces when they woke up and discovered a vegetable treasure hunt was priceless! Giggles, confusion, and eventually, surprisingly enthusiastic eating. It was chaotic, silly, and utterly worth it. It reminded me that sometimes, the best memories are made with a little playful absurdity â€“ and a nod to our favorite Aussie cartoon.



Hope your holidays were filled with joy and unexpected vegetable discoveries!
