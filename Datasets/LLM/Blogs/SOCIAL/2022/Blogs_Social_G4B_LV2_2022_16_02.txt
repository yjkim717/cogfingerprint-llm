**The Echo Chamber of “Experts”**

Anyone else feel like the internet’s become a battlefield lately? I’ve been wrestling with this lately, and it’s exhausting. It’s not about disagreements – healthy debate is good! – but this… this insistence on being *right*, even when you’re demonstrably wrong. 

I spent a ridiculous amount of time last week wading through a gaming forum, watching people confidently declare themselves “internet experts” while completely disregarding any evidence to the contrary. It’s the classic ‘trolling behavior’ – not out to be malicious, just determined to be stubbornly, frustratingly incorrect. 

Honestly, it’s a mirror reflecting our own tendency to double-down on what we *want* to believe.  It makes me want to step away, but also reminds me to double-check *everything*.  Anyone else feeling this digital fatigue?

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps add a specific anecdote or focus on a particular aspect?
