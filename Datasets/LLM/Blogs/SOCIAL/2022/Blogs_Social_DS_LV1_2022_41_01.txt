### The Texts That Crossed a Line

It’s 2022, and my phone buzzes. It’s not a friend, but my old high school teacher. Again.

The messages started innocently enough—a “hope you’re well” after graduation. But they’ve become persistent. “We should grab coffee,” he texts, and I feel a familiar knot in my stomach. He knows things about me, private struggles I confided during office hours when I was his student. That knowledge, once a foundation for mentorship, now feels like an imbalance of power he’s unwilling to acknowledge.

It’s made me reflect hard on those invisible lines. The teacher-student relationship is built on a specific trust, and when it continues without the structure of a classroom, the dynamic needs to change. His texts, blurring professional and personal, haven’t evolved. They just feel… inappropriate. It’s a uncomfortable reminder that some boundaries exist for a reason, long after the final bell has rung.
