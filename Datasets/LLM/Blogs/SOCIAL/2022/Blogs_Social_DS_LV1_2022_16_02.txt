It’s 2022, and I’ve been thinking a lot about the state of online gaming forums lately. I remember jumping into a discussion about a new game mechanic, armed with actual patch notes and developer quotes. But instead of a thoughtful exchange, I was met with dismissive comments and trolling from self-proclaimed “experts” who clearly hadn’t even tried the update.

It made me realize how often we see this in broader social spaces, too—people clinging to roles and opinions without the experience or facts to back them up. It’s not just about games; it’s about how we engage with each other. Are we here to learn and share, or just to hear ourselves talk? Sometimes, the digital world feels less like a community and more like a shouting match.
