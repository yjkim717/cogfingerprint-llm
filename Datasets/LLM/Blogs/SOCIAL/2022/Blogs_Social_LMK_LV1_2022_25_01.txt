As I dove into my favorite video game in 2022, I couldn't help but think about how character creation has evolved. One feature that caught my attention was texture mods, allowing players to customize their characters with intricate designs. I started pondering - what if we could take it a step further? Adding face paint and tattoos to the creation suite would be a game-changer. It would not only reflect our personalities but also our cultural identities. The idea resonated with me, and I began to imagine the possibilities. Body art as a form of self-expression could truly come alive.
