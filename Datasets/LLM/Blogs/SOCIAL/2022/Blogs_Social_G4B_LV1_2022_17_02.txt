**The Sticky Situation**

Okay, so 2022 was… a lot. Nursing school was already intense, but then came the clinical rotation. We were swamped with patients, and honestly, the hand sanitizer situation was *constant*.  I remember one particularly quick, accidental finger brush with a patient’s hand – totally fleeting, but it sent me spiraling. 

Suddenly, I was obsessed with washing my hands, like, *constantly*. It was ridiculous. And the worry? Ugh, the emetophobia started creeping in. Just the *thought* of germs triggered this insane anxiety. It felt so isolating, like I was overreacting.  It made me realize how much we’re conditioned to fear contamination, and how that fear can totally hijack your brain.  Anyone else experience something similar?
