As I dove into Monster Hunter Rise on PC in 2022, I found myself yearning for the Switch controls I was used to. I decided to grab my Pro Controller and hook it up via Steam. To my delight, it worked seamlessly! Replicating the Switch controls on PC was a game-changer. I felt right at home, and my gaming experience became more enjoyable. The nostalgia and familiarity were just what I needed to take my hunting skills to the next level.
