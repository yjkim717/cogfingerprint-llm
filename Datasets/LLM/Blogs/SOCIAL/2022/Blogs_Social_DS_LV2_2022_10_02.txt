It’s 2022, and I’m zooted on this prescription, but my mind keeps drifting back to Saigon nights and the hard stuff. Funny how a pill can blur the line between medicine and memory, pulling me into a haze of nostalgia for things I swore I’d left behind. It’s a bittersweet trip, feeling so Vietnamese and so lost, all at once. Anyone else ever get tangled in their own past like this?
