It’s 2022, and I’m staring at these "black triangles" between my teeth, wondering if my Invisalign journey was worth it. I moved cities mid-treatment, and switching providers felt like starting over—except with a hefty bill and no refund in sight. Now, I’m weighing bonding to fix the gaps, but it’s just another expense on top of the retainers waiting in the wings.

Honestly, it’s more than a dental dilemma; it’s a lesson in trusting the process and knowing when to advocate for yourself. If you’re on a similar path, don’t be afraid to ask questions—your smile deserves that much.
