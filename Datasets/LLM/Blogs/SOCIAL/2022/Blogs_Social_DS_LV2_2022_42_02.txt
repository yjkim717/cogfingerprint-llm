My son was so proud when Walmart hired him. But before his first shift, we had to scramble for $50 for the required steel-toed boots. It hit me thenâ€”the cruel irony of low-wage work. The very jobs meant to lift you up often have upfront costs that feel insurmountable. In 2022, with inflation soaring, that $50 was a week of groceries. The system shouldn't put a price tag on a fresh start.
