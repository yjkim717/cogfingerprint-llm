**The Unexpected Journey of a Smile (and a Little Social Anxiety)**

Okay, real talk. Remember when everyone was getting Invisalign? It felt like *everyone* I knew was sporting those clear aligners. I jumped on the bandwagon in early 2022, picturing myself confidently flashing a perfectly aligned smile. The reality? It’s been… more complicated.

I'm seeing a lot of chatter online lately, especially on Reddit, about people switching providers mid-treatment, dealing with unexpected costs, and even those notorious “black triangles.” Honestly, it’s comforting to know I’m not alone in feeling a little blindsided by the whole process.

There's a surprising amount of social anxiety that comes with it too. Suddenly, I was hyper-aware of whether people noticed my trays, if they looked weird, if I was mumbling because of them.  It’s a small thing, but it impacts your confidence. It's made me realize how much we rely on unspoken cues and how much a smile can communicate.  Still working through it, but at least I know I'm not the only one navigating this journey!
