## The Long Road to Being Seen: Finding an ADHD Advocate

It's been a journey, to say the least. For years, I felt like I was navigating life with a missing instruction manual – constantly scattered, perpetually behind, and battling a persistent feeling of “almost.” When I finally voiced my concerns about potential ADHD to a psychologist, I was met with a suggestion to see a psychiatrist, specifically one specializing in adult ADHD, for what they framed as primarily a depressive episode. 

While I appreciate the initial consultation, it felt… dismissive. Thankfully, taking that step and finding a psychiatrist who *genuinely* understood the complexities of adult ADHD has been a game-changer. It's 2022, and finally, I'm feeling validated and equipped to understand myself better. The evaluation process is underway, and for the first time in a long time, I feel hopeful.
