It’s funny how a simple cosmetic item in a game like Rocket League can make you stop and think. When the Nike collab dropped in 2022, I was genuinely excited—until I saw the decals. Some countries got these slick, branded flag designs, while others, like my England flag, felt like an afterthought or just… absent.

Suddenly, it wasn’t just about customization; it felt like a small mirror held up to bigger issues. Who decides what gets represented, and what gets left out? In a game that connects players worldwide, uneven distribution like this creates invisible lines between us. It’s a reminder that fairness, even in virtual spaces, matters. We’re all here to play, to celebrate our teams and pride—so why does it feel like some of us are starting on the back foot?
