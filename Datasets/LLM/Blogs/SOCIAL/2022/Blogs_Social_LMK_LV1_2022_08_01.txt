"The infamous dress debate of 2015 still resonates with me today. I recently found myself pondering the moondrop and sundrop designs from the FNAF universe, and how they eerily echo the divisive color perception phenomenon. Just as people saw the dress as either blue and black or white and gold, moondrop's cool tones and sundrop's warm hues evoke a similar split. It's fascinating to see how our brains process color, and how it can be both personal and subjective."
