In Rick Riordan's latest book, a refreshing change is underway. A strong female leader takes center stage, navigating the challenges of menstruation with dignity. No longer is this natural aspect of womanhood mocked or undermined. As a reader, I felt seen and represented. It's a powerful reminder that representation matters in literature. In 2022, we're still craving authentic portrayals of women and girls. Riordan's thoughtful storytelling is a step in the right direction, celebrating female leadership and normalizing the conversation around periods. A small but significant win for inclusivity and diversity.
