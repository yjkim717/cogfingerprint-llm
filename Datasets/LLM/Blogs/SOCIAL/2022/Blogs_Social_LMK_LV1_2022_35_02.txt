**Rebuilding Bridges: Navigating Friendship with a Friend with BPD**

As I sat on my couch, scrolling through social media, I stumbled upon a post from an old friend. We hadn't spoken in months, not since her hospitalization following a suicide attempt. My heart sank, and a mix of emotions flooded my mind. I had been hesitant to reach out to her, unsure of how to navigate our complicated friendship.

My friend has borderline personality disorder (BPD), and our friendship has been a rollercoaster ride. The intense highs and lows, the dramatic breakups and tearful reunions – it's been exhausting. I've struggled to maintain my own mental health, dealing with anxiety and depression. Reconnecting with her felt like a daunting task, like tiptoeing through a minefield, never knowing when the next explosion would happen.

As I read her post, I felt a pang of guilt for having distanced myself. I wondered if I had abandoned her when she needed me most. But I also remembered the countless times I'd felt drained, anxious, and uncertain about how to support her. The memories of our late-night conversations, her frantic texts, and my own sleepless nights worrying about her – it was all still so raw.

Reaching out to her felt like a risk, but I knew I had to try. I sent her a message, tentatively suggesting we catch up. As I waited for her response, my anxiety spiked. What if she lashed out at me? What if I said something wrong? The what-ifs swirled in my head, making my stomach twist into knots.

When she finally replied, I was relieved. We started talking, slowly rebuilding our connection. It's been a delicate dance, one that requires patience, empathy, and understanding. I'm still figuring out how to balance my own mental health with being a supportive friend. It's not easy, but I'm willing to try. For her, and for me. We're rebuilding bridges, one conversation at a time.
