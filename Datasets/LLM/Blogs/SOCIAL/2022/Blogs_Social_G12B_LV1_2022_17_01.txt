## The Weight of "What Now?" (And a Thousand Miles Between Us)

Okay, real talk. Graduating college felt… weird. Like, I walked across that stage, shook the Dean’s hand, and suddenly the music stopped. There was no fanfare, no clear next step, just… silence. And a whole lot of anxiety bubbling up.

Everyone else seemed to have it figured out, right? LinkedIn profiles polished, job offers in hand, plans for rooftop celebrations. Meanwhile, I was staring at a box of my belongings, trying to mentally pack up four years of memories and a hefty dose of existential dread.

The biggest thing? Moving. A thousand miles away. A thousand miles between me and my best friends, my family, the familiar comfort of my routine. We promised to visit, of course. Weekend trips, holiday gatherings – the whole shebang. But the unspoken fear hung in the air: would things change? Would "us" change?

Social media isn't helping, either. Seeing everyone’s highlight reels just amplifies the feeling that I'm behind. Like I should be slaying at my new job while simultaneously cultivating a perfect apartment and maintaining a thriving social life. 

It's 2022, and everyone's navigating this strange post-pandemic world, figuring out their place. Maybe the uncertainty isn't a weakness, but just… part of the journey.  Maybe "what now?" is a question we all get to grapple with, even if we don't have all the answers.  Right now, I'm choosing to breathe, unpack slowly, and trust that everything will, eventually, be okay.
