As a die-hard Six: The Musical fan and self-proclaimed completionist, I couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment when I browsed the official merchandise shop in 2022. Where was the Jane tote bag? Fellow fans and I took to social media to express our curiosity, wondering why this beloved character was left out. The NYC merchandise hub seemed to have everything, but this one item was noticeably absent â€“ sparking a heated discussion among fans like me.
