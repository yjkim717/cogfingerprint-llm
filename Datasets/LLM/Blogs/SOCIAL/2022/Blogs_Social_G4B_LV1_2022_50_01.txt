**The Power of a Name (and a Face)**

Okay, so 2022 was *weird*, right? Scrolling through TikTok felt like a constant battle for attention, and everyone was obsessed with the latest streaming numbers. It’s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that a massive budget and a flashy marketing campaign are *everything* when it comes to a movie’s success. But I’ve been thinking a lot about this lately, remembering how captivated I was by *Spider-Man: No Way Home*. 

Seriously, that film wasn't just a spectacle; Zendaya was a *huge* draw. It felt like her presence, her energy, genuinely shifted the whole thing. It made me realize we often dismiss the impact of actors – the “box office draw” – way too easily. 

It’s not just about star power, obviously. But seeing how a talented performer could elevate a project, reminding me that sometimes, a familiar face and a compelling story are all you really need.  It’s a good reminder that social media hype doesn’t always equal real impact, and that human connection still matters, even on a big screen.
