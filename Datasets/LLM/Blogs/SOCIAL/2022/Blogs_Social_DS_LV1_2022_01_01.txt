Walking through the virtual car park in Rocket League last week, I spotted a flashy Nike-branded England flag decal. It got me thinking—why just a select few nations? In a game that connects millions worldwide, shouldn’t every country’s flag have its moment?

It’s 2022, and we’re more aware than ever of the importance of representation. Whether in sports, media, or gaming, seeing your identity acknowledged matters. When only certain flags get the branded spotlight, it feels like an unintentional snub to others who are just as passionate.

I’d love to cruise the arena with my heritage proudly displayed, no matter where I’m from. Equal decals wouldn’t just be a cosmetic update—they’d be a small but meaningful nod to inclusivity. After all, isn’t unity what the beautiful game is all about?
