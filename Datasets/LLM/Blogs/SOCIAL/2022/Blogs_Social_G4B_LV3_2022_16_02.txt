**The Echo Chamber Blues**

Anyone else feel like the internet’s become… exhausting? I’ve been spending a lot of time online this year, and honestly, a huge part of it feels like wading through a swamp of unsolicited opinions. It’s not just disagreement – it’s this constant barrage of dismissive attitudes, often layered with absolute *certainty* about things they clearly don’t understand. 

I saw it particularly bad in gaming communities – people instantly tearing down others’ arguments, fueled by frustration and a refusal to actually engage. It’s easy to get sucked in, to feel that urge to defend, to counter. But lately, I’m trying to step back and recognize that a lot of it isn’t about genuine debate. It’s just… noise. And it’s draining.  Maybe a little digital detox is exactly what we all need.
