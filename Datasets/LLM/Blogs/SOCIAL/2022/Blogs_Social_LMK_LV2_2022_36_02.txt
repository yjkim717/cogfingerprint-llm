As I pondered gifting my 7-year-old niece the Circle of Magic series by Tamora Pierce, I reflected on the power of reading to shape young minds. Avidly devouring American Girl and Magic Tree House books, she's ripe for a new adventure. I'd love to hear from fellow book lovers - is Circle of Magic a great fit for a curious 7-year-old? Share your thoughts and help me introduce her to a world of wonder!
