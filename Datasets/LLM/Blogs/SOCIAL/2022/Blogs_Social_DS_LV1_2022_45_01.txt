It’s 2022, and my life has become a careful math problem no one taught me how to solve. I have Type 2 diabetes, and Ozempic has been a lifeline—not just for my blood sugar, but for managing a separate neurological condition, too. But now, there’s a whisper of a shortage, and my insurance company has started playing gatekeeper with my refills.

So, I’ve started rationing. Instead of my weekly injection, I stretch it to nine, sometimes ten days, trying to make this precious liquid last. It’s a gamble. I feel the difference—the creeping fatigue, the unsteady hands—but what’s the alternative? Running out completely?

It feels surreal, having to make these calculations in a country with such advanced medicine. My health feels less like a priority and more like a logistical puzzle where I might be the missing piece. It makes me wonder how many others are out there, silently stretching their doses, hoping the supply chain catches up before our own bodies give out.
