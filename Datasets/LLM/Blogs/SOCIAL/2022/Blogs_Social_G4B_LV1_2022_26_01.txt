**A Little Light at the End of a Long Tunnel**

Okay, so 2022 was… a year. A lot of feeling lost, a lot of just *trying* to keep up. I’d been bouncing between therapists for ages, and honestly, it felt like everyone was telling me I was just “stressed” or “overthinking.” It was exhausting. 

Recently, my psychologist suggested something I hadn’t really considered: a referral to a psychiatrist. It felt a little daunting, like admitting I needed more help than just talk therapy. But it’s a huge relief to finally have someone seriously considering the possibility of ADHD. 

It’s not a magic fix, of course, but just the validation – the feeling that maybe, *just maybe*, there’s a real reason why things have felt so chaotic – is a surprisingly powerful step.  Honestly, it’s a small win, but a really important one.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps generate a post on a different topic?
