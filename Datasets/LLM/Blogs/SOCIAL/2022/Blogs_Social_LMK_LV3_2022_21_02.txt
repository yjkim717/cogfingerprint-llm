"Surviving the Void: A Risk of Rain Conundrum"

As I dove back into Risk of Rain in 2022, I was excited to tackle the latest update - Void Fields. But, boy, was I in for a rude awakening. This new stage has left me questioning its purpose, feeling more like a frustrating hurdle than a challenging addition. The moment I step into Void Fields, the damage output from enemies skyrockets, and the clock starts ticking. The pressure is suffocating. I find myself dying more often than not, struggling to make it through without wiping. The sense of accomplishment that Risk of Rain usually offers is replaced with frustration. Is it really worth the agony? It seems the void is more about survival than enjoyment. I'm left wondering if Void Fields is a test of endurance or just a harsh reality check on my gaming skills.
