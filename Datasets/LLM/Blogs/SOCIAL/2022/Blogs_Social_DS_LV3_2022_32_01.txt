Even at my “healthiest” weight, I still catch myself sucking in my stomach when I walk past a mirror. It’s a reflex born in childhood, a leftover whisper from years of being told my body was something to be fixed.

My journey with my body has been a long one. I chased a smaller number on the scale with a desperation that felt like life or death, and I reached it. But the victory was hollow. The self-consciousness I carried from my youth didn’t magically vanish with the pounds. I was thinner, but I wasn’t freer. My reflection was still a list of flaws, with my stomach as the starring problem.

True change didn’t start with another diet in 2022. It began when I stopped fighting and started listening. Body acceptance isn’t a finish line you cross; it’s a daily, gentle practice of thanking your body for what it does, not punishing it for how it looks. The trauma’s echoes are still there, but now I’m learning to answer them with compassion, not criticism. The goal is no longer a perfect body, but a peaceful mind.
