**The Weight of a Scroll**

Remember those endless scrolling sessions in 2022? We were all doing it, right? And I started noticing something… a really unsettling feeling creeping in. It wasn’t just boredom; it was this constant, low-level self-consciousness about how I looked. 

It started with a glance at my brother’s Instagram – effortlessly fit, always looking good. Suddenly, my own reflection felt… inadequate. It’s a terrible cycle, isn’t it? Comparison is the thief of joy, and social media is its favorite hunting ground. 

I realized I was desperately seeking validation, needing external approval to feel okay about my body.  But the truth is, that kind of validation is fleeting, and it rarely feels genuine.  It’s easy to get lost in the perception others have of you, forgetting to check in with *your own* internal compass. 

It’s a reminder that true self-acceptance isn’t about fitting a mold; it’s about recognizing your worth, regardless of a filtered photo or someone’s fleeting opinion.  It’s a slow, messy process, but one absolutely worth pursuing.
