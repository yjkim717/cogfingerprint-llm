### The Cone of Shame & A Lesson in Patience

It was the summer of 2022, and my new kitten, Luna, was giving me a masterclass in patience. After her spay surgery, I thought we were in the clear. The incision looked good, so I made the rookie mistake of taking her cone off "just for a little while." Big mistake.

A frantic call to the vet later—her incision had reopened and needed to be restitched—and I was wallowing in guilt. The vet was kind but firm. "The cone stays on, and the stitches stay in, for the *full* time. No exceptions."

Those next two weeks were a test. Luna’s sad eyes from inside that plastic lamp shade were a constant reminder of my error. But it taught me a profound social lesson, especially in our post-lockdown world where we’re all eager for quick fixes. True healing, whether for a tiny incision or for our frayed social bonds, can’t be rushed. It requires consistent, sometimes uncomfortable, care. We have to trust the process, even when it’s frustrating. Luna is now perfectly healed, and I’m a little wiser about respecting the timelines that true recovery demands.
