### The Day My PC Had a Meltdown (And So Did I)

Remember 2022? The world was opening back up, but my social life was still running on dial-up. My one true companion was my trusty HP Omen, the portal to my friends and the few hobbies I had left.

Then, the betrayal began. Random shutdowns. A frantic, beeping error code. A cold dread settled in—my PC was overheating. I’d cleaned it, I’d checked the connections, but a "pump speed error" on the liquid cooling system felt like a terminal diagnosis. Staring at that black screen, I didn't just see a hardware failure. I saw my last tether to my community snapping.

It was a stark, whirring and beeping reminder of how fragile our connections can be. We build our worlds around these machines, and sometimes, it takes a complete system crash to realize just how much we rely on them to feel plugged in.
