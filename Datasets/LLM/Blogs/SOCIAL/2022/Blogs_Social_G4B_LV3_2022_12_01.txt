**The Unreliable Signal: When Connection Feels Like a Breakdown**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2022, we’re *constantly* connected. Social media, instant messaging, video calls – it feels like we should be overflowing with connection. But lately, I’ve been battling something frustratingly similar to a computer error: intermittent disconnects. 

It started with a strange feeling – a sense of being ‘off’ when scrolling. Then came the frustrating ‘90B’ error, mirroring that HP Omen shutdown. It’s like my online world keeps crashing, leaving me feeling isolated despite being surrounded by digital noise. 

I realized I was chasing likes and validation instead of genuine engagement. Just like troubleshooting a computer, sometimes you need to step back, re-seat the hardware (re-evaluate your priorities!), and check for overheating (maybe a little digital detox?).  It's a reminder that true connection isn’t about the signal strength, but about the quality of the conversation.
