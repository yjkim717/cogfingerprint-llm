It’s 2022, and I’m still figuring out where to draw the line with digital connections. Recently, an old teacher from high school started texting me—nothing alarming at first, just friendly check-ins. But then the messages kept coming, referencing personal details I never shared publicly. It felt…weird.

I couldn’t shake this uncomfortable feeling, like the boundaries between past and present were blurring in ways I hadn’t signed up for. Teachers hold a special place in our lives, but when does mentorship cross into something else? I started questioning every “How’s your love life?” or “Let’s meet up sometime” text.

It’s made me reflect: in a world where everyone’s just a tap away, how do we protect those professional lines without feeling guilty? Sometimes, silence speaks louder than a reply.
