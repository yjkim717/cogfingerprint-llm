## Did I Just Crack Futurama? (Or Am I Losing It?)

Okay, so I'm down a *serious* rabbit hole tonight. I’ve been rewatching Futurama – because, let's be honest, who *isn't* in 2022? – and something... weird happened. I was watching "The Late Philip J. Fry," and Cubert's scene just…hit differently. 

You know Cubert, the little robot obsessed with brains? Well, during this particular line, his mouth animation *really* looked like he was saying "poop" instead of "brains."  I froze the frame, rewatched it ten times. I even slowed it down! 

Is it just my brain playing tricks on me? Or did some animator slip something hilarious in there that nobody’s noticed? It's that kind of detail that makes me love animation so much - the hidden jokes, the little quirks. I posted about it on Twitter, and the replies are wild.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I'm choosing to believe there's something delightfully subversive going on. Anyone else see it?!

**Notes on Choices & Context (2022):**

*   **Referencing Twitter:** Social media, particularly Twitter, was a major hub for sharing and discussing online discoveries in 2022.
*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Okay, so...", "let's be honest," and "Anyone else see it?!" to create a relatable, casual vibe.
*   **Relatability:** Mentioning rewatching Futurama taps into a shared nostalgic experience for many in 2022 with the revival.
*   **Slightly Humorous:** The post embraces the slightly absurd nature of the discovery and the possibility of being "crazy."
