## That Line Gets Blurry, Doesn’t It?

Okay, so I need to get this off my chest. It's been swirling around in my head for a while now, and honestly, social media hasn’t helped me process it. It’s about a situation I had with a former teacher a few months back. 

I'd reconnected with him on Instagram – totally innocent, I thought. We chatted a little about the school, reminisced about old times. Then, the texts started. Frequent texts. Casual invites to coffee. Nothing overtly *wrong*, but… off. Like a persistent hum of discomfort. 

What really threw me was how he’d mention details about my life that he *shouldn’t* have known. Things I'd only talked about with friends. It felt like a breach, a crossing of a line. It made me intensely uneasy.

It's 2022, and we’re all so hyper-connected. Boundaries feel… fluid. But this made me realize how crucial it is to actively *define* them, especially when there's a power dynamic involved. It’s a weird feeling, questioning someone who was once in a position of authority.  I ended the contact, and honestly, I'm still unpacking it. Have you ever felt that unsettling sense of a boundary being crossed? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
