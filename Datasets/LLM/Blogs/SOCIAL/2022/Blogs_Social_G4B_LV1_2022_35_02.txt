**The Tightrope Walk: When Friendship Meets a Storm**

Honestly, 2022 felt like a year of learning a *lot* about myself, and about the messy, complicated nature of human connection. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about friendship lately, and a particular experience keeps circling back – one that was, frankly, terrifying.

It started with Sarah. She's a brilliant, creative soul, but she’s also living with Borderline Personality Disorder. And let me be clear, learning about BPD was a huge shift. It wasn't about blaming her; it was about understanding the intense emotional swings, the fear of abandonment, and the incredible vulnerability she carried. 

Then came the attempt. It happened suddenly, unexpectedly. The shock was paralyzing. Afterwards, navigating our friendship felt like walking a tightrope over a canyon. There was guilt, confusion, and a deep, aching sadness. I felt pulled between wanting to support her and needing to protect my own mental health. 

It forced me to confront my own anxieties – my fear of confrontation, my tendency to people-please. I realized I needed to set boundaries, to prioritize my well-being while still offering a lifeline. It wasn't about ending the friendship; it was about redefining it. 

It’s a journey, not a destination, and some days are harder than others. But I’m learning that true friendship, especially when it involves mental health challenges, requires honesty, compassion, and a whole lot of self-awareness.
