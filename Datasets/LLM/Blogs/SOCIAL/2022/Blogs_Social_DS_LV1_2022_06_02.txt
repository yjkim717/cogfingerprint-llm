### The Myth of "It Gets Better"

I think we need to retire the phrase “it gets better.” Or at least, stop handing it out like a cheap party favor to people who are drowning.

I’m not saying this from a place of anger, but from a bone-deep exhaustion that has become my default setting. I’m 42, and for over twenty years, I’ve been running on a treadmill that keeps increasing its speed. The 2022 headlines shout about inflation and a possible recession, and all I can do is let out a weary sigh. This isn’t a new storm for me; it’s the same perpetual drizzle I’ve been soaked in since my twenties.

My story isn’t unique, and that’s the point. It’s a slow, grinding saga of systemic poverty. It’s the “good” job that vanished in the 2008 crash, the years of piecing together freelance gigs with no safety net, and the chronic stress that eventually materialized as high blood pressure and insomnia. My body literally started billing me for the anxiety I couldn’t afford to process.

Every time I managed to save a tiny buffer, life sent an invoice: a car repair, a dental emergency, a rent increase. The system isn’t designed for you to get ahead; it’s designed to keep you in a state of managed decline. You’re not living; you’re perpetually catching up.

And the well-meaning advice? “Just learn to code!” or “Have you tried budgeting?” It’s like offering a band-aid to someone with internal bleeding. The problem isn’t a single bad month or a temporary setback. It’s the cumulative weight of decades of instability. It’s the mental exhaustion of constantly performing calculations in your head: *If I skip lunch three days this week, that’s $25 toward the electric bill. If I drive for a rideshare app on Saturday night, maybe I can cover the copay for my medication.*

This isn’t a lack of resilience. This is what happens when resilience is your only resource, and it’s been depleted for years.

So, what do we do instead of saying “it gets better”? Maybe we start by acknowledging that for some, it *doesn’t*. Not without profound, systemic change. We can sit with someone in their frustration without trying to paint a silver lining. We can validate the sheer, unfair grind of it all. Because sometimes, the most powerful thing you can hear when you’re tired isn’t a promise of a distant finish line, but simply, “I see you. I see how hard you’re running. And it’s okay to be tired.”
