It’s 2022, and I’m still thinking about how often we’re told to just “live with” things that disrupt our lives. Like my dad’s tinnitus.

He went to an ENT specialist, hopeful for answers. Instead, he got a shrug. “It’s just earwax,” they said, before brushing off his hearing imbalance like static on an old radio.

Watching him try to mask his frustration broke my heart. How many others are sitting in waiting rooms, only to be dismissed? Healthcare shouldn’t feel like a battle where you have to advocate just to be heard—literally.

It’s a reminder that behind every symptom is a person seeking not just treatment, but understanding. We deserve both. And sometimes, the real imbalance isn’t in our ears, but in the care we receive.
