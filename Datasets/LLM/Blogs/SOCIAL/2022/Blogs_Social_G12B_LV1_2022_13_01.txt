>## The Unexpected Side Effect of a Perfect Smile

Okay, so I’m officially three months into my Invisalign journey, and let me tell you, the before-and-after photos are *almost* worth it. Almost. Because, wow, did I not anticipate this. My throat. It's been… protesting. 

I’m diligently wearing my aligners the recommended 23 hours a day, as per my orthodontist’s instructions, and while my teeth are slowly shifting (progress!), my throat feels like I've been cheering for a stadium crowd. It's a low-grade, persistent soreness. 

Anyone else experiencing this? I've been scouring forums and Reddit threads, desperately seeking solace and suggestions. Warm water? Herbal tea? Apparently, even sucking on a lozenge while wearing aligners is a surprisingly nuanced discussion! It’s a little humbling to realize the perfect smile comes with its own unique set of challenges. Send help (and throat-soothing recommendations) my way! #Invisalign #SmileJourney #AdultBraces #2022
