It’s 2022, and I’m thinking about the power of words. We all know how a harsh insult can sting—but should it land someone in jail? I’ve heard casual, “polite” language that cuts deeper than any crude Schimpfwort. Our laws treat certain speech as a serious Strafbestand, yet overlook the quiet harm in everyday talk. Shouldn’t we focus more on intent and impact, not just the words themselves? It’s a conversation worth having, for the sake of our shared humanity.
