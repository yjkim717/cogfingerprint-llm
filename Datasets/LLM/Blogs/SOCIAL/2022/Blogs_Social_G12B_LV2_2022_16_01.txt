Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and a 2022 context.  I've included a title suggestion at the top.

**Title: The Empty Promise of Digital Excitement**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How much emotional investment we pour into digital things. I was genuinely excited about Overwatch 2. I preordered, fueled by nostalgia for the original and the promise of fresh content. The beta access was a blast – a little taste of what was to come.

Then… silence.

Weeks went by after the official launch, and my preorder felt less like a celebratory purchase and more like a paperweight. Beta access was *over*. My game, essentially, was unusable for a significant chunk of time. It wasn’t a huge deal in the grand scheme of things, but it left a strange, hollow feeling. 

It made me think about the whole landscape of online engagement. We're so bombarded with marketing hype, with promises of instant gratification, and it’s easy to get caught up in the buzz. But sometimes, that excitement leads to disappointment. It’s a good reminder to temper expectations and remember that even the biggest companies can occasionally drop the ball. And maybe, just maybe, to be a little less emotionally invested in pixels.

**Notes on Choices:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "It’s funny, isn’t it?" and "a little taste" to make it feel more like a personal reflection.
*   **Relatable Angle:** I focused on the emotional response (disappointment, feeling misled) rather than just the technical issue.
*   **Reflective:** The ending ties the experience to a broader point about online engagement and managing expectations.
*   **2022 Context:** While subtle, the general feeling of being overwhelmed by online hype resonates with trends in 2022.
