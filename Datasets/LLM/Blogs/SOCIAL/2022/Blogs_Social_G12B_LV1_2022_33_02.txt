## The Lawn and the Dream: When Family Expectations Collide

It's 2022, and the hustle is *real*. I’m in that weird space where I’m technically an adult, paying bills, and meticulously tracking every penny, all in pursuit of a ridiculously large goal: owning a house. It feels like every extra hour I work – and lately, it’s been a *lot* of overtime – is just a tiny chip off a mountain of a down payment. 

Weekends used to be for recharging. Now, they're a strategic allocation of time between grocery runs, apartment chores, and, increasingly, a looming sense of obligation. 

This past Sunday was a prime example. I’d finally managed to squeeze in six extra hours at work on Saturday, feeling utterly drained but buoyed by the extra cash. I was looking forward to a lazy Sunday, maybe catching up on a book, definitely *not* doing anything remotely strenuous.

Then the text came. “Could you tackle the lawn today? It’s getting a bit out of hand.” My parents. Bless their hearts.

Suddenly, my precious day off felt… compromised. It’s not that I don't *want* to help. It’s just… I’m stretched so thin already.  Is it unreasonable to want one day a week where I don't feel like I'm working for someone else, even if that someone is my family? 

It’s a small thing, a lawn. But it feels like a symptom of a bigger issue – the unspoken expectation that as a young adult, I should still be readily available to fulfill family duties, even as I'm scrambling to build my own independent life.  Maybe I'm just feeling the pressure of adulthood intensely.  Anyone else wrestling with this?
