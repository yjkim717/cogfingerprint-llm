>## The Static in My Memory

It's weird how certain things burrow into your brain, isn't it? Lately, I've been haunted by a jingle. Not a catchy, earworm kind of jingle, but a faded, almost ghostly one. It’s buried deep in the static – the kind of background noise you hear when channels bleed into each other late at night. 

It struck me most vividly while rewatching 'A Serious Man' recently. The film's unsettling atmosphere felt amplified by this nagging, familiar tune lurking just beneath the surface. It’s not a song I can place, no specific product or brand comes to mind. Just a series of notes and a muffled, almost mournful melody.

I’ve been mentioning it to friends, describing it like I'm trying to conjure a dream. Does anyone else experience this? These random sonic fragments clinging to the edges of memory, refusing to be fully grasped? It’s strangely comforting, in a way, to know I’m not alone in this pursuit of the elusive. Maybe we're all just collecting static.
