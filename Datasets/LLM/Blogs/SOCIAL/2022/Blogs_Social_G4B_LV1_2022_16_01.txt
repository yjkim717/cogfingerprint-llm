Okay, here's a reflective blog post, aiming for a conversational tone and around 150 words, inspired by the provided summary and set in 2022:

**The Blizzard Betrayal (and Why I’m Questioning Everything)**

Okay, let’s just be real. I was *so* hyped for Overwatch 2. I pre-ordered, I was mentally planning my team comps, I was genuinely excited for a fresh start. Then, BAM – Blizzard pulled the beta access dates. Just…gone. 

It felt incredibly shady, honestly. Like a rug pull after promising a whole new world. I’d sunk money in, and suddenly, there was no clear timeline, no way to actually *play* the game I was paying for.  

It's not just about the money, though. It’s about the feeling of being let down by a company you’ve invested in.  It’s made me question a lot of things about Blizzard’s approach – and frankly, about the whole concept of pre-ordering when things feel so…unstable. 2022 is proving to be a year of big disappointments, it seems.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
