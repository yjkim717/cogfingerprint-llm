>## The Hidden Costs of Starting Out

It’s wild how quickly “adulting” can throw curveballs. My son, fresh out of high school and brimming with excitement about his first real job at Walmart, recently came home with a bit of a downer. Turns out, landing the gig wasn’t the only expense. 

Apparently, Walmart requires a physical exam – a cool $45 – and then there’s the cost to renew his ID, another $30. It just feels…like a lot. He’s already balancing textbooks and ramen noodles, and now this? It’s a reminder of how quickly those seemingly small costs add up when you’re just starting out. Hopefully, the experience and income will be worth it, but it's a tough lesson in the realities of entering the workforce. 2022, huh? Still figuring things out.
