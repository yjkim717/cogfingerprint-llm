## Rewatching Hell's Kitchen & My High School Reunion Anxiety

Okay, confession time: I’ve been deep-diving into old seasons of *Hell’s Kitchen* lately. Specifically, season 9. And it got me thinking about something totally unexpected – high school reunions. 

Watching Elizabeth struggle during that one cooking challenge? It honestly mirrored the dread I felt leading up to my ten-year reunion last year. The pressure to perform, the fear of being judged, the awkward small talk… it was all there! Paul, calmly executing his dish? He was the cool, confident friend effortlessly catching up.  It's wild how a reality cooking show can tap into these universal anxieties, isn't it? Makes me want to order takeout instead of cook tonight.
