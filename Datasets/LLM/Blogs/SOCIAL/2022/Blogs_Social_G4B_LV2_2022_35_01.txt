**The Ghosts in My Crown Vic**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a car can become more than just a way to get from A to B. My old Crown Victoria – affectionately nicknamed “Vic” – has been a constant in my life for years. Lately, though, she’s been throwing a little attitude, stubbornly refusing to start and with a weird, flickering odometer. 

It’s mirroring something I’ve been feeling, honestly. Like a mechanical problem in a car, I’ve been wrestling with a few things lately, feeling stuck and a bit unreliable.  It makes you realize how much we project onto these things – hoping they’ll just *work*. 

Right now, I’m focused on figuring out Vic’s issues, same as I’m trying to sort out my own life.  Maybe a little patience, a few tools, and a good mechanic is all it takes.  Anyone else got a trusty old ride that’s been giving them a little grief?
