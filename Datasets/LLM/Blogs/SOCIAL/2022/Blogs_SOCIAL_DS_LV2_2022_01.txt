It’s 2022, and my work-from-home sanctuary is constantly interrupted by a familiar chime: another "reply-all" to a department-wide email. My manager sends a simple procedural update, and suddenly, my inbox floods with a dozen "Thanks!" or "Got it!" notifications.

I get it—we’re all trying to stay connected and visible in our remote roles. But each unnecessary reply feels like a digital tap on the shoulder, pulling me out of focus. It’s a small thing, but it adds up, turning collaboration into clutter.

I’m torn. Do I speak up and risk sounding nitpicky, or just keep silencing the pings? In this new social landscape of remote work, sometimes the kindest gesture is knowing when not to hit "reply all."
