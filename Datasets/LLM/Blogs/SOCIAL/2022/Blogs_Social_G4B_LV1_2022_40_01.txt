**Finding My Flow (and My People) in Colorado Springs**

Moving to a new place is… a lot. Especially when you’re craving connection. That’s why I’ve been diving headfirst into the yoga scene here in Colorado Springs. I’m hoping to find some studios with a good vibe – places that feel like a real community.  More than just stretching, I’m looking for a group of friends to share this journey with.  It’s amazing how a little movement and a shared practice can open doors to new friendships.  Wish me luck!
