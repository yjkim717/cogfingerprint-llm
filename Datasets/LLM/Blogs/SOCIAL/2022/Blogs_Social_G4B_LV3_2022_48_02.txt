**“Fine” – It’s More Than Just “Okay,” Isn’t It?**

Remember when “fine” just meant…fine? Like, when someone asked how you were, a simple “fine” was the default. But lately, I’ve noticed it’s being used differently. It’s creeping into conversations to describe something genuinely *top tier*.  A restaurant dish? “That’s really fine.” A new song? “The production is just fine.” 

It’s a subtle shift, a little layer of nuance we’re adding. Maybe it reflects a desire to express genuine appreciation – to move beyond the bland ‘okay’ and really acknowledge the quality of something. What do you think?
