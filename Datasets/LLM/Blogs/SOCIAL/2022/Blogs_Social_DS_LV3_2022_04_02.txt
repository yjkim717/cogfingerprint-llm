In the digital sprawl of 2022, my escape hatch was a fantasy roleplay forum. At seventeen, my world felt small, but online, I could build worlds where giants roamed modern cityscapes or clashed on medieval battlefields. It wasn't just about epic scale; it was the shared angst, the collaborative storytelling of characters desperately trying to break free from their confines.

That mutual effort with a stranger—crafting a narrative of conflict and escape—was a powerful social connection. We weren't just two GMT users; we were co-authors in a private universe, finding kinship in building something bigger than ourselves. It taught me that sometimes, the most meaningful social interactions happen when you’re collaboratively pretending to be someone—or something—else entirely, exploring profound themes one post at a time.
