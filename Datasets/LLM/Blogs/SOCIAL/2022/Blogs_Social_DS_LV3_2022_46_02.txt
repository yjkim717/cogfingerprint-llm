That familiar jingle, the one that crackles through the radio static right after a song ends—it’s followed me for years. I first noticed it in the film *A Serious Man*, a moment of eerie resonance. But it wasn’t just there; it was a ghost from old TV, a sonic artifact that countless others have heard without knowing why. In 2022, with so much noise vying for our attention, it’s comforting to share this small, mysterious connection. It reminds me that even in the static, we’re all tuning into the same fleeting frequencies of collective memory.
