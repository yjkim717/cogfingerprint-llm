### The Juggling Act: 2022's Work-Life Puzzle

It’s 2022, and like so many of us, I’m trying to level up. I saw a "Now Hiring" sign at Wegmans and felt a real spark—it’s the kind of place you could build a career. But then, the familiar knot of anxiety tightened in my stomach.

My current gig at Starbucks has been a lifeline, but the schedules are a constant puzzle. How do I tell a potential new manager, "I'd love to join your team, but my other job comes first"? It feels like you're asking for a chance with one foot already out the door.

This balancing act is the modern job search. We’re all just trying to piece together a future without dropping the responsibilities we’re already carrying. Fingers crossed they see my retail experience and not just the complicated calendar.
