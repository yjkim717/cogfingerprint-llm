As I got behind the wheel of the 2018 VW Golf R last week, I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The drive-by-wire system, while technologically advanced, drained the car of its soul. I yearned for the analog driving experience of old, where every shift and turn felt tactile and connected. In an era where manual transmissions are becoming a rarity, I'm on the hunt for a new ride that recaptures that nostalgic car feel. Is it too much to ask for a driving experience that's still raw and unmediated in 2022?
