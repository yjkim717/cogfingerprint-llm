## The Silent Worry Before the Day Begins

It's those little anxieties that really get to you, isn't it? This morning, it’s Bubba, my cat. He’s been dry heaving – that awful, strained sound – but *not* actually bringing anything up. It’s unsettling. The vet's number is already open on my phone, but I'm battling that familiar wave of panic. 

It’s 2022, and we’re all a little more attuned to our anxieties, aren't we? Juggling work, life, and just *being* can feel precarious. And now, adding a sick pet to the mix? It's a lot. I'm staring at him, trying to decide if it's something to rush to the emergency vet or hold off until tomorrow. The guilt of leaving him is already settling in. Anyone else feel like their worries multiply before a workday?
