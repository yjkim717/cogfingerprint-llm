Juggling a new Starbucks gig while chasing my dream job at Wegmans has been a whirlwind. I moved here in 2022 hoping my years at Safeway would count for something, and they did—I landed an interview! But the real test is this delicate dance between paychecks and passion.

My schedule is a patchwork of early morning lattes and hopeful applications. Every time I master a complex drink order, I think, "See? I'm adaptable. Remember this, Wegmans." It’s more than just a transfer; it’s about finding a place that values the hustle. In a world that often feels disconnected, this journey is a powerful reminder that our past experiences aren't just items on a resume—they're the foundation for our next chapter, connecting every step we've taken to where we're meant to be.
