## The Overflowing Bowl & the Endless Scroll

It's funny the things that trigger a bigger thought. I was tinkering with my reef tank the other day – meticulously monitoring the TDS levels after running my RO filter – and it got me thinking about social media. 

See, my RO filter has a storage capacity. You fill it, you use it. Running it constantly, drawing water faster than it can replenish, *technically* isn't ideal. It might affect the water quality, right? And that felt oddly relatable to my scrolling habits.

We’re constantly filling our mental "storage tanks" with content, news, opinions… and it feels like we *should* keep the stream flowing, right? But what happens when we're continuously absorbing without pausing, without letting anything settle? Does the quality of what we're taking in degrade? Does it pollute the clarity of our own thoughts? Maybe it’s time to let the tank refill.



Hope this fits the bill!
