**The Moment My Phone Just… Died**

Okay, real talk. 2022 felt like a year of constant connection, right? Scrolling, liking, sharing – it was exhausting *and* addictive. But last week, my HP Omen desktop, usually a reliable workhorse, just… shut down. Randomly. Like a digital panic attack. It led to a frustrating string of error codes, mirroring the feeling of something suddenly breaking down in my online life.

It got me thinking about how much we rely on these devices, and how easily we can feel adrift without them.  I realized I was spending so much time *performing* online, chasing likes and validation, that I hadn’t actually *connected* with anyone in a genuinely meaningful way.  

Just like my computer needed troubleshooting, maybe we all need to step back and reconnect with the real world – and the real people – around us.  Anyone else had a similar “digital reset” moment lately?
