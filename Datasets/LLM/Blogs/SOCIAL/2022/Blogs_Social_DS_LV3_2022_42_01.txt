It’s 2022, and I’m still thinking about the first time I read a Rick Riordan book that felt like it saw me—not as a stereotype, but as a whole person. His latest heroine isn’t just brave or clever; she’s real. She leads without apology, and yes, she gets her period. No awkward jokes, no hushed tones—just life, authentically woven into her story.

I remember being a teen and feeling like certain experiences were meant to be hidden, especially ones tied to being female. Seeing a character navigate leadership while also dealing with something so normal, so human, was quietly revolutionary. It’s more than representation; it’s permission—to be unashamed, to lead fully, and to embrace every part of who you are. That’s the kind of storytelling that doesn’t just entertain; it changes you.
