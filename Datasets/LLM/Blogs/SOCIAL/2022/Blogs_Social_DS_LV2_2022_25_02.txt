It’s 2022, and I’m unpacking boxes in my new South Carolina apartment, hit by a wave of nostalgia. My old PS2 sits there, and I remember late-night Netplay sessions with friends scattered across the U.S. and even overseas. But here, my connection’s spotty, and those pixelated lobbies feel worlds away.

Finding the right fiber optic provider isn’t just about speed—it’s about bridging distances, preserving those irreplaceable social ties forged over games. It’s funny how a stable internet connection can feel like a lifeline to your people, turning a new house into a home where friends are always within reach.
