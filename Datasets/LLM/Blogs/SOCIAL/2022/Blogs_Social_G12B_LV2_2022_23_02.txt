## Still Obsessed: Why I'm Rewatching 'The L Word' (and Loving That Pilot!)

Okay, confession time: I'm deep into a 'The L Word' rewatch. And wow, that pilot episode *still* hits. The way it throws you headfirst into those complex friendships and simmering romances? Genius. It's wild to revisit this show in 2022 and see how much (and how little) has changed about queer representation on TV. Anyone else a fan?
