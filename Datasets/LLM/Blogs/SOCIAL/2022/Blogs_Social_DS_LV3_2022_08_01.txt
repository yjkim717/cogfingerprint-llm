Remember that viral dress debate from 2015? It’s back—sort of. Moondrop and Sundrop’s interchangeable designs are giving me major flashbacks. One moment, I see a sleek, modern look; the next, it’s whimsical and soft. It’s fascinating how our brains lock onto one perception, just like that infamous dress. In a world full of shifting perspectives, maybe fashion is reminding us that beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder.
