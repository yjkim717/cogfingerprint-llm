Moving to Colorado Springs last year felt like a huge leap, and honestly, a little lonely. Earning my yoga teaching certificate was amazing, but I realized I needed more than just downward dog – I needed connection. As a new resident, building a community has been my focus. I'm hoping to find a great yoga studio and some welcoming groups.  It’s about more than just the poses; it’s about finding those friendships that make a place feel truly like home.  Anyone have recommendations?
