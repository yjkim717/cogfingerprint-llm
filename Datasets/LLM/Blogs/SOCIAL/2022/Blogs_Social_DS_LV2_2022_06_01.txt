It’s 2022, and I’m wrestling with carpenter bees drilling into my porch. They don’t sting, but the wood damage is real. I’ve considered a bee trap, yet something holds me back—maybe it’s their gentle buzz, a reminder that not all nuisances are malicious. In a world quick to push others out, I’m learning to coexist, finding beauty in the hum of life, even when it leaves a few holes behind.
