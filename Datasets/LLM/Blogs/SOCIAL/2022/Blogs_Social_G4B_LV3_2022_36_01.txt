**The Little Things That Matter**

Anyone else feel that pang of disappointment when something you *really* wanted isn't available? I was at *Six: The Musical* in 2022, completely blown away by the show, and was so bummed there wasn't a Jane Doe tote bag. It felt like a little missed opportunity â€“ a tiny piece of the magic that would have stuck with me. It just reminded me how those small, specific fandom items can really resonate. #SixTheMusical #Merch #Completionism
