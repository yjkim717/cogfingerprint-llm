## The Little Things That Sting: Rocket League, National Pride, and Feeling Left Out

Okay, confession time: I’m a little obsessed with Rocket League. It's my go-to for a stress-relieving evening. Recently, I noticed something that just…bugged me. Psyonix has been releasing Nike decals for various national teams, which is pretty cool, right? But scrolling through, I realized something glaringly obvious was missing: an England flag decal. 

Seriously? In 2022, with the World Cup looming, no England representation? It felt like a missed opportunity. I even jokingly tweeted about it, suggesting a cheeky collaboration with Mini – imagine a Team GB decal with that classic Mini silhouette! It’s just a small thing, a cosmetic item in a game, but it highlights how much we crave those little symbols of national pride. And when they're absent, it leaves you feeling a little… overlooked. Anyone else feel me?
