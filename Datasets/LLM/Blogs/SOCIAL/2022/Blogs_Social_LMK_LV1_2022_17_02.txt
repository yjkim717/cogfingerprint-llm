As I stepped into my clinical rotation in the spring of 2022, my emetophobia - a deep-seated fear of vomiting - suddenly became a huge obstacle. Every beeping machine and antiseptic smell transported me back to memories I'd rather forget. Hand hygiene became an obsessive ritual for me; I washed my hands until they were raw, just to feel a semblance of control. My anxiety spiked with every patient interaction, as I worried about potential exposure to illness. I felt like I was walking on eggshells, constantly on the lookout for any sign of distress. Nursing school had prepared me for the technical aspects, but not for the emotional turmoil that came with it. It was a tough journey, but I was determined to push through, one hand sanitized step at a time.
