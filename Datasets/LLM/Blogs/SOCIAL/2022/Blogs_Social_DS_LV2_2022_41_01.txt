### When the School Bell Doesn't Ring for the Last Time

It’s 2022, and we’re all more connected than ever, right? But sometimes, that connection feels… off.

I recently ran into my old high school teacher. It was nice at first—a quick, “Great to see you!” in the DMs. But then the texts kept coming. “We should grab a coffee!” “When are you free?” It moved from flattering to uncomfortable fast.

The real gut-punch was when they casually referenced a private struggle I had back in tenth grade—something I thought was buried in the past. It felt weird, like a boundary had been crossed without me even seeing the line.

It’s a strange new social puzzle: navigating relationships that have outgrown their original context. Just because we *can* be permanently connected doesn't always mean we *should*. Has anyone else felt this? The shift from a respected figure to an overly familiar presence is a jarring reminder that some roles are meant to stay in the past.
