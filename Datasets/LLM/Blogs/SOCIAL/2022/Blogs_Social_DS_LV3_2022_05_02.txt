It was just another Tuesday evening when my phone buzzed with a frantic call from my brother. His voice was tight with panic as he explained how "eBay support" had contacted him about a compromised account, pressuring him to transfer $5,000 immediately through Venmo for "safekeeping." In his rush to secure his profile, he sent the money straight to my account, thinking it was a trusted middle step.

Suddenly, I was holding $5,000 that wasnâ€™t mine, staring at a follow-up message full of sketchy instructions. My gut twisted. Do I follow through and risk feeding a scam, or send it back and hope it truly reaches him? In 2022, digital trust feels so fragile. We navigate apps and platforms daily, but one clever lie can turn our own accounts against us. That night, I learned that in our hyper-connected world, the line between helping a loved one and enabling a fraudster is terrifyingly thin.
