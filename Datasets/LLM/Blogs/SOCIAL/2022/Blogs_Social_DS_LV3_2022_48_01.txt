It’s funny—I never thought much about my auburn hair until 2022, when I noticed something strange. As my hair grew longer, that rich, natural color I loved started fading into a lighter, reddish-brown. It felt like my roots were holding onto the past while the ends were living a sun-bleached life. I’ve been trying to protect it—less sun, gentle products—because dyeing it feels like giving up on what’s authentically me. It’s a small thing, but it’s made me reflect on how we hold onto pieces of ourselves, even as time and change try to soften their edges.
