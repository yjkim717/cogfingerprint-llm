"As I dove back into Noita in 2022, I stumbled upon a game-changing trick that boosted my health max. By leveraging the 'Master of Wounding' perk and downing Ambrosia, I gave my Noita a serious health boost. I swapped my trusty wand for a new strategy, and it paid off. The sense of accomplishment was exhilarating, and I felt more connected to the Noita community, eager to share my discovery with fellow players."
