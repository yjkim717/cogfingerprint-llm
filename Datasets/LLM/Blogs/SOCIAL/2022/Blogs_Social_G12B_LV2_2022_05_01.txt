>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary and instructions. I've aimed for a relatable, conversational tone and a reflective feel, setting it in the 2022 context of widespread remote work.  I've included a title suggestion too.  Let me know what you think!

## The Gentle Art of "Please Don't Reply All"

Remember the early days of working from home? The novelty! The pajama pants! The blissful quiet! Somewhere along the way, for many of us, that quiet got a little… fractured. And often, it’s thanks to a seemingly innocuous email: “Got it!” or “Thanks!” sent as a reply-all confirmation.

I’ve been there. Staring bleary-eyed at my inbox, watching a chain of acknowledgements blossom after a simple question. It’s not *anyone’s* fault, really. It's just… a habit. A digital reflex born from wanting to be helpful, to show you're engaged. 

But in 2022, with our inboxes already overflowing, those extra notifications feel less like helpfulness and more like a constant, low-level hum of distraction. I recently had a colleague subtly suggest (and I use that word deliberately!) a pause on the reply-all confirmations. It sparked a thought: how do we navigate these small social nuances in a remote world? It’s a reminder that even the smallest digital etiquette adjustments can make a big difference to our collective sanity. What are your WFH pet peeves?
