**The Awkward Dance of “Maybe”**

Okay, so 2022 felt *heavy* with unspoken things, didn't it? Scrolling through Instagram, everyone seemed to be living these hyper-curated, perfect lives. But honestly, I was stuck in a weird mental loop about… well, expanding our comfort zones. 

My partner and I were talking about a "3 way," a total curveball. It wasn’t about pressure, more like a shared curiosity mixed with a serious dose of nervousness. The thought was both exciting and terrifying.  It highlighted how much we still navigate intimacy with a strange blend of vulnerability and wanting to *prove* we could handle it.  Anyone else feel like 2022 was all about grappling with the messy, beautiful reality of “maybe”?
