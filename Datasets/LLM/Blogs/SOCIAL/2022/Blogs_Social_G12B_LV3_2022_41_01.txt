>## When "Checking In" Feels…Off

It's 2022, and the lines between professional and personal feel blurrier than ever, especially thanks to social media and instant messaging. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about boundaries, particularly in situations where power dynamics are at play.

A friend recently shared a really unsettling situation with me. They’d finished a class with a teacher they respected, but the teacher started sending texts – suggesting coffee, referencing details from their personal life that were shared *in confidence* during class. It started as seemingly innocent "checking in," but quickly morphed into something uncomfortable and, frankly, inappropriate.

It’s a tricky situation. You want to respect authority, but you *also* deserve to feel safe and respected. It got me thinking - how often do we brush aside those little red flags because we’re hesitant to rock the boat? It's crucial to remember that healthy relationships, whether professional or not, are built on clear, firm boundaries. Don't feel guilty for setting them. Your well-being matters most.
