"As I rolled out my mat in Colorado Springs in 2022, I felt a mix of excitement and nerves. Fresh out of yoga teacher training, I was eager to connect with like-minded folks. I'm on the hunt for COS yoga studios and groups to join forces with. If you're a fellow yogi or studio owner, let's connect! I'm looking forward to sharing my practice and learning from others in the community."
