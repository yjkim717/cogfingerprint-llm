**The Weight of Unexpected Waves**

It feels strange admitting this, but 2022 was…heavy. Not in a dramatic, movie-plot kind of way, but a slow, persistent weight that settled deep in my chest. It started with a diagnosis – melanoma – and honestly, the initial shock just opened the floodgates. Then came the bills. Cancer treatment isn’t cheap, and suddenly, ‘financial hardship’ wasn't some abstract concept; it was *my* reality. 

I felt utterly overwhelmed, like I was drowning in paperwork and worry. Socially, I pulled back. It felt selfish to even *want* company when I was battling so much internally.  It's easy to feel isolated when you’re facing something so intensely personal, especially when healthcare costs are eating away at everything. 

I’m learning that asking for help isn’t a weakness – it’s a lifeline.  And that even on the toughest days, acknowledging the stress is the first step towards finding a little bit of calm.

Would you like me to tweak this draft or generate a different version based on a specific angle you’d like to explore (e.g., focusing more on the social isolation aspect, or offering a slightly more hopeful tone)?
