### The Scariest Yes of My Life

I said “yes” to my first real job offer in the spring of 2022, and my immediate reaction wasn’t excitement—it was pure terror.

Here I was, a freshly minted 21-year-old college graduate, and the map on my screen showed my new life was a twelve-hour drive from everything I’d ever known. My hometown, which had started to feel a little too small, suddenly seemed safe and familiar. My friends were scattering to different cities, and the hardest part was looking at my partner, knowing our movie nights would become FaceTime dates and our “see you tomorrow” would turn into “see you in three months.”

Everyone tells you to chase your career, that this is what we’ve been working for. But no one warns you about the emotional whiplash. Is this the right path, or am I just running toward a fancy job title and away from the people who matter most?

I’m taking the leap anyway, terrified that I’m making the best—or worst—decision of my life. I guess that’s what your early twenties are for: hoping the net will appear.
