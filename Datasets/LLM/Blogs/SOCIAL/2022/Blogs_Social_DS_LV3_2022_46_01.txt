There’s something magical about stumbling upon a forgotten film—like that elusive British movie from the late ‘60s or early ‘70s about a young poet. I can almost picture its stark red, white, and black poster, a one-word title teasing a story that might have sparked later cinematic icons.

It got me thinking about how inspiration works: a quiet, overlooked gem plants a seed that blooms decades later in a festival favorite or a modern classic. In 2022, with so much content at our fingertips, it’s humbling to remember that creativity often draws from these hidden wells. What forgotten stories have shaped the art we love today? Sometimes, the past whispers the future into being.
