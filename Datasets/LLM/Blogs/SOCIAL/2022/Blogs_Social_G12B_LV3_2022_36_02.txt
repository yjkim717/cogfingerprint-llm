## Diving into Tamora Pierce: Is Seven Too Young for the Circle of Magic?

Okay, fellow fantasy lovers, I saw a question pop up in a bookish corner of the internet recently that really struck a chord. A parent was wondering if their seven-year-old, a fan of American Girl, Magic Tree House, and the *Wizard of Oz*, was ready to tackle Tamora Pierce's *Circle of Magic* series. It's a great question! 

Pierceâ€™s books are *wonderful*, but they definitely have a bit more complexity than some introductory fantasy. As a longtime fan myself (I devoured these in middle school!), I know they can be a lot for a younger reader. 

It got me thinking: how do we gauge age appropriateness for books we adore? It's not always about a number, but about a child's individual reading level and emotional maturity. If your little one isn't quite ready, perhaps starting with *Eragon* or *Nevermoor* could be a gentler transition. What are your thoughts?
