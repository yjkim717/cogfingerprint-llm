"Free Speech or Criminal Offense? The Insult Conundrum"

As I scrolled through my social media feed in 2022, I couldn't help but wonder: why are insults still a punishable offense? In Germany, being found guilty of "Beleidigung" can land you in prison for up to a year. Isn't this a relic of the past? With the rise of online discourse, our words have more power than ever. But should they be policed? I believe that freedom of speech is essential, but where do we draw the line? Should we be able to speak our minds without fear of prosecution, or is this a necessary measure to protect citizens from harm?
