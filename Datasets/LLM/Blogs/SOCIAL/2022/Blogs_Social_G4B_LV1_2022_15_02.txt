**The Wilderness Still Feels… Wrong**

Okay, so I’ve been avoiding the Wilderness like the plague since that last patch dropped. It’s weird, right? I used to *love* the chaos, the potential for a good PK battle. But lately, it just feels… hostile. 

I saw a few pkers get wiped pretty spectacularly last week – the new death threat system is brutal. It’s made me seriously question if it’s even worth the risk.  Honestly, it’s shifted my focus. Maybe a little less solo grinding, a little more sticking with the guild.  Anyone else feeling this hesitant about diving back in?
