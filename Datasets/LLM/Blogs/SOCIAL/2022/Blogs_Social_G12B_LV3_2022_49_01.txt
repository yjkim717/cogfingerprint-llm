## The Unexpected Tax Maze of Remote Life

Okay, so here's a situation that's been swirling in my brain (and apparently, a lot of other people’s too!). I'm a US citizen, but I’ve got my Canadian Permanent Resident status – a bit of a dual life, right? Then, 2022 hit, and suddenly remote work became *the* thing. I landed a fantastic role… based entirely in the US. 

Now, the questions started piling up. Do I *still* need to file Canadian taxes? My income is flowing into a US bank account, I’m doing US-based work… it feels a little complicated! It's a reminder that navigating global citizenship and the gig economy isn't always straightforward. It’s definitely spurred me to dig deeper into the details – and maybe chat with a tax pro! Anyone else feeling this cross-border confusion?
