It’s 2022, and my sister texted me in a panic: “My 7-year-old is devouring books faster than I can buy them. Is Tamora Pierce’s Circle of Magic okay for her age?” I paused, remembering my own journey into children’s literature.

It’s a beautiful dilemma, isn’t it? Watching young readers hunger for more complex worlds. Pierce’s series, with its themes of friendship and self-discovery, is wonderfully age-appropriate for advanced readers. It doesn’t talk down to them but welcomes them into a richer narrative.

These moments remind me how vital it is to nurture a child’s literary curiosity gently. In a digital age, that spark—the magic of getting lost in a book—is a gift we should protect and encourage together.
