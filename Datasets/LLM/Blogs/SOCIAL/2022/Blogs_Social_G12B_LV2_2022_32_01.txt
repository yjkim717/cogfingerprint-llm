## The Scale Said "Healthy," But My Brain Still Remembered

It’s weird, isn’t it? How something as simple as a number on a scale can hold so much baggage? I finally hit a weight I’d been working towards for… well, let’s just say a *long* time. My doctor says I’m healthy. My clothes fit better. I *feel* better. Logically, I should be celebrating, right?

And I *am* happy, genuinely. But there’s this… echo. A little voice in the back of my head whispering all the old insecurities. The ones from years of feeling like I wasn’t “enough.” It’s like my body remembers the years of restrictive diets and punishing workouts, even if my mind is trying to move on.

Social media hasn't helped, obviously. Scrolling through perfectly curated feeds, it’s easy to fall back into that comparison trap. I’ve been trying to be more mindful about what I consume online, unfollowing accounts that trigger those old feelings. It’s a work in progress.

Honestly, it’s a reminder that achieving a healthy weight is just *one* piece of the puzzle. The real work is untangling the years of negative self-talk and learning to truly love and accept myself, regardless of the number on the scale. It’s a journey, and I’m learning to be kinder to myself along the way.
