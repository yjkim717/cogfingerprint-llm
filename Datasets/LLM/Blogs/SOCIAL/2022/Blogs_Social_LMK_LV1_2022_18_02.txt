"I recently fell victim to a potential shipping scam on OfferUp. I purchased a graphics card and received a tracking number, but it kept showing 'processed at a USPS facility.' Days turned into a frustrating wait. Was I being scammed? I realized I wasn't alone - many users have reported similar experiences. To avoid falling prey, be cautious when transactions seem too good (or suspicious) and verify the seller's credibility. Stay vigilant when buying online!"
