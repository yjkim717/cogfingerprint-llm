### The Scale Can't Measure My Peace

For most of my life, my self-worth was a number on a scale. In 2022, you’d think we’d be past this, right? With all the body positivity on our feeds, it felt like I was the only one still fighting a silent war with my reflection.

My journey was a rollercoaster of extremes—crash diets, frantic gym sessions, and the fleeting high of a smaller jeans size, only to be followed by the inevitable slump and regain. I finally reached what my doctor called a "healthy weight," but my mind hadn't gotten the memo. I’d still catch myself sucking in my stomach in photos or avoiding hugs so people wouldn't feel… well, me.

The goal was no longer to shrink my body, but to quiet that voice. It’s a daily practice, some days harder than others, but I’m learning that true health isn’t a dress size—it’s the peace I feel when I no longer see an enemy in the mirror.
