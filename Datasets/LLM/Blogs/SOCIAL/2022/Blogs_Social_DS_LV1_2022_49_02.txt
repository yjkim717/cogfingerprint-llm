Itâ€™s wild how a Sims household in Willow Creek taught me something about real life in 2022. I installed an extreme violence mod, set my Sim on an autonomous killing spree, and just watched the chaos unfold. But Eliza Pancakes, of all people, fought back and killed my Sim instead.

It made me reflect: we often create conflict expecting to win, never anticipating the consequences or the resilience in others. That digital revenge mission felt eerily symbolic of how quickly real-world arguments can spiral. Sometimes, the pixels hold up a mirror.
