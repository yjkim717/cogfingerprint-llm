"Embracing the Unknown: My Long-Distance Leap of Faith in 2022. As I stood in my empty apartment, surrounded by half-packed boxes and a mix of emotions, I couldn't help but wonder if I was making a huge mistake. Just a few months ago, I was celebrating my college graduation, surrounded by loved ones. Now, I was preparing to move 1500 miles away from everything and everyone I knew for a new job. The excitement of starting my career was overshadowed by the anxiety of relocating to a new city alone. As a 21-year-old, the thought of navigating unfamiliar streets and making new friends was daunting. But I took a deep breath, reminded myself of my goals, and stepped into the unknown. I'm trading in my comfort zone for a chance to grow and discover new aspects of myself. Wish me luck - I'm about to take on 2022!"
