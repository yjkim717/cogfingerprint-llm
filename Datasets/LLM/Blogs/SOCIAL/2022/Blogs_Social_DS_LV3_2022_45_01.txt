It’s 2022, and I never imagined my life would revolve around a tiny glass vial and a calendar. As someone managing type 2 diabetes, Ozempic has been a lifeline—not just for blood sugar, but for the quieting of a constant, neurological static that made every day feel uphill. So, when the shortage hit, my stomach dropped.

My prescription was secure, but the pharmacy shelves were not. I stared at my 16-dose supply, doing the math. My insurance wouldn’t approve a refill for three months. Panic started to whisper in my ear.

That’s when I made the decision with my doctor: stretch it. I moved my injection from every seven days to every eight. It’s a small shift on paper, but it feels enormous in practice. It’s a gamble, a personal experiment in rationing health. I’m hyper-aware of my body now, listening for any sign that the extended interval is costing me. This shortage isn’t just an inconvenience; it’s a stark reminder of how fragile the systems we rely on truly are, and how a global supply chain issue lands squarely in my kitchen, every eighth day.
