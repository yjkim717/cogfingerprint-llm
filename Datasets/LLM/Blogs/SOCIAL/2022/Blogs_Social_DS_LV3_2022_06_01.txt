It’s 2022, and the storms have taken out my carpenter bee trap—again. I’m left staring at the chewed-up wood of my porch, wondering why I keep fighting these little drillers. They’re harmless, really, but relentless. I’ve tried every wood treatment, yet they return like stubborn neighbors. Maybe it’s not about winning, but learning to coexist with the small forces of nature that remind us we don’t always have control.
