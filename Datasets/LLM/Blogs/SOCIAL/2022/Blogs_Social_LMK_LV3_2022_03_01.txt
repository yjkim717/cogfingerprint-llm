As I sipped hot cocoa on our veranda on Christmas morning 2022, I recreated a magical moment from Bluey's "Veranda Santa" episode with my kids. We laughed and marveled as "Santa" left surprises. Inspired by the show, we made the morning special, creating memories that will last a lifetime. This heartwarming experience reinforced the value of family traditions and the joy of simple, festive moments together.
