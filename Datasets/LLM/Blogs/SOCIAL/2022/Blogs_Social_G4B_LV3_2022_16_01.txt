**The Weight of a Promise Broken**

Remember that feeling when you really *believed* in something? Like, you were holding your breath, anticipating something amazing? I had that with Overwatch 2. The pre-order hype was real, Blizzard’s promises of a revamped hero shooter felt incredible. 

Then came the beta – a chaotic mess of limited access and confusing changes. It wasn’t just frustrating; it felt like a betrayal.  Suddenly, that pre-order felt less like an investment and more like a sunk cost.  You pour time and money into something, and it doesn’t deliver, and it’s a sharp, stinging disappointment. 

It’s a weird feeling, isn’t it? Like a little crack in your faith in a company, a reminder that even the biggest brands can let you down.  It’s made me think a lot about trusting expectations, and the quiet sadness of a promise broken.
