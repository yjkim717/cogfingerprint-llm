**The Weight of a Big Shadow**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a digital space – a Reddit chat, really – can suddenly feel like it’s holding a surprising amount of weight. I stumbled across a post recently about a 17-year-old roleplayer looking for a partner for a story. The core of it? A giant. Not a friendly, helpful giant, but one steeped in terror, a symbol of escape and a whole lot of angst. 

It made me think about how we all crave connection, but sometimes we’re drawn to the *big* things – the dramatic, the intense.  We want stories that mirror our own internal struggles, that feel like a dark reflection of our anxieties.  Maybe it’s a desire to feel small, to be rescued by something colossal. 

It’s a strange comfort, isn’t it, to find someone else wrestling with a giant shadow within their own world? 2022 felt heavy, and sometimes, a shared fictional struggle is all you need.
