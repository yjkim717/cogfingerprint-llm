**The Phantom Graphics Card**

It’s weird how easily you can get sucked into the online vortex, right? Last fall, I spotted a ridiculously cheap graphics card on OfferUp. The seller seemed legit, even sent a tracking label – which, of course, never moved. Just a static image. It felt…off. Like a digital ghost. 

Honestly, it was a tiny thing, but it really got me thinking about online fraud and how easily we trust things we see without verifying. It’s a reminder to always be skeptical, even when a tracking number looks real.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic using the same keywords?
