>## The Echo of English and the Slow Fade of Enthusiasm

Okay, so I've been trying to learn Finnish and Hindi. Seriously trying. Duolingo streaks, flashcards, the whole shebang. It started with such vibrant enthusiasm! I pictured myself confidently ordering *kahvi* in Helsinki and haggling for spices in Delhi. The reality, though, has been a little…deflating.

It’s this weird thing that keeps happening. I'll bravely attempt a sentence in Finnish, a tentative greeting in Hindi, and almost invariably, someone responds in English. It's not malicious, not at all. People are just… helpful? Eager to bridge the gap? But it completely derails the process. The opportunity to actually *use* the language, to stumble and learn from mistakes, vanishes.

It’s like a little part of my motivation wilts with each English reply. It's 2022, and the global reach of English is undeniable, but it’s also a frustrating barrier to truly connecting with cultures I admire. I’m trying to recalibrate, find more dedicated practice spaces, but it’s a constant reminder of that linguistic dominance. Anyone else feel this struggle?
