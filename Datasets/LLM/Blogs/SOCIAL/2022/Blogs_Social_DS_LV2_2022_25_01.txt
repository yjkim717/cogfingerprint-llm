Remember those early pandemic Zoom calls? Weâ€™d all show up in our little boxes, trying to project a polished version of ourselves. It felt like we were all wearing a kind of digital face paint, carefully curated for public consumption.

Fast forward to 2022, and that performative energy has started to feel exhausting. I see it everywhere, even in my gaming life. I was customizing a wrestler recently, diving into texture mods and creation suites, and it hit me: we're all just building our avatars, our personal "caws" for the world to see.

But lately, I find myself craving less customization and more authenticity. I wonder if the most radical act of creation now is just showing up as we are, without the digital paint.
