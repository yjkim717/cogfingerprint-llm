**The Weight of a Little Cone**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a tiny plastic cone can suddenly feel like a monumental worry? My sweet Luna was recently spayed, and honestly, the first few days were a blur of anxious glances at her stitches and a whole lot of whispering.  The vet was clear – patience is key, but the worry… that’s a different beast.  It’s a reminder that even the most routine moments, like a cat’s recovery, can trigger a surprising wave of protective instinct.  Social media felt overwhelming – everyone’s perfect little updates! – and I just needed to be *present* with Luna.
