### The Unwritten Rules of the Wild

It’s funny how a video game can mirror real life. I was deep in the Wilderness the other day, just trying to gather some cursed energy for a crafting project. I had my PvP flag off, trusting the game’s threat system to keep me safe from dedicated PKers.

Then I saw him—another player, just standing there. He wasn’t attacking, but his presence alone was a palpable threat. My heart started racing. I was safe by the rules, but the *feeling* of danger was 100% real.

It made me think about 2022. We all operate with our own "threat systems" and safety settings—our boundaries. But sometimes, just the potential for conflict, that unspoken tension in a room or a comment section, puts you on edge. You can be technically "safe" from a direct attack, yet still feel the wilderness around you. It’s a reminder that our social worlds, much like this digital one, are governed by both hard rules and the far more unpredictable nature of human presence.
