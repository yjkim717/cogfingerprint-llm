As I scrolled through HardwareSwap during the 2022 Christmas sale, I stumbled upon a gem - a sealed EVGA RTX 3080 Ti graphics card for $800 OBO. The seller had originally paid $1,500, but was now letting it go for a steal. I couldn't help but think about the social dynamics at play. People upgrading to newer models, and others snatching up deals. It's a reminder that in the world of tech, value is fleeting.
