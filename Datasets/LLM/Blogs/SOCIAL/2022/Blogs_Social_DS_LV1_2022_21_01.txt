Remember the satisfying, solid *thunk* of my old Civic’s door? That car was a conversation. The steering wheel chattered back, the shifter clicked into place with a mechanical certainty you could feel in your bones. It was raw, unfiltered.

Then, last week, I test-drove a 2022 model. It was brilliant—silent, swift, and surgically precise. But it felt like driving a supremely competent computer. The "road feel" was a digital simulation.

It left me wondering in our increasingly "by wire" world, what have we traded for that perfection? Are we losing the gritty, analog soul that made driving feel less like a task and more like a tactile, human dance with the road?
