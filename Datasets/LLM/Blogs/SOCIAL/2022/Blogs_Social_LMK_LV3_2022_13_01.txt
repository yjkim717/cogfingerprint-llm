"As I navigated the world of Invisalign in 2022, I encountered an unexpected challenge: persistent sore throats after getting sick. With a required 23 hours of aligner wear, I struggled to find relief. I discovered that maintaining good oral care and exploring soothing remedies were key to alleviating discomfort. By sharing my experience, I hope to help others facing similar issues. Simple changes, like gargling with salt water and prioritizing hydration, made a significant difference. By being open about our struggles, we can support one another in our journey to a healthier, happier smile."
