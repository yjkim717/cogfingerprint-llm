The Frustrating Reality of Language Learning

As I strolled through the streets of Helsinki in 2022, I felt a surge of excitement to practice my Finnish skills. But, as I approached a local caf√©, my enthusiasm was quickly dampened. I mustered up the courage to order in Finnish, but the barista immediately responded in perfect English. I was taken aback. Why didn't they want to chat in their native language? I've had similar experiences with Hindi, where native speakers switch to English, seemingly out of habit or convenience. It's discouraging, to say the least. As a language learner, I crave the opportunity to practice and improve. When native speakers default to English, it feels like they're depriving me of that chance. I wish they could understand that it's not that I don't appreciate their English skills, it's just that I want to learn theirs. A little encouragement would go a long way in keeping me motivated to continue my language learning journey.
