It’s 2022, and I’m sitting here staring at another stack of medical bills, wondering how a diagnosis of malignant melanoma could upend so much more than just my health. I’ve always lived paycheck to paycheck, but cancer treatments don’t care about your budget.

I remember the relief when I hit my out-of-pocket max—until I realized that “relief” still meant thousands I didn’t have. Financial aid applications became my second job, a humbling maze of paperwork and pleas. It’s a strange battle: fighting for your life while fighting to afford it.

This journey has taught me that illness isn’t just physical—it’s a social and financial earthquake. No one should have to choose between health and debt.
