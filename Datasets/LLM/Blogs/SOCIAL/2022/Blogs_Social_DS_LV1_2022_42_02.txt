My son was so excited to land that Walmart job offer in 2022. But the "start-up costs" hit hard. First, a $50 physical. Then, a trip to the DMV to renew his expired license. It all added up before he'd even earned a single paycheck. It makes you wonder how many eager workers get stuck at this financial gate, especially when you hear about companies struggling to fill positions. The path to employment shouldn't start with a bill you can't afford to pay.
