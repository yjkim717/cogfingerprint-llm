**Ghosted by a Memory**

Okay, so this is weird to even write about, but I need to get it off my chest. Last fall, I started getting… texts. From a guy I hadn’t thought about in years – my high school science teacher. Seriously. It was so jarring. 

He’d just send random, slightly cryptic messages, and it felt *immediately* uncomfortable. Like, a really prickly, unsettling vibe. I tried to ignore it, delete them, you know? But he kept going. It felt like a digital ghost, re-appearing after all this time. 

Social media just amplified the creep factor. Seeing his profile, knowing he was still active… it made me feel incredibly vulnerable. I blocked him, obviously, but it still left this weird, lingering feeling. It made me think about how easily the past can resurface, and how unsettling it can be when boundaries get blurred.  Anyone else have a similar experience?
