It was the summer of 2022, and I was hosting a steady stream of out-of-town guests, all eager to reconnect after years of limited travel. My trusty reverse osmosis filter was working overtime to keep everyone hydrated. I’d fill a pitcher, and someone would immediately empty it, pushing the system into continuous operation without letting the storage tank refill.

I didn’t think much of it until I noticed the water tasted… flat. A quick TDS test confirmed my suspicion—the quality had dipped. It was a small but powerful reminder that even the most reliable systems have their limits. Just like my own social energy, constantly giving without pause eventually affects the quality of what you offer. It taught me the importance of building in moments of rest, for both machines and people.
