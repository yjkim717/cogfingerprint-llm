As I booted up Monster Hunter Rise on my PC via Steam in 2022, I found myself stuck on a frustrating issue - syncing my Switch controls. I wasn't alone; many players were seeking help online. This got me thinking - how often do we struggle to adapt to new platforms, not just in gaming, but in our daily lives? Embracing change can be tough, but with a little patience, we can master the new controls and thrive.
