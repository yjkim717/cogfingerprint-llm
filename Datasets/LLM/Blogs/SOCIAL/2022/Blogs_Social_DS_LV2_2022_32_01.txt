### The Mirror and Me: A Lifelong Conversation

It’s 2022, and my entire life, my body has felt less like a home and more like a project. I can trace the timeline not in years, but in sizes—the too-skinny jeans from a desperate diet, the baggy sweaters bought to hide in, the “goal” dress hanging in my closet like a taunt.

I’ve spent more energy calculating calories and critiquing my reflection than on almost anything else. It’s exhausting.

But lately, something’s shifted. Maybe it’s seeing more real, unedited bodies online, or just the sheer fatigue of the fight. I’m trying to change the conversation with myself. It’s not about loving every part, not yet. It’s about acceptance. It’s about thanking my legs for carrying me and my arms for holding those I love.

The goal isn’t a number on a scale anymore; it’s a feeling of peace. It’s a quiet confidence that comes from realizing my worth was never in my waistline. The project is finally over. The journey home has begun.
