**The Static in My Head Lately**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2022 has felt…off. Like there’s this low-level static buzzing in my head, a feeling I can’t quite shake. It started with a dream – a *really* intense dream – and it’s been pulling at me ever since. 

It wasn’t a typical nightmare, more like a fragmented memory of something that never actually happened.  I found myself piecing together a story of a completely fabricated family history, a tangled web of lies stretching back generations. It felt…urgent, like I was meant to *know* something, to uncover a truth buried deep.

And then, the conspiracy theories started to creep in. Not the wild, outlandish kind, but a chilling sense that powerful people had deliberately shaped events, manipulating narratives for their own gain. It’s unsettling to think about how easily reality can be distorted, how readily we accept stories without questioning their source.

I’ve been spending a lot of time lately just trying to ground myself, to remember what feels real. It’s a strange feeling – confronting the possibility that the foundation of my identity, my understanding of the world, might be built on something shaky. 

Maybe it’s just stress, maybe it’s the constant barrage of information we’re all subjected to. But this dream, this creeping sense of unease… it’s making me think about the importance of seeking out authentic connections and challenging the narratives we’re fed.  What do you guys think? Are you feeling this kind of unsettling static too?
