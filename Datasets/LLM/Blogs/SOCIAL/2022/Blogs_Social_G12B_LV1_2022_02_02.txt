Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the Noita summary, framed within a 2022 social media context, aiming for a conversational tone and storytelling:

## The Algorithm & the Overflow

Remember when everyone was chasing "optimizing" their Instagram feed in 2022?  I got sucked in, too, trying to game the algorithm. It felt like finding a secret exploit, like boosting your max health in a game. But chasing those fleeting engagement spikes feltâ€¦hollow.  Like pouring energy into something that just kept demanding more.  Maybe true connection isn't about maximizing, but about finding *your* little wand, your authentic voice, and letting that be enough.
