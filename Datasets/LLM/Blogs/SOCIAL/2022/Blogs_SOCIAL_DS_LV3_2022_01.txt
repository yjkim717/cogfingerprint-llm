It’s 2022, and here I am, working from my kitchen table, surrounded by the gentle hum of my laptop and a flood of email notifications. Lately, one little habit in our department has been quietly chipping away at my focus: the dreaded "reply-all" for simple acknowledgments.

I get it—we’re all trying to stay connected and show we’re on the same page. But each “got it” or “thanks!” sent to the entire team adds up, burying meaningful updates under a mountain of digital noise. It’s not just about inbox clutter; it’s the constant pings pulling us out of deep work, making remote collaboration feel more chaotic than cohesive.

So, I’m wondering: could we rethink our social norms around email? A small shift in our digital etiquette might just give us back the quiet focus we’re all craving.
