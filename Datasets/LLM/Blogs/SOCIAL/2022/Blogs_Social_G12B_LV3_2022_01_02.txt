## The Unexpected Kindness of Rocket League Trading

Okay, confession time: my Rocket League inventory was a *mess* last year. Blueprints piled up, items I’d long forgotten. Then I saw someone offering credits for inventory clears – a lifeline! It felt a little odd, but the generosity of strangers in that game, helping me streamline my setup, was surprisingly heartwarming. It’s a small thing, but it reminded me that even in online spaces, genuine connection and a little help can go a long way.
