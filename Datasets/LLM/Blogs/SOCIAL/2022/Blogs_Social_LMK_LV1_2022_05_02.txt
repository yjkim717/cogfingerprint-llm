"A Close Call with Online Scammers"

Last week, my brother received a suspicious call that had me on high alert. The caller claimed to be from eBay, stating that he'd received a $5,000 transfer by mistake and needed to return it. My brother was taken aback, but I immediately sensed something fishy. The caller had a thick Indian accent and was pushing my brother to use a money transfer service to return the funds. I quickly intervened, warning my brother that this was likely a scam. We did some research and, sure enough, numerous reports of similar calls flooded our search results. It turned out the scammers were trying to get my brother to divulge his Venmo account info. I was relieved that we caught on to it, but it got me thinking - how many others fall prey to these phone spam tactics? As we navigate the online world in 2022, it's more crucial than ever to stay vigilant and educate ourselves on the latest scams.
