## The Spice of Things & Unexpected Memories

Okay, so, new job, right? Big change. Everyone says it's exciting, and it *is*, in a stressful, figuring-everything-out kind of way. Last week, I had a particularly weird day. There was a mix-up about my medication at work – a totally innocent misunderstanding, but it threw me for a loop. Suddenly, I was hit with this wave of… nostalgia? It sounds crazy, but it brought back memories of a time when I was experimenting, trying to find my place, that whole early twenties thing. 

It was fleeting, this feeling, and honestly a little unsettling. It reminded me how far I've come, and how much I appreciate the stability I have now. Just a reminder that even the most mundane moments can unlock a flood of unexpected memories, huh? Anyone else ever experience anything like that?
