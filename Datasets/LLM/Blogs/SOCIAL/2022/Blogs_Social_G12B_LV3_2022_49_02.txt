## When My Sims Got Served (and I Wanted Revenge)

Okay, so I need to vent about something that happened in my Sims 4 game last night. I’ve been playing for *years*, and I thought I'd seen it all. Turns out, I was wrong. My Sim, bless their oblivious heart, just mildly annoyed Eliza Pancakes. Just a little playful teasing, you know? Harmless stuff. 

Then, BAM! Eliza snapped. Like, full-on, unexpected rage. She chased my Sim down and… well, let’s just say it involved a tragic gardening accident. Seriously, who knew Eliza Pancakes had it in her?! 

Now, I’m not proud of what happened next. Let's just say I downloaded a *certain* mod. It’s 2022, and sometimes you just need a little digital revenge to process the shock of a virtual betrayal, right? Don't judge me! It was cathartic.
