"Breaking Taboos: The Power of Representation in Young Adult Literature. Rick Riordan's latest book is a game-changer for young readers, especially girls. His 14-year-old protagonist embodies female leadership, taking charge of her team with confidence and strength. What's more, she openly discusses her menstruation, normalizing a natural aspect of life often stigmatized. By doing so, Riordan shatters taboos and promotes representation, empowering young women to own their identities. As we navigate 2022, it's refreshing to see literature evolve, celebrating diverse voices and experiences that inspire a new generation."
