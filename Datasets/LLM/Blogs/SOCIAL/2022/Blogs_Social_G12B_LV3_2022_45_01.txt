## When Your Medicine Disappears: Navigating the Ozempic Shortage

It's unsettling, isn’t it? That feeling when something you rely on, something essential for managing your health, suddenly vanishes. That's been my reality lately. Like so many others, I’ve been affected by the Ozempic shortage. Living with diabetes *and* a neurological condition means consistent medication is more than just a preference – it’s stability. 

When my prescription ran low and insurance coverage stalled, panic set in. But then, a little ingenuity (and a lot of conversations with my doctor!) led to a temporary solution: carefully spacing out injections. It’s not ideal, and it’s definitely not a long-term fix, but it’s buying me time while I navigate this frustrating situation. It's a stark reminder of how fragile our access to healthcare can be. Anyone else facing similar challenges?
