## Finding My Tribe in Colorado Springs

Moving to Colorado Springs in 2022 felt exciting, but also a little lonely. I craved connection, a sense of community. Yoga seemed like the perfect place to start! Searching for studios wasn't just about poses; it was about finding *people*. That shared space, that breath, felt like a doorway to friendships I hadn't realized I was missing. It's amazing how a downward dog can lead to a genuine smile and a new friend.
