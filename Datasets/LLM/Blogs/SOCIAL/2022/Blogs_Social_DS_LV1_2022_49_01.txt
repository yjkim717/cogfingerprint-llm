Sipping my morning coffee in Vancouver, I couldn't help but reflect on how 2022 reshaped our understanding of "home." My US passport and Canadian PR card sat side by side on the kitchen counter—tangible proof that identity isn't bound by borders anymore. Working remotely for my American employer while building a life here made me realize how many of us now navigate multiple national allegiances. The real tax return wasn't just about dollars—it was about acknowledging we belong to interconnected communities, not just places.
