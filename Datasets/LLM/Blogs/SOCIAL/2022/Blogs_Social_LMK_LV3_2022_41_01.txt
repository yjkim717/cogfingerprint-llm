"When Boundaries Blur"

As I scrolled through my phone, a familiar name caught my eye - my old science teacher, now an acquaintance. We'd parted ways years ago, but their texts had become a regular occurrence. At first, it was harmless, just checking in. But soon, the messages turned frequent and suggestive - "Let's grab coffee" or "Want to study together?" The unease crept in as I realized my discomfort wasn't just about the messages, but the fact that they knew intimate details about my private life. As their former student, I'd shared personal struggles with them, seeking guidance. Now, their knowledge felt like a weight. I needed to re-establish boundaries, reminding myself that their role was no longer that of a teacher, but an individual in my social circle. It was time to communicate my limits and respect my own needs.
