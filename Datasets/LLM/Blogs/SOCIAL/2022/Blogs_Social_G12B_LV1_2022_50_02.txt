>## When the Visuals Tell a *Different* Story

Okay, so I’ve been thinking a lot about music videos lately. Not just the flashy, dance-heavy ones, but the ones that genuinely *do* something with the song itself. Like, completely twist its meaning. Remember when Olivia Rodrigo’s “Good 4 U” video came out? Everyone was already dissecting the breakup lyrics, but the 90s, teen-movie-gone-wrong aesthetic took it to a whole other level. 

It got me wondering: are we, as listeners, too quick to accept the surface narrative? Sometimes, a director's vision can offer a fascinating, even unsettling, counterpoint to the words we’ve been hearing. It’s a beautiful kind of creative collision, isn’t it? What music videos have *you* seen that completely flipped your understanding of a song? Let me know!
