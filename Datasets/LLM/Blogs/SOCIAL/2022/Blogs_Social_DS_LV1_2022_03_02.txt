It’s 2022, and I’m at Go Fest surrounded by adults grumbling about Niantic’s latest changes. Then I see a kid nearby, phone held high, jumping with joy after finding a shiny Axew. It hit me: while we’re busy critiquing every update, the magic of Pokémon Go still works perfectly for them. Their excitement was pure, unfiltered—a reminder that sometimes, the real catch isn’t a rare Pokémon, but that spark of childhood wonder we’ve let slip away.
