### The Space Between Friendship and Self-Preservation

It’s 2022, and my phone feels like a loaded gun. Scrolling through my feed, I see her post—another fiery, hostile rant about religion that feels like a personal attack, knowing my beliefs. My thumb hovers over the heart button. Do I like it? Ignore it? My stomach twists into the same knot it did six months ago.

That was the night I got the text from a mutual friend: “She’s in the ER. It was bad.” The self-harm incident wasn’t just a cry for help; it was a seismic event that shook our entire friend group. We rallied, of course. We sent flowers, made meals, and offered endless “I’m here for you”s. But the trauma of that night left a scar on me, too. The fear, the helplessness—it changed the fabric of our friendship.

She has BPD, and I’ve tried so hard to be a steady anchor in the storm of her emotions. I’ve driven to her apartment at 2 AM, I’ve talked her down from ledges both figurative and literal. But her recent social media spree, targeting things she knows are core to who I am, feels different. It’s not the illness talking; it feels like a calculated erosion of the very boundaries I’ve been trying to build for my own mental health.

My therapist says I can’t set myself on fire to keep someone else warm. I’m juggling my own medication, trying to find the right cocktail for my anxiety, and I’m finally realizing that “unconditional” friendship can sometimes be a dangerous ideal. So, I put my phone down. I don’t like the post. I don’t comment. For now, the silence is my boundary. It’s not about abandoning her; it’s about surviving us both. Maybe that’s the most compassionate choice I can make.
