## The Double Chin and the Echo Chamber of Self-Doubt

Okay, let’s be real for a minute. We all have those things, right? Those little quirks, those perceived flaws that loop endlessly in our heads, amplified by the ever-present lens of social media. Lately, mine has been…a double chin. 

Now, I’m not overweight. I work out, I try to eat well. But there it is, stubbornly present in every selfie, every video call. And the comments? They sting. Not always malicious, sometimes just casual observations from well-meaning friends, but they land. They echo. 

It’s weird, isn't it? How something so seemingly small can feel so monumental. I find myself obsessively tilting my head, adjusting my posture, desperately trying to erase it from existence. 

I've been reading a bit about genetics lately, and it's strangely comforting to realize this might just be…me. A part of my inherited blueprint. It doesn't magically make the self-consciousness disappear, of course. But it shifts the blame away from a personal failing and towards something bigger, something I can't entirely control.

This year, especially with the constant barrage of filtered perfection online, I’m trying to be kinder to myself. To recognize that the standards we’re held to are often impossible, and that everyone has something they’re picking apart. It’s a work in progress, definitely. But acknowledging the struggle – and maybe even laughing at it a little – feels like a good place to start.



What’s *your* “double chin”? What’s that little thing you’re trying to silence? Let's talk about it.
