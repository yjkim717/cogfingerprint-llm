It’s 2022, and my dad’s world has shrunk to the size of a relentless ringing in his ears. Tinnitus, they call it—a constant buzz that dims his joy and isolates him in plain sight. When he finally mustered the courage to see an ENT doctor, hoping for answers, he was met with a shrug. No real examination, no listening—just a swift dismissal that left him feeling invisible.

His hearing problems and that stubborn sensation of ear blockage were brushed aside as trivial. It’s a familiar story, isn’t it? That sting of medical frustration when you’re pleading for help and handed indifference instead. Watching him navigate this has been a painful lesson in advocacy and empathy. Sometimes, the loudest battles are fought in the quietest of moments, and being heard shouldn’t feel like a luxury.
