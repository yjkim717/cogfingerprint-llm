>## The Weight of Unexpected Costs

It's funny, isn't it? How life can feel so…stable, and then a single diagnosis can shatter everything. That's where I've been for the past several months. A melanoma diagnosis, completely out of the blue, threw me headfirst into a world of specialists, biopsies, and a mounting pile of medical bills.

I thought I was prepared. I have insurance, after all. But even with insurance, the co-pays, the deductibles, the procedures…it's relentless. We'd been living paycheck to paycheck, carefully saving where we could, and now our savings are gone. Seriously, *gone*. 

It’s a strange kind of exhaustion, this financial strain layered on top of the emotional toll of facing something like cancer. I’m grateful for the support of friends and family, and desperately trying to navigate the complexities of HSAs and understanding when we’ll hit our out-of-pocket max. 2022 has been a brutal lesson in the fragility of financial security, and just how quickly everything can change. It makes you really appreciate the small things, and fiercely advocate for yourself.
