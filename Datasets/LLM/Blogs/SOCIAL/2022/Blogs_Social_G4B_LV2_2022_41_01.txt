**The Weight of a Past Hello**

It’s weird, right? How something that happened years ago can still feel…heavy? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a really unsettling feeling, sparked by a series of texts. It’s from a former teacher. Not a *bad* teacher, exactly, but someone who knew a lot about me, a lot more than he should have. 

It started with a simple, polite message – then escalated into persistent inquiries. The unsettling part? His knowledge of details I’d actively tried to bury. It’s triggering a deep-seated social anxiety, a feeling of being watched, of having boundaries crossed. 

Honestly, it’s brought back a cascade of uncomfortable memories and a sharp reminder of how vulnerable we can feel when we’ve navigated tricky social situations in the past.  It’s a strange kind of ghost – a reminder that some doors, once opened, can be hard to truly close.  Anyone else ever dealt with something like this?
