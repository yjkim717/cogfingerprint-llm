It’s 2022, and my old Crown Vic’s odometer is frozen, the engine just groaning weakly when I turn the key. It feels like a metaphor—some days, I’m stuck, slow to start, my own spark just… gone. But then I remember the forums, the strangers online who offered help, sharing their own stories of sputtering engines and life’s stalls. It’s in these digital connections that we find the jumpstart, not just for our cars, but for our spirits, too.
