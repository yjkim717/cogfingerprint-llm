It’s 2022, and I’m scrolling through headlines about energy, feeling a familiar confusion. Terms like oil shale and shale oil blur together, and I keep wondering: is in-situ retorting just another name for hydraulic fracturing? Both sound like ways to tap into resources deep underground, but what does that mean for our environment and safety?

I picture communities near these sites, the quiet unease about water and land. It’s not just about technology—it’s about trust. Are we trading short-term gains for long-term consequences? As someone who cares about our planet’s future, I want clarity, not jargon. Because behind every drilling method, there’s a story of people and places waiting to be heard.
