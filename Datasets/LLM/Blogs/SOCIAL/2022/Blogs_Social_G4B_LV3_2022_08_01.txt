It’s funny how seemingly random things can trigger a flood of memories, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been obsessing over the headphone designs from *Five Nights at Freddy’s* – Moondrop and Sundrop, specifically. They unexpectedly brought me back to a particular dress I wore in 2015. It’s a bizarre connection, and I’m really curious if anyone else has had a similar experience. Social media feels full of these little, unexpected echoes, doesn't it?
