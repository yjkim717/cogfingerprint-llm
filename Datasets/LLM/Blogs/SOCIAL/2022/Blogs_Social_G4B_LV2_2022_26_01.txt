**The Quiet Shift**

Remember those moments in 2022 when you felt like you were just… observing life? Like watching a movie through a slightly blurry screen? I definitely do. Lately, I’ve been navigating a bit of a shift in how I connect, and it’s surprisingly vulnerable.

Recently, I was exploring the possibility of ADHD – a lifelong feeling of being a little ‘off’ – and my psychologist suggested talking to a psychiatrist. It felt a little daunting, honestly. Part of me wanted to stick with what I knew, but a small voice whispered that maybe a different perspective was needed. 

It's not about a grand solution, but about opening a door to truly understanding myself.  It’s a reminder that seeking support, even when it feels awkward, can be a really brave and important step.  Anyone else experiencing a similar quiet shift lately?
