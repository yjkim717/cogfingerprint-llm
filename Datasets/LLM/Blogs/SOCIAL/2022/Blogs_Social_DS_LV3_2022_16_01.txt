It was supposed to be a simple preorder. The Overwatch 2 hype was real, and when Blizzard announced beta access, I didn’t hesitate. I handed over my $40, imagining myself diving into the new heroes and maps weeks before anyone else.

But the fine print—or rather, the lack of it—was my downfall. The promise felt clear, but the reality was a lottery. I didn’t get in. Watching streamers and friends enjoy the beta while my purchase sat useless felt like a personal slight. That $40 wasn’t just money; it was trust, and it evaporated in an instant.

It’s a strange feeling, being let down by a company whose games have filled so many of my evenings. In 2022, we’re all navigating digital promises, but this blizzard of confusion left me cold. It’s a reminder that in gaming—and in life—clarity matters. I’m still excited for the full release, but that spark of blind faith? It’s on cooldown now.
