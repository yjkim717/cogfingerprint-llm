"My trusty Crown Victoria, a constant companion for years, suddenly refused to start one morning in 2022. As I investigated, I noticed the odometer display was wonky and the engine turned over sluggishly. A dead battery or faulty alternator were likely culprits. It was a frustrating wake-up call, making me realize how reliant I'd become on this reliable ride. Time to diagnose and get back on the road - and maybe consider an upgrade too!"
