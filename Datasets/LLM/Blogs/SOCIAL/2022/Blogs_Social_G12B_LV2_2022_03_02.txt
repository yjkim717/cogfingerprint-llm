## Watching Them Play: A Pokémon Go Paradox

It's 2022, and my kid is *still* obsessed with Pokémon Go. Seriously. While I occasionally roll my eyes at Niantic’s latest decisions (seriously, Go Fest?!) and remember my own initial frustrations with the game, watching them chase down a shiny Axew brings a smile to my face. 

There’s something undeniably charming about witnessing their dedication, the little victories celebrated with genuine excitement. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the joy isn't in mastering a system, but in simply *playing* within it. Maybe I'll even dust off my old account... just a little. Don't tell anyone.
