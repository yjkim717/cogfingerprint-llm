**The Buzz About Frustration (and Maybe Bees?)**

Okay, 2022 was… a year, wasn’t it? I spent a good chunk of it trying to tackle a tiny, persistent problem: carpenter bees. I’d invested in a trap, convinced I’d finally win the battle against their porch damage. Then came the storm. Just…gone. Ugh. 

It felt so frustrating, like putting in effort and getting completely swamped. It’s weird, right?  Sometimes you’re just trying to manage a small annoyance, and it feels like a huge setback.  It made me think about how easily we get discouraged, and how important it is to find a little grace for those unexpected curveballs life throws our way.  Anyone else have a mini-disaster story this year?
