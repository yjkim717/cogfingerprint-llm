It’s 2022, and I’m officially a UPS 22.4 cover driver—which sounds solid until you realize how much uncertainty comes with it. Every morning, I wonder if I’ll be driving or tossed back into the warehouse sorting packages. It’s like my seniority resets daily.

Just last week, I clipped a mirror pulling out of a tight alley. My heart sank—not just about the damage, but the paperwork and management’s reaction. Sometimes, it feels like the higher-ups thrive on chaos. I’ve heard whispers about favoritism and broken promises, and honestly? It wears on you.

But there’s a strange camaraderie here. We share stories in the break room, laugh about the absurdity, and remind each other why we’re pushing through: for that shot at a stable, full-time gig. In a world still reeling from the pandemic, this grind means everything. Here’s hoping the road gets smoother—literally and figuratively.
