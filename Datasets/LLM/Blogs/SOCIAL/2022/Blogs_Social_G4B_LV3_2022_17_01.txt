Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the summary and keywords, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone with a 2022 feel:

**The Weight of a 'Maybe'**

Okay, real talk. 2022 felt like a year of ‘maybe’s’. Like, a *lot* of ‘maybe’s’. And lately, I’ve been feeling it acutely – that weird, heavy feeling of fear wrapped up in uncertainty. It’s funny, right? I’m 26, and I’m seriously considering a huge shift: moving across the country for a job opportunity. 

It’s exciting, absolutely. A new beginning, a chance to really build something for myself. But then the doubt creeps in. A tidal wave of “What if I’m making a mistake?” and “What if this completely messes up my relationship?”  The long distance feels particularly daunting this time, a vast, echoing space of potential loneliness. 

Honestly, it's a scary kind of self-doubt – the kind that whispers you’re not brave enough, not capable enough.  I'm trying to remind myself that feeling this way is *normal*.  It means I care.  It means I'm facing something significant.  Maybe that's the first step, right? Just acknowledging the weight of that ‘maybe’ and letting it sit with me for a bit.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
