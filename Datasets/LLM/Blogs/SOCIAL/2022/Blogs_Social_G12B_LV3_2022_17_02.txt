## The Unexpected Wave: Emetophobia and Clinicals

Okay, wow. Today was… a lot. Nursing school is already a whirlwind, but throw in a healthy dose of emetophobia and clinical rotations become a whole new level of challenge. I had a brief touch – just a quick pat on the arm from a patient – and suddenly, that familiar wave of anxiety hit. My brain immediately spiraled: germs, contamination, *what if*… you know the drill.

It's exhausting constantly battling these intrusive thoughts, especially when I'm trying to learn and provide care. I know logically it was nothing to worry about, but in that moment, my anxiety felt incredibly real. Just wanted to share, because I know I'm not alone. Anyone else navigating mental health hurdles alongside their studies? Let’s connect – knowing I'm not the only one makes a difference.
