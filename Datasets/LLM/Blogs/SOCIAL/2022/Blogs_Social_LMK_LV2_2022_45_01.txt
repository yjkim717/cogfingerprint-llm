"Navigating the Ozempic Shortage: A Personal Dilemma"

As I sit here, pen in hand, I'm reflecting on the challenges of managing my diabetes during the 2022 Ozempic shortage. With a neurological condition on top of my diabetes, Ozempic wasn't just a medication - it was a lifeline. But when the shortage hit, I was faced with a harsh reality: ration my medication or go without. The thought of rationing was daunting, but the alternative was unbearable. I've come to realize that I'm not alone in this struggle. Many of us are caught between our health needs and the harsh realities of medication shortages. As I weigh my options, I'm left wondering: what does this mean for my health, and for others like me? Will insurance coverage be enough to mitigate the effects of the shortage? The uncertainty is unsettling, but I'm determined to find a way forward.
