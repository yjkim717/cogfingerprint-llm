"Reliving Nostalgia: How a Speedrun VOD Brought Back Memories. I recently watched the VOD of an Ocarina of Time beta showcase speedrun event and was blown away. Seeing top players push the limits of the game was exhilarating. The gaming community's passion and camaraderie shone through. It reminded me of the countless hours I spent as a kid playing this classic. The VOD reignited a spark, and I'm grateful for the nostalgia. If you're a fan, I highly recommend checking it out!"
