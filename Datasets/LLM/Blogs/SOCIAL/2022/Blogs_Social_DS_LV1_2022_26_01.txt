**Finally, Someone Listened**

For years, I carried this label: "chronically depressed." My therapist and I would talk in circles, trying to untangle the knots of my low motivation and brain fog. It was 2022, and the world felt like it was moving at lightning speed, yet I was stuck in slow motion.

During one session, I finally gathered the courage. "What if it's not just depression?" I asked, my voice barely a whisper. "What if it'sâ€¦ ADHD?" I braced for dismissal.

But she didn't dismiss me. Instead, my psychologist nodded thoughtfully. "Let's get you a proper evaluation with a psychiatrist," she said. "A fresh set of eyes."

That referral, even if it was officially for "treatment-resistant depression," felt like a seismic shift. It wasn't a cure, but it was validation. For the first time, someone was acknowledging that the map we'd been using might be wrong, and we needed to find the right territory. It was the hope of being truly seen, not just for my symptoms, but for their potential root cause.
