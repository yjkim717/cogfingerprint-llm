**The Double Shift Dilemma**

Okay, so 2022 was… a year for pivots, right? I was seriously considering a job transfer at Wegmans – a really cool opportunity, honestly – but it threw me for a loop. I was already happily (mostly!) employed at Starbucks. The thought of juggling two totally different environments, two different bosses… it felt a little overwhelming. 

I started spiraling, wondering if it was even worth pursuing. Was I being greedy, asking for *more*? I even confessed my anxieties to a friend, who gently pointed out that Wegmans valued a good employee, and a fresh perspective could be a huge asset.  It made me realize, sometimes the biggest risk is not taking a chance at all.  What do you guys think about juggling multiple jobs?
