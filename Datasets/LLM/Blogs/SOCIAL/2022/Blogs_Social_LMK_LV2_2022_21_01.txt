As I slipped behind the wheel of my friend's 2018 VW Golf R, I expected an exhilarating drive. But, to my surprise, it felt... sterile. The by-wire technology and automated transmission left me yearning for the raw, analog experience of my old 1995 BMW 325i. There's something about being connected to the road, feeling every bump and shift, that modern cars just can't replicate. In a world where tech is king, I'm nostalgic for the authentic driving experience of yesteryear's manual transmissions and mechanical feedback.
