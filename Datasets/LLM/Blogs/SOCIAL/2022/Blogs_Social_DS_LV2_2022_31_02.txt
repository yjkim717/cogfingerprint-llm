**The Wall of "We Can Just Speak English"**

I remember the flush of pride, ordering a coffee in my carefully practiced Italian. The barista’s response was perfect, crisp English: “That’ll be four euros.”

My heart sank. It’s a small moment, but it builds a wall. In our hyper-connected 2022 world, where translation apps live in our pockets, the goal often feels less about connection and more about flawless performance. We’re nudged toward the path of least resistance: Global English.

That eager “We can just speak English!” from a native speaker, meant to be helpful, can feel like a door gently closing. It steals the messy, beautiful struggle where real learning happens. The goal isn’t perfection; it’s the shared laugh over a mispronounced word, the patient effort to build a bridge, not just take the express lane. I’m not giving up, but I’m learning to ask for the gift of patience, not just perfection.
