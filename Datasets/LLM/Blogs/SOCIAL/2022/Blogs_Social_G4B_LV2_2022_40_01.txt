**Finding My Flow (and My People) in Colorado Springs**

Moving to a new place isâ€¦well, itâ€™s a lot. This year, Colorado Springs felt like a fresh start, but also a little lonely. I realized I needed more than just a beautiful view â€“ I needed connection. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m on the hunt for local yoga studios and groups! Building friendships through shared movement feels so grounding.  Hopefully, finding my new yoga tribe will help me truly feel at home.  Anyone have recommendations? ðŸ˜Š
