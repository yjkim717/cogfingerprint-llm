>## That Ocarina of Time Beta VOD Blew My Mind

Okay, seriously, you guys *need* to check out the recent Ocarina of Time beta showcase VOD that just dropped. I stumbled upon it last night and spent hours glued to the screen. The speedrun community's dedication is unreal, and the team behind this showcase really pulled something special together. It's fascinating to see how the game evolved, and honestly, just a really fun, engaging watch. Proof that passion projects still rule!
