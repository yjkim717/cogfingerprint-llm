**The Soundtrack of a Shift**

Okay, so 2022 was… a lot, right? Between the constant scrolling and the pressure to “optimize” my online life, social media felt like a relentless soundtrack of other people’s highlight reels. But lately, I’ve been trying to tune out the noise and really *listen*. 

Recently, a friend told me about her cat, suddenly overwhelmed with meows after her heat cycle. It sparked something. It made me realize how easily we can get caught up in projecting our own anxieties onto our pets – and vice versa. 

My own social feed felt a bit like that intense, insistent meow – demanding attention, triggering a response. It’s a reminder to carve out space for quiet observation, for noticing the subtle shifts in *my* own feelings and, you know, maybe just let a cat be a cat.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
