As a parent, it's disheartening to see my son struggle to land a job due to unnecessary hurdles. In 2022, he's been applying to various Walmart locations, but the process has been a challenge. To complete the application, he needs to undergo a physical examination, which comes with a hefty price tag. To make matters worse, his expired ID needs to be renewed, adding to the expenses. It's frustrating to think that the cost of employment is becoming a barrier to entry for many young people like my son.
