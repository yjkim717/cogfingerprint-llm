### The Resume in My Pocket

It’s 2022, and I’m standing outside Wegmans, my freshly printed resume feeling heavy in my hand. I love my current gig at Starbucks—the chaotic morning rush, the regulars who know my name. But I’m ready for a new chapter.

A nagging thought freezes me at the door: Will they see "Starbucks Barista" and assume I can't handle their schedule? That I'm not serious? My manager knows I'm looking and has been incredibly flexible, but the fear of being pigeonholed is real.

It’s a strange social paradox, isn't it? Having a job makes you a more attractive candidate, but sometimes it feels like the *wrong* job can become an invisible barrier. I take a deep breath and walk in, hoping they see my work ethic, not just my employer.
