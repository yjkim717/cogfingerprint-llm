There’s something about the Void Fields in *Risk of Rain 2* that feels a little too real in 2022. It’s not just a game level; it’s a metaphor for those days when everything chips away at you at once.

You step in, and the damage starts ticking immediately—a constant, draining pressure. The timer never stops, a relentless reminder of scarcity, of time slipping through your fingers no matter what you do. And then there are the items, those tantalizing chances for a turnaround, but choosing takes precious seconds you don’t have.

In a year already filled with survival-mode energy, the Void Fields magnify that feeling. You’re making decisions under duress, hoping your choices will be enough to see you through. But sometimes, the cost is just too high, and you’re left wondering if the struggle was even worth the reward. It’s a harsh lesson in endurance, one that hits a little too close to home.
