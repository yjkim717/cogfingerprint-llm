There’s something almost meditative about driving my old pickup truck—the satisfying click of the manual shifter, the hum of the engine you can actually feel in the steering wheel, the way the road communicates through every turn. It’s a raw, unfiltered conversation between me and the asphalt.

But lately, I’ve noticed how modern cars cocoon us in silence and screens, smoothing out every imperfection until driving feels more like being a passenger. In 2022, as we chase convenience, I wonder what we’re leaving behind. That tangible, analog connection isn’t just nostalgia—it’s a reminder to stay present, to feel life as it happens, not just watch it pass by.
