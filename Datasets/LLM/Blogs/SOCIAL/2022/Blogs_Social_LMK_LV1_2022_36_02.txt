As I ponder gift ideas for my 7-year-old niece, I'm drawn to Tamora Pierce's Circle of Magic series. An avid reader of American Girl books, she's ready for more adventure. But is this fantasy series suitable for her reading age? I'd love to hear from fellow readers: would you recommend Circle of Magic for a 7-year-old? The series has captivated many young readers, but I'm unsure if its themes and complexity are a good fit. Your input would help me make an informed decision and find the perfect read for my niece in 2022.
