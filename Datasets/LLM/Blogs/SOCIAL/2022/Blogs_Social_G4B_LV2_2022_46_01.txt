Okay, here’s a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone, around 100 words:

**A Ghost of a Memory**

There’s something really fascinating about unearthed memories, isn’t there? I was reading about a 1960s film – just a fleeting mention of a “poet kid” and a hazy connection to *Don’t Look Now* – and it sparked something. It reminded me of how easily influential ideas drift through our culture, like half-remembered dreams. 

It made me think about how the seeds of creativity are often planted in the most unexpected places, echoing across decades.  Maybe that forgotten film, with its unusual core, was a quiet ancestor to so much we see today.  Isn't it strange how a single, vague image can hold such weight?

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific angle or adding a call to action (like asking readers about their own forgotten memories)?
