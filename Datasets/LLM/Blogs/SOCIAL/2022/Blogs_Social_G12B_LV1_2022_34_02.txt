## The Boudoir Dress Hunt is Real

Okay, so I'm on a mission! I saw the most gorgeous boudoir dresses – that Pollardi vibe, you know? – while browsing online. Sadly, my local bridal shops just don’t seem to carry them. It's 2022, and shouldn’t there be more options beyond the traditional white gown? Anyone else feel like finding something truly *you* is a wild goose chase?



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
