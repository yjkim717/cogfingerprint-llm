Remember that 2015 dress debate—black and blue or white and gold? It’s funny how something so simple can split opinions. Lately, I’ve been thinking about Moondrop and Sundrop’s interchangeable designs, and it feels like that all over again. In 2022, with so much division, it’s a gentle reminder that perspective shapes everything. What’s clear to me might look totally different to you, and that’s okay. It’s all part of being human together.
