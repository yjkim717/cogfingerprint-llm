### The Day I Realized My Parents Didn't Get It

It was a Sunday morning in the fall of 2022. The one day my alarm clock was silenced. The one day my laptop stayed closed. After months of grinding through 70-hour workweeks, this single, sacred day was for laundry, for staring at the wall, for remembering what quiet felt like.

Then my phone buzzed. My mom, cheerful as ever. "The leaves are piling up! Your dad has the rakes ready. We'll see you at 10?"

My heart sank. It wasn't a question. It was a summons.

A wave of pure, hot frustration washed over me. Didn't they see the shadows under my eyes? The way I jumped at every notification? To them, my "work" on a screen wasn't real work. Their generation retired with gold watches; mine was retiring our social lives to meet impossible KPIs.

But beneath the anger was a deep, aching sadness. This wasn't about the yard. It was a generational chasm. Their expectation of "help" clashed violently with my reality of mental exhaustion. I was burning out, and they were asking me to chop wood.

I took a breath. "Mom," I said, my voice softer than I expected. "I can't today. This is my only day to not be 'on.' I'm really, really tired."

The silence on the other end was heavy. It was the first time I had drawn this boundary, not with a spreadsheet, but with my own parents. It was messy and uncomfortable, but it was the first step in a new conversationâ€”one where my exhaustion was finally allowed to take up space.
