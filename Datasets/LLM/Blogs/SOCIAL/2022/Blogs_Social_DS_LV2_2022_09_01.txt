### The Three Little Things That Saved Our Home

You know that low-grade hum of anxiety that became the soundtrack to 2022? For me, it wasn’t just the news cycle—it was the quiet groan of my house. I’d lie in bed and hear a drip, or see a flicker in the lights, and my mind would spiral into visions of flooded floors and electrical fires.

I felt so powerless about the big, wide world, I decided to focus on my small, square one. I called a plumber and an electrician for a "well-check." And what they told me was a wake-up call.

Those tiny, chrome angle stop valves under my sinks? Twenty years old and ticking time bombs. The rubber supply lines to my washing machine? Brittle. And my electrical panel, the heart of the house, was an outdated model known for issues.

Addressing these three things felt like a profound act of self-care. It wasn’t just about preventing a disaster; it was about reclaiming a sense of control. In a year that felt chaotic, this small, proactive investment in my sanctuary was deeply calming. It was a reminder that while I can’t fix everything, I can absolutely take care of my own four walls. And sometimes, that’s the most powerful peace of mind you can find.
