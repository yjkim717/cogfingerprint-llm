**The Quiet Hum of Discomfort**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Scrolling through Instagram in 2022 and seeing everyone’s highlight reels – the perfect vacations, the flawless meals, the beaming smiles. And then there’s this little, persistent hum of discomfort in *my* life. A feeling of being subtly, unfairly treated, like the universe has a tiny, mischievous gremlin just waiting to throw a wrench in things.
