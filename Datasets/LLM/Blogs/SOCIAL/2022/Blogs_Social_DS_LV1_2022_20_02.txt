It’s 2022, and I’m still thinking about my dad’s last ENT appointment. He went in hopeful, describing the constant ringing in his ears and the way sounds sometimes feel unbalanced, like he’s hearing the world through a tilted speaker. The doctor barely looked up from his chart. “It’s just tinnitus,” he said, “and a little earwax. Nothing to worry about.”

Nothing to worry about? Tell that to my dad, who now hesitates before joining family conversations, afraid he’ll miss something or reply oddly. It’s more than a medical issue—it’s a social one. Dismissing someone’s hearing struggles chips away at their confidence, their place in the room, in the family, in life.

We trust doctors not just with our health, but with our dignity. When that trust is broken by a brush-off, the echo lasts much longer than any ringing in the ears.
