**The Strange Case of the Missing Union Jack**

Okay, confession time: I’ve spent a ridiculous amount of time this year obsessing over tiny, pixelated decals in Rocket League. It sounds silly, I know, but it’s strangely absorbing! Lately, I’ve been noticing something… off. The distribution of branded decals feels wildly inconsistent. You get a ton of Nike, sure, but then suddenly, nothing of the England variety. 

It’s a little frustrating, honestly. As a Brit, seeing our flag represented feels important, even in a game. I started thinking about how much broader this issue actually is. We’re constantly bombarded with branded content, and it’s easy to feel like you’re just a cog in someone else's marketing machine. 

I even had a wild thought – a Team GB decal, maybe with a little Mini Cooper detail? It’d be a cool way to celebrate national pride and, let’s be honest, a fantastic way to personalize your car.  It’s a small thing, but it highlights how much we crave authentic representation, even in the digital world. What little things make *you* feel connected?
