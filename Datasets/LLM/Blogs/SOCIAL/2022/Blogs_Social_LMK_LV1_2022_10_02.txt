"As I started my new job in 2022, I was taken aback when a colleague prescribed me medication for my health issue. I couldn't help but chuckle at the irony. It brought back memories of my youthful days experimenting with recreational drugs. Now, I'm following instructions to the letter, a far cry from my past recklessness. Nostalgia washed over me as I filled my pillbox, a poignant reminder of how far I've come."
