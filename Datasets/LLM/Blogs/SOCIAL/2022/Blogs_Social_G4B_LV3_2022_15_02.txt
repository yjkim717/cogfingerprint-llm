**The Wilderness and the Weight of Worry**

Remember that RuneScape Wilderness update last year? It hit me hard, honestly. As someone who mostly sticks to avoiding PvP, the thought of that vast, untamed space filled me with a surprising amount of fear. It’s funny, isn't it? We build these little digital communities, craving connection, and then suddenly a new area appears, a potential for… well, *death*. 

It made me think about how much we worry about being vulnerable, even in games.  Do we ever truly feel safe, really?  That wilderness felt like a stark reminder of that fundamental human hesitation.
