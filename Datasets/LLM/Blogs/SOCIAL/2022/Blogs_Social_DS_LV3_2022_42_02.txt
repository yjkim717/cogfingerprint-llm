I still remember the sinking feeling in 2022 when I landed the job interview—only to realize my state ID had expired weeks prior. Between the $35 renewal fee, the unpaid time off for the DMV visit, and the required physical exam co-pay, I’d spent over $200 before even receiving a paycheck. It’s a silent tax on opportunity, one that so many face just to get a foot in the door.
