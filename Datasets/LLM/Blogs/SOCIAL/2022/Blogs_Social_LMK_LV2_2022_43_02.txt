"As I scrolled through HardwareSwap during the 2022 holiday sale, I stumbled upon a gem - a sealed, unused EVGA RTX 3080 Ti graphics card for $800 OBO. The seller's honesty was refreshing, and I couldn't help but wonder about the story behind the card. Was it a gift or a purchase gone wrong? Whatever the reason, it was a great deal for a savvy buyer like me. It made me think about the human side of online marketplaces."
