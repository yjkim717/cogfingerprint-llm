## Lost in the Kibbeverse? Me Too.

Okay, let's be real. Anyone else down a serious rabbit hole trying to figure out their Kibbe body type? I stumbled upon it a few months ago, and suddenly my wardrobe felt… complicated. I've been sifting through Reddit threads, endlessly comparing myself to images, and my results are a *mess* (ECAD, EDEDD, CCACEC – seriously!). 

The biggest struggle? Differentiating between Soft Classic, Theatrical Romantic, and Soft Gamine. They all have such lovely vibes! It's a journey of self-discovery, for sure, and I’m hoping to find some clarity soon. Anyone else feel the same? Let's commiserate (and share tips!) in the comments.
