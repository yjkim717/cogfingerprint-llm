**The Ghost in the Machine**

I was scrolling through Instagram the other day, and it hit me – this constant, polished perfection feels…hollow. I was thinking about my old BMW 325i, a gloriously analog beast from ‘95. The shifting was a deliberate dance, the engine a throaty rumble you *felt*. 

Then I saw a VW Golf R, all sleek and ‘by-wire’ – impressive, sure, but it felt strangely sterile. Like a really good simulation, not the real thing.  It’s weird, isn’t it?  We crave connection, even when technology promises seamlessness.  Maybe we're longing for a little grit.
