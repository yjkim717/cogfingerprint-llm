"As I settled into my new home in South Carolina in 2022, I realized that staying connected with friends through online gaming wasn't just a hobby, it was a lifeline. But with so many internet providers to choose from, finding the right one for seamless gaming was a challenge. I was determined to find a reliable fiber optic internet connection that would let me team up with friends in the US and abroad without a hitch. It was a quest that made me appreciate the power of community and connectivity in the digital age."
