**The Weight of a Dream, and the Pull of Cash**

It’s funny how quickly a ‘dream’ can feel like a weight. I was talking to a friend last year – 2022, remember? – about buying a house. She’d finally gotten a decent loan, and the excitement was palpable. But then I started thinking about the *cost* of that dream, not just the monthly payments, but the way it clung to her credit, the constant pressure to keep up. 

It reminded me of that Cambodian couple running their donut shop, trapped by a financed car and the longing for a place to truly call their own.  It’s a universal feeling, isn’t it? That desire for stability, for a sense of rootedness, battling against the realities of debt and the allure of quick fixes – like wanting a cash payment to break free. 

Sometimes, the biggest dreams require the most patience, and the most honest look at our financial systems.
