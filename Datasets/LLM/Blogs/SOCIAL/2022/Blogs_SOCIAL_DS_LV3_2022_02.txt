It was just another Tuesday evening in 2022 when my phone buzzed with a frantic call from my younger brother. His voice was tight with panic as he explained how “eBay support” had contacted him about a compromised account, pressuring him to “secure his funds” by transferring $5,000 to my Venmo.

My heart sank. The request felt off, but his fear was real. In that moment, I was caught in a social trap—the instinct to protect my brother clashing with the glaring red flags of a scam. Do you follow the sketchy instructions from a supposed authority, or trust your gut?

That digital dilemma, the pressure to act quickly in our hyper-connected world, is a uniquely modern form of social fraud. It weaponizes our trust in family and familiar platforms. We eventually reported it and started the process of getting his money back, a stressful lesson in pausing and questioning everything, no matter how convincing the story seems.
