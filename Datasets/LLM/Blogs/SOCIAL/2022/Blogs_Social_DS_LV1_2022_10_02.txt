It’s 2022, and I’m lying here zooted from my prescription meds—feels way too familiar. My mind drifts back to darker days, chasing that same intensity with hard drugs. Funny how a pill can blur the line between healing and haunting. I’m left wondering: in a world so eager to numb the pain, are we ever really moving forward, or just circling the same old ghosts?
