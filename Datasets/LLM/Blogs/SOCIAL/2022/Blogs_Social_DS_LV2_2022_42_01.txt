It’s 2022, and I’m flipping through Rick Riordan’s latest book when I stumble upon something I’ve rarely seen in fiction: a female leader, navigating her duties while on her period, treated with quiet dignity. No punchlines, no awkward stereotypes—just real, relatable humanity.

It hit me how powerful that is. Growing up, periods in media were either invisible or the butt of a joke. Seeing a respected character experience this normal part of life without shame or sidelining felt like a quiet revolution. It’s more than representation—it’s validation. It tells young readers, especially girls, that leadership and strength aren’t separate from being a woman. And honestly? It’s about time.
