## Eight Days & A New Start

It's been eight days since the move, and something feels… different. Eight days free from the old patterns. Honestly, I'm just proud. This new space, this new chapter, it's already helping me move *beyond* the behaviors. Small wins feel huge right now. Sending love to anyone else on a similar journey. ✨ #recovery #newbeginnings #mentalhealth
