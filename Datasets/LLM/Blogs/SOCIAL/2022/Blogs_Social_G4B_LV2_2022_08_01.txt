**The Dress, the Headphones, and a Strange Kind of Obsession**

Remember that dress from 2015? The one that flipped colors? It’s weird how something online can just…stick with you. Lately, I’ve been having a similar feeling about Moondrop and Sundrop headphones. There’s this uncanny resemblance to that dress, a sort of visual echo. It's a small, odd thing, but it highlights how easily our brains latch onto patterns and how a shared fascination can spread like wildfire.  Anyone else experiencing this lately?
