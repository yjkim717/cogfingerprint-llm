## The Hunt for Something Silky & Secret

Okay, real talk. I’ve been obsessed with boudoir dresses lately – those whisper-soft, lace-trimmed pieces you see in magazines. I’ve scoured local bridal boutiques, hoping to find something similar, but it's been a *mission*. Apparently, "boudoir" isn't exactly a staple! Anyone else feel that frustrating gap between what you see online and what's actually available? It's 2022, can't we all have a little luxury?
