It’s 2022, and honestly, I’m just tired. Every day feels like the universe has a personal vendetta against me—missed buses, sudden downpours, endless bad news. I try to be kind, to do the right thing, but it’s exhausting when the world seems to push back at every turn. Some days, I just want to retreat and avoid it all. Anyone else feel like they’re running a marathon with no finish line in sight?
