## The Weight of "Things Will Get Better" – And What To Do When You Don't Believe It

I saw something on Reddit the other day that just… hit different. It was a post, raw and honest, describing a bone-deep fatigue, a disillusionment so profound it felt like a physical ache. The person was talking about the well-meaning, but often hollow, refrain: “Things will get better.”

And honestly? I felt seen.

We’ve all heard it, right? It’s the default response to hardship, a comforting balm meant to soothe anxieties. But what happens when “things” *don’t* get better? What happens when you’ve been hearing that promise for years, decades even, and the reality remains… difficult?

The post resonated with me because it tapped into something I think a lot of us have been grappling with, especially over the last few years. 2022 has been… a lot. We’re still navigating the fallout of a pandemic, facing economic uncertainty, and witnessing global events that feel increasingly overwhelming.  It’s a breeding ground for **burnout**, plain and simple.

I remember a time, not so long ago, when I genuinely believed “things will get better” was a guaranteed outcome. Work hard, stay positive, and the universe would reward you, right?  That’s the narrative we're fed.  But life, as I’ve learned, isn't always a meritocracy. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you're still facing an uphill battle.

For this Reddit poster – and for many others I know – that battle has been a long, relentless one. A cycle of **chronic hardship** that’s chipped away at hope, leaving behind a residue of **hopelessness**. They spoke of a lifetime of setbacks, of poverty, of health issues, of constant instability. And it’s easy to judge from the outside, to offer platitudes. But when you’re *in* that struggle, those words feel less like comfort and more like a dismissal.

It’s particularly poignant because it highlights the limitations of positivity. We’re told to “think positive,” to “manifest” our dreams. While I believe in the power of a positive mindset, it’s crucial to acknowledge that it's not a magic bullet. It doesn’t erase systemic inequalities, it doesn't heal chronic illness, and it certainly doesn’t pay the bills.  For those facing **financial struggle**, a forced smile and affirmations just won't cut it.

The weight of that reality can be crushing. It can lead to a profound sense of **disillusionment**, a feeling that the world isn’t fair, that the promises made are false, and that your efforts are futile.  And that’s okay to feel. It's *valid* to feel.

So, what do you do when you’ve lost faith in the "things will get better" mantra? How do you navigate
