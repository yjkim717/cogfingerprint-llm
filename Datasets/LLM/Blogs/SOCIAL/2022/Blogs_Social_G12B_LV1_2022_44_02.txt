## Lost in the Blue Beard House (and Finding Myself?)

Okay, so I just got back from the most *strange* and beautiful evening. West Edge Opera, bless their hearts, did a production of *Ariane et Barbe-Bleue* at the Scottish Rite Temple, and it completely wrecked me in the best possible way.

I’ll admit, I went in knowing very little about the opera itself (Debussy, right? Beautiful, but a bit intimidating). The story, for those unfamiliar, is loosely based on the Bluebeard's Castle fairy tale - a woman marries a mysterious man with a shadowy past and a house full of locked rooms. 

But this wasn't just a retelling of a cautionary tale. The director really leaned into the idea of self-discovery, of confronting your own inner demons and the secrets you keep from yourself. The setting – the Scottish Rite Temple - was incredible. All those intricate carvings and echoing spaces just amplified the feeling of being lost in a labyrinth, not just of rooms, but of the mind.

The singers? Absolutely phenomenal. Each voice was so powerful, so full of emotion. It wasn't just about hitting the notes (though they did that with ease), it was about conveying the raw vulnerability and desperation of the characters.

It got me thinking, honestly, about my own "locked rooms." What are the parts of myself I keep hidden, the fears I don’t want to acknowledge? This opera, more than anything else, felt like a visual and auditory exploration of that universal human struggle. It’s funny how art can do that, isn’t it?  It’s 2022, and we’re all just trying to navigate these complex internal landscapes, searching for a little light in the darkness. I'm definitely going to be pondering this one for a while. Highly recommend if you’re looking for something thought-provoking and genuinely moving.
