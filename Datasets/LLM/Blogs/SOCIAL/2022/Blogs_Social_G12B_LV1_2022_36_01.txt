>## Missing a Queen? My Six Merchandise Hunt & a Small Observation

Okay, so I just got back from seeing *Six* on Broadway (seriously, go see it!), and naturally, I hit up the merchandise stand afterward. I was *so* excited to snag a tote bag – perfect for carrying books and theatre programs. But something felt…off. They had totes for Anne, Catherine, Jane, and all the other queens, but no Jane Seymour. 

I asked the staff, and they just shrugged. It got me thinking though. Is it a reflection of how history often glosses over Jane? Quiet, dutiful, a bit overshadowed. A small detail, sure, but it sparked a little historical pondering amidst the excitement of the show. Maybe next time, Jane gets her moment in merch too!
