It’s 2022, and I’m still wrestling with these stubborn carpenter bees. They’ve turned my porch into their personal woodworking project! I tried everything—traps, wood treatments—but they just keep coming back. It’s a bit like dealing with that one friend who always oversteps boundaries: you set limits, but they buzz right through. Sometimes, you just have to rebuild and reinforce, even when you’d rather not. A lesson in patience and persistence, for sure.
