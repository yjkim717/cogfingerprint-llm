Here's a 76-word reflective blog post:

"After watching a Bluey episode about Verandah Santa, our Christmas morning got a bit chaotic! My kids were convinced Santa would arrive on our veranda, and sure enough, they spotted 'him' lurking outside. We ended up having a hilarious morning, with Santa 'leaving' gifts and making a quick escape. It was a lovely, silly moment, and I'm so glad we got to share it together as a family. Who needs a quiet Christmas morning, anyway?"
