As I dove into Noita in 2022, I stumbled upon a clever trick that changed my gameplay. By combining Master of Wounding with Ambrosia, I could boost my max health. I was thrilled to discover that using a wand to cast spells amplified the effect. Sharing this trick on social media sparked a lively discussion among fellow gamers, and I realized that sometimes, the most valuable discoveries come from sharing our own experiences and connecting with others.
