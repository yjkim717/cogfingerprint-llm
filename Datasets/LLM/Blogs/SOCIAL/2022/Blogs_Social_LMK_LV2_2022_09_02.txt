As I reflect on the American financial system in 2022, I'm reminded of a Cambodian couple's journey to financial freedom. Having financed a Toyota, they now face the daunting task of paying off their car loan. But their motivation isn't just about driving a reliable vehicle - it's about building a strong credit score to achieve a bigger dream: owning a home. In a system where credit scores play a significant role in determining loan eligibility, this couple understands that paying off their car loan is a crucial step towards securing a mortgage. By making timely payments and potentially switching to cash transactions, they're taking control of their financial future. As I consider their story, I'm struck by the complexities of the American financial system and the resilience of those navigating it. Their experience serves as a reminder that financial freedom is often a journey, not a destination.
