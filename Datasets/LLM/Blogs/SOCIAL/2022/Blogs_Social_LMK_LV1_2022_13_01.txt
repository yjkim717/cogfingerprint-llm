"Getting Invisalign was a game-changer for my smile, but it's been a bit of a challenge lately. I've been dealing with a pesky sore throat since I started wearing my aligners. I've been wondering if it's related to my daily tea habit - I just can't seem to cut back on my morning cuppa! Has anyone else experienced this? I'm looking for tips on how to soothe my throat without compromising my orthodontic care. Any advice from fellow Invisalign warriors would be greatly appreciated!"
