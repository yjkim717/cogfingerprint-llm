The little girl’s hand was so warm when it briefly brushed against mine. It was just a second, a fleeting touch as I adjusted her IV, but my heart hammered against my ribs. Emetophobia, this intense fear of sickness, has been my shadow for years, and now I’m in nursing school.

I immediately used the sanitizer at my station, the familiar scent of alcohol a small comfort. I followed the protocol perfectly, yet the anxiety lingered. Was it enough? The fear of contamination is a constant hum in the back of my mind, a battle between my training and my deepest anxieties. It’s a strange reality in 2022, where hand hygiene is paramount, yet for me, it’s a shield that never feels quite strong enough. This journey is as much about healing my own fears as it is about learning to care for others.
