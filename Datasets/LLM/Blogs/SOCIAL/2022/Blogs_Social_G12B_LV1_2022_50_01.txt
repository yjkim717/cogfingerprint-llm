## The Zendaya Effect (and Why We Still Care About Movie Stars)

Remember when everyone was losing their minds over *Euphoria*? Specifically, remember the sheer, undeniable *pull* Zendaya had? It wasn't just about the show being good (though it was), it was about *Zendaya*. And that got me thinking a lot about something deeper: do movie stars still matter?

For a while there, it felt like the answer was a resounding “no.” Streaming services exploded. Algorithms curated our viewing habits. Critical reviews felt increasingly irrelevant. We were told audiences were smarter, more discerning, less susceptible to "star power."  The idea of a single actor being a *guarantee* of box office success seemed laughably outdated.

Then *Euphoria* happened, and then *Spider-Man: No Way Home* happened. And suddenly, that question felt a whole lot more complicated.

I witnessed it firsthand earlier this year with *The Lost City*. I’d been lukewarm on the trailers. The premise felt… fine. But then I saw Sandra Bullock *and* Channing Tatum were starring, and suddenly, I was intrigued. My friends felt the same. We all went, and we all had a really good time. Was it a groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece? Absolutely not. But it was entertaining, and the presence of those familiar faces made a difference.

And then there’s Hugh Jackman. Seriously, the man can do no wrong. *The Music Man* revival? Sold out. *The Son*? People were interested, even if the reviews were mixed. There's just *something* about his appeal.

It made me realize that while a great script, clever marketing, and impeccable direction are absolutely crucial – and let's be clear, they *always* are – the human element still matters. We connect with people. We build anticipation around seeing actors we admire. We are, at our core, influenced by faces we recognize and associate with positive experiences.

Maybe it's nostalgic. Maybe it’s a reaction against the endless scroll of content. But in 2022, a year saturated with streaming options, the “Zendaya effect” – the undeniable influence of an actor's appeal – felt more potent than ever.  It's a reminder that sometimes, a little star power is exactly what a movie needs to shine.
