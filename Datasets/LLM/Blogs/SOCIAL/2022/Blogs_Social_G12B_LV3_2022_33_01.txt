## The Mirror Lied (And Maybe Social Media Did Too)

It's 2022, and we’re all bombarded with images. Perfect bodies, flawless skin, highlight reels of seemingly effortless happiness. It's a constant stream, and honestly, it's exhausting. Lately, I've been wrestling with something that feels surprisingly… personal. It’s this nagging feeling that I'm bigger than I actually am.

I’m not talking about needing to lose a significant amount of weight. I'm genuinely healthy, I exercise, and I eat reasonably well. But when I look in the mirror, I see something different. Something…larger. And it’s not just me noticing. Friends and family, with what I assume are good intentions, occasionally make comments – "You look great!" which somehow translates in my head to, “You’re looking a little bigger, aren’t you?”

It’s a weird cycle of self-consciousness and frustration. I know, logically, that I’m probably being overly critical. My doctor says I'm fine. But this feeling persists, fueled, I suspect, by the unrealistic standards we're all subjected to daily. 

There's a growing awareness these days about how much of our body image is shaped by genetics and societal pressures. I’ve been reading about how our genes influence how we *perceive* our weight, not just what the scale says.  And then there's the constant comparison – scrolling through Instagram and feeling like everyone else has unlocked the secret to effortless perfection. 

I'm trying to be kinder to myself, to actively challenge those negative thoughts. It’s a work in progress, to be sure. But recognizing the role social media and even my own inherited predispositions play in this is the first step towards finding a little more peace with the person staring back at me.
