## Finally, a Period Mention That Doesn't Feel… Weird?

Okay, so I just finished "Daughter of the Deep" by Rick Riordan, and I needed to gush about something. I've devoured the Percy Jackson series for years, and while I love the adventure, I've always felt a little…underwhelmed by how female characters were handled. Not *bad*, just…flat.

But this book? It’s different. Specifically, the way Riordan handled a scene involving menstruation for one of the main characters, Ella. It wasn't a plot device, a source of weakness, or a moment for awkward jokes. It was just *there*, a normal, human experience woven naturally into the narrative. 

Seriously, in 2022, why is it still revolutionary to see a female character portrayed with such realistic nuance? It’s a small thing, but it makes a huge difference. It felt like a genuine step towards more authentic and relatable representation in young adult fiction, and it’s got me cautiously optimistic for what comes next.




Hope this meets your needs!
