There I was, scrolling through my niece’s Christmas wish list in late 2022, a familiar mix of American Girl and Magic Tree House titles. She’s a voracious seven-year-old reader, and I wanted to introduce her to something with a little more magic—specifically, Tamora Pierce’s *Circle of Magic*.

But was it age-appropriate? I remembered my own journey with those books, how they wove complex themes of friendship and responsibility into a world that felt safe to explore. For an avid young reader ready to step up from chapter books, this series could be the perfect bridge. It’s not just about the fantasy; it’s about finding your circle, your people. I decided it was a risk worth taking, a new world to gift her.
