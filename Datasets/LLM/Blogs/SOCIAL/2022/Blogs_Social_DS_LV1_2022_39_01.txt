Looking back on 2022, I realized my reef tank taught me something profound about community. That year, I kept pushing my RO filter beyond its 5-gallon limit, thinking more water meant better preparation. But the TDS crept up—my filter system was straining, and purity suffered. It hit me: we often stretch ourselves thin trying to store up more—more connections, more content—thinking it enriches our social lives. Yet, like that overworked RO unit, we lose quality in the chase for quantity. True richness comes not from how much we hold, but from the care we put into each interaction. Sometimes, less really is more.
