**That Uneasy Feeling: When Your Cat Just Can’t Throw It Up**

Remember scrolling through Instagram last year, seeing everyone’s perfectly curated cat lives? It’s easy to fall into that comparison trap, right? Lately, I’ve been hyper-aware of how social media can make us question our own experiences.
