**The Scroll & The Shame**

Remember endlessly scrolling through Instagram in 2022, feeling like everyone else had it figured out? I do. It’s a feeling so many of us battled – this constant comparison, this quiet shame bubbling up about our bodies. For me, it stemmed from a really messy past, a lot of insecurities that took root early on, and then got amplified by some really hurtful online interactions. 

I spent so long chasing a “better” version of myself, fixating on weight loss as the answer. But honestly, it was a distraction. It wasn’t until I started really acknowledging the connection between my past trauma and my current self-consciousness that things began to shift. 

There’s still a long way to go, of course. But learning to accept myself – flaws and all – feels less like a destination and more like a daily practice. It’s about choosing to meet the scroll with kindness, not judgment.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
