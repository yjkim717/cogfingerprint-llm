Remember scrolling through endless gift guides in 2022, feeling utterly disconnected? I was hunting for a book for my niece and found myself in a sea of generic recommendations. Then I stumbled upon a heartfelt query from an aunt in a forum, asking about Tamora Pierce for her seven-year-old. It wasn't just about age-appropriateness; it was about passing on a spark of magic. That single, personal plea cut through the noise, reminding me that the best gifts aren't just items—they're shared stories waiting to unfold. It’s the human connection that truly guides us.
