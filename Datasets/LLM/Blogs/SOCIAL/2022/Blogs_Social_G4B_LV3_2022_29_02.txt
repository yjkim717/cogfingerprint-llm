**The Echo Chamber and the Missing Volume**

Let’s be honest, 2022 felt… loud. Not in a good way. Scrolling through social media, I was bombarded with “hacks” and “strategies” for building a YouTube channel – specifically, a Let’s Play one. Two years ago, the thought of creating video content genuinely excited me. Now? It just felt like wading through a thick fog of conflicting advice and, frankly, a massive creative block.

I’d get so frustrated, chasing tips that felt utterly divorced from *my* style or what I actually wanted to create. Everyone seemed to have a secret formula, a magical button to press that instantly unlocked a thriving channel. The problem was, there was no secret. Just a lot of noise.

It’s easy to get lost in the echo chamber of online tutorials, convinced that if *they* can do it, so can you. But I realized I was so focused on following instructions, I’d forgotten the core reason I wanted to play games in the first place – to just… *play*. 

I needed to stop trying to replicate someone else’s success and start rediscovering the simple joy of production, even if it meant starting small. Sometimes, the best way to break through a creative block is to just… let’s play. Seriously.  What helps *you* silence the noise?
