As I stood in my kitchen, sipping a glass of crystal-clear water, I couldn't help but wonder: is my RO unit doing its job? I've always been told to stop it at 5 gallons, but what happens if I let it run beyond that? Will the water quality suffer? In 2022, with the increasing awareness about clean drinking water, I felt compelled to dig deeper. Does exceeding the storage capacity affect TDS levels? I decided to investigate, and what I found out might just change the way you think about your RO filter too.
