There’s this strange feeling lately, a flicker of something… like a half-remembered film. I’m chasing a ghost of a British movie from the late ‘60s or early ‘70s – all hazy color and unsettling beauty. I keep wondering if it subtly shaped our collective cinematic memory. 

It reminds me of how social media, with its curated realities, can feel like a constant, manufactured nostalgia. We’re bombarded with images of ‘perfect’ pasts, and I find myself yearning for something *real*, something with a genuine, slightly melancholic texture, like that forgotten film might have possessed.  Do you ever feel that way?
