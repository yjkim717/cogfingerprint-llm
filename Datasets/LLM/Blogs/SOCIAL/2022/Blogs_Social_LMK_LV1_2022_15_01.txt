"My Heart Sank: A Lesson in Post-Spay Surgery Care. As a cat mom in 2022, I thought I was prepared for everything, but nothing could have prepared me for the anxiety I felt when my kitty's spay surgery incision opened up a few days after the operation. I had followed the vet's instructions to the letter, or so I thought. The panic set in as I rushed her back to the clinic, where she was re-stitched and given a clean bill of health. The experience was a sobering reminder of the importance of post-operative care. I realized that I had been so focused on the surgery itself that I hadn't given enough thought to the recovery process. Now, I'm sharing my story to help fellow cat owners avoid the same worry. If you're going through a similar experience, take a deep breath and know you're not alone. With proper care and attention, your kitty will be back to their playful self in no time."
