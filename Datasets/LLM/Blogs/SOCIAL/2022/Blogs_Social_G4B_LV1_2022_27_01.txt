**The Weight of the Box**

Okay, so 2022 was… a year. I started a gig as a UPS driver, thinking it’d be straightforward – deliver packages, get paid. It quickly became a masterclass in stress. Seriously, the rules are *intense*. Like, ridiculously strict about where you can leave a box. 

And the management? Let’s just say “challenging” doesn’t quite cover it. It felt like climbing a corporate ladder made of barbed wire.  I was juggling the driving with a part-time job just to make ends meet, and honestly, the work-life balance was nonexistent. 

It made me think about how much we all carry – not just packages, but expectations, anxieties, and the pressure to constantly “do more.”  It's a reminder that sometimes, the simplest jobs can be the heaviest, and prioritizing your well-being is the most important delivery of all.
