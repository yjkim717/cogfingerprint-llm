## When the Grind Feels *Too* Grind-y: A Risk of Rain 2 Reflection

Okay, let's be real. Lately, I've been wrestling with Void Fields in Risk of Rain 2, and it's got me thinking about something bigger than just dodging projectiles. It’s about that feeling when a challenge shifts from rewarding to just… exhausting. 

The constant damage scaling *and* that ticking clock? It feels less like skillful progression and more like a relentless pressure cooker. You’re scrambling, healing constantly, and honestly, the satisfaction of finally clearing it feels muted by the sheer relief of survival. 

It makes me wonder: are we chasing difficulty for difficulty’s sake? Sometimes, a little less pressure, a little more breathing room, can make the victories *so* much sweeter. Anyone else feeling this lately, in games or… well, life?
