>Okay, here's a blog post inspired by the Kibbe body typing system, aiming for a conversational tone and storytelling style, set in 2022, and around the ~136 word count.

## The Algorithm and Me: A Style Identity Crisis

Okay, so I've been down a *serious* rabbit hole lately. It started with TikTok, naturally, and led me to David Kibbe's body typing system. Apparently, I’m somewhere between ECAD, EDEDD, and CCACEC – which, to the uninitiated, means absolutely nothing. 

I’ve been obsessively trying to figure out if I’m a Soft Classic, a Theatrical Romantic, or a Soft Gamine. Each description *feels* right at different moments! It’s fascinating, really, how much our bone structure, flesh, and facial features contribute to a certain aesthetic.

It’s definitely made me question my style choices. Am I fighting my natural lines?  Am I trying to force a look that just…doesn't *fit*?  It’s a silly, slightly obsessive journey, but in a world of fleeting trends, maybe finding a personal style identity rooted in my body is a worthwhile quest. Anyone else get lost in the Kibbe system?
