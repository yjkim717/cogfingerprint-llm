"Make Your Vote Count: A Simple Tip for Paper Ballots. As we navigate the 2022 election season, every vote matters. When casting your ballot on paper, ditch the ball-point pen for a marker. Trust me, it's a game-changer. A marker's thicker ink is less likely to bleed or skip, making your vote clearer and more likely to be counted. I've seen it make a difference in local elections. So, next time you're at the polling location, grab a marker and make your voice heard with confidence. Your vote deserves to be counted."
