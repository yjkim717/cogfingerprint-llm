**The Weight of "Just Be Social"**

2022 felt… heavy, honestly.  Everyone kept saying, “Just be social!” after the pandemic, like it was a simple fix. But for so long, navigating social situations felt like wading through quicksand. I’d spent years battling the feeling that I was *wrong* for struggling – a constant, low-hum of dismissal when I’d finally try to connect. 

It’s strange, but the thought of finally getting a professional assessment, even if it starts with someone looking at depression, feels like a tiny spark of hope. Maybe there’s a real reason why socializing isn’t ‘easy’ for me.  It’s not about *not wanting* to be social; it’s about the effort, the overwhelm, and the frustrating feeling of being misunderstood.  I’m hoping to find some clarity, and maybe, just maybe, a little less pressure to "just do it."
