It was supposed to be a time for healing after my melanoma surgery in 2022. Instead, I found myself in a different kind of battle: filing a short-term disability claim with MetLife. The endless forms, the confusing phone calls—it felt like a full-time job when I had the least energy to spare. It’s a stark reminder that the system meant to support you during illness often adds another layer of stress, making recovery feel like a solitary journey when you need community the most.
