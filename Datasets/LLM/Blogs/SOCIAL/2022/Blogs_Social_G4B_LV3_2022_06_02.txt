**The Quiet Hum of “It’ll Be Okay”**

Remember those well-meaning platitudes we all absorbed growing up? “Everything happens for a reason.” “Just stay positive!” “Things will get better.” By 2022, I was seriously starting to question them. Not in a defiant, angry way, but with a bone-deep weariness that settled right into my chest. 

I’ve been battling a persistent, low-grade hum of disappointment lately – a feeling that’s become almost… familiar. It’s not a dramatic, screaming kind of sadness, but a quiet, persistent ache fueled by a series of small, frustrating setbacks.  The job application rejections piled up, the freelance gigs dried up, and the constant feeling of being just *slightly* behind financially started to take its toll. 

It’s easy to tell someone else to “just keep going,” but when you’re staring down the barrel of chronic stress and a growing sense of hopelessness, those words feel… hollow.  I found myself instinctively reaching for them, trying to plaster a smile on, but the effort felt exhausting.  

Social media, ironically, amplified this. Scrolling through carefully curated feeds of people seemingly thriving – vacations, promotions, perfect families – just deepened the feeling that I was stuck in a loop of frustration. It’s a lonely feeling, that awareness of a disconnect between the reality of your life and the highlight reels of others. 

I realized I needed to acknowledge the mess, the uncertainty, the sheer *difficulty* of things.  It’s okay to not have all the answers. It’s okay to admit that “things will get better” isn’t a guarantee, just a hope.  And maybe, just maybe, acknowledging that uncomfortable truth is the first step towards actually finding a way through it. 

What about you? Have you found yourself questioning those familiar phrases lately?
