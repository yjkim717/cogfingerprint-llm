**The Void Fields Are Watching… And I’m Losing My Mind**

Okay, Risk of Rain 2 fans, let’s be real. Remember when Void Fields were a *challenge*? A tense, strategic scramble? Now? It feels like a relentless, agonizing slog. I spent a solid two hours last night just trying to survive, constantly dodging, desperately patching up with healing items, and praying my armor plating would hold. 

It’s not the game itself – I *love* RoR2 – but the sheer pressure of the damage over time is brutal. It’s easy to get caught out, to make a single mistake, and suddenly you’re obliterated. 

Honestly, it’s starting to feel less like a game and more like a test of endurance. I’m starting to wonder if the community is getting a little too focused on speedrunning and pushing the limits, and forgetting the joy of just… playing.  Anyone else feeling this frustration? Let’s talk about it! #RiskOfRain2 #VoidFields #GamingFrustration
