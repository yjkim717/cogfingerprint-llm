It’s funny how a video game can sometimes mirror real life. I was playing Risk of Rain 2 the other day, grinding through the Void Fields, and it hit me: this is exactly what burnout in 2022 feels like.

You’re constantly on the clock, racing against an invisible timer, while damage just keeps ticking away. No matter how many “healing items” you stack—whether it’s a quiet evening or a weekend off—it never feels like enough. The pressure is relentless.

I see it everywhere now. Friends, coworkers, even myself—we’re all playing on hard mode, trying to be Railgunners sniping goals or Commandos pushing through tasks. But at what cost? The reward just doesn’t seem worth the exhaustion anymore.

Maybe it’s time we step back from our own personal Void Fields. Stop normalizing the grind and recognize that some challenges drain more than they give. Here’s to choosing peace over punishment, in games and in life.
