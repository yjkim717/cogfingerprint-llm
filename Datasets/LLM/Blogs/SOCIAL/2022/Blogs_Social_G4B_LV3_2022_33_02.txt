**The Weight of "Helping Out"**

Remember those late nights in 2022? Scrolling through Instagram, seeing everyone’s perfectly curated lives, and feeling… a little hollow? I started noticing it creeping into my own life, and it centered around something surprisingly familiar: my family. 

I’m working hard, *really* hard, trying to build a career, and it feels like every free moment is expected to be spent tackling household chores. My parents, bless their hearts, just assume I have endless time for laundry and dishes.  It’s not that they’re demanding, more like… gently persistent. 

Honestly, it's breeding a quiet resentment. I feel like I’m constantly sacrificing my precious downtime – the stuff I need to recharge – just to keep the home running smoothly. It’s a subtle battle, but it’s chipping away at my peace of mind.  I’m realizing that 'helping out' shouldn't feel like another job layered on top of an already demanding life.  Anyone else feeling this pull between family expectations and their own well-being?
