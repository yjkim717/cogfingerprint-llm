There’s something uniquely 2022 about our collective hunger for nostalgia—we’re rebooting everything, from beloved sitcoms to cult classics. But as I settled in to watch one such revival recently, I couldn’t help but feel a little… disconnected.

The show tried to have it both ways: a soft reboot for longtime fans, yet a fresh start for newcomers. The result? Characters I once loved felt like hollow echoes, their new storylines lacking the heart that made them resonate years ago. It was a strange continuation—one that seemed to prioritize references over genuine connection.

And I’m not alone. Across social media, viewership seems to be dipping as others voice that same unease. It’s a reminder that in storytelling, as in life, you can’t stand with one foot in the past and the other in the present without losing balance. Maybe what we truly crave isn’t just familiar faces, but stories that grow with us—honest, evolving, and whole.
