**The Ghost in the App**

It’s weird how quickly the internet can feel… unsettling. I was scrolling through Reddit last week, just killing time, when a story hit me hard. A guy’s brother got totally swindled – a fake eBay listing, an Indian accent promising a huge payout, and suddenly, $5,000 was sitting in his Venmo account. 

It’s not the money itself, really. It’s the sheer *trust* we place in these apps, right? We’re supposed to be connecting, sharing, but these scams are exploiting that very connection. It made me think about how easily we can be manipulated, especially when someone *sounds* genuine. 

Suddenly, sending money through Venmo felt a little… riskier. It's a reminder that vigilance is key, even in the digital spaces we’ve come to rely on.  Anyone else had a weird online encounter recently?
