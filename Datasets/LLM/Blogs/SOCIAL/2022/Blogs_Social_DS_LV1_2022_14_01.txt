It’s 2022, and I’ve been thinking a lot about how we connect now. I watched this amazing Ocarina of Time beta showcase VOD the other day, and the chat was just exploding. Everyone was sharing memories, theories, and pure excitement in real-time. It hit me—this is our modern campfire. We’re not just watching a speedrun; we’re building a little community, sharing an emotional journey from our separate screens. It’s a different kind of togetherness, but it’s real.
