## The Cone of Shame & the Echo Chamber of Worry

It's officially been two weeks since Luna's spay, and let me tell you, the internet has been *a lot*. I knew there'd be a recovery period, but I wasn’t prepared for the sheer volume of opinions on kitten post-op care. 

My biggest worry? A tiny split in her incision. Nothing major, the vet assured me, but enough to send me spiraling down a rabbit hole of forums and Facebook groups dedicated to… well, everything cat-related. Suddenly, I was hyper-aware of every lick, every twitch. Was she in pain? Was it getting infected?

The online advice was overwhelming. “Remove the cone immediately!” countered by “Cone 24/7 or risk disaster!” I felt paralyzed. I trusted my vet, of course, but the constant barrage of stories – some graphic, some just plain alarming – fueled my anxiety. 

It’s strange, isn’t it? How easily we get caught up in the echo chamber of online worry. We seek connection, but sometimes find ourselves amplified anxieties instead. Luna's doing okay, stitches are coming out next week, and I’m slowly learning to trust my instincts *and* my vet, and maybe, just maybe, step away from the forums for a little while.



Hopefully, this captures the reflective, conversational tone and addresses the requested themes!
