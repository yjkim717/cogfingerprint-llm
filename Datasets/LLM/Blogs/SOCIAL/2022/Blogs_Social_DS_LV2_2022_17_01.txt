### The Other Side of the Finish Line

I did it. The diploma is in my hands, the cap-toss photo is all over my Instagram, and my family keeps telling me how proud they are. So why do I feel like I’m standing at the edge of a cliff?

For so long, “graduate and get a job” was the finish line. Now that I’ve crossed it, I’m realizing it was just the starting block for a much more terrifying race. In a few weeks, I’m packing my life into a Honda Civic and moving eight hours away for that very job I worked so hard to land.

The scariest part isn’t the new city or the career anxiety—it’s the quiet apartment waiting for me at the end of the day. My partner, my rock through the chaos of finals and job hunting, won’t be there. We’re stepping into the world of pixelated date nights and counting down the days until a visit, trying to figure out if “we” can survive as a long-distance “us.”

Everyone celebrates the achievement, but no one warns you about the hollow ache of the life you have to leave behind to build a new one. I guess this is what growing up in 2022 truly feels like.
