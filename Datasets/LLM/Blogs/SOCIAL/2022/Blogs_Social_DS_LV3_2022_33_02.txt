### The Sound of Silence is a Luxury I Can't Afford

It’s 2022, and the world has supposedly “reopened,” but my internal battery is still stuck at 1%. I find myself staring at my phone, caught between a Slack notification pinging about a deadline and a text from my mom asking if I’ve called my grandmother. In this moment, I feel the weight of two generations on my shoulders.

My parents’ generation operated on a simple, grueling formula: work hard, provide, and rest later. “Later” was a hazy, distant reward for a lifetime of labor. For my generation, “later” is a myth we can’t afford to believe in. The “hustle culture” of our always-on digital world has merged with those deeply ingrained parental expectations, creating a perfect storm of burnout.

The pressure isn't just to succeed at work; it’s to be the reliable child, the present friend, and a well-adjusted adult—all while curating a life that looks vaguely impressive online. Saying “no” feels like a betrayal to a boss who needs me and to parents who sacrificed everything for my opportunities.

But I’m learning that this constant state of mental exhaustion isn’t a badge of honor; it’s a warning sign. The real work-life balance isn’t about juggling everything perfectly. It’s about having the courage to occasionally let a ball drop, to choose an evening of quiet over another task, and to understand that preserving my own well-being isn’t selfish—it’s the only way I’ll have anything left to give to anyone else. The most radical act might just be granting myself permission to be still.
