## The Weight of "What Ifs" and Ghosting Songs

Okay, so I stumbled across a fascinating Reddit thread the other day. Someone was dissecting Danny Gonzalez's lyrics – specifically the line, "I wish it was Nick." Apparently, it sparked a whole debate: was it a longing to have ghosted Nick Jonas instead of Kevin, or a wish Nick had reached out? 

It got me thinking about those little social media moments that linger. The missed connections, the silent treatments… the "what ifs" that swirl around them. It’s a strangely universal feeling, isn't it? That tiny pang of wondering what *might* have been, even in the smallest of interactions. 2022 felt full of those, didn’t it?
