**The Stitch Saga & Social Media Panic (2022)**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 was *the* year of frantic Google searches for me. My sweet Luna got her spay, and everything seemed to be going okay… until it wasn’t. A tiny little stitch popped open. Suddenly, I was spiraling. 

I immediately hit up Instagram – #catsurgery #postopcare #spaystitches – desperately seeking reassurance. Everyone had an opinion! “Vet ASAP!” screamed one post. “Just monitor it!” countered another. It was overwhelming. 

Ultimately, I decided to err on the side of caution and call the vet. Thankfully, it wasn’t a huge deal, just needed a little extra attention and a cone of shame.  It reminded me that social media can be a brilliant resource, but it's also important to trust your gut and, you know, *listen to your vet*.  Luna’s doing great now, and I’m a little less obsessed with checking her incision every five minutes!

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a post focusing on a different angle (e.g., the emotional aspect of pet ownership)?
