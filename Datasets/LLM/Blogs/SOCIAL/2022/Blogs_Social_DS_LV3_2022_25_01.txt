Remember those late-night WWE gaming sessions in 2022? My friends and I would spend hours in the creation suite, crafting our ultimate wrestlers—but something always felt missing. We had the moves, the gear, but their faces were blank slates.

That’s when I thought: what if we could add facepaint or intricate tattoos right in the game, like applying temporary bodyart or a digital caw? It’s more than pixels—it’s identity. In a world where self-expression is everything, giving players that creative control would turn our virtual warriors into true extensions of ourselves. After all, isn’t wrestling as much about the story you tell as the moves you land? Let’s paint our legends, not just play them.
