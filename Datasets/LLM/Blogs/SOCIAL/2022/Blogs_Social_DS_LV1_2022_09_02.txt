### The Price of a Paper Trail

It’s 2022, and my wife and I finally felt ready. After years of saving, we were going to apply for a mortgage—our ticket to a home of our own here in Phnom Penh. We had a plan, or so we thought.

Then came the reality check from the loan officer. Our combined debt-to-income ratio was too high. The culprit? Our reliable Toyota Camry, still being financed. That monthly payment, something we’d managed comfortably for years, was now the very thing blocking our path.

The solution felt almost backward. We had to drain a significant chunk of our cash savings to pay off the car loan entirely. It was a tough pill to swallow; watching that safety net shrink was terrifying. There was no bank deposit involved, just a direct payment to clear our name from a debt ledger.

It made me reflect on this modern paradox. To prove we are financially stable enough to take on a massive debt (a mortgage), we first had to erase a smaller, manageable one, even if it meant parting with our liquid security. It’s a strange dance of numbers and trust, where sometimes you have to let go of tangible cash to build credit for a future dream.
