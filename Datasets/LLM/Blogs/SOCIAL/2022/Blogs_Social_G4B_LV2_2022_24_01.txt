**Digging Deeper Than We Think**

Remember last year, all the buzz about “shale oil” and how it was supposed to be the solution? It felt like everyone was suddenly obsessed with extracting it from the ground – and it made me think about something bigger. 

I was reading about “oil shale” and this process called “in-situ retorting” – basically, heating the rock from *within* to get the oil out. It sounded a lot like “hydraulic fracturing,” or fracking, we were hearing so much about with shale oil. 

Suddenly, it hit me: are we really learning from our mistakes? Both methods seem to be pushing the limits of what’s acceptable in terms of environmental impact. It’s a sobering thought, isn’t it?  We need to ask ourselves – are we prioritizing short-term gains over the long-term health of our planet and communities? 

What are your thoughts? #environment #energy #reflection
