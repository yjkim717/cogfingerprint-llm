"Stepping into the Unknown: My Journey to Embracing Long-Distance"

As I stood at the crossroads of my life in the summer of 2022, the excitement of a new job was tangled with the anxiety of leaving behind everything familiar. At 21, I was about to embark on a 1500-mile journey, not just away from home, but from the comfort of loved ones and the security of known surroundings. The thought of transitioning to a new career in a new city was daunting. But as I took a deep breath and stepped into this unknown, I began to realize that it's okay to feel scared. It's okay to not have it all figured out. With each new experience, I learned to navigate my anxiety and found solace in the strength I discovered within myself. My journey taught me that sometimes, it's the leap into the unknown that leads to the most profound growth.
