**The Void Feels…Mean Lately**

Okay, Risk of Rain 2 players, let’s talk. I’ve been staring at those Void Fields for way too long, and honestly, they’re starting to feel *brutal*. Remember when they were a tricky hazard, a little test of your positioning? Now, it’s a guaranteed wipe if you blink. 

The sheer damage output combined with the relentless time pressure – seriously, the clock is *mocking* me – makes it almost impossible to properly react. And don’t even get me started on the lack of decent healing items to really mitigate the damage over time. It feels like the game is actively trying to punish you for daring to explore. 

It’s making me think about the bigger picture of risk and reward. Is the challenge still fun, or is it just frustrating?  Anyone else feeling this way as we head into 2022?
