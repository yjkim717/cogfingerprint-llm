The Sims game - a sandbox of endless possibilities. But what happens when a Sim's death turns the game into a revenge mission? For me, it was Eliza Pancakes, a ruthless Sim who took out my beloved character, sparking an obsession with taking her down. As I dove into the extreme violence mod, I realized how it blurred the lines between gaming experience and real-life emotions. Was I just having fun or was I tapping into a deeper desire for retribution? As I reflect on this Sims saga in 2022, I'm left questioning the psychology behind our digital actions.
