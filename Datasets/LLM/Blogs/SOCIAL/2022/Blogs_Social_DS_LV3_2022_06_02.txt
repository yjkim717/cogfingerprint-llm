### The Echo of an Empty Promise

I was on the phone with a well-meaning friend the other day, the kind whose life seems to orbit a sun of steady paychecks and predictable problems. I was trying to articulate the low-grade hum of panic that has become the soundtrack to my 2022, a year that feels less like a fresh start and more like a continuation of a marathon I never signed up for.

“Hang in there,” she said, her voice dripping with sympathetic certainty. “Things will get better.”

And I just… shut down.

It’s not that I’m ungrateful for the sentiment. It’s that the phrase “things will get better” has started to feel like the most hollow, cruel joke. It’s a platitude that ignores the topography of my entire adult life. Better implies a destination, a finish line I can see. From where I’m standing, all I see is the same damn maze.

My **struggle** isn’t a single, dramatic event. It’s a slow, grinding erosion. It’s the soul-crushing **disappointment** of finally landing a job interview after six months of searching, only to be told they’ve decided on an “internal candidate.” It’s the quiet shame of doing the monthly budget for the dozenth time, moving numbers around a spreadsheet like puzzle pieces that were never meant to fit, the **financial hardship** a constant, gnawing presence in my gut.

It’s the memory of 2020, when I lost my apartment and had to move back in with my parents at thirty-two. A global pandemic, sure, but the personal **disappointment** was a private earthquake. I told myself it was temporary. Two years later, I’m still in their spare room, my savings account a ghost of what it was, my pride in tatters. Every “for-now” solution has a terrifying way of becoming permanent.

And the exhaustion… it’s not the kind you can fix with a good night’s sleep. It’s a deep, cellular **exhaustion** born from the constant calculus of survival. Can I afford this doctor's visit? Will my ancient car make it through another winter? The mental load is a heavy blanket, smothering any flicker of creativity or joy.

So, when someone tells me “things will get better,” what I hear is, “Your pain is temporary, and your resilience is a given.” But what if it’s not? What if this isn’t a valley but the plateau? That’s the true seed of **hopelessness**—not a dramatic, give-up-on-life despair, but a quiet, chilling acceptance that this might just be it. The struggle is the story.

I don’t need empty reassurance. I think what I, and maybe you, need is for someone to just sit in the quiet with us and acknowledge the jagged, unfair shape of this reality. To admit that sometimes, things don’t get better. They just are. And surviving that, day after exhausting day, is its own kind of brutal, uncelebrated strength.
