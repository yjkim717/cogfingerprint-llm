**Title: Taming the Steam Menagerie: My Quest for the Perfect PC Control Scheme**

I’ll admit it—I’m a creature of habit. After hundreds of hours with *Monster Hunter Rise* on my Switch, my fingers have a deeply ingrained muscle memory with my Pro Controller. So, when I finally grabbed the PC version, my first mission wasn't to hunt a monster; it was to hunt for the perfect control scheme within Steam’s labyrinthine settings. The goal was simple: replicate my beloved Switch layout. The journey through Steam’s button mapping interface, however, was its own epic boss fight. After some trial and error, I finally recreated that familiar feel, proving that with a little patience, you can truly make any game on PC your own.
