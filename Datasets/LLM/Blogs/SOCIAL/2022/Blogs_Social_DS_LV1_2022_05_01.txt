It’s 2022, and I’m deep in the remote work groove—sweatpants, coffee, and a flood of email notifications. But lately, my inbox feels like a group chat gone wrong. Every "got it" or "thanks" sent via reply-all triggers a chorus of pings across the department.

I get it—we’re trying to stay connected, to signal we’re present. But as my screen lights up for the tenth time today with another acknowledgment, I wonder: are we communicating or just creating digital noise?

There’s a fine line between keeping everyone in the loop and drowning each other in notifications. Maybe it’s time to rethink our digital etiquette, to value clarity over clutter. After all, true connection in a remote world shouldn’t mean being constantly interrupted—it should mean being thoughtfully heard.
