It’s 2022, and I’m navigating Invisalign life—trays in for 23 hours a day, chasing that perfect smile. But then came the sore throat, a stubborn sidekick I hadn’t expected. I panicked: do I skip wear time for relief? Nope. I kept my aligners in, leaned on soothing throat lozenges, and learned to pop the trays out quickly for sips of tea. It’s a small struggle, but it taught me that even the tiniest adjustments can make big progress feel personal and totally worth it.
