**The $5,000 Phone Call and the Stranger in My Pocket**

My phone buzzed with an unknown number. Against my better judgment, I answered. The voice on the other end had a heavy Indian accent and launched into a frantic story about an eBay payment error. My guard was up instantly—this was a classic script.

But the real shock came an hour later. My brother, Mark, called. "Hey, I just Venmo'd you five grand for that eBay thing. The guy said it was urgent."

My blood ran cold. The scammer hadn’t targeted my account; he’d targeted my brother’s trust in *me*. In our hyper-connected world, it’s not just our own skepticism we need to arm, but that of everyone in our digital orbit. That stranger wasn’t just in my phone; he was in our relationship, testing it with a single, clever lie. It was a stark reminder that in 2022, the most valuable thing a scammer can steal isn’t money—it’s the faith we have in each other.
