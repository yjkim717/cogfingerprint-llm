## The Digital Face & the Real One

It’s weird, isn’t it, how much control we have over our online presence? I was messing around with a character creation tool the other day – you know, one of those where you build a digital avatar – and it struck me. The level of detail you can achieve with textures and mods… it’s basically like applying digital makeup and tattoos. 

It got me thinking about how we curate ourselves on social media. We filter, we edit, we highlight. We’re all, in a way, texture modding our real faces and identities.  Are we consciously shaping perceptions, or just reacting to the algorithms?  It's a bit unsettling to realize how easily we can build a completely constructed persona. Maybe a little less pixel-perfect perfection and a little more raw authenticity is what we all need online in 2022. Just a thought!
