**The Weight of Watching, and the Yearning for Something More**

Remember 2022? It felt like everyone was glued to their screens, scrolling, reacting, *watching*. Social media became this constant, low-humming anxiety – a feeling of needing to keep up, to offer the ‘right’ opinion, to curate a perfect little highlight reel of my life. It was exhausting. 

I found myself drawn to stories, specifically in online roleplay communities. There’s something incredibly appealing about escaping into a world where you can be someone else, where epic conflicts and quiet moments of angst feel…valid.  A lot of those worlds centered around giants – colossal figures representing overwhelming forces, and the desperate yearning to find a way to escape their shadow. 

It made me think about how we all crave that, don’t we? A space to breathe, to explore our own internal giants, and to find a way to step out from behind the screen and into a life that feels a little less performative, a little more *real*.  Anyone else feeling this pull lately?
