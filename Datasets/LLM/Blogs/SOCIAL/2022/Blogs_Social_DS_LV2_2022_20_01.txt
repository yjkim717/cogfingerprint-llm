### The Lost Art of the TV Intro

Remember when you couldn’t skip the intro? I was hit with a wave of this nostalgia recently, falling down a rabbit hole trying to remember a specific 2000s comedy. All I had to go on was a hazy memory of *The Office* font and an *Inbetweeners* vibe. It was a digital scavenger hunt fueled by pure, unadulterated nostalgia.

And it got me thinking—in our age of binge-watching and the relentless ‘Skip Intro’ button, we’ve lost something. Those 30-second intros weren’t just filler; they were a ritual. They were the deep breath before the plunge, the signal to your brain that it was time to switch off from the world and settle in. The quirky montage, the instantly recognizable theme song—it built a sense of community and anticipation that a simple ‘Next Episode’ countdown just can’t replicate.

In 2022, a year that still felt fragmented from the chaos of the pandemic, I realized I was craving those small, shared rituals. That search for a forgotten sitcom wasn’t just about finding a show; it was about reclaiming a feeling. It was a connection to a simpler time, a collective memory of laughing at the same cringe-worthy moments on a Thursday night.

Maybe it’s time we stop skipping so fast. Sometimes, the comfort we’re looking for isn’t in the next episode, but in the familiar tune that welcomes us home. What’s a TV intro that’s permanently etched into your memory? For me, it’ll always be the one I spent an entire evening trying to find.
