**The Weight of It All**

Honestly, 2022 felt… heavy. It wasn’t just the usual anxieties of life – the rising cost of everything, the constant feeling of being ‘paycheck to paycheck’ – it was layered with something completely unexpected. My mom was diagnosed with malignant melanoma.

We were navigating endless insurance paperwork, battling out-of-pocket expenses we hadn't budgeted for, and just feeling utterly overwhelmed. 

It’s isolating, trying to be strong for your family while simultaneously carrying this immense stress.  It made me realize how vulnerable we all are, and how quickly life can throw you a curveball.
