**The Way the Internet Feels Lately**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 felt…weird. Not in a dramatic, dystopian way, but a subtly unsettling one. I was scrolling through Reddit the other day, and a story hit me hard. A guy’s brother got caught in a classic online scam: a fake eBay return that ended with $5,000 funneled through Venmo. 

It’s not the money itself that’s scary, is it? It’s the *trust*. We’re supposed to be able to buy things, connect with people, and share experiences online, but these little cracks are appearing – these moments where that trust is shattered. 

It made me think about how easily we can be manipulated, how quickly a seemingly harmless transaction can turn into a nightmare. We’re so ingrained in these digital spaces, relying on platforms we don’t fully understand. It's a constant low-level anxiety, wondering if the person on the other end is *really* who they say they are.  Anyone else feeling this way?
