## The Unexpected Complication of Working Across Borders

It's 2022, and the remote work revolution is *real*. I’m living the dream – a Canadian permanent resident, but still a US citizen. Sounds simple, right? Not so much when the dream involves a fully remote job… based in the States. 

Suddenly, I'm wrestling with a whole new level of tax complexity. Do I file in Canada? The US? Both?! It’s a surprisingly isolating feeling, navigating these unfamiliar waters. It highlights how globalization, while offering incredible opportunities, can also throw some seriously complicated curveballs your way. I'm researching everything I can, but it's a stark reminder that even a "dream job" can come with unexpected administrative hurdles.
