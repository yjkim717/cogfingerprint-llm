**The Quiet After the Storm (and the Meows!)**

Okay, friends, let’s be real – social media can be *exhausting*, right? Scrolling through highlight reels, feeling the pressure to always be ‘on’… it’s a lot. Lately, I’ve been feeling a serious need for quiet, a little reset. 

It reminded me of something completely different: my sweet Luna. Just a few weeks ago, she was in full ‘heat’ mode – a whirlwind of frantic meowing, pacing, and generally being a little… intense. It was a lot to process, and honestly, a bit overwhelming to watch. 

Now, she’s back to her usual, wonderfully mellow self. But there’s a noticeable shift. A quietness that feels almost new. It’s a gentle reminder that change, even in the most familiar creatures, is inevitable. And sometimes, the most beautiful thing is the stillness that follows a period of intense activity. 

It’s made me think about my own online presence – maybe it's time for a little digital declutter and a whole lot more peace. What about you? How are you finding your quiet moments lately? #catlife #socialmedia #selfcare #petbehavior
