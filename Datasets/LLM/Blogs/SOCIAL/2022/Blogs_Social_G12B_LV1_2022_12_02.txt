## The Quiet Before the…What Was That?!

Okay, so I’m officially baffled. Remember how I was stressing about Luna, my cat, going through her heat cycle? Thankfully, that seems to have passed. She was back to her usual, gloriously sleepy self. Or so I thought.

Lately, she’s been *chatty*. Like, seriously chatty. Constant meows, little trills, just… talking. And then, the weirdest thing: little, playful (but slightly startling!) nips. Not aggressive, just… unexpected. 

It’s 2022, and we’re all used to unpredictable behavior, right? But this feels different than the hormonal rollercoaster of her heat. She's eating fine, playing normally, just… communicating in a whole new way. 

I've been reading up – apparently, even post-heat, cats can have behavioral shifts. Maybe she's just bored? Maybe she wants to tell me something I’m missing? It’s a reminder that even when you think you understand your furry friend, they’ve still got a few surprises up their sleeves. Anyone else experiencing this? Send help (and maybe some extra catnip!).
