### The Night We Found Magic in a Parking Garage

Last weekend, my partner and I did something we hadn’t done since… well, 2019. We went to the opera. Not in a grand, velvet-lined hall, but in a raw, converted parking garage for West Edge Opera’s production of *Ariane et Barbe-Bleue*. It felt like the perfect 2022 activity—a little gritty, deeply inventive, and a testament to the art that persisted even when the world paused.

I’ll be honest, I was there more for the experience than the story of Bluebeard. But something unexpected happened. As the powerful soprano, singing the role of Ariane, reached a crescendo, a single, stark light beam cut through the industrial darkness, illuminating her face. In that moment, a tiny, flickering LED on a set piece shorted out with a faint *pop*.

A minor technical glitch. A blip.

But instead of breaking the spell, it did the opposite. It grounded the entire fantastical story in our shared, imperfect reality. It was a beautiful reminder that the magic of live performance isn’t about flawless perfection. It’s about the raw, human effort happening right in front of you. It’s about the singer who pours her soul into a note while standing on what was once a concrete parking spot. It’s about the stagehand somewhere in the shadows, probably holding their breath.

Walking back to the car, the cool night air felt different. We weren’t just talking about the plot; we were talking about that moment of beautiful imperfection. It felt like a metaphor for… everything. For trying, for showing up, for creating something meaningful even when the wiring is a little faulty. After years of isolated screens, being part of that collective, human breath in a room was the real headline. The opera was just the incredible excuse.
