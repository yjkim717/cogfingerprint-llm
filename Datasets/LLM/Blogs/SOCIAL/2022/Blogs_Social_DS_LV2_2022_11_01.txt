It was supposed to be the year of getting back to normal. 2022, right? We were all trying to move forward. Then the doctor said the word no one wants to hear: cancer.

My first thought wasn't about survival rates or treatment plans. It was, "How will I pay for this?"

I have insurance. I work hard. But I was already living paycheck to paycheck. Now, the co-pays and deductibles are a tidal wave, washing away what little savings I had. The financial stress is its own sickness, a constant, gnawing fear in the pit of my stomach.

You can have the best fight in you, but it’s hard to focus on healing when you’re terrified of losing everything. No one should have to make that choice.
