Here's a reflective blog post:

"Have you ever wondered what happens when light bounces between two parallel mirrors? It's a mind-bending thought experiment that got me thinking about the nature of reflection. As I pondered this, I realized that our social reflections - the way we're perceived online - can be just as puzzling. In 2022, we're more connected than ever, yet we still struggle to grasp the true intensity of our online presence. Just like light loss occurs with each reflection, do we lose a piece of ourselves with each digital echo?"
