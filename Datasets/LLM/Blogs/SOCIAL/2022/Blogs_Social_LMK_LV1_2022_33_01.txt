**The Unseen Struggle: When You're 'Light' but Still Feel Heavy**

As I scroll through my social media feeds, I'm bombarded with images of chiseled abs and toned physiques. It's 2022, and the pressure to conform to societal beauty standards is as intense as ever. For a long time, I've felt self-conscious about my body, convinced that I'm 'too heavy' or 'not fit enough.' The irony? I'm actually relatively light. But when every mirror reflection and passing glance makes me cringe, it's hard to shake off the feeling of inadequacy. I've caught myself comparing my body to others, wondering why I don't have a 'perfect' shape or a flat stomach. The truth is, our perceptions of ourselves are often skewed, influenced by unrealistic expectations and curated online personas. It's time to break free from the shackles of body comparison and focus on what truly matters â€“ our health, not our appearance.
