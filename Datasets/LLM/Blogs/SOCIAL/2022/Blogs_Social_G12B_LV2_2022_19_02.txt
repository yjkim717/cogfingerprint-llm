>## The Line Between Inspiration and… Something Else?

Okay, creatives, let's talk about something a little prickly. I’ve been seeing a lot of buzz lately around sites selling screenshots from movies – marketed as resources for "photobashing" and artist referencing. 

It got me thinking. We *all* reference. It's how we learn, how we build. But is selling direct visuals, especially copyrighted material, really fair use? It feels like a murky area. I’m not a lawyer, obviously, but it’s raising some serious questions about respecting original work and the evolving landscape of digital inspiration. What are your thoughts? Let's discuss in the comments!
