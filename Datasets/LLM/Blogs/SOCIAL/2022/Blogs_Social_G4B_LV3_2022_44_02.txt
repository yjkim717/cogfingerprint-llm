**Lost in the Layers: Why Live Performance Still Matters**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2022 felt like a year of staring at screens. Scrolling, streaming, and generally feeling a little…disconnected. But last month, I finally managed to snag tickets to see ‘Ariane et Barbebleue’ – and it was a serious jolt to the system.

It wasn't just a pretty spectacle, you know? It was a *performance*. Watching the characters, Ariane and Barbebleue, wrestle with their desires and fates, felt incredibly raw. The director really dug deep into the symbolism of the production, layering meaning beneath the beautiful music. I found myself reflecting on my own choices, my own ‘characters’ in the ongoing story of my life. 

There were a couple of minor technical glitches – a dropped prop here, a slightly shaky lighting cue there – but honestly, they faded into the background. What truly resonated was the power of the voices, the sheer artistry of the singers and the commitment of the entire cast. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? In a world saturated with digital connection, experiencing something live, something created with such intention and vulnerability, felt like a genuine act of belonging. It reminded me that stories, and the people who tell them, still hold a profound power to change the way we see ourselves and the world around us.
