## The Tiny Intruders and the Big Anxiety

Okay, real talk: my house has a rodent problem. Rats and mice, to be precise. I’ve tried traps – so many traps! – but they’re just not cutting it. The thought of poison lurking around, potentially causing a… situation… inside my walls? It’s a hard pass. 

It’s more than just the mess, though. This whole thing has tapped into a deeper anxiety about losing control of my space, my home. Anyone else find themselves battling unexpected battles and realizing they’re about more than just the surface level? Send help (and maybe some humane pest control tips!).
