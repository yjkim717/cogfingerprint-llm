**The Unexpected Rage of a Digital Pancake**

Okay, real talk – 2022 felt like a year of little digital frustrations, right? I stumbled across this wild story about a *Sims* player who got absolutely *incensed* by a Sim named Pancakes. Seriously, it spiraled into a full-blown revenge mission involving an extreme violence mod. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a ridiculously simple game can trigger such a disproportionate reaction. I found myself thinking about how easily we build up tiny annoyances, letting them simmer until they erupt. Pancakes wasn’t even *that* bad, just… relentlessly aggressive. 

It made me wonder about our own online interactions. Do we let minor digital slights fester? Maybe it’s time to embrace the virtual pancake and just… let it go. What’s *your* biggest digital frustration lately?
