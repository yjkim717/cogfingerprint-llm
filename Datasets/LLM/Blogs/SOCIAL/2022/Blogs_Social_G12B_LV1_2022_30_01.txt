## The Rumor Mill & My Hybrid Hunt

Okay, so this week's been a weird one for golf gear anticipation. I was chatting with my local pro shop guy, and he casually mentioned whispers of a new Titleist hybrid dropping around mid-August. Immediately, I dove down a Reddit rabbit hole! It's funny how quickly social media amplifies these things. Now Iâ€™m simultaneously excited and trying to resist the urge to replace my perfectly good clubs based on a rumor. Anyone else battling this gear-lust fueled by online chatter?
