## That Suspicious Feeling: OfferUp and the Waiting Game

Okay, so I’ve been seeing a lot of chatter online lately about online marketplaces, and it got me thinking about a recent experience. I snagged a graphics card on OfferUp – a *really* good deal, I thought! – but now… crickets. The shipping label looks legit, there’s a tracking number, but it hasn’t updated in days. That little voice of doubt is creeping in. Is it a scam? It’s a weird feeling, this limbo of hoping for the best while bracing for the worst. Anyone else ever feel this way navigating online deals?
