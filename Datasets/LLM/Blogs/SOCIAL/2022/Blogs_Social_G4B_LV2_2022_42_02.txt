**The Unexpected Weight of a Walmart Job**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something that *should* be a step forward – like my son landing a job at Walmart – can suddenly feel like a massive weight. 2022 was a tough year for so many families, and we felt it acutely. The physical exam, the insistence on a valid ID (expired, of course!), and then the sheer number of paperwork fees… it all piled up. 

It wasn’t about the job itself, but the unexpected financial burden. It reminded me that sometimes, the path to opportunity isn't a straight line, and it takes more than just a resume to navigate.  Anyone else feel this sting?

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps add a specific detail or adjust the tone?
