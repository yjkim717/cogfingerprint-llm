**The Jane Tote Hangup**

Okay, so 2022 was *the* year for Six. I was absolutely obsessed, spending hours lost in the music and the story. But there’s one little thing that’s still bugging me – the lack of a Jane tote bag. Seriously, where’s the Jane tote?! 

I saw a post on Reddit about it, and honestly, I wasn't alone. It’s a minor thing, I know, but as a completionist (guilty!), it felt like a little piece was missing. It just highlights how social fandoms can sometimes focus on the smallest details, and how a simple merch item can spark a whole conversation.
