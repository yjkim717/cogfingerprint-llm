**The Sunday Sigh**

Let’s be real, 2022 felt like a constant sprint, didn’t it? Between juggling a demanding job and just… existing, it felt like weekends were just a fleeting memory. I found myself staring at my phone on my one day off, scrolling through everyone’s seemingly perfect lives, and feeling this low-level hum of inadequacy. 

This past Sunday, that feeling hit particularly hard. I was desperate for a genuine break, a moment to just *be*. But my dad, bless his heart, had a list – a *long* list – of yard work that needed doing. Suddenly, my precious day off was turning into another chore. 

It wasn't about the yard work itself, really. It was about the unspoken pressure, the feeling of being pulled in a million directions. It felt like a tiny echo of the constant “overworked” feeling I’d been battling all year. 

Honestly, just driving home, feeling the weight of it all, I needed to step away.  I pulled over, turned off the car, and just breathed.  It’s easy to get lost in the noise of social media, comparing ourselves to others’ highlight reels.  But sometimes, the most radical act of self-care is simply recognizing when *you* need a pause – even if it’s just a Sunday sigh. 

What’s your go-to reset button when life feels overwhelming?
