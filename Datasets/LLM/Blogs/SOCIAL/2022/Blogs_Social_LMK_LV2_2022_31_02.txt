The Frustrating Reality of Language Learning in a Globalized World

As I navigated the streets of Helsinki in 2022, I felt a surge of excitement to practice my Finnish skills. But, more often than not, locals responded to me in English. The same happened when I tried to converse in Hindi with native speakers online - they would switch to English, leaving me feeling discouraged. It's a common plight for language learners. The dominance of English can be overwhelming, making it tough to find opportunities to practice our target languages. I've come to realize that it's not just about finding language exchange partners, but also about creating a supportive environment that encourages native language practice. By being mindful of this, we can help break the English barrier and foster a more inclusive language learning experience. Let's make a conscious effort to support each other's language journeys.
