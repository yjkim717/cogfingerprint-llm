It’s 2022, and I’m selling my old graphics card on OfferUp. The buyer’s wary—can you blame them? The USPS tracking number I sent hasn’t updated in days, stuck at some facility. I get it; trust feels fragile these days. But I’m just a regular person trying to make a few bucks. It’s a reminder: behind every transaction, there’s a human hoping for a little faith.
