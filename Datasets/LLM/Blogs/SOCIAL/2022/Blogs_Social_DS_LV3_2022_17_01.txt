The cap and gown felt heavier than I expected on graduation day in 2022. Everyone kept asking about my plans, and I’d smile and say something vague about “opportunities out West.” But inside, my stomach twisted at the thought of trading coffee dates with my best friend for FaceTime calls across three time zones.

I’d lie awake at night, my mind racing. Was I chasing a career or running from something? The uncertainty was a constant hum in the background of every “congratulations.” My parents’ home, my favorite local park, the familiar faces at our corner café—these weren’t just places. They were anchors.

The scariest part wasn’t the new city or the job hunt. It was the quiet fear that my closest relationships would slowly fade into long-distance politeness, that I’d become a stranger in my own life. But then I’d remember: every “what if” about losing connections is also a “what if” about building new ones. Maybe courage isn’t the absence of that anxiety, but packing it right alongside your dreams.
