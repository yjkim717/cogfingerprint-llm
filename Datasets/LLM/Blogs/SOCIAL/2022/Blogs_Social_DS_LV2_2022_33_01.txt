### The Mirror’s Unfair Comparison

I stood in front of the mirror in 2022, a year supposedly about radical self-love, and all I could see was my double chin. The weirdest part? By every scale and chart, I’m a perfectly normal weight. Yet, there I was, feeling completely at odds with my own body.

It’s not even about health; it’s about a ghost in the glass. The ghost is my brother, who has the effortless, lean frame I’ve always envied. Every family photo, every casual glance, became a silent competition I was destined to lose. My brain would instantly compare, and my confidence would plummet.

I’m learning, slowly, that my body isn’t the problem. The problem is the invisible yardstick I use to measure it against someone else’s completely different blueprint. My worth isn’t hiding behind my jawline; it’s in the life this body lets me live. The journey isn’t about changing what I see, but changing *how* I see. And that’s a weight worth lifting.
