## The Gentle Art of Email Peace (and My WFH Sanity)

Working from home in 2022 was supposed to be *chill*, right? Flexible hours, comfy pants… the dream. But my inbox? It’s become a notification nightmare. It all started innocently enough. A quick "Got it!" reply-all to a team update. Then another. And another. Soon, my phone was buzzing every five minutes with acknowledgements. Seriously, *every* email.

It was driving me bonkers. My focus evaporated. My anxiety spiked. I realized I needed to address it, but how? Confrontation felt harsh. So, I started subtly. A gentle mention in our team chat about minimizing reply-alls unless truly necessary.  A strategically placed GIF of a stressed-out cat. 

It's a work in progress, admittedly. Some colleagues are getting the message, others… not so much. But I'm learning that even small steps toward email etiquette can make a big difference in maintaining a little sanity in this perpetually connected world. Anyone else battling the reply-all beast? Share your strategies!
