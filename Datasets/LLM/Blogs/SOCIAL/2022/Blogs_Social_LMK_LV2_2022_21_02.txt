As I dove back into Risk of Rain, I couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration with the Void Fields stage. The damage just feels too intense, and certain game mechanics seem to work against you. I mean, where's the slack when you need it most? Healing items are scarce, and damage over time effects feel like they're stacking up to finish you off. It's like the game is punishing you for being there. I've found myself wondering, is it even worth attempting? The thrill of exploring the unknown is overshadowed by the agony of repeated failure. It's 2022, and I've come to expect a certain level of polish from my gaming experiences. Void Fields feels like a step back, a harsh reminder that sometimes, the fun is lost in the frustration. Have you had a similar experience? How do you cope with stages that just feel too tough?
