Of all the things I expected to inherit from my father, a state in moral freefall was not one of them. It took a nightmare—not the kind with monsters under the bed, but the terrifyingly realistic kind that stains your waking hours—for me to truly understand the weight of it. It was the summer of 2022, and the political heatwave outside was nothing compared to the fever dream that gripped me one sweltering night.

In the dream, I was walking through our family home, but it was a fabrication. The walls were made of legal documents, the floor of campaign promises. My father was there, not as the man who taught me to ride a bike, but as a figurehead, his smile a carefully constructed mask. And then the corruption started to seep in. I saw it like a black mold, creeping from the foundations—backroom deals disguised as family dinners, the trauma of a betrayed public echoing in the hollow spaces where our real laughter used to be. I was an adult in this dream, but I felt like a child, powerless, watching the only home I’d ever known rot from the inside out.

I woke up gasping, the line between the nightmare and reality blurred. My father was a prominent figure in our state’s government, and the whispers I’d spent years dismissing suddenly had a chilling clarity. The dream wasn’t just a random horror show; it was my subconscious holding up a mirror, forcing me to confront what I’d always chosen to ignore.

That nightmare was a catalyst. It unearthed a deep-seated trauma—not from a single event, but from the slow, quiet corrosion of integrity. I realized my family’s legacy wasn’t just a name or a history; it was a system I was passively upholding by my silence. The phrase “it’s just politics” felt like a cop-out, a way to absolve myself of responsibility. But the dream made it personal. This wasn’t about anonymous bureaucrats; it was about *my* father, *my* home.

And with that realization came a crushing sense of responsibility. It’s a heavy cloak to wear, this duty to clean a house you didn’t dirty. How do you even begin to reform a system so entrenched? The path isn’t clear. It’s messy and fraught with personal cost. Do I speak out publicly, potentially tearing my own family apart? Do I work from within, trying to steer the ship from a place that feels morally compromised?

I don’t have all the answers yet. But the nightmare robbed me of my comfortable ignorance. I can no longer be a bystander in my own life’s story. The responsibility to step up, to use whatever voice and influence I have, is now a non-negotiable part of my existence. It’s a terrifying prospect, but the alternative—living in that fabricated, corrupt world, even if only in my dreams—is far worse. The real nightmare isn't the dream itself; it's waking up and choosing to do nothing.
