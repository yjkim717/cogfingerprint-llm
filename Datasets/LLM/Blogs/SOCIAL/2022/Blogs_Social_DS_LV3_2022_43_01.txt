It was one of those 2 a.m. conversations that starts with a silly question and ends somewhere profound. My partner and I stood in our long hallway, staring into the infinity created by two opposing mirrors. "Does the light get dimmer each time it bounces?" he asked.

That simple question about light refraction and reflection sent us down a rabbit hole of late-night physics searches. We learned that yes, technically, some energy is lost. But our perception of that gradual dimming? That's the human part. It made me think about 2022â€”how our own energy and brightness can feel diminished when constantly reflected back at us through screens and social echoes. Are we, like the light in our hallway, slowly losing our spark by bouncing our attention off so many surfaces? The mirrors held no answer, just our thoughtful faces, a little dimmer in the endless tunnel of reflections.
