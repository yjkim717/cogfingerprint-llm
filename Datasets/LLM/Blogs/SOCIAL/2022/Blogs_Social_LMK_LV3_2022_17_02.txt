As I navigated my clinical rotation in 2022, a minor incident left me shaken - a tiny splash of bodily fluid on my skin. As a nursing student with emetophobia, the fear of vomiting, this was a nightmare come true. My anxiety spiked, and I couldn't help but wonder: what if? I realized that my phobia wasn't just about the incident itself, but about the uncertainty and loss of control that came with it. Reflecting on this experience, I'm learning to confront my fears and develop coping strategies, not just for my nursing career, but for life.
