There’s a strange nostalgia that hits when you’re zooted on prescription meds in 2022, scrolling through old photos. I remember my Vietnamese friend in college, the one who introduced me to harder stuff, laughing as we debated life’s big questions. Now, alone in my apartment, that chaotic freedom feels like a lifetime ago. It’s a bittersweet reminder of how much has changed, and what we left behind chasing those fleeting highs.
