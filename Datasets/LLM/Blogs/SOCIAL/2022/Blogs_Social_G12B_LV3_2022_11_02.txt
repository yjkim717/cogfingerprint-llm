's response:## When Insurance Feels Like a Brick Wall

Okay, let's be real. Dealing with insurance companies can feel like navigating a maze blindfolded, right? I saw a really frustrating post on Reddit the other day that hit a little too close to home. Someone – a real person, facing a serious health challenge – had their short-term disability claim denied by MetLife after undergoing melanoma surgery. 

Melanoma. That’s scary enough on its own. Then to be fighting for basic income support while recovering? It's just… unfair. What made it even worse was the struggle to get the necessary medical paperwork. It’s a vicious cycle.

It really highlights how vulnerable we are. You pay into these systems, hoping they’ll be there when you need them, and sometimes… they just aren't. It’s a reminder to advocate for yourself, to document *everything*, and to lean on your community when things get tough. Anyone else ever felt this way?
