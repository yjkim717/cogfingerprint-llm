**The Tightrope of Friendship: BPD, Trauma, and Reaching Out**

It's funny, isn't it, how social media can both connect us and create these huge, echoing silences? Lately, I’ve been feeling the weight of one of those silences, and it's got me doing a *lot* of thinking about friendship, mental health, and the tricky business of boundaries.

A few months back, a close friend experienced a really difficult trauma. I was heartbroken for her, and wanted to be there, to offer support. But then… things started to shift online. Her posts became… intense. Rapidly changing narratives, accusations, and some pretty alarming expressions of despair.  It was a lot. And honestly, it triggered a lot of old anxieties in me.

My friend has BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder), something she’s shared with me openly in the past. I understand, intellectually, that BPD can impact emotional regulation and how someone processes trauma. I *get* that. But seeing it play out so publicly, so rawly, across Instagram and Facebook… it felt different. It felt… overwhelming.

I found myself pulling away.  Feeling guilty for pulling away.  Wondering if I was being a bad friend. Was I abandoning her when she needed me most? Or was I protecting myself from something I wasn’t equipped to handle?  The internet, as it often does, amplified everything, turning a complex situation into a dizzying spiral of "what ifs."

I’ve been wrestling with whether to reach out, to try and reconnect. Part of me desperately wants to, to offer that support. But another part is terrified of the emotional fallout, of getting drawn back into a cycle that could be harmful to both of us.

It's a tightrope walk, isn’t it? Balancing empathy with self-preservation.  Recognizing the pain of a friend while also acknowledging the limits of what you can realistically offer. I don't have any answers, just a lot of questions and a growing awareness of how fragile these connections can be, especially when mental health is involved. And a lot of hope that she’s finding the support she truly needs.
