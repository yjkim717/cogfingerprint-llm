**The One Thing My Scale Can't Measure**

2022 was the year I finally admitted my scale and I were in a toxic relationship. It would give me a perfectly "normal" number, and I'd still walk away feeling like I'd failed.

The real issue wasn't the weight, but the distribution. While my brother got the family's "lean and lanky" genes, I seemed to have inherited the "sturdy" ones. My constant companion? A double chin that felt like a neon sign announcing my self-consciousness, even during video calls where I was just sitting still.

I’d catch my reflection and not see a healthy guy in his thirties; I’d see a body that felt fundamentally *wrong* compared to the effortless frame I’d grown up beside. It’s a strange battle, fighting a physique that, on paper, is fine. I’m learning it’s less about the number and more about making peace with a body composition I didn’t choose, and quieting the critic that lives right under my jawline. The journey isn't about shrinking anymore—it's about finally feeling at home in my own skin.
