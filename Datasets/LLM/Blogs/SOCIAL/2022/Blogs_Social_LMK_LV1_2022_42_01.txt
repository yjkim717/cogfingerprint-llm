"As a parent and a reader, I'm thrilled to see authors like Rick Riordan pushing boundaries in young adult literature. His latest book is a game-changer, featuring a strong female protagonist who's not afraid to take charge. What's more, Riordan tackles the often-taboo topic of menstruation with refreshing honesty. It's a welcome respite from the usual sanitized portrayals of adolescence. By depicting realistic female leadership and bodily experiences, Riordan is helping to empower a new generation of young readers. As we navigate the complexities of 2022, it's heartening to see literature that reflects the world we want our kids to grow up in."
