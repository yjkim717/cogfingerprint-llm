As I scrolled through social media in 2022, I stumbled upon artists sharing their photobashing techniques, using images from sites like Shotdeck as references. It got me thinking - is this fair usage or copyright infringement? Many artists use these resources to hone their skills, but where do we draw the line? I'm no lawyer, but it's clear that the boundaries between inspiration and infringement are blurry, and it's up to us to be mindful of our creative practices.
