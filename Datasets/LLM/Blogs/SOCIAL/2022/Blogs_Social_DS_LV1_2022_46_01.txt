Remember that feeling of stumbling upon an old film that just clicks? Last week at our local festival, I finally saw Nicholas Roeg’s "Don’t Look Now." It wasn’t just the haunting imagery—it was realizing how these 70s gems ripple through time.

It got me thinking: in 2022, we’re all curators of our own digital lives, sharing clips and aesthetics that inspire new creations. That forgotten poet from a 60s British film, the eerie tension Roeg mastered, even Kubrick’s boldness in "A Clockwork Orange"—they’re not locked in the past. They’re conversations across generations, reminding me how every story we engage with today is part of a larger, shared cultural tapestry. What hidden inspiration might you uncover?
