## The Echo Chamber & My Latest Forum Face-Palm

It’s 2022, and you’d think we’d be a little better at, you know, *listening* online. But lately, I've been revisiting some old gaming forums – a nostalgic habit, really – and it’s just… frustrating. 

There’s this relentless current of people so convinced of their own brilliance, they’ll argue a point to the death, even when presented with solid evidence to the contrary.  I saw a thread about the optimal build for a character in *Elden Ring* where someone vehemently insisted their wildly inefficient strategy was superior, despite multiple experienced players calmly explaining why it wasn’t. 

It's not just about being wrong, it’s the *refusal* to acknowledge facts. It feels less like a genuine discussion, and more like a competition to see who can be the most stubbornly right.  I wonder if we've all just gotten too comfortable shouting into our personalized echo chambers. Maybe a little humility wouldn’t hurt.
