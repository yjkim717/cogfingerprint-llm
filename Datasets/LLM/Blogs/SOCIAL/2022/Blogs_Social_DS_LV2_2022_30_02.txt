Sometimes it feels like the universe has a personal vendetta against me. I try to do good, but a cascade of small, draining things just keeps coming. It’s an exhausting weight, and I can’t help but feel a little bitter watching others coast by, completely oblivious. This isn’t about hating people; it’s about feeling perpetually misunderstood and targeted by life itself. In 2022, that isolating exhaustion became my shadow. Anyone else ever feel that way?
