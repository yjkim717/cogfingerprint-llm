## The Quest for the Right Book: A Parent's Dilemma

It's 2022, and my little bookworm is *devouring* everything she can get her hands on. Seriously, she's a force of nature. We’ve tackled mountains of *Magic Tree House* adventures, and she's happily zooming through chapter books. But now, she’s eyeing something a little…bigger. Specifically, Tamora Pierce’s *Circle of Magic* series.

My gut tells me she’s almost there, but I’m hesitant. At seven, are those themes and complexities truly age-appropriate? I remember reading those books as a pre-teen and being utterly captivated, but a seven-year-old’s experience might be vastly different.

It’s a constant negotiation, isn’t it? Wanting to nurture a love of reading while also protecting them from things they’re not quite ready for. I’m leaning towards starting with the first book and seeing how it goes, maybe supplementing with some lighter fantasy in the meantime. Any fellow parents navigated similar terrain? Share your wisdom!
