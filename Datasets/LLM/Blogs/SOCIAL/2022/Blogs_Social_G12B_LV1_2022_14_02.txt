## The Christmas Dress Panic (and Reddit to the Rescue!)

Okay, confession time: I left my Christmas dress shopping *way* too late. It's December 2022, and I needed something festive, fast. BlackMilk, my usual go-to for quirky Christmas prints, was sold out, naturally. Cue mild panic! Then I remembered Reddit. Seriously, a quick search on r/AskReddit led me to some amazing suggestions for legit online shops with express shipping. Crisis averted! Proof that the internet, sometimes, is a beautiful thing. âœ¨
