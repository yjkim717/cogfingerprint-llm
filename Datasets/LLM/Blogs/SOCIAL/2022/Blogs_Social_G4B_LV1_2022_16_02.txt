**The Echo Chamber of “Experts”**

Anyone else feel like the internet’s become a battlefield of opinions? I was scrolling through a gaming forum last week, completely lost in a thread about a new strategy game, and it devolved into the most frustrating argument.  Someone was loudly declaring themselves an “expert” based on, like, one YouTube video. 

It’s exhausting, honestly. This constant need to prove you know better, to shut down anyone who disagrees.  So much time wasted on unproductive shouting matches, fuelled by people who *think* they’re right.  I started wondering – are we all just desperately trying to be heard, even if it means tearing down others?  It’s a sad reflection on how we use the internet, isn’t it?
