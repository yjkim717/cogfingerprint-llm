"I'm obsessed with my natural auburn locks, but lately, I've noticed they're lightening as they grow out. As a reddish-brown hair devotee, it's been disheartening to see my vibrant color fade. In 2022, it's crazy how easily our hair can change - between the sun, heat styling, and environmental factors, it's a wonder we don't all have grey hair by now! I'm on a mission to preserve my rich hair color without resorting to dye. Has anyone else struggled with this? Got any tips to share?"
