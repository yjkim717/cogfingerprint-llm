It’s 2022, and I’m on week three of Invisalign—committed to that 23-hour wear goal. But wow, my throat’s been scratchy lately! I realized I’d been popping throat lozenges or hard candies between meals, then rushing my aligners back in. It hit me: I was prioritizing tray time over comfort, ignoring my body’s signals. Now, I pause, sip tea, and breathe. Sometimes, the most productive thing we can do is slow down and listen—even in our hustle-obsessed world.
