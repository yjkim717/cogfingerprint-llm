**The Scroll & The Shame**

Let’s be honest, 2022 felt like a constant scroll. Instagram, TikTok… it’s a highlight reel of everyone else’s “perfect” lives. And sometimes, that perfect life includes gleaming, confidently straight teeth – thanks to Invisalign, maybe? 

Recently, I read a Reddit thread about someone regretting switching Invisalign providers, frustrated with the results and feeling a bit lost. It hit a nerve. We all crave validation, especially online. But chasing that filtered perfection can be exhausting. 

It’s okay to not love every stage of a process, or to realize a path isn’t the right one. Like that user, shifting providers felt like admitting something wasn’t working.  It’s a vulnerable move, but prioritizing *your* happiness and results – not someone else’s ideal – is always worth it.
