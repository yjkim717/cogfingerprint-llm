**The Weight of "Almost"**

Okay, so 2022 feels…heavy, doesn’t it? Like everyone’s teetering on the edge of something huge. I’ve been feeling it *really* intensely lately, and it’s all tied up with this looming graduation. It's not the degree itself, honestly. It’s the *what comes next*. 

I’m moving across the country, a whole new state, and my boyfriend, Liam, is staying behind. That distance feels like a physical weight, doesn’t it? We’re trying to make it work, but there’s this constant undercurrent of anxiety – will we still connect? Will this be the start of something amazing, or the slow unraveling of something good? 

It’s a weird cocktail of excitement and terror, and I’m definitely not alone in feeling this uncertain blend. Anyone else wrestling with the “almost” of big life changes?
