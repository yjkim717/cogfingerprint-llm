**The Weight of a Promise Broken**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 felt like a year of dashed expectations, didn’t it? I dove headfirst into Overwatch 2, hyped for the beta access, and honestly, I walked away feeling… betrayed. It wasn’t just about the game itself, though it definitely had its issues. It was about the *feeling* I got after buying in, trusting Blizzard’s promises.

The marketing felt deliberately vague about the beta, and when it finally arrived, it was a mess.  Suddenly, it felt like a test of my patience, a reminder that sometimes, the biggest letdowns come from the people we *think* we can rely on. 

It made me think about how easily trust can erode when words don’t match actions.  It’s a surprisingly heavy thing to grapple with, especially when it’s tied to something you were genuinely excited about.  Anyone else feeling this kind of social disappointment lately?
