Of course, here is a reflective blog post based on your summary.

For years, I wore the label of "chronically depressed" like a lead coat. My psychologist was kind, but when I’d mention my lifelong dance with chaos—the forgotten keys, the half-finished projects—ADHD wasn’t on the table. It was just another symptom of the sadness.

But a quiet, stubborn voice in me knew there was something more. In 2022, after scrolling through one too many relatable #AdultADHD TikToks, I finally booked an appointment with a psychiatrist who specializes in it.

Walking out of that first session, I didn't have a diagnosis yet, but I had something I’d lost: hope. For the first time, I felt truly *heard*. It’s terrifying to reconsider your entire life’s narrative, but it’s also a profound relief to finally be looking in the right place for answers. This isn't an end; it feels like the real beginning.
