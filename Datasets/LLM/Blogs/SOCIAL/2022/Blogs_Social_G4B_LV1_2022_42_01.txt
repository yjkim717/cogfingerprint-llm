**Seriously, *Daughter of the Deep* Got Me Thinking…**

Okay, so I just finished Rick Riordan’s *Daughter of the Deep*, and honestly, I’m still buzzing. It’s not just the epic mythology and action – though that’s a huge part of it! – but the way he tackled Annabeth’s period storyline. It felt… real. Like, genuinely acknowledging a totally normal, messy part of being a teenager. 

As a twenty-something navigating my own hormonal rollercoaster in 2022, it was a surprisingly refreshing perspective.  Riordan doesn't shy away from it, and that’s powerful. And beyond that, watching Annabeth step into a leadership role, figuring things out as she goes, was inspiring. It reminded me that leadership isn’t about being perfect; it’s about showing up and trying.  What books have recently resonated with you on a deeper level?
