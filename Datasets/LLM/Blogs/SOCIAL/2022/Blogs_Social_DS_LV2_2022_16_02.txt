It’s 2022, and I just spent an hour arguing with someone on a game forum who insisted they knew more about a character’s backstory than the actual developers. They cited “common knowledge” and ignored the official lore I linked. Sound familiar?

I had to step back and ask myself: why did I engage? It’s like we’re all trapped in this cycle of trying to prove we’re right to strangers who aren’t even listening. Sometimes, it feels less like a debate and more like performance art for an audience of none.

These days, I’m learning to recognize when a discussion is genuine and when it’s just digital trolling. My sanity thanks me. Anyone else feel this way?
