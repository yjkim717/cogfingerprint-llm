## The Tightrope Walk of Friendship and Boundaries

Okay, so, things have been… complicated lately. I've been doing a lot of thinking, a lot of journaling actually, and wrestling with some pretty tough feelings around friendship, mental health, and the blurry lines we draw between forgiveness and enabling. 

It started a few months ago. A friend – let's call her Sarah – reached out. Sarah has Borderline Personality Disorder, and we've had a history. A history that included some really painful moments, including a period where she struggled with self-harm. We drifted apart a while back, partly because the emotional intensity was a lot to handle, and partly because I realized I wasn't equipped to be her primary support system. 

Her apology was… sincere. Raw, even. She acknowledged the pain she’d caused, specifically how her actions had impacted me. I genuinely felt a flicker of empathy, a pull to reconnect. I've always believed in second chances, and honestly, missed her.

But then things took a weird turn. 

Sarah started posting a lot on social media. And not just *any* posts. They were… aggressive. Targeted. Critiquing – harshly, I might add – various religious beliefs. Now, everyone’s entitled to their opinions, absolutely. But the way she was doing it felt… different. It felt like she was deliberately trying to provoke a reaction, to stir up conflict. 

It's left me in this incredibly awkward space. Part of me wants to reach out, to offer support. To remind her that her struggles don't excuse hurtful behavior. Another part of me is terrified of falling back into old patterns, of becoming a dumping ground for emotional turmoil. 

And honestly, the religious aspect just adds another layer of complexity. It makes me question if this reconnection is truly healthy for *me*. Am I obligated to support someone, even when their actions are causing me distress?

I’m realizing that setting boundaries isn’t about rejecting someone; it's about protecting myself. It’s about acknowledging that I can’t fix anyone, and that my own mental wellbeing matters. It’s a tightrope walk, that's for sure. Balancing compassion with self-preservation. It’s a lesson I’m still learning, especially navigating it all in the hyper-connected landscape of 2022.



Anyone else ever felt this way? What do you do when a friend is struggling, but their behavior is impacting you negatively? I’d really love to hear your thoughts.
