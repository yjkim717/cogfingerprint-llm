## The Little Things That Get You

Okay, hear me out. It’s a weird one. I was playing Rocket League the other night – you know, that chaotic, addictive game where cars play football? – and got totally fixated on something small. They just released a new set of country decals, a Nike collaboration, and… it’s a bit of a mess.

Specifically, some countries got the full Nike treatment – swooshes and all. But England? Just a flag. And no Team GB option, which feels odd given the recent Commonwealth Games. It sounds ridiculous, I know, but it genuinely bummed me out. 

It’s not about the shoes, or the branding, or even Rocket League itself. It’s about feeling seen, you know? That little flag representing your country, your team… it’s a small thing, but it adds to the community and the fun. It’s a reminder of shared identity. And when it's missing, or feels incomplete, it's a tiny disappointment in a world that already feels a little disconnected. Just a thought. Anyone else ever get surprisingly invested in virtual decals?
