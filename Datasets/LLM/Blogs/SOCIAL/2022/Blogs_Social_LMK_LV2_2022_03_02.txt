As a parent, I've witnessed my kid's love for Pok√©mon Go shine through despite the frustrations adult players face. At the 2022 Go Fest, I saw firsthand how Niantic's policies can be a turn-off for grown-ups, but for kids, it's a whole different story. They don't care about the 'raid changes' or 'server issues'; they just want to catch 'em all! It's a refreshing reminder that sometimes, simplicity is key to joy.
