**The Weight of Everything**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How life can just… pile on. This past year, 2022, felt like a constant negotiation with gravity. I watched a friend receive a cancer diagnosis – a shock that sent ripples through our whole group. Then, the bills started rolling in, a relentless tide of medical expenses that felt impossible to stem. 

Suddenly, everything felt weighted down. The joy of a shared laugh felt muted, the energy to even *respond* on social media drained away. I found myself scrolling, seeing everyone’s curated happiness, and feeling a deep, unsettling shame for not feeling…okay. 

It’s easy to project an image of strength online, but honestly? Some days, it’s just about surviving.  Recognizing that struggle, and allowing myself to feel it, was the first step.  Sending a simple "thinking of you" can sometimes be more powerful than a perfectly filtered post.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way – perhaps focusing on a specific aspect, or aiming for a slightly different tone?
