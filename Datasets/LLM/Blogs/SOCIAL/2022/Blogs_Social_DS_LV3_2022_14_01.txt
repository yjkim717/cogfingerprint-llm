Rewatching that Ocarina of Time beta showcase VOD from 2022 felt like a digital reunion. Hearing the teamâ€™s laughter and shared amazement was a testament to how powerful our online communities can be. It wasn't just about the game; it was a reminder of the genuine connection and collective joy we built, even through a screen. Truly special.
