## That Earworm You Can't Place… And a Film About Existential Dread

Anyone else ever get a song stuck in their head that feels *ancient*, like it’s been echoing in the background of your life forever? I’ve been chasing one for days now. It’s this short, slightly unsettling jingle – all static and hazy melody – and it's driving me a little mad.

The weirdest part? It popped into my head after rewatching "A Serious Man" recently. The film’s already steeped in a sense of unsettling familiarity, right? And this jingle just *fit* perfectly with that feeling of searching for something just out of reach.

Turns out, a fellow Reddit user is on the same hunt! They suspect it’s a vintage TV ad, lost to the sands of time. It’s got me thinking about how deeply ingrained certain snippets of media become in our collective memory, even if we can't quite place them. It's a strange, comforting, and slightly creepy feeling, isn't it? Anyone else recognize it? Let me know!
