As I scroll through my feeds, I'm struck by the diversity of online roleplay communities. I recently stumbled upon a post from a 17-year-old girl looking for a roleplay partner to explore a fantasy world with a twist - she wanted to play a character amidst angst and conflict, with a giant as her character. It's fascinating to see how people are drawn to different themes and genres, from urban fantasy to medieval-inspired settings. What I find particularly interesting is how these online interactions can be a safe space for self-expression. In 2022, it's amazing to see how social media has enabled people to connect with others who share their passions, even if they're niche. For this young girl, finding someone to share her fantasy world with could be a great way to explore her creativity and maybe even work through some real-life emotions. It's a lovely reminder of the power of online communities to bring people together.
