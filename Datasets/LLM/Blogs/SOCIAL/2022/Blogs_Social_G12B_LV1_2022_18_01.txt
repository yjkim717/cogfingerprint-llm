## The Illusion of Altitude (and My Monk's Dilemma)

Okay, so I'm diving into a new D&D campaign this fall, and I’ve decided to play a Kenku Monk. Sounds niche, right? The thing is, I’m really hoping to capture the *feeling* of flight with this build. The Kenku's mimicry, combined with a carefully chosen subclass, should allow for some clever, almost aerial maneuvers. 

But… I'm already second-guessing myself. Will this intricate plan just feel clunky and awkward at levels 1-3? Will I be spending more time explaining *how* I'm "flying" than actually doing anything cool? Social media’s full of perfectly optimized builds; I hope my experiment isn’t a flop! Wish me luck.
