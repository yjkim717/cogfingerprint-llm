Sitting in my Vancouver apartment in 2022, I stared at my laptop—my U.S. employer’s logo glowing back. As a U.S. citizen and Canadian PR, I felt caught between two homes. Did my remote work tie me to Canadian taxes, even without local income? It was more than paperwork; it was about belonging. Navigating two identities, I realized home isn’t just where you live, but where your responsibilities—and heart—truly settle.
