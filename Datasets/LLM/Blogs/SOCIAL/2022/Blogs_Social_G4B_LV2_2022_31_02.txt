**The English Echo Chamber**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2022 felt like a year of feeling… a little lost in translation. I’ve been chipping away at learning Spanish for ages, and I hit a wall. Suddenly, *everywhere* I looked online, it was English. Forums, tutorials, even helpful language exchange partners – all defaulting to English. 

It was incredibly disheartening. It felt like all my effort was being met with an echo chamber. I started to seriously question if it was even worth pushing forward.  The language barrier felt less like a challenge and more like a giant, unscalable wall. 

It’s a weird feeling, right? Like your passion is being subtly sidelined by the dominant language.  I'm learning to push back against that, to seek out those smaller, native-language communities.  Because honestly, the reward of truly connecting with a culture through *their* words? That’s what it’s all about.
