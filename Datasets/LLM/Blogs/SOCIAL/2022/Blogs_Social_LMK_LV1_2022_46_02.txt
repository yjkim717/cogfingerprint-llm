The elusive TV jingle. I was watching a rerun of "A Serious Man" (2009) on a streaming platform in 2022, and a familiar tune caught my ear during a pivotal scene. It sounded eerily similar to a jingle I'd heard before, possibly on an old TV commercial. I became obsessed with identifying the song. Was it a pre-existing tune or a custom composition? After some digging, I discovered that the tune was actually a catchy melody from the 80s. It turned out to be a popular advertising jingle that had stuck in my subconscious. The mystery was solved, and I was left pondering the power of music in media.
