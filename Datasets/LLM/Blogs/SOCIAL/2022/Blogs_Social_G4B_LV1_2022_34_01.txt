**Scrolling Through a Feeling: My Thoughts on Brand Social in 2022**

Okay, let’s be real – 2022 was *the* year of social media saturation. I’ve been diving deep into helping local businesses build their brand online, and honestly, it’s made me think a lot about what actually *connects*. 

It’s easy to get caught up in chasing trends – bright filters, perfectly timed Reels, endless stories. But I’ve realized that truly effective branding on social isn't about flashy tactics; it’s about crafting a feeling. 

I was working with a fantastic little bakery last year, and they were stressing about getting the “right” aesthetic. We shifted focus to showcasing *their* story – the baker’s passion, the local ingredients, the warmth of their space. Suddenly, their feed wasn’t just pretty pictures, it was inviting. 

It’s a reminder that millennials (and everyone else!) are craving authenticity. Let’s ditch the pressure to *perform* and start creating social media that genuinely reflects a brand’s soul. What are your thoughts?
