It’s funny how a snippet of sound—a jingle, a familiar tune—can stop you in your tracks. I was watching a film in 2022, and in a scene layered with static, there it was: that TV jingle from my childhood. It felt like a whisper from the past, a shared cultural touchstone hiding in plain sight. In a world that often feels disconnected, those fleeting moments of collective recognition are a quiet comfort. We’re all tuning into the same invisible frequencies, even when we think we’re alone.
