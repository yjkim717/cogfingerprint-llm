It’s funny how one word can hold such contradiction. In 2022, a friend described a date as "fine"—a single, ambiguous word that left me guessing. Was it politely mediocre or genuinely great? It made me realize how much we rely on context and tone, not just dictionary definitions, to truly understand each other. Sometimes, the simplest words create the widest gaps in our social connections.
