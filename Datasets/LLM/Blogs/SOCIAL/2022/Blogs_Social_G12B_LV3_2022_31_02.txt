## The Invisible Barrier: Why Learning a Language Feels So Hard Sometimes

It's 2022, and we’re supposedly more connected than ever. Yet, as I’m trying to really *learn* a language, I'm hitting a wall. A frustrating, invisible wall made of… English. 

I'll start a conversation, brimming with enthusiasm, ready to stumble through phrases and mispronunciations. Then, almost without fail, comes the response: "Oh, just speak English, it's easier!" 

It’s not malicious, I know. But it’s a quiet discouragement. It feels like a subtle rejection of my effort, and a reinforcement of English’s dominance. It makes me question my motivation, makes me wonder if truly connecting with the culture I’m trying to understand is even possible. 

I crave that feeling of genuine immersion, of fumbling through conversations and *actually* understanding. It's about more than just grammar; it's about building bridges. And right now, those bridges feel a little shaky. Anyone else feel this way?
