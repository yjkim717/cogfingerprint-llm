There I was, ready to dive back into the world of Monster Hunter Rise on my PC in 2022, Pro Controller in hand. But muscle memory is a funny thing. My fingers, so accustomed to the Switch's layout, fumbled on the PC's different button mappings. It’s more than just controls; it’s about that seamless feel, the flow of the hunt. I just want to recapture that original setup, to make the transition as smooth as the gameplay I remember. Has anyone else faced this controller clash?
