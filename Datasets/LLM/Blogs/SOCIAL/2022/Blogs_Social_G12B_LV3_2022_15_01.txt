## Those Tiny Stitches and a Whole Lot of Worry

Okay, friends, let’s talk cat anxieties. Specifically, *my* cat anxieties. My little Willow just had her spaying surgery a couple of weeks ago, and things seemed to be going smoothly… until they weren't. We noticed a bit of redness around the incision site, and honestly, panic set in. 

Suddenly, I was a whirlwind of online searches: "cat spay incision healing," "stitches removal timeline," you name it. It’s amazing how quickly a seemingly minor issue can feel like a huge crisis when it involves a furry little member of your family. 

I reached out to our vet, of course, and that really helped calm my nerves. It seems a little extra healing time is normal sometimes. Seeing those tiny stitches, knowing how vulnerable she was, just tugged at my heartstrings. 

It's a good reminder, isn't it? Even when we're doing everything “right” – choosing a reputable vet, following all the post-op instructions – things can still throw us a curveball. And that's okay. It's about being observant, proactive, and trusting our instincts. Now, wish Willow a speedy recovery!
