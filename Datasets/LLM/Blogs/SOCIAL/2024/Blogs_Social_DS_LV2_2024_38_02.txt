It’s funny—in 2024, we’re all curators of our own little universes online, yet sometimes I feel more like Frankenstein’s monster than the creator. I’ve been working on this dark fantasy novel inspired by the old Universal Monsters, now public domain, and I keep asking myself: am I stitching together something fresh, or just reanimating nostalgia?

I shared a snippet online, and the response was a mix of excitement and protective purism. It hit me—our creations, once shared, belong to everyone in a way. They live and breathe in the collective imagination. It’s a delicate dance, honoring the past while weaving in your own voice. In a world of endless reboots, maybe the real horror isn’t the monster—it’s losing the soul of the story. And perhaps, the soul is just us, connecting.
