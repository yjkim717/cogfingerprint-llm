### The Unseen Hurdle: More Than Just a Room

They tell you that moving to Germany for your studies is about embracing a new culture and expanding your mind. They don’t tell you that your biggest challenge won’t be the coursework, but finding a roof over your head.

At 35, returning to university felt like a brave new beginning. But here in 2024, the housing hunt feels like a system designed to keep you out. Every “WG Gesucht” (flat-share) ad is a fresh wave of anxiety. The dreaded “Schufa report” requirement—a German credit check I, as a new arrival, simply cannot produce—is an immediate roadblock. Then comes the quiet judgment. “We’re looking for someone… younger,” reads one polite rejection. Another simply ghosts my application.

It’s a lonely feeling. You’re fighting for something as basic as shelter, and the barriers aren’t just financial; they’re bureaucratic and, at times, ageist. My dream of a German education is real, but so is the reality that my greatest lesson so far is in resilience. I’m not just looking for a room; I’m looking for a chance to prove I belong here.
