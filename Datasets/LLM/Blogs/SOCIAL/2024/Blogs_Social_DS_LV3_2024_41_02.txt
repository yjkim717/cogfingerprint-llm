There I was, at the airport gate in 2024, feeling that familiar pang of modern anxiety—my laptop battery hovering at 8%. I’d invested in this smart Samsonite bag with its built-in easy pass system and a dedicated internal USB cable, promising seamless charging on the go. But as I fumbled, connecting my power bank, doubt crept in. Was it even working?

It struck me then how our social lives often feel the same. We’re all wired with invisible connections, hoping our efforts to reach out—a text, a call—will “charge” a relationship, bridge a distance. Sometimes the system fails; sometimes a connection just clicks.

Finally, a green light glowed on my laptop. Relief. It’s a small reminder that in a world obsessed with staying powered, the real charge comes from knowing we’re all trying to connect, in more ways than one.
