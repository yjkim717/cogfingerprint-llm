**The Pre-Record Panic – Seriously?**

Okay, so I just survived a university interview at Coventry, and honestly, I’m still processing. It’s 2024, and the whole thing felt…weird. There’s this constant back-and-forth online about whether pre-recorded interviews are ‘cheating’ or not. My interviewer hinted at wanting a natural response, then later seemed concerned about my preparation. 

It’s exhausting! I spent ages crafting answers, feeling like I was acting, and then being judged for it.  It’s not about tricking anyone, just adapting to the format.  Anyone else feeling this social media-fueled anxiety about how we’re *supposed* to present ourselves? #universitylife #interviewstress #redditvibes

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
