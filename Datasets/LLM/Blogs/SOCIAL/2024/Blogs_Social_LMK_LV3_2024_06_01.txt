As I gazed at my shattered windshield in 2024, I realized the harsh reality of driving. A hit-and-run incident left me shaken, but my dashcam footage proved to be a lifesaver. The experience was a wake-up call, highlighting the importance of road safety and the role of dashcams in preventing vandalism and insurance disputes. My driving experience has since become more cautious, and I've encouraged others to install dashcams, too. It's a simple step towards a safer driving experience and peace of mind on the road.
