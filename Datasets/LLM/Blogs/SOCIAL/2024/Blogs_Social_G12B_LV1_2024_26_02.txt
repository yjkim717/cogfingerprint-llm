## Tiny Dancer, Big Worries

Bringing home a new dog is always a leap of faith, isn't it? We adopted a little chihuahua, Pip, last month, and I'm already wrestling with a classic introduction challenge. Our resident dog, Winston, is a schnauzer – a sweetie, mostly – but with a *very* noticeable prey drive. 

It’s 2024, and we’re all so much more aware of canine behavior, but still, seeing that instinct flare up when Pip zips around is a little nerve-wracking. Slow introductions, supervised playtime, a *lot* of positive reinforcement… it’s a work in progress. Hoping for a harmonious household, and lots of shared naps soon! Any tips from fellow multi-dog families are welcome! #dogadoption #chihuahua #schnauzer #preydrive
