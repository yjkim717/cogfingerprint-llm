**The Weight of a "Schufa"**

Okay, let’s be real – starting university is supposed to be exciting, right? New city, new friends, endless possibilities. But for a lot of international students, it starts with a seriously stressful hurdle: finding a place to live. 

I was chatting with a friend, Liam, who just arrived at Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf. He's brilliant, a total go-getter, and utterly bewildered by the German rental system. Apparently, landlords are *demanding* a "Schufa" report – basically, a credit history – and often have age limits. It’s not about fairness, it's about perceived risk. 

It really struck me how much we rely on these seemingly small bureaucratic steps to exclude people. Liam's feeling isolated and frustrated, stuck searching through “wg-gesucht” (roommate wanted) ads, desperately hoping to find a place that doesn’t penalize him for being a young, international student. 

It’s a harsh reminder that navigating a new country isn't just about academics; it’s about overcoming these invisible barriers.  Anyone else out there facing similar challenges? Let’s talk about it. #internationalstudent #germanlife #universitystruggles
