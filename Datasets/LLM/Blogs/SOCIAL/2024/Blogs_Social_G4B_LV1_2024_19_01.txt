**The Unexpected Rumble: When Social Feels…Wrong**

Okay, so I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about social media, and honestly, it’s been a bit of a weird vibe. I used to just scroll, right? Like most of us. But recently, it’s felt… intense. Like a low-level rumble you can’t quite place. 

It started with a friend posting this picture of their ‘perfect’ vacation – turquoise water, impossibly sunny smiles, the whole nine yards. And I felt this weird little pang of… dissatisfaction? It wasn’t jealousy, exactly, more like a feeling that something was *off*. It reminded me a little of that awful pain I felt during my wisdom tooth extraction last year. You know, that sharp, unsettling pain that made you question everything? 

I realized I was comparing my messy, real life to someone else’s carefully curated highlight reel. And it wasn’t making me feel good. 

It’s the same with political debates – everyone’s shouting, no one’s listening, and it just feels…painful.  I’ve started taking breaks, honestly. Unfollowing accounts that trigger that ‘rumble’ feeling. It’s not about deleting everything, it’s about being more intentional. 

I think we’re all craving authenticity in 2024, a little less performance and a little more genuine connection. Maybe I need to start posting *my* messy moments, instead of striving for a flawless online persona.  Who’s with me?
