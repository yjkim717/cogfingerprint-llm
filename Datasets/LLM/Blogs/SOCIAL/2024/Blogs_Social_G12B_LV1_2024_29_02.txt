## The Silence Feels Louder Now

It’s a tough thing to admit, but I had to pause something really important to my journey recently. For those who’ve been following along, you know I’ve been working with a voice therapist for a while now, exploring vocal transition as part of my MTF journey. It’s been… transformative, honestly. Hearing my voice shift, even subtly, has been incredibly affirming.

Then life threw a curveball. A house fire, thankfully no one was hurt, but the aftermath has been a whirlwind of insurance claims and rebuilding. Suddenly, medical bills piled up, and the financial stress became overwhelming. It broke my heart, but I had to make the difficult decision to put voice therapy on hold.

The silence feels louder now. It's a reminder of what I've lost, and a worry about when – or if – I can resume. But I’m trying to focus on the immediate, on rebuilding, and trusting that this pause isn’t a full stop.  It’s just… a really long breath. Hoping for brighter days ahead.
