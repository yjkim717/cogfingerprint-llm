The hum of the refrigerator. The neighbor’s distant lawnmower. In 2024, my home should be a sanctuary, but with burnout amplifying my misophonia, every sound feels like an assault. I finally took PTO, dreaming of quiet recovery, only to find myself more trapped by the noise than by any deadline. Instead of recharging, I’m just counting down the hours until work resumes. It’s a cruel irony—needing silence to heal, but being unable to escape the very noise that exhausts you.
