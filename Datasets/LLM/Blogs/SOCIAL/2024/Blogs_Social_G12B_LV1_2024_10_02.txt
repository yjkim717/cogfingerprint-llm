>## Concrete and Memories: Hanoi's Green Heart

It’s striking, isn't it, how quickly a city can change? I was in Hanoi last month, and while the energy was vibrant, I couldn’t shake a feeling of…loss. The old photos I’d seen, bursting with lush foliage, felt distant from the increasingly concrete landscape. They say replanting takes decades, a slow, patient dance against the relentless tide of development. It makes you wonder: what are we sacrificing in the name of progress, and can we truly reclaim what we’ve lost? It’s a thought that’s stuck with me.
