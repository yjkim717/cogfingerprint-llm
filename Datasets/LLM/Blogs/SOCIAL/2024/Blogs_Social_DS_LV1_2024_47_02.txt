It’s funny how a single game can feel like a home you keep coming back to. For me, that’s *Horizon Zero Dawn*. I’ve wandered its vibrant, post-apocalyptic wilds more times than I can count—first on my trusty PS4, then diving deeper into *The Frozen Wilds* on a PS4 Pro. Aloy’s journey became a part of my own.

Now, with *Horizon Forbidden West* finally here, I’m caught in a familiar modern dilemma. Do I dive in now on my current console, or do I wait for the elusive PS5 upgrade to experience it in its full, untamed glory? It’s less about the graphics and more about the feeling. I want my first time in the Forbidden West to be the definitive one.

In a way, this feels like a small reflection of our times. We’re so often torn between instant gratification and the promise of a richer, future experience. It’s a tiny, first-world problem, for sure, but it makes me pause and consider how often we make these calculations in life, waiting for the "better version" instead of just enjoying the moment we’re in.
