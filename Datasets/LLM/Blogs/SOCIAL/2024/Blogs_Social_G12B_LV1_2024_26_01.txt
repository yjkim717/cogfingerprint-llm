>## The Weight of Likes & the Weight of My Photos

Okay, real talk. I've been trying to build a presence on Insta this year, you know, the usual – pretty pictures, curated aesthetic, the whole shebang. But I’m a hobbyist photographer, not a pro, and my passion is capturing *moments*, not necessarily perfectly polished content. 

The problem? My phone's storage was screaming at me. Each photo, especially with decent resolution, was eating up space like crazy. I was sacrificing quality to fit everything in, and honestly, it felt wrong. 

Then it hit me – why am I chasing this constant need for *massive* image files just to get a few extra likes? It’s a digital weight, both on my phone and on my mind. I've started experimenting with compressing my images, and the difference in storage is huge! I'm still learning, but it’s a reminder to focus on the joy of capturing, not just the perceived value of a high-res post.
