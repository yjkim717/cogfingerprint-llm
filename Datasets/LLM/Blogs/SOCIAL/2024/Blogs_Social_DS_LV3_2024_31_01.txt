The chill in the air tonight feels different, sharper. It’s not just the cold of a 2024 winter; it’s the icy grip of worry. My friend’s cat, Taro—a sweet, fluffy indoor soul who’s never known a world beyond warm radiators and soft blankets—has somehow slipped outside.

I can’t stop thinking about him. Taro isn’t just a pet; he’s family. I remember how he’d curl up on my lap during visits, purring like a tiny engine, completely unaware of the harsh world beyond the window. Now, that world is his reality. Every gust of wind, every rustle in the bushes, makes my heart clench. Is he scared? Is he hiding somewhere, confused and freezing?

In moments like these, you realize how fragile our little bubbles of comfort are. We build safe, cozy lives for those we love, and in an instant, it can all vanish. My phone is glued to my hand, hoping for a text, a call, any sign that he’s okay.

Please, if you’re out there, Taro, find your way home. We’re waiting, hoping, and leaving a light on for you.
