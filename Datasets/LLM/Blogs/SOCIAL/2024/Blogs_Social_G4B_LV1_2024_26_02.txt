**Tiny Terror, Big Heart: My Social Media Dilemma**

Okay, so I’m seriously contemplating adopting a little chihuahua – they’re just *adorable*, right? But my schnauzer, Gus, is a total sweetheart… with a *serious* prey drive.  I’ve been scrolling through all the dog adoption groups on Social, reading about introductions and managing that instinct. It’s honestly overwhelming!  Trying to balance the cute factor with responsible pet ownership feels like a whole new level of social media pressure.  Anyone else navigating this? #dogadoption #preydrive #chihuahua #schnauzer #petparenting 2024 🐾 📱
