The sun used to be my friend, but these days, it feels like a harsh critic. Since my cataract diagnosis, natural light indoors has become a source of frustration—a blinding glare that washes everything out. My world has shrunk to the gentle embrace of artificial, warm light from my lamps.

It’s a quiet rebellion against the cold, unforgiving daylight. I’ve found a new appreciation for cozy evenings and the soft glow that lets me see clearly without squinting. It’s a small, personal sanctuary, a reminder that sometimes comfort is found not in the brightest places, but in the warmest ones.
