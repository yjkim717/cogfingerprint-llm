## That Blind Spot in Life (and Parking Lots!)

You know those moments where you just *feel* a little unsettled? I had one the other day pulling out of a parking lot. Seriously overgrown bushes were completely blocking my view of oncoming traffic. Maneuvering out in my little car felt… precarious.

It got me thinking. We all have those "blind spots" in life, don’t we? Areas where we can’t quite see clearly, where potential challenges are lurking just out of sight. Maybe it’s a relationship we’re ignoring, a career path we’re hesitant to explore, or a personal habit we know isn't serving us. 

Sometimes, all it takes is a near-miss in a parking lot to remind us to slow down, check our surroundings, and make sure we have a clear view of the road ahead. What are your current "blind spots," and how are you navigating them?



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
