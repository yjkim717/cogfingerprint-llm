## Those Blind Spots in Life (and Parking Lots)

It’s funny how everyday frustrations can spark bigger thoughts. I was wrestling with a particularly tricky parking lot exit yesterday – seriously, those bushes bordering the entrance have completely exploded! – and it got me thinking about how often we're navigating life with limited visibility.

Being in my little hatchback definitely didn’t help; I felt like a tiny ship trying to merge into a roaring ocean of oncoming traffic. It made me realize how much we rely on being able to *see* what’s ahead, both literally and figuratively. Are we all carefully trimming back the “bushes” in our own lives – the assumptions, the biases, the things that block our perspective? Or are we blindly pulling out, hoping for the best? It's a good reminder to pause, assess, and maybe, just maybe, do a little pruning now and then.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
