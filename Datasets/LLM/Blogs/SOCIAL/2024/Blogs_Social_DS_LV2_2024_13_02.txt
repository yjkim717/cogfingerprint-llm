Two weeks until my father-in-law’s wedding, and I’m hunting for a sky-blue, knee-length dress with a discreet zipper near the bust. It’s not just about looking good anymore; it’s about balancing motherhood with life’s big moments. In 2024, we’re still navigating how to stay "us" while caring for little ones. Here’s to celebrating love, one practical yet pretty outfit at a time. Any other mamas relate?
