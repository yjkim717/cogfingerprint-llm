## The Weight of What Might Be

It's hard to shake the feeling of…uncertainty, isn’t it? Everywhere you look, the 2024 election is dominating conversations. I find myself scrolling through social media, seeing the familiar divides – the fervent support for one candidate, the equally passionate opposition to another. It’s exhausting. 

Honestly, watching Biden navigate these past few years has been…a lot. And the fractures within the Democratic party feel wider than ever. Then, you see Trump’s rallies, the energy, the unwavering devotion. It makes you pause and wonder: are we truly seeing a predictable path here?  It’s a question that rattles around in my head, a quiet worry amidst all the noise.
