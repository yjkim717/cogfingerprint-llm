**The Weight of a Pint**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily a night out can start to feel…heavy? I was scrolling Reddit the other day and stumbled across a post from someone wrestling with a similar feeling – a creeping fear about their drinking, fueled by a family history and a constant pressure to “just have a few.” 

Honestly, I get it. The ‘social drinking’ thing feels like a tightrope walk sometimes.  Do you really want to keep chasing a feeling just to fit in?  It’s time to seriously consider cutting back, before it becomes something more.
