### The Fine Print on Your Soul: My Chaotic Year as a 'Company Man'

So, 2024. The year I decided to get a patron.

Not a business mentor or a life coach, mind you. I’m talking about the kind of patron you find in the shadowy corners of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. My character, a warlock, made a pact with Anthraxus, an entity from the muck and mire who deals in souls. The deal was simple: I provide the occasional "soul sacrifice" (don't ask), and in return, I get power. Easy, right?

It wasn't. The first time my character had to strong-arm a local cult into compliance, I realized something. I wasn't just playing a chaotic neutral free agent; I was a middle-manager for a cosmic corporation. My "soul sacrifices" were quarterly quotas. My "diplomatic missions" were just me, a lone agent, trying to smooth things over after the home office (Anthraxus) had made a mess of things with its cryptic, self-contradicting demands.

And honestly? It started to feel a little too familiar.

We all have our Anthraxus, don't we? That demanding, often faceless entity we serve—a company, an algorithm, a grind-culture mindset—that promises us power (a paycheck, clout, status) in exchange for little pieces of our soul. We sacrifice our time, our peace, our creativity, and we tell ourselves it's a fair trade. We navigate the office politics, the confusing corporate directives, and the pressure to meet targets, all while trying to maintain some semblance of our own moral compass.

Playing this warlock became a weirdly reflective experience. It made me question what I’m truly sacrificing in my own life for the power I’m told I need. Am I building my own legacy, or just fulfilling someone else’s inscrutable, soul-bound contract? This year, I’m going to read the fine print a little more carefully—both in my D&D game and in my real life. Because no amount of cosmic power is worth losing what makes you, you.
