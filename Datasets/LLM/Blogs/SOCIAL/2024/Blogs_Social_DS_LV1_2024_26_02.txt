Bringing home our new Chihuahua puppy last week, I couldn’t shake the worry about how our Schnauzer would react—his prey drive is no joke. But instead of lunging, he tilted his head, sniffed gently, and now they nap curled together. It’s a sweet reminder that with patience and proper introductions, even our most ingrained instincts can give way to connection. Sometimes, the heart outruns instinct.
