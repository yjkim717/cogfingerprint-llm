It’s funny—in 2024, with so much focus on digital creators, I keep thinking about Rooster Teeth’s early days. Burnie was like our Washington, steady and visionary, while Geoff’s bold, creative energy felt Jeffersonian. They weren’t just building a company; they were shaping a community. It reminds me how modern founders, like those early American leaders, can inspire movements just by staying true to their voice.
