The Twitter we once knew is gone. As I scroll through my feed in 2024, I'm met with a deluge of low-effort posts and a disturbing surge in extremist rhetoric. Elon Musk's takeover has, in my opinion, accelerated the platform's decay. The alt-right, once relegated to the fringes, now feels emboldened to spew their toxic ideology to a wider audience. The "Dead Internet Theory" - a notion that the web is dominated by bots and artificial interactions - feels uncomfortably prophetic. It's as if the platform has become a breeding ground for manufactured outrage and echo chambers. I've watched as nuanced discussions devolve into shouting matches, and thoughtful voices are drowned out by the cacophony of clickbait and hate. Twitter's decline is a cautionary tale for social media as a whole: when profit is prioritized over people, the consequences can be dire.
