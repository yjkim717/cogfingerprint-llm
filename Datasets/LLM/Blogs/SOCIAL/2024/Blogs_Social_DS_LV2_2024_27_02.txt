### The Ghost in the Machine

It’s 2024, and my love life feels like a glitchy app stuck on a loop. Swipe, match, chat, meet, connect… ghost. The silence after what felt like a genuine connection is a special kind of modern heartbreak.

I’m not just looking for a date for Saturday night; I’m trying to find my person to build a life with. I show up, I’m present, I listen. I thought being a good guy was the key. But the pattern is exhausting. It leaves you wondering if you’re the problem, or if everyone is just too afraid to be real.

I’m holding onto hope that the right connection is still out there—one where the conversation doesn’t just fade to black, but builds a future, together. I’m done just filling a slot in someone’s roster. I’m ready for the main event.
