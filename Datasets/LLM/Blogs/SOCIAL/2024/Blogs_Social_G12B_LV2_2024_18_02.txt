## The Frustration of Almost-Perfect Prints

Ugh, 3D printing, right? I’m battling a weird one this week. My wall art keeps needing supports, even with a brand new nozzle! Calibration cubes are *perfect*, though. It’s those little victories mixed with the head-scratching failures that really sum up this hobby, doesn’t it? Anyone else feel this 2024 struggle?



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
