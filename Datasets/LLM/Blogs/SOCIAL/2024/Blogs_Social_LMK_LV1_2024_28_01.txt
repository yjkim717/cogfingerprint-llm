As I navigated the Amazon Flex app in 2024, I faced a tough decision. My dad's health was declining, and I needed time off to care for him. I worried about dipping below the hour cap and potential penalties. But family comes first. I took a step back, prioritizing my loved one over Flex driving. I hope Amazon FC understands the importance of family care and adjusts its policies to support drivers during difficult times.
