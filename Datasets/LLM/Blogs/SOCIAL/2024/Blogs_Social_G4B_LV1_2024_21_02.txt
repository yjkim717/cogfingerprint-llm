**Lost in the Algorithm, Found in the Park**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How we curate our online lives, trying to project this perfect image. Lately, I’ve been craving something *real*. That’s why I started spending more time at the park downtown – a true third place. Just a bench, some sunshine, and people chatting casually. No pressure, no need to impress. 

It’s a refreshing change from the constant scroll and the unspoken competition for likes. Sometimes, just being present with others, without a status update hanging over our heads, feels…good.
