The Twitter I once knew is gone. As I scroll through my feed in 2024, I'm met with a sea of noise - low-quality content, blatant spam, and bots masquerading as real people. Elon Musk's takeover has left a void, and it's not just me who's noticed. The online community is reeling. The platform that was once a hub for meaningful discussions and connections has devolved into chaos. The dead internet theory is starting to feel uncomfortably prophetic - is this what the future of social media looks like? As I reflect on the changes, I'm reminded of the fragility of online communities. Twitter's decline is a wake-up call: when we prioritize growth over genuine interaction, we risk losing the very essence of what made a platform worth visiting in the first place. It's time to reevaluate what we want from social media - and demand better.
