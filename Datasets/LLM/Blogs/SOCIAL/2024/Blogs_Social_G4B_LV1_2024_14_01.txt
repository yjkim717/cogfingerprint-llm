**Sydney Gridlock – More Than Just a Commute**

Ugh, seriously, this morning’s M2 and M7 chaos was brutal. I was stuck in a massive traffic jam heading into the city – a classic Sydney morning commute, right? But it got me thinking. It’s not *just* about being late for work. It’s about feeling completely disconnected, trapped in this metal box, and losing precious time. Makes you appreciate those little moments of connection when you finally arrive, doesn’t it? #SydneyTraffic #CommuteLife #SocialReflection 2024
