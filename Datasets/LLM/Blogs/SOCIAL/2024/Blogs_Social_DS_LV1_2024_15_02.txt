Itâ€™s funny how a tiny detail can connect us. In 2024, I was sorting through old coins from my grandfather, hoping to find a 1995 nickel without a mint mark to complete a set. I ended up posting online, and the response was incredible. Seasoned collectors, history buffs, and newbies all chimed in, sharing stories and knowledge. It wasn't just about the coin anymore; it was about the shared curiosity and the human connections forged over a small piece of metal. Sometimes, the real treasure isn't what you find, but who you find it with.
