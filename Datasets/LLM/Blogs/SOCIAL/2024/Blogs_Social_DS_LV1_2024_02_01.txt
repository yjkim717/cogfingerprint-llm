### The Unseen Hurdle: My Hunt for a German Home

They tell you to pack your bags, get your visa, and embrace the adventure. No one tells you about the Schufa.

As an international student in my thirties, I arrived in Germany in 2024 full of optimism. I’d pictured a cozy *WG* (flatshare), filled with the chatter of new friends. Reality, I quickly learned, is a relentless scroll through WG-Gesucht.

My age seemed to be an immediate red flag in a market dominated by 20-year-olds. But the bigger wall was the Schufa report—a credit history I, as a newcomer, simply didn’t have. Every promising lead ended with the same polite rejection: “Sorry, we need someone with a Schufa.” My budget for a room shrank while my frustration grew.
