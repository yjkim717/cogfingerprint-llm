It’s funny how a single image can stick with you for years. For me, it was the black-and-white photo of two dogs on the cover of a short story collection I read back in college. I can’t even recall the title now, but that book—an American work of contemporary literature—left a mark.

In 2024, we’re drowning in digital content, yet it’s these tangible, quiet artifacts that often shape us. Those stories explored connection and loneliness in ways that feel even more relevant today. I think about how we seek meaning now: through screens, fleeting trends. But real resonance? For me, it’s still in the weight of a book, the texture of a photograph, and the stories that patiently wait to be rediscovered.
