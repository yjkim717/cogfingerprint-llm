It’s 2024, and adopting our little Chihuahua, Luna, felt like a leap of faith. Our Schnauzer, Max, has such a strong prey drive; I was nervous about their first meeting. But watching them slowly sniff and circle each other, tails cautiously wagging, I realized that patience and positive introductions can build bridges, even between the unlikeliest of friends. It’s a lesson in trust we all need sometimes.
