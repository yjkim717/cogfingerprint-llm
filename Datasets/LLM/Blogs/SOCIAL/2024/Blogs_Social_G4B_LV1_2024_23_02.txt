**The Unexpected Pull**

Okay, let’s be real – I’ve been noticing something lately, and it's making me think a *lot* about attraction and how we all perceive it. It's about these seemingly straight guys – you know the type – who are intensely drawn to transmasculine folks who, let’s just say, aren’t always rocking the ‘typical’ feminine look. 

It's fascinating, right? I’ve seen it happen more and more, and I think it’s less about a rigid definition of “man” and more about a genuine appreciation for someone who's owning their gender expression. Maybe it’s the vulnerability of navigating transition, or the boldness of rejecting expectations – whatever the reason, it’s powerful. 

I’ve even found myself questioning my own attraction sometimes, realizing that connection isn’t always about surface-level aesthetics. It’s about the *feeling*, the energy, and the way someone truly embodies themselves.  Fluid attraction is real, and it’s beautiful when we allow ourselves to see it. What are your thoughts?
