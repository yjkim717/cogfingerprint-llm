As I stroll through Hanoi's bustling streets in 2024, I'm reminded of the city's dwindling greenery. The once-lush trees that lined the capital's roads are vanishing, leaving behind a concrete jungle. I'm concerned that the loss of these urban trees will have long-lasting environmental consequences. It's a pressing issue that requires thoughtful urban planning to preserve the beauty and health of our capital cities.
