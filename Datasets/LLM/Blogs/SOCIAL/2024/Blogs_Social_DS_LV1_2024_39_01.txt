It’s funny how much my little plant cabinet taught me about balance this year. I set up an Inkbird controller and fans to keep the humidity just right, but at first, it was either too dry or too damp. It reminded me of my own life—always chasing extremes, overworking or burning out. Now, when I hear those fans gently whir to life, it’s a small reminder that consistency, not perfection, keeps things thriving. Sometimes, the most meaningful growth happens in the steady, quiet moments.
