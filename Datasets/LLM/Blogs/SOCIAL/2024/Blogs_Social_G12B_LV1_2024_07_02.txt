## The Anticipation is Real (and Vinyl-Scented!)

Okay, so I’m officially a puddle of excited right now. Remember how I was talking about getting back into vinyl? Well, it’s paying off! Just got a preorder LP in the mail from Garden Home, a band out of Wisconsin I’ve been obsessing over. It’s this raw, emotional post-hardcore/screamo sound that just *hits*. 

It’s a small victory in a sea of doomscrolling, honestly. Knowing this physical piece of art, this tangible connection to music I love, is on its way… it's a really nice feeling. Apparently, November’s going to be a big month for vinyl releases – five in total! Bring on the crates!



Hope you enjoyed it! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
