## The Unexpected Gift of a Two-Hour Delay

Okay, 2024 life, you're testing me! Today's commute was… memorable. The M2/M7 near Rouse Hill decided to throw a *major* traffic tantrum, and I ended up two hours late. Two hours! Honestly, I was stressing, picturing the mountain of work piling up.

But then, something shifted. My boss, bless her heart, suggested I just work from home. And suddenly, that delay felt… less awful. I’m sipping tea, my dog's snoring softly, and I’m actually getting things done. Sometimes, the universe throws roadblocks (literal ones, apparently!) to nudge you towards a better way. Who knew a traffic jam could be an unexpected gift?
