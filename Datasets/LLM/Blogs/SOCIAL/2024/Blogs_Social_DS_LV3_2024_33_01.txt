There I was, tucked between two SUVs in my compact car, trying to edge out of the grocery store lot. But those overgrown bushes at the exit completely blocked my view of oncoming traffic. My heart raced each time I inched forward blindly, relying on hope rather than visibility. It’s 2024—shouldn’t our shared spaces prioritize safety over aesthetics? That moment of vulnerability reminded me how much we depend on thoughtful design to foster trust and connection in our everyday interactions.
