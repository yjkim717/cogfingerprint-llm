It’s 2024, and I’ve realized my favorite part of the week isn’t a Zoom call or my couch—it’s the corner booth at the local cafe. That’s my “third place.” It’s where I bump into neighbors, share a laugh with the barista, and have those spontaneous chats you just can’t schedule. In our increasingly digital world, these public spaces feel more vital than ever. They’re where we truly connect, reminding us that community is built in the in-between moments.
