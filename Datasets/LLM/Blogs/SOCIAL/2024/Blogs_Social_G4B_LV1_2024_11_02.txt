**A Little Push, A Lot of Hope**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How quickly life can shift. Just a few months ago, I was scrolling through Instagram, mindlessly liking vacation photos and food pics. Now, I’m staring down a diagnosis – stage 3 melanoma – and completely rethinking what matters. 

Honestly, it’s terrifying. But it’s also ignited something fierce within me. I’ve started a small fundraising campaign for AIM at Melanoma, a brilliant non-profit dedicated to research and education. Seeing the support roll in, even just a few dollars at a time, feels incredible. 

Social media, which used to feel so distant, is now a tool to connect with others, share information, and, most importantly, push for better diagnoses and a future free from this disease. It’s a little push, but I believe it can make a huge difference.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps write a post with a slightly different focus?
