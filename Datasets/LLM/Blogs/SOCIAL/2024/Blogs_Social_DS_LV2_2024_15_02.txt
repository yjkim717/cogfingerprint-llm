It’s funny how a simple coin can connect you to people you’ve never met. Just the other day, I was sorting through a handful of old nickels, my 1995 collection spread across the kitchen table. I’ve been hunting for those elusive D and P mint marks, and honestly, it’s been a grind.

But then I got a message from a fellow collector across the country, sharing a tip and a bit of encouragement. In 2024, when so much feels digital and distant, there’s something deeply human about this shared, tangible pursuit. It’s not just about the coins—it’s about the stories and the small, unexpected connections we make along the way.
