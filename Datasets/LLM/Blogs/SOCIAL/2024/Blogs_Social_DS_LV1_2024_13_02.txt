With my father-in-law’s wedding just two weeks away, I’m on a mission to find the perfect dress—one that’s nursing-friendly but doesn’t scream “maternity.” I need a knee-length style, no cinches, and a zipper placed thoughtfully away from my chest for easy access. It’s funny how priorities shift: before motherhood, I’d have focused on the sparkle; now, it’s all about blending practicality with elegance. In 2024, it feels like we’re redefining what it means to dress for life’s big moments, balancing our roles without losing ourselves.
