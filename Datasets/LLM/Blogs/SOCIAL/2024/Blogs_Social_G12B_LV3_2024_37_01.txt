## Who Will Tell Our Story? (And Why It Made Me Think of the American Revolution)

Something popped up on Reddit the other day that really stuck with me. Someone was pondering who’s going to document the history of Rooster Teeth – all the ups, downs, and hilarious moments. It’s a surprisingly weighty question for a company built on so much laughter! 

It immediately reminded me of a scene from *John Adams* where they're debating who will write the definitive account of the Revolution. Seriously! I started thinking about Burnie and Geoff, the core of Rooster Teeth, and it felt… fitting to imagine Burnie as Washington - the steady leader, setting the course. And Geoff? Definitely Jefferson, the brilliant, sometimes chaotic, voice of creativity. 

It got me thinking about all the online communities we build and the stories we create within them. Who *will* remember the details? It’s a fun, slightly melancholic thought, isn’t it?
