It’s funny how the smallest changes can reshape your daily life. For months, my thigh was my go-to for estrogen injections—a ritual marked by soreness and hesitation. Then, on a whim, I tried my deltoid. What a difference! It’s quicker, gentler, and far less daunting. In 2024, we’re all seeking ease in our self-care routines, and this tiny switch felt like a quiet rebellion against needless discomfort. Sometimes progress isn’t about big leaps, but finding the simpler, kinder path for ourselves.
