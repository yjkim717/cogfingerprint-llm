## The Unexpected Freedom of Offline Connection

Remember when reliable Wi-Fi felt like a given? Now, in 2024, I’m realizing how much I crave that *alternative*. Lately, I've been experimenting with using my phone's data – yes, that unlimited plan – on my laptop when I'm out and about. It’s surprisingly liberating! No more hunting for cafes or relying on spotty public networks. Just a simple connection, letting me work (or scroll!) wherever I am. It’s a small thing, but it feels like a little pocket of freedom.
