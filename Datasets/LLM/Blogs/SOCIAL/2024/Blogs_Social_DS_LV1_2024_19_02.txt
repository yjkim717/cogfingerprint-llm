**The Unseen Pressure of the Recorded Interview**

It’s 2024, and the digital interview is the new normal. I just went through one for a university application, and let me tell you, it’s a uniquely stressful social performance.

I prepared for days, practicing my answers until they were polished but still genuine. Yet, the moment I hit record, everything felt artificial. I was hyper-aware of the camera lens, trying to maintain "eye contact" with a piece of glass. When a technical glitch caused me to pause and restart, I could feel my delivery become stiff.

Now, I’m left wondering if my passion will be misinterpreted as reading prepared responses. It’s a strange new social hurdle—trying to be your authentic self for a system that can sometimes feel designed to catch you out. The pressure isn't just to be good; it's to look naturally good on camera.
