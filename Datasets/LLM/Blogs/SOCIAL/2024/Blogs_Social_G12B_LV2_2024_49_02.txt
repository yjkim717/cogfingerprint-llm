## The Echoes of Glimmering Stone: Choices and Consequences in BG3

Okay, so I'm on my third run of Baldur's Gate 3, and wow. This time, I really dove deep into Grymforge, wrestling with Nere and the Drow. It's fascinating how a seemingly small decision – siding with one faction over another – can ripple outwards, affecting so much later on. It’s a stark reminder that even in a fantasy world, our choices have weight, and sometimes, the 'right' answer isn’t so clear. Anyone else feel that intensely with BG3?
