**The Diploma Dilemma (and Maybe a Tech Role?)**

Okay, real talk. 2024 feels…weird. I just finished my engineering degree, and honestly, the job hunt is brutal. I’ve sent out dozens of applications, tailored my resume until it’s practically unrecognizable, and still, crickets. It's leaving me feeling pretty deflated. 

There’s this nagging voice telling me I should just push for those “ideal” engineering positions. But then I saw a posting for a medical device technician internship – and a tiny part of me is considering it.  It’s not what I envisioned, definitely not the path I mapped out, but it’s a foot in the door, a chance to actually *do* something with my skills. 

Maybe a little detour isn’t the end of the world. Anyone else feeling the pressure to “have it all figured out”?  Let’s commiserate! #jobsearch #engineering #careerchange #2024
