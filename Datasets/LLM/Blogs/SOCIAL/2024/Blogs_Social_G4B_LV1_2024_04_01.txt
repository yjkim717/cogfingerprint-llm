**Sunlight? Seriously?**

Okay, Reddit, I need to vent. I’m pretty sure I’m just…different when it comes to light. I absolutely *hate* natural light. It’s not even about being a morning person – it’s the glare, the way it feels so cold, and honestly, just the overwhelming brightness. 

I’ve been researching this a bit, and it feels like a really strange thing to admit. I’m considering getting some intraocular implants to help manage it, maybe even explore artificial light solutions for my home. It feels a little isolating, but also… validating?  Anyone else experience something similar?  Let’s talk about how we navigate this weird, bright world. #sensoryissues #lightsensitivity #reddittherapy

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps generate a post with a different focus (e.g., exploring the science behind light sensitivity)?
