## Drowning in Photos (and Storage Space!)

Okay, fellow creatives, let’s be honest: our phones are bursting at the seams! As a budding photographer in 2024, I've been wrestling with the same dilemma. I *love* capturing moments, but those high-resolution images eat up storage like crazy. 

It got me thinking – is it better to resize, or just dial down the resolution from the get-go? I'm on a budget, and I definitely don’t want to sacrifice image quality, but I also need to be able to share my work on social media without my phone staging a full-blown rebellion. What are your go-to strategies for balancing beautiful photography and manageable file sizes? Let's chat in the comments!
