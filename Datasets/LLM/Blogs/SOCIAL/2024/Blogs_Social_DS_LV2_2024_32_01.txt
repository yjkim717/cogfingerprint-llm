It’s 2024, and I’m still learning that sometimes the most well-meaning advice comes from a place of love—even when it doesn’t quite hold water.

My stepdad insisted on rationing our pets’ water to prevent accidents, despite our dog trainer’s advice to keep bowls full and accessible. Watching our pup nudge an empty dish, I felt that familiar tension between respecting family and trusting expertise.

But here’s the thing: it’s not just about hydration. It’s about listening—to our pets, to professionals, and to each other. We found a middle ground, adding extra bowls and scheduled walks, and the accidents faded. It reminded me that in a world full of strong opinions, connection often flows from compassion, not control.
