"Finding Comfort in Hormone Therapy: My Injection Journey". As I continue my hormone therapy journey in 2024, I've discovered that deltoid injections for estrogen are a game-changer for me.

I'm sharing my experience to help others who may be struggling with injection anxiety or discomfort, hoping that my story can provide a sense of comfort and reassurance as they navigate their own paths.
