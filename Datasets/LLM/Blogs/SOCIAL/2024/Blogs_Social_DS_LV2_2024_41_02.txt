It’s 2024, and I thought I had life figured out—until my Samsonite bag’s "easy pass" USB system let me down mid-flight. There I was, power bank ready, cable plugged in, expecting my laptop to hum back to life. Nothing. Just that dreaded low-battery icon blinking back at me.

It hit me then: we’re so wired for convenience, for seamless solutions, that a single hiccup feels like betrayal. We expect tech to bridge every gap, to keep us effortlessly connected. But maybe there’s something grounding about these small failures—a reminder to slow down, look up, and appreciate the unplugged moments.

Still, if anyone’s cracked the code on laptop charging via built-in USB, my inbox is open. Some modern problems really do need modern solutions.
