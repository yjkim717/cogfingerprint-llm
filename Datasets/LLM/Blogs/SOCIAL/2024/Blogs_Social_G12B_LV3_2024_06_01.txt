## That Sinking Feeling (and Why I Got a Dash Cam)

Okay, let's be real – driving in 2024 can be stressful. Lately, I've been noticing more road rage, more aggressive driving… and then it happened to me. A rock kicked up by another car chipped my windshield pretty badly. Suddenly, I was staring at an unexpected expense and a whole lot of frustration. 

It was a stark reminder that we’re not always in control. That's when I finally bit the bullet and got a dash cam. It's not about distrusting everyone on the road, but about protecting myself. Peace of mind is worth it, right? Plus, knowing I have a record feels surprisingly empowering. Anyone else feel the same way?
