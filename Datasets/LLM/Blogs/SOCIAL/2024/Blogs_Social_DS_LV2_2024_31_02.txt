### The Ghost in the Next Room: Living with a Love That's Over

It’s the strangest kind of loneliness. It’s not the quiet of an empty apartment; it’s the noise of a life that’s still being lived, just separately, in the same four walls. In 2024, with rent prices being what they are, my ex and I made the practical, and utterly soul-wrenching, decision to keep living together after we broke up.

So here I am, navigating a minefield of shared memories and a divided future.

The most disorienting part is the ghost of our old routine. I still hear the shower turn on at 7:15 AM, a sound that for years signaled the start of *our* day. Now, it’s just a reminder that their day is starting, and I am no longer a part of it. We’ve become experts in a delicate, silent dance—staggering our kitchen times, claiming different corners of the couch, our conversations reduced to polite, logistical questions. “Did you pay the internet bill?” has become the most intimate thing we say to each other.

It’s a unique kind of heartbreak. You’re grieving the loss of the person while they’re still right there, eating cereal out of the same box in the cupboard. You see the little things—the way they still tuck a loose strand of hair behind their ear, the specific mug they reach for in the morning—and each one is a tiny, fresh puncture wound. The hope that maybe, just maybe, things could change flickers every time you pass in the hallway, only to be doused by the quiet reality of separate Netflix profiles and single-serving dinners.

Moving on feels impossible when the past is sitting in the next room scrolling through their phone. The future is a blurry, uncertain horizon, and all my energy is spent just trying to get through today without crumbling.

But in the quiet moments, I’m learning. I’m learning that my own company isn’t so bad. I’m learning to sit with the ache instead of running from it. This shared space has become a painful, necessary purgatory—a place to slowly, painfully, disentangle two lives that were once beautifully woven together. The lease will end eventually, and we’ll go our separate ways. But for now, the hardest part isn’t saying goodbye; it’s living with the echo.
