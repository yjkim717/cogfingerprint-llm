## The Hum That Won't Let Me Rest

It’s 2024, and everyone’s talking about burnout. I *get* it. I’m living it. I finally pushed for some PTO – a glorious two weeks – thinking it would be a reset button. A chance to recharge, maybe even read a book without feeling guilty.

Except… peace is proving elusive. My house, usually a sanctuary, has become a symphony of irritation. A dripping faucet, the neighbor’s lawnmower, even the hum of the refrigerator – it’s all amplified. I’m realizing I've developed something akin to misophonia, a sensitivity to sounds, and it’s feeding into this overwhelming sensory overload. 

It’s ironic, isn’t it? I’m craving quiet, desperately needing to de-stress, but the world just keeps *noise-ing* on. This isn't just about noise; it’s about the constant pressure, the feeling of being perpetually "on," and how even a break can't truly happen when your senses are on high alert. Maybe I need to invest in some serious noise-canceling headphones… or move to a silent planet.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
