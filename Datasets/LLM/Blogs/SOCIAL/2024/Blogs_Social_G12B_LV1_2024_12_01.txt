## The Echo Chamber and the Diminishing Returns of Hype

Remember the absolute *explosion* of excitement around *Stranger Things*? Like, 2019 was a fever dream of Hellfire Club tees and synthwave soundtracks. I was totally caught up in it, rewatching the first season with everyone else and feeling that shared, nostalgic joy. But lately, I've been thinking a lot about the way hype can warp our perception of something.

It’s not just *Stranger Things*, either. We see it everywhere. A new movie, a new album, a new tech gadget… the marketing machine churns, creating this immense expectation, and then… the reality often doesn't quite measure up.

I think social media amplifies this effect. The constant stream of praise and anticipation creates an echo chamber, making it harder to admit when something isn't *actually* great. We’re afraid of looking like we're 'out of touch' or missing the boat. 

Maybe it’s time to be a little more discerning, a little less swayed by the collective roar. Let’s try to enjoy things for what they *are*, not what we’ve been told they *should* be. Anyone else feeling this?
