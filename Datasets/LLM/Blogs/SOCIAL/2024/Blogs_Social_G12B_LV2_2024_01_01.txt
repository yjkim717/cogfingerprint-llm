## Is This *Really* the Dream?

Seriously, has anyone else noticed how the "dream build" keeps shifting? Like, I was looking at a new 4090 the other day, and suddenly the *entire* PC – Ryzen 9, X670 board, the works – could have been built for roughly the same price. It’s wild! Makes you wonder what we’re chasing, doesn't it? Maybe the dream isn’t about peak specs, but about… enjoying the game? Thoughts? #pcmasterrace
