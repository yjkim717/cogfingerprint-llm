As I dive into writing my Universal Monsters spin-off novel, I'm grappling with a creative conundrum. I'm drawn to the Dark Fantasy elements that are seeping into my narrative, but I'm worried it might stray too far from the Horror roots of iconic characters like Dracula and Frankenstein. Can I find a balance between the eerie atmosphere of Horror and the rich world-building of Dark Fantasy? I'm embracing the uncertainty, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me in 2024.
