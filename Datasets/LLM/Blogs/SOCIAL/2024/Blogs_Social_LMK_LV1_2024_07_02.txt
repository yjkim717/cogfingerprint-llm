"As I scrolled through my social media feed today, I stumbled upon a preorder alert for Garden Home's highly-anticipated self-titled LP on Kerosene Heights. I'm beyond stoked! Having dived into the post-hardcore scene lately, I've been on the lookout for new releases that resonate with me. This one caught my attention, and I quickly hit the preorder button. Now, I'm counting down the hours until I can give it a spin after work. The anticipation is real â€“ can't wait to immerse myself in the sounds of Garden Home!"
