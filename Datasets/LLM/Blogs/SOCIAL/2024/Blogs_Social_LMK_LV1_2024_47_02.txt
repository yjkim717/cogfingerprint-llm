"I'm still reeling from my third playthrough of Horizon Zero Dawn. The thrill of taking down those robotic beasts never gets old! As I wrapped up my last play session, I couldn't help but think about what's next. With Horizon Forbidden West on the horizon (pun intended), I'm torn between buying it for my trusty PS4 or waiting for my upgrade to PS5. I mean, who doesn't want to experience Aloy's next adventure in stunning next-gen graphics? But, as I scrolled through social media, I saw so many friends raving about the game's PS4 version. It made me realize that, at the end of the day, it's not about the console - it's about the story and the thrill of exploration. So, I'm leaning towards getting Forbidden West on PS4. After all, I've already got a great thing going on my current console. Why wait?"
