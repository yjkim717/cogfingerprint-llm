## Eight Weeks In: Should I Jump or Should I Stay? (A NICU Nurse's Dilemma)

Okay, deep breaths everyone. I need to get this off my chest. I’m eight weeks into a dream job – a Registered Nurse in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). It’s *the* specialty I’ve been working towards, the one I envisioned myself thriving in, surrounded by tiny miracles and a team of dedicated professionals. 

And… it’s been rough. Really rough.

I’m not going to sugarcoat it: the environment here is… challenging. Let’s just say the support system I anticipated isn't quite there, and I’ve already witnessed more than my fair share of workplace toxicity. Things have shifted dramatically from the interview process, and the reality of daily pressures is hitting me hard. I'm feeling a level of distress and disillusionment I honestly wasn't prepared for. Burnout feels like it’s lurking around the corner.

So, here’s the big question swirling in my head: Do I stick it out? Do I try to weather the storm and hope things improve? Or do I cut my losses and consider a career change, even after such a short time? 

The fear of it looking bad on my resume is real. Will leaving after only eight weeks be a scarlet letter? Will it signal instability to future employers? It’s a valid concern, especially in a profession as demanding as nursing. 

But what’s the cost of staying? What’s the cost to my mental health, my passion for nursing, and ultimately, the quality of care I can provide those precious little patients? 

This is a conversation I know many nurses – especially those early in their careers – can relate to. Let's talk about it. What would *you* do?
