**The Quiet Battle at Home**

It’s weird, right? Saving up for a dream trip, meticulously planning every detail… and then feeling utterly paralyzed by the little things? Lately, my home has become a minefield of disruptive sounds – a dripping faucet, a neighbor’s lawnmower – and it’s triggering something fierce. 

I think it’s connected to burnout, honestly. The constant pressure just makes me hyper-sensitive to everything. Relaxation feels impossible. It’s a frustrating reminder that sometimes, the biggest battles aren't fought on a grand scale, but in the quiet corners of our own lives. #misophonia #stress #burnout
