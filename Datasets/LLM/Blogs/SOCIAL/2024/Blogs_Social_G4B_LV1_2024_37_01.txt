**Who Would Play *Us* in a Historical Drama?**

Okay, I had a random thought today: if Rooster Teeth – Burnie, Geoff, Thomas Jefferson (seriously, that guy!), the whole crew – were suddenly thrust into a period piece, who’d play who?

It’s silly, but it makes you think about their personalities in a new way! #RoosterTeeth #SocialThoughts #JustSaying
