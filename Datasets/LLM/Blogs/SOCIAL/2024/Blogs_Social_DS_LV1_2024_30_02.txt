So, you're about to tackle that wobbly wheel and have a new hub assembly waiting from RockAuto. The big question: does the box contain everything you need? From my experience, it's a mixed bag. Most modern hub assemblies conveniently come with a new, critical axle nut—don't reuse the old one! However, the integrated ABS sensor is usually included, but always double-check the product listing photos and details on RockAuto before you finalize the order. You don't want to be halfway through the job only to find your new hub is missing its "brain" for the anti-lock brakes.

It’s 2024, and my entire social life is a curated algorithm. My feed shows me friends at a party I wasn't invited to, while my own post about a quiet coffee gets crickets. I closed the app today and just called someone. The sound of a real, surprised laugh was a jolt of pure connection I didn't know I was missing. We're all so packaged for consumption, we forget the raw, unedited joy of just being heard.
