The crackle of flames still echoes in my mind, a stark reminder of the night our home vanished. In the aftermath, every dollar became a lifeline, and sacrifices were inevitable. The hardest? Pausing the voice therapy that had become my anchor.

As a transgender person, those sessions weren't just about pitchâ€”they were about finding my authentic self. Now, with finances stretched thin, I hear the old hesitations creeping back into my speech. It feels like watching a part of me slowly fade, a necessary but heartbreaking step back in my mental health journey. Some days, the silence feels louder than the fire ever was.
