## The Funny Thing About Progress

It’s weird, isn’t it? How dedicating yourself to something – like, *really* dedicating yourself – can flip your perspective on… well, everything. I started walking consistently last year, then added some light weightlifting. The weight melted off, my energy skyrocketed, and honestly, I feel fantastic. Like, genuinely, deeply good about myself.

But lately, a little voice has started whispering. It’s not about *feeling* good, it’s about *looking* good, and more specifically, what other people think. I caught my reflection the other day and, for the first time in ages, felt… exposed. Like I’d suddenly become hyper-aware of every angle, every muscle. 

Is this what people expect? Is it…too much? It’s silly, I know. All this effort for *this* kind of worry? I guess progress isn't just about numbers on a scale; it’s about navigating a whole new set of social anxieties too. Still, gotta keep walking, right? And maybe work on silencing that little voice.
