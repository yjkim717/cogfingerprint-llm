### Finding Strength in Unexpected Places

So, I finally finished my first playthrough of Baldur’s Gate 3. Everyone online said to make Shadowheart, my trickery domain cleric, a back-line healer. Her job was to be supportive, a bit sneaky, but definitely not a frontline fighter. On paper, she was built for clever tricks, not for taking hits.

But you know what? I rebelled. I ignored the "optimal" advice and poured all my efforts into making her an unkillable tank. I found the best armor, enchanted her gear, and turned her into a fortress. Her base AC got so high that enemies would just bounce off her. Sure, she’d swing her mace and miss most of the time—her combat accuracy was comically bad—but she was an immovable object, a sanctuary for my squishier party members.

It got me thinking, especially in our hyper-optimized 2024 world where we’re all pressured to specialize and "stay in our lane." We’re told to double down on our obvious strengths. But Shadowheart taught me there’s a different kind of power in defying expectations. Her value wasn't in dealing damage; it was in her unwavering presence, creating space for everyone else to shine.

Sometimes, the most profound support doesn’t come from doing what you’re "supposed" to be good at, but from becoming the resilient, unexpected rock that holds everything together. Who knew a video game companion could be such a powerful lesson in community?
