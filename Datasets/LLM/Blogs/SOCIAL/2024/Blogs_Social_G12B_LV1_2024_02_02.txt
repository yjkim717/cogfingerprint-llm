## The Ghost Limb and the Galaxy Far, Far Away

It's weird, isn't it, how VR can unlock unexpected things about yourself? I've been diving back into *No Man's Sky* in VR lately, and I’ve been experimenting with some pretty niche control schemes. See, I’m trying to navigate the vastness of space using *only* my left hand. Sounds bizarre, I know.

It started with a bit of motion sickness, the usual VR disorientation. But then I realized: my right arm has a lingering stiffness from an old injury.  Using it for traditional VR locomotion felt…wrong.  So, I started fiddling. Now, with a custom control setup, I’m warping between planets, scanning alien flora, all with just my left hand guiding the ship.

It's not just about overcoming discomfort. It’s about adapting, about finding new ways to interact with these digital worlds. It made me think about accessibility in a broader sense—how often do we build systems that exclude people without even realizing it?  It’s a small thing, a single player’s workaround in a space exploration game, but it’s sparked a bigger thought about inclusivity and the power of creative problem-solving. Who knows, maybe someday, VR will truly be for *everyone*.
