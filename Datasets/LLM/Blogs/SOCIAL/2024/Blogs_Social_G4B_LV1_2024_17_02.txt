**Neonatal Nights & Nerves**

Okay, so I just started my shift in the NICU, and honestly? It’s… a lot. I’m so thrilled to be here, to be a part of such tiny, incredible lives, but the initial orientation felt *really* rushed. Like, we got the basics – suctioning, rounds, feeding protocols – but not much about the specific nuances of caring for preemies and surgical babies. 

I'm a new grad, and the pressure is real. Seeing those little faces hooked up to so many machines, knowing they’ve already faced so much… it’s humbling.  I voiced my concerns to my preceptor, and she was really understanding. She admitted it's tough to cram everything in, and that we’ll build confidence with experience. 

It’s made me realize the importance of asking questions, of really digging deep into each patient’s story.  This isn’t just about following a checklist; it’s about connecting with these families and providing the most supportive care we can. Wish me luck – and maybe send coffee! #NICU #NewNurse #NeonatalCare #Reflection

Would you like me to revise this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
