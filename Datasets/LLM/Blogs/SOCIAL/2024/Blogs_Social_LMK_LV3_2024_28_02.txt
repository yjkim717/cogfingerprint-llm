As I navigate social gatherings in 2024, I'm constantly reminded of the pressure to drink. It's easy to get caught up in the culture of "one more round" and "it's just a habit." But what if you're trying to cut back? I've been there, and it's tough. By sharing my own struggles and tips, I hope to help others who are on a similar journey towards a healthier relationship with alcohol and a more mindful approach to social drinking.
