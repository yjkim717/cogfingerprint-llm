**The Weight of a Thousand Likes**

Let’s be honest, 2024 feels *heavy* sometimes, doesn't it? Especially when you’re chasing that perfect shot, meticulously editing, and then hitting “post” – only to be momentarily consumed by the numbers. I recently found myself wrestling with huge image files, desperately trying to shrink them without losing detail. It’s a frustrating feeling, like sacrificing quality to fit a certain mold. 

It made me realize: are we prioritizing likes over the *joy* of capturing a beautiful moment?  Let’s remember that real connection comes from authenticity, not just a pretty picture.
