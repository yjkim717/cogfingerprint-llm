It’s 2024, and I’m still thinking about *Stranger Things*. I’ll admit it: I don’t get the hype anymore.

I remember the magic of the first season—the mystery, the nostalgia, the genuine chills. But with each new chapter, that spark has dimmed for me. The plot feels stretched, the scares more predictable. And then there’s Eddie Munson. Look, the guy had charisma, but the pedestal he’s been placed on online? It feels a bit overrated, disconnected from the character I actually saw on screen.

It’s strange when a show you once loved becomes a cultural monolith. The excitement is everywhere, yet my own experience has been one of gradual decline. It’s okay to step back from the crowd and just… miss what it used to be. Anyone else feel this way?
