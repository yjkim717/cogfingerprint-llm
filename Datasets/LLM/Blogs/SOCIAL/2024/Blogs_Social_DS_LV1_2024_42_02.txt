It’s 2024, and I keep thinking about that artist who painted over her canvas every day for a year—600 layers, each one a fleeting moment. It reminds me of our digital lives: we snap photos, post stories, then scroll past. Each one a layer, quickly buried. But what if we peeled them back? Would we find meaning, or just the ghost of a moment? Maybe it’s not about permanence, but the ritual of creating, again and again.
