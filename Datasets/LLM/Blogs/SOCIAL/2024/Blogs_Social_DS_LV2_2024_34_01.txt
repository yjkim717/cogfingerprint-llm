It’s 2024, and I’m still chasing that feeling of delicate confidence. You know the one—the kind For Love and Lemons captures so perfectly in their lingerie. I’ve been scrolling through independent designers, hunting for swimwear that mirrors that same romantic, lacey energy. There’s something deeply personal about finding a frilly bikini with bows; it’s not just a suit, it’s a statement. It’s about embracing a softer, more intentional you, right down to the last ribbon tie.
