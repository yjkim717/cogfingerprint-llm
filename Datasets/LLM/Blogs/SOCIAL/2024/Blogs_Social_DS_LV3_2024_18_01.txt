It’s 2024, and I’ve been exploring liquid staking on platforms like Sui and Scallop—staking my SUI tokens and receiving sSUI in return. At first, I wondered: does locking up assets mean losing touch with their real value? But here’s the beauty of it: liquid staking lets you keep your tokens working for you while staying flexible. It’s like having your cake and eating it too—earning rewards without being tied down. Over time, I’ve realized that the value of these staked assets isn’t just about price alignment; it’s about trust in the ecosystem and the freedom to pivot when opportunities arise. In a world craving both security and liquidity, this feels like the perfect balance.
