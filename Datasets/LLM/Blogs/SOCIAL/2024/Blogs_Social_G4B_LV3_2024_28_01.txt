It feels like time has warped lately. My dad’s health is changing, and suddenly, my carefully built social life is taking a backseat.  I’m juggling work, appointments, and just…being there. There’s an immense weight of caregiving, and honestly, the stress is a constant companion. It’s a quiet kind of loss, watching someone you love fade, and I’m learning that prioritizing family, even when it’s hard, is everything.  Anyone else feeling this shift in 2024?
