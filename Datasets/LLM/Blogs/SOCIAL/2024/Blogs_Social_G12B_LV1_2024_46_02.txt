## The Weight of Stillness in a Scrolling World

There's something deeply comforting about holding a physical book these days, isn't there? I’ve been on a bit of a short story kick lately, hunting for something… grounded. Something that feels like a quiet pause button in this relentless 2024 scroll.

I stumbled across a collection recently, a beautiful thing. It had this incredible black-and-white photo tucked inside – just a couple of dogs, curled up asleep in a sunbeam. Simple, honest. It felt like a visual anchor to the stories themselves. They explored everyday lives, quiet anxieties, the subtle shifts in American landscapes. It reminded me that even amidst the noise, beauty and stillness exist, and sometimes, it’s found in the simplest of things.




Hope this works for you!
