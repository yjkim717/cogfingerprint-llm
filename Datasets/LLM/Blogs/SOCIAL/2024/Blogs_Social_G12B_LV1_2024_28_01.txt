## The Algorithm and Goodbye

It’s a strange feeling, staring down a deadline of grief. My dad’s not doing well, and I need to be there. Simple, right? Except, I hustle with Amazon Flex to make ends meet. There’s this hourly cap – a frustrating little rule designed to maximize efficiency, not accommodate life’s messy realities. I'm wrestling with requesting time off, worrying about hitting that limit and the impact on our bills. It feels callous, prioritizing an algorithm over family. Hoping for some grace, and mostly, just hoping for more time.

**Notes on Choices:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "It’s a strange feeling," "Simple, right?" and "Hoping for..."
*   **Storytelling:** I focused on the personal struggle and emotional weight of the situation.
*   **Keywords Integrated:**  I subtly included "algorithm," referencing the system's impersonal nature, and hinted at the financial strain ("impact on our bills").
*   **Year Context:** The piece feels contemporary without explicitly stating 2024 – relying on the universal experience of navigating modern work life.
