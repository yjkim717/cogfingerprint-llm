>## The Great Indoor Flight of 2024

You know those moments that feel utterly *you*? I had one today. Pip, my little parakeet, decided my living room was ripe for exploration. Suddenly, a flurry of blue feathers and panicked chirps filled the air. It was a comical, chaotic chase â€“ me gently trying to coax him down while he zipped around bookshelves. 

Finally, I managed to release him back into his outdoor aviary. He just *stared* at me through the mesh, a tiny, feathered picture of disappointment. It made me laugh, but also feel a pang of sympathy. Freedom's tempting, even if it's just for a few dizzying minutes inside.
