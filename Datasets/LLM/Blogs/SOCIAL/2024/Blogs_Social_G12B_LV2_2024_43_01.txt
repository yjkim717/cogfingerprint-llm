## The Pressure's On (and the Ribeye's in a Bag)

Okay, confession time: I’m hosting a work get-together next week, and I’m *determined* to wow everyone. A Reddit thread sparked an idea – sous vide appetizers! Sounds fancy, right? But I'm nervous. Will my colleagues, used to predictable pub fare, appreciate perfectly cooked ribeye bites? It's a reminder that sharing food is about more than taste; it’s about connection, and a little bit of culinary risk. Wish me luck!
