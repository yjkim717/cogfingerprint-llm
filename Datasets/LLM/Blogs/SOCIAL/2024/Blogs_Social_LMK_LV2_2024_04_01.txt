"After my cataract surgery in 2024, I was surprised to find that natural light overwhelmed me. With my new intraocular implants, I felt like I was staring directly into the sun. Artificial warm light, on the other hand, was a balm to my sensitive eyes. It's funny how our preferences change - now I'm more likely to cozy up under a table lamp than step outside on a sunny day. Has anyone else had a similar experience?"
