It’s 2024, and my phone buzzes with yet another “urgent” automated message—a robotic voice insisting my Truist account needs verification. I sigh, remembering when calls meant real human connection. Now, we’re navigating a digital maze of spam, where trust feels like a rare currency. It’s made me more intentional: I pause before answering, cherish genuine conversations, and question the noise. In this age of algorithms, maybe the real verification is remembering what truly matters—each other.
