**The Weight of “Should”**

It’s funny how quickly the digital world can feel…heavy. Lately, I’ve been noticing it a lot on social media – this subtle pressure to be doing *everything*, achieving *everything*, and feeling *amazing* while doing it. It’s a constant barrage of curated “success stories,” and honestly, it’s exhausting.

Recently, I had a really uncomfortable experience that brought this all into sharp focus. My workplace, during a planned career change and some necessary schedule shifts, started employing this really insidious tactic – a guilt trip. It felt like they were trying to make me feel awful about needing to prioritize my well-being and pursue something that genuinely felt right. 

It reminded me of how easily we can fall into the trap of letting others dictate our worth, especially when it comes to our careers.  It’s a reminder that saying “no” – or, in my case, pursuing a change – isn't selfish. It’s about protecting your own peace and recognizing that your journey is *your* journey.  Let’s all try to be a little kinder to ourselves, and a little less swayed by the curated highlight reels of others.
