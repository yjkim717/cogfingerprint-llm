The fluorescent lights of the NICU hummed a familiar, sterile tune, but the melody of this unit felt different. When I accepted this position eight weeks ago, I pictured a sanctuary—a place of tiny victories and a team moving as one resilient heartbeat. The reality has been a jarring lesson in how a dream job can curdle under the weight of a toxic environment.

I’ve lost count of my preceptors. Just as I start to sync with one nurse’s rhythm, I’m rotated to another, leaving me feeling perpetually new and disconnected. There’s no chance to build the trust that’s so vital when caring for our most vulnerable patients. It feels less like training and more like being passed around.

Then there’s the new pod system. On paper, it’s about organization. In practice, it’s a cage. We’re micromanaged within an inch of our sanity, our every movement tracked and scrutinized. The collaborative spirit I craved has been replaced by a rigid, almost militant, attendance policy for our own pod assignments. It’s suffocating.

In 2024, we talk so much about mental health and supportive workplaces, but here, the culture is one of control, not care—and that extends to the staff as much as the patients. I stare at the isolette of a fragile newborn and wonder if I can truly give my best in a place that seems to distrust my competence so deeply. My heart is still in the NICU, but I’m left questioning if this specific unit has any room for it.
