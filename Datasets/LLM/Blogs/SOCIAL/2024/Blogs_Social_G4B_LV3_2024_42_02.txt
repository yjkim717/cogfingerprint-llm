**The Ghosts in My Gallery**

Scrolling through Instagram lately, it’s hit me with a strange wave of…nostalgia, I guess? Not for anything specific, just a deep ache for a feeling I can’t quite grasp. It reminded me of a childhood memory surfacing – a vivid, unsettling one. My dad, a talented artist, would systematically paint over everything I created, my drawings, my paintings…white. 

It felt like a stifling obsession, a way of erasing my voice. Looking back, I realize it might have been rooted in something deeper, a trauma he never understood how to process. It's a bizarre connection to the curated perfection we see online, isn’t it?  A longing for acceptance, perhaps, expressed in the strangest way.
