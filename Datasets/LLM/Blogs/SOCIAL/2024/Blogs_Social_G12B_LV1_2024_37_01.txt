## If History Had a Podcast... Starring Rooster Teeth?

It's a weird thought that popped up recently – if Rooster Teeth were around to chronicle history, who would play which Founding Father? Burnie as a passionately opinionated, slightly chaotic John Adams feels *right*, doesn't it? Maybe Geoff as the steady, pragmatic Washington? It's a silly exercise, but it got me thinking about how personality shapes historical narratives. Would their signature blend of humor and deep dives actually *work* for, say, the American Revolution? Probably! It’s a fun thought experiment for a Friday afternoon.
