## Is My Mirage Experience Just… Me?

Okay, Deadlock players, let's talk. I’ve been maining Infernus for ages, and lately, I've been seeing *a lot* of frustration about Mirage. People are saying she's broken, unbalanced. But honestly? My experiences with her have been surprisingly positive. 

It's got me wondering… am I just consistently facing players who aren't quite dialed in yet? 2024 is bringing a lot of new faces to Deadlock, and maybe my rosy Mirage encounters are a product of that. Food for thought, right? Let's discuss!
