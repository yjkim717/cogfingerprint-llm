## The Layers of Letting Go

It’s funny the things that stick with you. I was talking to my grandma the other day, and she told me this wild story about her sister-in-law. Apparently, decades ago, this woman was determined to paint her father's workshop a cheerful blue. Every day, she'd paint. Every night, her dad, a man of unwavering routine, would repaint it white. 

Imagine the sheer frustration! But Grandma said over time, the workshop walls became a chaotic, textured mess – layer upon layer of blue and white. It made me think about how we all build up layers too, trying to impose our vision, our color, onto situations that are constantly being reset. Sometimes, maybe the best thing isn’t to fight the white, but to find beauty in the history of all those layers. It's a weirdly comforting thought in 2024, isn't it?
