### From Fan to Creator: Walking the Public Domain Tightrope

It’s a strange feeling, holding a universe in your hands. I’m currently writing a novel that reimagines the classic Universal Monsters, and the shift from horror to dark fantasy has been both thrilling and terrifying.

These characters—the Creature, Dracula, the Wolf Man—are more than just IP; they’re modern folklore. They live in our collective imagination, and that’s the tightrope I’m walking. The public domain gives me the legal right to use them, but it doesn’t grant immunity from fan disappointment. My biggest fear isn’t a bad review; it’s the quiet comment that says, “This doesn’t feel like *him*.”

So, I’ve set a simple rule for myself: honor the core. The tormented soul of the Monster, the tragic curse of Larry Talbot. If I keep their essential spirits intact, I can build a new, fantastical world around them without breaking the magic that made us all fans in the first place. It’s a lesson in creative respect, and honestly, the most rewarding challenge of my career.
