It’s 2024, and my 3D printer and I have trust issues. It breezes through calibration cubes like a star student, but the moment I try printing intricate wall art with supports, everything falls apart—literally. I’ve swapped nozzles, tweaked settings, and still, it feels like we’re speaking different languages. Maybe it’s time for a heart-to-heart with my machine.
