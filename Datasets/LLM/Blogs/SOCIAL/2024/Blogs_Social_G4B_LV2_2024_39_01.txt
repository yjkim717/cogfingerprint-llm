**The Hum of Anxiety**

There’s a weird hum I’ve been noticing lately – not from my Inkbird controller battling humidity, but from scrolling. Social media feels… frantic. Everyone’s highlight reels are competing, and I’m suddenly acutely aware of how *my* life looks in comparison. It’s exhausting. 

I realized I was chasing a version of ‘perfect’ I can't actually reach. Maybe it's time to turn off the fans – both the literal ones battling humidity, and the ones fueling this constant need to compare.  A little quiet, a little grounding – that’s the reset I need.
