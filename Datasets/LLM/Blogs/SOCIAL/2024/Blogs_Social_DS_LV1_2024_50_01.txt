It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking about how we remember people. When Barack Obama eulogized John McCain, he didn’t shy away from mentioning his "short fuse" or moments of disrespect. At first, that struck me as odd—aren’t eulogies for praise? But now I see it: acknowledging flaws makes a life real. It’s a reminder that our heroes are human, too, and maybe that’s what makes their legacies so powerful and worth celebrating.
