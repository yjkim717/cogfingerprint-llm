raised by the relentless news cycle and the feeling that so much is outside of our hands? Lately, I’ve been craving a sense of *control*. It's funny, isn't it? Seeking it in hobbies – pottery, coding, even tending a small balcony garden – feels like reclaiming a little bit of *agency* in a world that often feels chaotic. These *activities* aren’t just fun; they're a quiet rebellion against feeling powerless, a path to *satisfaction* built on tangible creation. What's your go-to way to feel grounded in 2024?
