### The Ghosting Generation

It’s 2024, and my dating life feels like a broken record. I’m 25, I have a good job, and I genuinely try to be a good guy—I listen, I plan thoughtful dates, I communicate. But it all seems to end the same way: a promising connection just… vanishes.

The ghosting is the worst part. One week we’re sharing laughs over coffee, and the next, my messages are met with digital silence. It’s not just one person; it’s a pattern. The constant cycle of hope and sudden rejection is emotionally exhausting. I’m not looking to play games; I’m trying to build a meaningful relationship and maybe even settle down one day.

But how do you find solid ground when everyone seems to have one foot out the door? I’m just tired of feeling like I’m an option, instead of a priority.
