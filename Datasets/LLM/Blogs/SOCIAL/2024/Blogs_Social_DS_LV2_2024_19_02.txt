It’s 2024, and I just got accused of cheating in a prerecorded interview. Me—cheating! The irony? I was simply trying to look professional, keeping eye contact with the camera while my mind raced. A tiny tech glitch made it seem like I was reading prepared answers.

Honestly, it stings. In a world where authenticity is everything, being misunderstood feels like a gut punch. Have we become so suspicious that we mistake effort for deception? Sometimes, the pressure to perform perfectly is the real issue, not dishonesty.
