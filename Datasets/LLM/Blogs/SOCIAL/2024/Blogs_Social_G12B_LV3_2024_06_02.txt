 Hugging a New Ride (and Banishing the Bananas!)

There's something uniquely personal about buying a car, isn't there? I finally took the plunge and snagged a B5 blue beauty! The dealership insisted on those little decorative bananas hanging from the rearview mirror. Let's just say they weren't *quite* my vibe. A quick removal and it felt instantly mine â€“ a small act, a big statement of ownership. #carlove #automotive #personalize
