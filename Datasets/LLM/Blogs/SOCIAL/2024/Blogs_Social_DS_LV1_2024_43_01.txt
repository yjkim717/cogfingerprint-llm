I remember the pressure of hosting my team's first post-pandemic work gathering in 2024. I wanted to showcase my new sous vide, but a full ribeye felt too formal. The solution? Elegant, bite-sized appetizers. I settled on sous vide duck breast sliders with a cherry gastrique. The precision cooking delivered perfectly medium-rare duck every time, and the "wow" factor was undeniable. It was a delicious reminder that the most impactful connections often happen over shared, surprising food.
