### The Unlikely Mentor: What a Fiend Taught Me About My Own Morality

It’s 2024, and my biggest moral quandary isn’t about AI or politics—it’s about my weekly Dungeons & Dragons game.

Let me explain. My character is a warlock, and his patron is a yugoloth named Anthraxus. For the non-nerds, that’s basically a fiend from the plane of ultimate neutrality, a creature that deals in souls and sees morality as a currency. My character’s central conflict? He has to broker soul sacrifices to fuel his power.

Sitting there, role-playing a character trying to start a cult for this entity, I had a bizarre moment of clarity. I was wrestling with a fictional moral code more intently than I sometimes do with real-world dilemmas. Anthraxus doesn’t demand evil for evil’s sake; he demands a transaction. It’s a brutal, unsettling form of honesty. There are no grand illusions of righteousness, just a simple, terrible cost for the power you desire.

And it made me think: how often do we make our own soul sacrifices without even realizing it?

We don’t call it that, of course. We call it “hustle culture,” trading sleep and sanity for a promotion. We call it “staying connected,” sacrificing our peace of mind to the endless scroll of bad news. We sacrifice bits of our integrity to fit in, or our passions for a perceived sense of security.

My warlock’s pact is a dark mirror held up to my own choices. Anthraxus is upfront about the price. In our lives, the contracts are often hidden in the fine print of our daily routines.

So, my strange journey into fiendish patronage has become an unexpected lesson in personal accountability. It’s forcing me to ask: What am I sacrificing? And more importantly, is the power I’m gaining—the status, the comfort, the convenience—truly worth the cost?

Turns out, you can find a reflection of your own moral compass in the most unlikely of places. Even in the sulfurous gaze of a fiend.
