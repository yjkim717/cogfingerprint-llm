## The Unspoken Question: When "Why Not?" Becomes "Why?"

It's 2024, and we’re constantly bombarded with narratives about family, legacy, and the ‘natural order’ of things. Lately, I’ve been grappling with a particularly persistent one: the societal expectation to have children. Specifically, the gentle, yet unwavering pressure from my parents.

It’s not a malicious thing, their curiosity. It stems from a place of love, I know. But their questions – "Don't you want to experience the joy of a child?" – feel loaded now. They’re rooted in a generation where having kids was practically a given, a societal milestone.

My answer remains the same: I’ve chosen to be childfree. And it’s not a choice made lightly. It’s a considered decision, factoring in everything from the immense financial burden of raising a child in today's world to the desire to ensure future generations aren't saddled with anxieties about climate change or crippling debt. 

More than that, I want to allow any potential future children of others the freedom to truly explore their passions, without the weight of expectation or the constraints of limited resources. It’s a selfish desire, perhaps, but one I hold dear. 

Sometimes, I wish the question wasn't “Why not?” but simply, “So, what are you passionate about these days?” It feels like a much more genuine conversation starter.
