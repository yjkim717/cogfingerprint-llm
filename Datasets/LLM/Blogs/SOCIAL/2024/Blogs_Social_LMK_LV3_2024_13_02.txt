As I count down the days to my best friend's wedding in 2024, I'm on the hunt for the perfect nursing-friendly dress. With my little one still breastfeeding, I want a stylish outfit that accommodates my needs. I'm drawn to soft pastel hues and flowing designs that exude elegance. Finding a dress that meets my requirements is a challenge, but I'm determined to feel confident and beautiful on this special occasion.
