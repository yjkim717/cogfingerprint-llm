As we continue to navigate the complexities of social interactions in 2024, I'm reminded of the power of eulogies to spark interesting conversations. Recently, I found myself pondering why we often feel compelled to acknowledge the deceased person's flaws in death tributes. Take Barack Obama's eulogy for John McCain, for instance. While some saw it as a gracious gesture, others wondered why we can't just focus on the positives. As we reflect on our own relationships and how we honor others, let's consider the value of balance in our tributes â€“ and in our lives.
