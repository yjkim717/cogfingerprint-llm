It’s 2024, and honestly, I’m just trying to keep up. After that debate, the whispers about Biden’s age grew louder. Then the assassination attempt on Trump—it felt like the ground shifted. Suddenly, Democrats seem fractured, unsure, while Republicans appear galvanized. But is Trump’s victory really a done deal? I’m not so sure. In this whirlwind, I find myself just hoping for a future that feels stable and sane again.
