**The Unexpected Freedom (and a Slightly Sad Snack)**

It reminded me of that time my little budgie, Pip, staged his own escape! He flew right out the window, and after a frantic hour, we got him back – safe, thankfully. But the best part? He’d been enjoying a little sunflower seed treat while he was out there!  It’s funny how these little moments of freedom – both for our pets and ourselves – can come with a tiny pang of disappointment.  Social media feels a bit like that sometimes, doesn’t it? #petlife #escapades #reflection
