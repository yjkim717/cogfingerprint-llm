## The Weight of Expectations (and a Dead Laptop)

Okay, real talk. I'm sitting here, slightly frazzled, staring at a stubbornly uncharged laptop. And it’s all thanks to my Samsonite bag. I’d been so proud of this thing – sleek, professional, promised built-in USB charging capabilities! Perfect for the perpetually-on-the-go freelancer like me.

Except… it’s not working. At all. 

I’ve checked the power bank (fully charged, naturally), the USB cable (tried three different ones!), even double-checked the Easy Pass sticker isn’t interfering (because, you know, 2024 and the constant fear of signal blockage). Nothing. 

It’s a silly frustration, I know. But it’s also a bigger thing. It’s about the weight of expectations we put on tech, on brands, on *things* to make our lives easier. And when they fail, it feels like a personal failure, right? Like I’ve somehow missed a crucial step, a hidden instruction manual. 

Now I’m off to Google "Samsonite USB charging troubleshooting," hoping to avoid a full-blown tech meltdown. Wish me luck! Maybe someone out there has conquered this beast.
