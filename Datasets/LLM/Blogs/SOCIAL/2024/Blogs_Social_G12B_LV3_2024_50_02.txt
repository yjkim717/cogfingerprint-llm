## Is This How It Ends? A Worrying Feeling About 2024

Okay, I need to get this off my chest. Lately, I’ve been feeling… uneasy. Scrolling through Reddit the other day, I stumbled upon a thread echoing a worry I've been having: is Donald Trump’s return to the White House almost inevitable? 

It's hard to shake the feeling. Watching the debates, seeing Biden’s age a visible factor, and witnessing the sometimes fractured state of the Democratic party… it’s a stark contrast to the seemingly unified front Republicans have behind Trump. 

I’m not saying it *will* happen, but the possibility is unsettling. It feels like we’re sleepwalking towards a future we desperately hope to avoid. Anyone else feeling this too? Let's talk about it.
