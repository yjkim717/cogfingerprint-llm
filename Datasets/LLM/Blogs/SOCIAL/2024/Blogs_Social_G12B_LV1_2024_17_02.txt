## Neon Lights and Nerves: My First Few Weeks in the NICU

Okay, deep breaths everyone. I’m finally sitting down with a lukewarm cup of tea and a few minutes to process everything. I started my dream job – a NICU nurse – about a month ago, and honestly? It's been… a lot.

I went into this so excited. I pictured myself confidently charting vital signs, soothing tiny babies, and feeling like a superhero in scrubs. The reality? A little more like a baby myself, clinging to the handrails of a very steep learning curve.

The orientation felt… rushed. Like they were trying to cram a semester's worth of information into a week. I know everyone’s busy, and the NICU is constantly bustling, but it left me feeling a bit adrift. I’m trying to soak it all in, but remembering all the nuances of different ventilator settings and medication dosages is a serious mental workout.

And then there's the looming unit restructure. Apparently, they're dividing the unit into specialized teams, which sounds great in theory, but adds another layer of uncertainty right now.  It's hard to build a solid foundation when the ground is shifting.

The biggest challenge, though, has been the preceptor support. It's been…inconsistent. Some days I felt like I had a champion guiding me; other days, I was left feeling pretty lost. It's isolating when you're surrounded by so much critical care and feel like you're constantly asking “dumb” questions.

But, I'm trying to focus on the small wins. Holding a tiny hand, hearing a baby’s first cry, even just remembering a new medication – those moments make it all worthwhile. I’m actively reaching out to colleagues, asking for help, and reminding myself that *everyone* started somewhere. It's a tough journey, but I'm determined to find my footing in this incredible, high-stakes world. Wish me luck!
