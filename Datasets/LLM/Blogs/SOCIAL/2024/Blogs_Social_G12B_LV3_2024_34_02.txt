]## The Lingering Question Mark of Last Year's Pain

Okay, so last year was… something. I had this excruciating pain, the kind that makes you question every life choice you've ever made. Turns out, it was likely a kidney stone. A *kidney stone*. Who even expects that? 

After a terrifying trip to urgent care (seriously, the waiting room felt like an eternity), and a hefty dose of relief medication, I was sent home with instructions to drink copious amounts of lemon water and, well, wait it out. The lemon water, surprisingly, wasn't terrible. I felt like I was powering through something, you know? 

The pain subsided, thankfully, and life went back to… mostly normal. But here's the thing: it's been a year. A whole year. And I still find myself wondering – did I actually pass that stone? Or is it just…biding its time? 

It’s a weird little anxiety, this lingering question mark in my body. I guess it’s a reminder that sometimes, even when things *feel* resolved, there's a tiny, persistent whisper of “what if?” Anyone else ever experienced something like this? Let me know in the comments – I need to feel less alone in this kidney-stone-induced existential crisis!
