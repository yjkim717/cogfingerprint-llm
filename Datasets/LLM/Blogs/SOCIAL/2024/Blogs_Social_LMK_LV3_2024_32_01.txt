As I watched my stepdad restrict my pet's water intake, I couldn't help but wonder if we were doing more harm than good. The advice came from a well-meaning dog trainer, but had it been misinterpreted? I've since learned that limiting water intake can be detrimental to our furry friends' health. As pet owners, it's our responsibility to separate fact from fiction and prioritize animal welfare. In 2024, with the wealth of information available, it's easier than ever to make informed decisions about pet care. I'm calling on fellow pet owners to join me in questioning common practices and seeking out credible sources. By doing so, we can ensure our pets receive the care they deserve. Let's work together to debunk misinformation and promote responsible ownership â€“ our pets' health depends on it. By taking a closer look, we can make a real difference in their lives.
