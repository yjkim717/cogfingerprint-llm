### The Stories We Tell Ourselves

It’s the kind of news that makes you pause your scrolling and just sit for a minute. Caleb Harris. A name most of us didn’t know, now forever tied to a chilling, almost unthinkable theory—a simple misstep, a fall into a storm sewer.

In 2024, we’re surrounded by so much noise. We have answers for everything at our fingertips, and yet, a story like this reminds me how fragile our daily navigation really is. We walk over grates and manholes without a second thought, part of the urban landscape we trust to just… work. The idea that a single, fleeting accident in the dark could lead to such a tragic end is a sobering reminder of the thin line between a normal night and a catastrophe.

This isn’t just about infrastructure or a true-crime mystery. For me, it’s become a metaphor. How many of us are just one unexpected step away from being swept into a current we can’t control? A sudden job loss, a health scare, a phone call that changes everything.

Caleb’s story, in its heartbreaking simplicity, connects us because it touches that universal fear of the random, the accidental. It makes me want to be more present, to look up from my phone and truly see the world I’m walking through. And maybe, to be a little more grateful for the ordinary, uneventful walk home. Because the truth is, our safety is often a story we tell ourselves, until a story like this reminds us otherwise.
