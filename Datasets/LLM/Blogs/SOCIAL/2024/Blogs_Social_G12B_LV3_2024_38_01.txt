>## That Uneasy Feeling When Your Power Comes at a Cost

Okay, so I've been wrestling with something in my D&D campaign lately, and it’s been making me think about power dynamics in… well, everything, really. My character is a Warlock, and their Patron is Anthraxus, a fascinating (and unsettling) entity from the Forgotten Realms. We’ve been discussing with our DM the implications of, essentially, *feeding* souls to Anthraxus – a core mechanic of this particular pact.

It’s brought up some really interesting questions. Like, what *are* the consequences? How does this impact my character's alignment? And, a big one, what's to stop me from building a cult around this shadowy being? 

It's more than just game mechanics, though. It’s about the inherent discomfort of gaining power through… sacrifice. Even within the fantastical context of D&D, it feels weighty. It mirrors, in a strange way, how we often see ambition and success in the real world – sometimes achieved at the expense of others, or with a hidden price tag we don't fully understand until later.

We’re navigating this with our DM, trying to build a narrative that feels both compelling and morally complex. It's a good reminder that even in a game, exploring the darker aspects of power and influence can be incredibly rewarding, prompting us to reflect on those same themes in our own lives. What sacrifices are we making, consciously or not, to achieve our goals? It’s a question worth pondering, even outside of a tabletop campaign.
