"As I dove back into the vast universe of No Man's Sky in my VR setup, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of frustration with the default locomotion controls. In 2024, with VR tech advancing at a breakneck pace, I expected a more personalized experience. Specifically, I wanted to navigate the cosmos using only my left hand, freeing up my right for other actions. After some digging, I discovered that the game allowed for controller-oriented movement, which I tweaked to be relative to the world. It was a small victory, but it made a huge difference in my gaming experience. This got me thinking - as VR becomes increasingly social, we need more customizable controls to accommodate different player preferences. By allowing players to personalize their experience, we can create a more inclusive and immersive environment for everyone."
