**The Comfort of Just… Being**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2024, with everyone constantly “on,” I’ve realized I crave something simpler. I mean, really crave it. It's the feeling of a good ‘third place’ – that casual coffee shop, the local bookstore, even just a park bench. 

Recently, I stumbled upon a little vintage shop and just *sat* there for an hour, people-watching and feeling utterly content. No pressure to buy anything, no need to impress anyone. It was just… being.  It reminded me of how important those low-key spots are for our social well-being.
