**The Day My Tiny Car Became a Problem**

Seriously, 2024 is *weird*. I was battling a parking lot at the grocery store the other day, and it felt… symbolic. It was ridiculously narrow, choked with oncoming traffic, and I was driving my little hatchback. I kept feeling like I was invading everyone’s space. 

It made me think about how we all navigate social situations – sometimes, we just don't fit, and it’s awkward. Like a small car trying to squeeze into a ridiculously tight spot.  It’s a reminder to be mindful and maybe, just maybe, find a wider route.
