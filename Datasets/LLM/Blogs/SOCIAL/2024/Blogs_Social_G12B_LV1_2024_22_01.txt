## Finally, a Kitchen (and a Little Bit of Hope)

It feels surreal to even type this, but… I’m getting keys to an apartment! After a really tough few years, bouncing around, it's hard to believe I'll have a place to call my own, and, most importantly, a *kitchen*. Like, a real one. With an oven!

I'm ridiculously excited to actually cook again. I'm dreaming of making something special to celebrate – maybe some sweet water noodles? Anyone have a go-to recipe? This feels like more than just cooking; it’s a fresh start, a little bit of stability, and a whole lot of hope simmering on the stove. Wish me luck!
