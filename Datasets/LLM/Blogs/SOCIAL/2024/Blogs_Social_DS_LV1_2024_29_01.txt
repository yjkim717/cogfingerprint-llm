Switching my estrogen shots from thigh to deltoid felt like a small act of self-kindness. For months, I’d dread the sting and the tiny bruises left behind—little reminders of discomfort. But the upper arm? It’s been a game-changer. A quick pinch, hardly any blood, and it’s over. It’s funny how such a tiny change can shift your whole outlook. In a world that often feels heavy, choosing ease where we can—even in medicine—feels quietly revolutionary. My body thanks me, and so does my spirit.
