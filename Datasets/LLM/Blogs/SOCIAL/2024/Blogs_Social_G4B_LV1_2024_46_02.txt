**Dusty Memories & Dog Photos**

Anyone else feel like scrolling through social media just pulls up a *lot* of…stuff?  I was looking through an old box of family photos the other day and stumbled upon a faded, black-and-white book. It was just two dogs – a scrappy terrier and a stately English setter – frozen in time. 

I’m completely captivated by wondering where it came from, maybe from the late 60s or early 70s. It’s funny how a simple photo can spark such a deep, nostalgic feeling. Makes you think about the quiet moments and the enduring bond between us and our furry friends, doesn’t it? #vintage #dogs #memories
