The constant hum of the refrigerator, my neighbor’s muffled TV, the relentless drip of the kitchen faucet—it’s 2024, and I’m drowning in noise. My misophonia has turned my own home into a battleground, each sound a fresh assault. I’m burnt out, craving silence and rest, but there’s no escape. It’s a cruel irony that the place I need to recharge is the very source of my stress. If you’re also feeling this sensory overload, know you’re not alone in this exhausting fight for peace.
