## Whose Life Is It, Anyway? Reflections on Choice and Childhood

It's 2024, and we're supposedly living in an age of unprecedented self-discovery and personal freedom. Yet, I’ve been noticing a persistent tension online, particularly within discussions around parenting. It feels like sometimes, the conversation shifts from nurturing a child to molding them into a reflection of *our* desires. 

Don't get me wrong, guiding and supporting your kids is vital. But I've been wrestling with this idea of ownership, this unspoken assumption that children are blank slates to be shaped. Are we, as parents, sometimes subtly (or not so subtly) attempting to control their paths, driven by our own anxieties or unfulfilled dreams? 

I’ve seen it in the relentless pressure around career choices, the curated hobbies, the expectations surrounding relationships. And it’s not just a straight, traditional parenting dynamic either. The rise of intentional childfree communities highlights a growing awareness of autonomy – the right to choose your own life, free from societal expectations.  Isn't that a right we should champion for *everyone*, including our children?

As someone who identifies within the LGBTQ+ community, I understand the struggle against imposed identities all too well.  It makes me question: are we inadvertently perpetuating a similar cycle when we expect our children to follow a predetermined script? 

Maybe, just maybe, true parenting isn’t about control. Maybe it’s about fostering independence, celebrating individuality, and creating space for children to become the *best versions of themselves*, even if that version looks radically different than the one we envisioned.
