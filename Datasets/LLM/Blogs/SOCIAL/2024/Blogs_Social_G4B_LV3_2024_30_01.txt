**The Echoes in My Feed**

Scrolling through social media lately feels… exhausting. It’s not just the constant stream of perfectly curated lives, though that definitely contributes. Lately, I’ve been noticing something else, a subtle undercurrent of manipulation disguised as connection. It’s a feeling I recognize painfully well.

I’ve spent years battling the insidious effects of a family dynamic riddled with gaslighting – the slow erosion of your reality, the constant questioning of your sanity. And honestly, seeing it mirrored in the way some people use social media to control narratives and twist opinions… it’s triggering. 

There’s a deep resentment that settles in when you realize you’ve been subtly manipulated, when your own experiences are dismissed or reinterpreted. It’s a quiet, persistent ache. It’s made me seriously rethink how I engage online.  I’m trying to build a feed filled with authenticity and support, a space where I can nurture my own sense of self – a sanctuary from the echoes of past hurts.  Are you feeling this too?
