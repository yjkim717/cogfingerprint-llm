**The Jitters and Tiny Hands: My NICU Transition**

Okay, let’s be real – starting a new job is *always* a little terrifying, right? But when you’re a new nurse, and you’re stepping into a place like the NICU, it’s a whole other level of feeling like you’re standing on the edge of a cliff. 

I recently went through my own version of this, and I wanted to share a little about it. I was so excited about pediatric nursing, truly passionate about caring for those little ones. But the orientation felt… rushed. Like we were thrown into the deep end with barely a life vest. 

Honestly, there were moments where I felt completely overwhelmed, wrestling with healthcare concerns and just desperately wanting to do my job *well*. The transition from general nursing to the NICU felt huge, and I definitely had those “what am I doing?” jitters. 

It’s a reminder that even experienced nurses feel this way sometimes. It’s okay to ask questions, to admit you need support, and to lean on your team.  I’m learning that navigating these big job transitions takes time, self-compassion, and a whole lot of coffee.  Anyone else feel this way when stepping into a new specialty? Let’s talk in the comments!

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
