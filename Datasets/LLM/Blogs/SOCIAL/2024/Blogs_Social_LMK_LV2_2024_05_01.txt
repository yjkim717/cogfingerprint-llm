"Improv Moments: A Lesson in Authenticity"

As I sat in my acting class in early 2024, I couldn't help but think about the assignment that had been weighing on my mind. We were tasked with observing a stranger and mimicking their physical mannerisms - a simple task, yet it felt like a daunting challenge. As I watched the person I had chosen, I found myself drawn to the quirks that made them unique. But, as I began to practice their movements and expressions, I couldn't resist the urge to add a dash of comedic flair.

Was I being true to the person I was observing, or was I just having fun with it? I turned to my instructor for feedback, wondering if I was overstepping by injecting humor into the exercise. The response was enlightening: "The goal isn't to become a caricature, but to capture the essence of the person." It made me realize that, in our daily lives, we're often guilty of doing the same thing - adding our own spin to the people and situations we encounter.

This exercise has stuck with me, and I find myself applying the lessons learned to my social interactions. By being more mindful of the people around me and striving to understand their authentic selves, I've become a better listener and a more empathetic friend. Who knew that an acting exercise could teach me so much about being human?
