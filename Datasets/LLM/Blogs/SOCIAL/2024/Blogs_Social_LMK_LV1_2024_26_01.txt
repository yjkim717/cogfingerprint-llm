As a beginner photographer in 2024, I was overwhelmed with storing my ever-growing image collection. With a tight budget, I struggled to find cost-effective ways to reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality. I discovered that resizing images and compressing files were game-changers. By lowering the resolution and using free compression tools, I was able to free up storage space. Now, I can focus on capturing life's moments without worrying about storage. It's amazing how a little tech tweak can make a big social media difference, allowing me to share more photos with friends and family.
