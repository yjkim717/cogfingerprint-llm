## The Quiet Thrill of the Hunt: My Nickel Collection and a 1995 Mystery

There’s something wonderfully calming about collecting, isn't there? Right now, I’m diving deep into nickels – yes, humble five-cent pieces! It's a surprisingly absorbing project, a little puzzle I piece together one coin at a time. I'm aiming to complete a full set, and I've been meticulously sorting and researching. 

Currently, I'm stuck on a 1995 nickel. It's proving surprisingly elusive! I'm trying to track down whether it even *exists* with a "D" or "P" mint mark – the Denver or Philadelphia variations. The US currency world can be surprisingly intricate. It's a small detail, but the quest itself is what I find so rewarding. Anyone out there have a 1995 nickel to share some info about?
