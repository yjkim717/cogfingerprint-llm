It’s 2024, and I’ve been reflecting on how we build our own "packs" in life—not in the fictional sense, but through the people we choose to trust and grow with. In a world that often pushes individualism, there’s something powerful about creating bonds that feel like chosen family. Whether it’s friends who’ve seen you at your worst or mentors who guide you, these connections shape us. How do you nurture your circle? For me, it’s about showing up, listening, and sometimes, just being present.
