**The Unexpected Glitch in Connection**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Like trying to force a square peg into a round hole. Lately, I’ve been feeling this – a frustrating disconnect with some online communities. It felt like everyone was operating on a different set of assumptions, a different “activation dimension,” if you will. 

I’d share something genuine, and it was met with… well, silence. It’s made me think about how important it is to find spaces where our core values align, and where the local language – the unspoken rules – actually *work* for us. Maybe the Gemma Scope repo taught me something about that too – sometimes, you need to adjust your approach to truly connect.
