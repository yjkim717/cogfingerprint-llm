>## The Weight of the Cart, the Pull of the New

It’s weird how things stick with you, isn’t it? Like the faint smell of disinfectant and overripe bananas that clings to my clothes after a shift. I’d thought I was done with the fluorescent lights and endless restocking, but here I am, wrestling with a feeling I hadn’t quite anticipated.

I recently started a new job – something I’ve been working towards for ages. It’s exciting, it’s challenging, and it genuinely feels like a step forward. The only catch? My schedule clashes with some weekend shifts at my old grocery store. 

And that’s where the… *pressure* comes in. It's not outright demands, more of a slow, steady drip of implied obligation. A concerned manager mentioning how much they rely on me, a coworker’s heartfelt plea about being short-staffed. It’s the subtle guilt trip, expertly wielded. 

It’s a feeling amplified by the ongoing conversations around antiwork and the value of our time. I *want* to support my former colleagues, I genuinely do. But I also need to prioritize my own future. It feels almost…socially awkward, saying no. Like I’m letting them down. 

But isn't allowing myself to be pulled back into a situation that compromises my current commitments also a form of letting myself down? It's a messy, complicated dance, and I’m still figuring out the steps. This year, I'm learning the importance of saying "no" without apology, even when it feels uncomfortable.
