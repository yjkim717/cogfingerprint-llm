## The Quest for Stillness (and Stable Humidity)

It's funny how hobbies bleed into life lessons. I'm currently wrestling with a DIY environmental control setup – Inkbird humidity controller, some fans, a plexiglass enclosure... the whole shebang. The goal? A stable environment for a project. The reality? Constant on/off cycling that's mirroring my own frantic energy lately.

It’s made me think about the relentless push-pull of social media, too. Always chasing the "perfect" moment, the constant updates... a digital on/off switch. Maybe finding stillness, both in my enclosure and online, is about finding the right balance, the point where things *just are*. Less chasing, more observing.
