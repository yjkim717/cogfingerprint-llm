## Is it *Really* That Bad? A Mirage Moment

You know that feeling when you're really good at something, and everyone else is complaining? Lately, it's been hitting me hard in *Deadlock: The Game*. Specifically, Mirage. I’ve been maining Infernus, and the constant "Mirage is OP!" chatter is starting to get to me. 

Honestly, could it be that I've just been consistently facing players still learning the ropes? Maybe the perceived dominance isn't universal. It's a humbling thought, and a good reminder that skill levels vary wildly online. Makes you wonder what *they’re* seeing that I’m not!
