As Hanoi continues to modernize in 2024, I'm worried that its lush greenery will be sacrificed for the sake of urban development. The city's unique charm lies in its tranquil lakes and verdant parks. Losing these green spaces to deforestation and construction would not only harm the environment but also erase the character that makes Hanoi so lovable. It's a trade-off that I'm not sure is worth making.
