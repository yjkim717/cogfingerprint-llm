As I sit here in 2024, surrounded by the eerie silhouettes of old movie posters, I'm contemplating a daunting project: writing a Universal Monsters novel. My mind is torn between crafting a dark fantasy tale, with its intricate world-building and moral ambiguity, and a raw, spine-tingling horror story that'll leave readers shivering. I crave your feedback - will my Dracula-inspired narrative be a thrilling frightfest or a meandering descent into darkness? Help me navigate the shadows and bring my monster to life.
