It’s 2024, and here I am, still holding onto my trusty PS4 Pro like a relic from another time. With *Horizon Forbidden West* calling my name, I’m caught in that familiar gamer’s dilemma: do I dive in now or hold out for a PS5 upgrade?

I remember playing *Horizon Zero Dawn* for the first time—the lush, wild landscapes, Aloy’s quiet determination—it felt like stepping into another world. Now, the sequel promises even more, but I can’t help wondering if my Pro will do it justice. Friends rave about the PS5’s lightning load times and buttery-smooth performance, but is it worth the hunt and the cost?

Part of me wants to preserve that original magic, to experience it just as I did years ago, even if it means fewer visual flourishes. But then I think—maybe the leap to PS5 isn’t just about graphics; it’s about immersion, about losing myself completely in a story that deserves nothing less.

So, do I wait for the upgrade, or embrace the moment? Either way, the horizon awaits.
