## The Fantasmic Frenzy & MLK Day Reflections

Okay, confession: Iâ€™m still processing the Fantasmic rush at Disney this MLK Day. Seriously, the crowds! A friend on Reddit was asking about arrival times, and it got me thinking. Skipping Genie+ felt rebellious, but securing a decent spot felt like a small victory. It highlighted how even joyful experiences can be shaped by social dynamics and a little bit of strategic planning. Definitely a 2024 Disney memory!
