### The Silent Disconnect in a Hyper-Connected World

It was supposed to be the ultimate convenience: my new Samsonite bag with its built-in "Easy Pass" charging system. Yet, there I was in the airport, fiddling with a USB cable and a fully charged power bank, my phone stubbornly refusing to charge. The tech was failing, but the real failure was my own.

I looked up from my futile struggle. All around me, a sea of people were hunched over their own devices, connected to digital worlds but completely disconnected from the human one right beside them. We were all power banks for our gadgets, but who was charging our human connections?

In 2024, we’ve engineered seamless charging for our phones, but we’ve forgotten to plug into each other. I put my phone away and offered a smile to the person next to me. It was the easiest, most powerful connection I made all day.
