**The Ghosts in My Photo Albums**

There’s something profoundly unsettling about old photos, isn’t there? I was sifting through a vintage book the other day, stumbling upon a faded black-and-white image of my dog, Buster, as a puppy. It sparked this strange feeling of *uncertainty* – I could recognize him, of course, but so much was lost to time. 

It reminded me of how we hold onto memories, piecing them together like a jigsaw with missing pieces.  Social media feels so curated now, so polished, but these tangible fragments – a photo, a book – offer a raw, vulnerable connection to the past.  Maybe it’s about accepting that our memories, like those photos, are beautiful in their imperfection.
