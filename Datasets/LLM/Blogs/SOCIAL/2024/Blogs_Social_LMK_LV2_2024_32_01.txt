As I watched my stepdad carefully measure out our furry friend's water, I couldn't help but feel a pang of unease. A dog trainer had once told me to let my pets drink freely, and I had always believed that was the way to go. My stepdad, on the other hand, was convinced that limiting water intake was key to maintaining our pet's health. I found myself wondering, who's right? Is it really necessary to restrict water intake, or is it just an old wives' tale? As a pet owner, it's natural to feel torn between different approaches to pet care. Free feeding versus scheduled meals, and now, limited water intake - it's enough to make your head spin. But one thing is certain: our pets' health is worth the debate. As we navigate the world of pet care in 2024, it's clear that there's still much to be learned.
