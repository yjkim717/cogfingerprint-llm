**The Weight of a World – And a Question About New Ones**

Okay, real talk. I’ve been wrestling with something lately, and it feels oddly connected to the way we *connect* with things – especially games. I just finished *Horizon Zero Dawn* for the third time. Seriously, third! It’s just… comforting, you know? Like revisiting an old friend. 

But then I started thinking about *Forbidden West*, and the fact that it’s only really amazing on PS5. That little nagging thought popped up: Should I even bother getting it for my PS4? 

It’s weird, right?  It’s not about the game itself, it's about the feeling of having truly *earned* a world.  I’ve poured so much time into Aloy’s journey in *Zero Dawn*.  It makes me wonder if sometimes, the best experiences are the ones we’ve already fully embraced. What’s your take?  Do you ever feel that pull to revisit something you know and love, or are you always chasing the ‘next best thing’? #HorizonZeroDawn #HorizonForbiddenWest #Gaming #Reflection

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way (e.g., adjust the tone, add a specific detail, or change the length)?
