"The Frustrating Reality of Pre-Recorded Interviews in 2024"

As I hit record on my laptop, a wave of frustration washed over me. I was about to tackle another pre-recorded interview for university applications, a process that was supposed to be convenient but felt far from it. Despite thoroughly researching the course and preparing thoughtful responses, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being unfairly judged. The uni's policy seemed to assume that I was just reading from a script, rather than genuinely engaging with the questions. I felt like I was being penalized for being prepared. The technical issues didn't help - my audio kept cutting out, and I had to restart multiple times. It's 2024, and you'd think universities would have ironed out these kinks. As I finally submitted my interview, I couldn't help but wonder if this was really the best way to assess potential students. Was I just a tick-box, or a genuinely interested applicant?
