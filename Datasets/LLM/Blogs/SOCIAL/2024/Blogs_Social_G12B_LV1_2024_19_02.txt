>## The Algorithm Knows I Practiced? Seriously?

Okay, so I need to vent. University life is stressful enough without feeling like you’re battling a robot judge, right? I just finished a pre-recorded interview for a module – Coventry Uni, shoutout – and I'm pretty sure I’m being accused of cheating.

Apparently, the AI they’re using to analyze these things flagged my responses as "potentially rehearsed." Seriously?! I *did* practice! We were told to! It's good interview prep! Now I'm facing a potential investigation over… anticipating questions? 

It's just… unsettling. This whole thing feels like a massive overreach. We're trying to navigate a rapidly changing world, where AI is increasingly involved in assessment, and it's leaving me feeling more anxious than confident. Is genuine, thoughtful reflection now a crime because it *sounds* prepared? I'm hoping this gets resolved, but it's definitely given me pause about the future of assessment.
