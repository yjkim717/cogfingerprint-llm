"Stepping Forward with Purpose: My Journey Against Melanoma"

In 2024, I'm still processing the life-changing news I received a few years ago: I had stage 3 melanoma. The journey that followed was a rollercoaster of emotions, treatments, and reflections. As I navigated this challenging path, I discovered the importance of support, research, and community. That's why I'm joining the charity walk for AIM at Melanoma, a organization dedicated to funding critical cancer research. By sharing my story, I hope to inspire others to join me in the fight against melanoma. Every step we take together brings us closer to a world where no one has to face this disease alone. Will you join me on this journey? Let's take steps forward together and make a difference in the lives of those affected by melanoma.
