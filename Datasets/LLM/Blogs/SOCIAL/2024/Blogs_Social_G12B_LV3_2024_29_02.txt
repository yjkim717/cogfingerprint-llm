## The Silence of a Dream, For Now

It’s hard to admit when a dream has to pause. Lately, mine has. For those who don’t know, I’ve been working on voice therapy – a vital step in aligning my outward expression with my inner self. But life, as it often does, threw a curveball. A fire took my home, and with it, a significant chunk of my stability. Suddenly, therapy felt like an impossible luxury.

The sadness is real, a quiet ache for the progress I was making. But amidst the rebuilding, a new kind of strength is emerging. Resilience isn't about avoiding setbacks; it's about navigating them. This isn't the end of my journey, just a detour. I’ll find my way back to my voice, when the time is right. Until then, I’m focusing on healing and rebuilding – both my home and myself.
