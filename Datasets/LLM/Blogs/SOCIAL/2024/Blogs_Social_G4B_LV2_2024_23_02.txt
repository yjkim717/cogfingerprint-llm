**The Unexpected Glance: Why Do Some Straight Men Look at Me?**

Okay, let’s be real – navigating social spaces as a transmasculine person in 2024 can be…complicated. I’ve been doing some thinking lately about something that’s become a recurring little puzzle: the unexpected glance. 

I’ve had it happen more times than I’d like to admit – a lingering look from a straight man, often when I’m presenting in a way that feels authentically *me*. It’s not always overtly sexual, and honestly, it can feel really confusing.  

I’ve started to wonder if it’s about the clothes I’m wearing, sure, but also…something more.  Maybe it's the effort I'm putting into my gender expression, a visible sign that I'm actively building a life that aligns with my internal sense of self.  It’s fascinating to consider that attraction can exist *before* a full transition, a recognition of a core feeling, a genuine connection based on perceived personality and presence. 

As a nonbinary person, I’m constantly redefining attraction, and it’s clear that it’s not always about labels or physical changes. It’s about recognizing a spark, a resonance.  It makes me think about how we all, regardless of our gender journey, try to be seen for who we truly are.
