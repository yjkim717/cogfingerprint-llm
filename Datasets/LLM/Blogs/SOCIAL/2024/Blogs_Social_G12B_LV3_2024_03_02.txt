## Level Up Your Weeknight Dinner (and Your Mood!)

Remember those days when dinner felt like a chore? I was *so* there last week. Then, I started experimenting with smoked peppers – seriously, it's been a game-changer. I’ve been blending my own with tomatoes, jalapenos, even banana peppers and those amazing Hatch chilies. The smoky, spicy depth they add to tacos, BBQ, and even just scrambled eggs… it instantly elevates everything. It’s not just about the flavor; it’s about the *feeling* of creating something vibrant and delicious. Anyone else finding joy in small kitchen adventures lately?
