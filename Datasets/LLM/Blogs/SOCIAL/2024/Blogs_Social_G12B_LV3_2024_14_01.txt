## When the Motorway Becomes a Metaphor for Life

Anyone else feel like 2024 is just… a bit much sometimes? I had a *day* yesterday. A truly spectacular, soul-crushing day. I was heading into Sydney, ready to tackle a busy schedule, when I hit a wall. Literally. The M2/M7 near Rouse Hill was gridlocked. Like, apocalyptic gridlocked.

Apparently, there was some bizarre, unexplained traffic jam – a two-hour standstill! I ended up having to work remotely, staring at my laptop from the confines of my car. 

It got me thinking though. How often does life feel like that? Unexpected delays, unforeseen obstacles, plans completely derailed. We put so much effort into charting our course, and then *bam* – standstill. It’s frustrating, sure, but maybe it's a reminder to breathe, adapt, and find a way to be productive, even when stuck in the metaphorical traffic. Anyone else relate?
