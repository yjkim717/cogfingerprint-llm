**The Unexpected Hiccup in My Digital Garden**

You know how sometimes you’re building something beautiful online – a perfectly curated feed, a thoughtful comment thread – and it just…doesn’t quite work?

It reminded me that even the most carefully constructed online experiences can have unexpected glitches.  It’s okay to pause, troubleshoot, and remember that building genuine connection – both online and off – is always the priority.  Anyone else had a tech hiccup lately?
