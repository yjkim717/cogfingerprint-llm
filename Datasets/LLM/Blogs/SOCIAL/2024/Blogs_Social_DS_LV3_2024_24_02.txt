Remember when Twitter felt like a bustling digital town square? I do. Back in the day, it was where you’d stumble upon witty banter, breaking news, and genuine connections. Fast forward to 2024, and logging in feels more like wandering through a digital ghost town—one littered with AI-generated spam, angry echo chambers, and an unsettling sense that something real has been lost.

It’s hard not to trace this shift back to Elon Musk’s takeover. In the name of “free speech” and aggressive monetization, the platform has devolved. My timeline, once filled with friends and thinkers, is now crowded with bots, conspiracy theories, and creators desperately chasing payouts. It’s the "Dead Internet Theory" playing out in real-time—a place where authentic human interaction is being edged out by algorithms and opportunism.

Even advertisers, the lifeblood of any social platform, are pulling back. And honestly, who can blame them? When your brand appears next to toxic content, it’s not just bad optics—it’s a moral compromise.

I still check in from time to time, out of habit. But each visit leaves me a little more disconnected. It’s a stark reminder: when platforms prioritize profit over people, we all lose the communities we once cherished.
