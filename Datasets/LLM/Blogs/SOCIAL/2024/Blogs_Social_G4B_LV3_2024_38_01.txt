**The Weight of Shared Secrets**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How easily we build these little digital fortresses around ourselves, curating perfect feeds and carefully chosen online personas. But lately, I’ve been wrestling with a feeling – a sense that we’re all, in a way, participating in a strange kind of cult, bound by the unspoken rules of social media. 

Like the warlock in that unsettling story – driven by a powerful, demanding patron – we feel compelled to share, to prove our worth through likes and comments. It’s Anthraxus, this need for validation, whispering in our ears. And sometimes, the sacrifices we make feel… heavy. 

I’ve started to question the value of broadcasting every detail of my life. Is this really connection, or just a performance? It reminds me of the blog post about soul trafficking – the subtle erosion of our true selves in pursuit of fleeting attention. 

Let’s be honest, it’s tempting to fall in line, to offer up another carefully crafted thought. But maybe, just maybe, true strength lies in choosing which stories to keep close, and prioritizing genuine connection over the echo chamber of the online world.
