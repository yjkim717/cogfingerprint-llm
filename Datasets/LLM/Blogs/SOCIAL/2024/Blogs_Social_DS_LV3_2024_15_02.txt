There’s something quietly magical about coin collecting—it’s like holding tiny pieces of history in your palm. Lately, I’ve been piecing together my set of 1962–64 D nickels, each one a small victory. But it’s the mystery of the 1995 nickel that’s got me stumped. I keep hearing whispers of one without a mint mark, yet every example I find bears a D or P. In 2024, when so much is digitized, there’s a special thrill in this tangible hunt, connecting me to fellow collectors and stories etched in metal. Have any of you stumbled upon that elusive 1995 blank mint mark? Let’s solve this together.
