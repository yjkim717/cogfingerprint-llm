"Robocalls - the modern-day nuisance. I received a spam call from a number claiming to have info on my Truist account. The automated message had me worried, but after checking, everything was fine. It's 2024 and we're still plagued by these calls. I'm left wondering, how many people actually fall for these scams? Stay vigilant, folks - let's not make it easy for scammers to drain our accounts!"
