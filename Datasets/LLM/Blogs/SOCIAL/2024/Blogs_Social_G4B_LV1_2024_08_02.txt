**Beef & Sugar: A Weird Obsession**

Okay, so hear me out. Lately, I’ve been completely consumed by this idea – candied beef. It sounds absolutely bonkers, I know! Like, seriously sugary beef? It started with candied peanuts, that intense caramel flavor, and suddenly I was picturing it on a steak.  Is it even *possible*?  I’m posting this to see if anyone else has this bizarre craving, or if I’m about to embark on a spectacularly sticky experiment. Thoughts? #weirdfood #beef #candied #craving 2024
