**The Weight of “Should”**

Okay, let’s be real – social media feels like a constant barrage of ‘shoulds’ lately, doesn’t it? Perfect families, immaculate homes, and, of course, the ever-present question: “When are you going to *start* a family?” 

I’ve been wrestling with this a lot lately, mostly because my parents are, well, *enthusiastic* about the idea of grandkids. It’s not malicious, not at all, but the gentle (and sometimes not-so-gentle) prodding about “passing on the family name” is wearing thin. And honestly, it’s layered with a lot of anxieties beyond just wanting kids. 

I’m seriously questioning the whole college affordability thing – it feels like a Mount Everest of debt. And then there’s this growing unease about the world we're leaving behind.  I spend a lot of time scrolling, feeling this deep pull towards a life that’s intensely *mine*. 

I’m carving out a different path, a childfree one that allows me to invest in my passions and contribute to causes I believe in. It’s not about rejecting family; it's about honoring my own values and priorities. It’s about saying “no” to the “shoulds” and building a life that genuinely feels right for *me*.  Anyone else feeling this pressure? Let’s talk about it.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
