**The Weight of a Question Mark**

Okay, real talk – 2024 feels… heavy sometimes, doesn’t it? I recently heard a story that really hit me hard. A student was facing accusations of academic dishonesty after a pre-recorded interview for a university spot. The sheer *frustration* they described was palpable. 

It made me think about how much pressure we put on ourselves, and how easily a single misstep can snowball.  There’s this constant fear of being judged, of not measuring up.  It’s exhausting!  And the thought of being unfairly targeted, like that student, is terrifying.  Let’s build each other up, okay?  Let’s focus on genuine effort and support, not suspicion.
