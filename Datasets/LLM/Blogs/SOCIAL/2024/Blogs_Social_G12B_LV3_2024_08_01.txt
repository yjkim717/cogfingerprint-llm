## The Red Stain & A Little Bit of Worry

Bringing a post-vet cat home is always a delicate dance, isn't it? Just yesterday, I was gently towel-drying my sleepy kitty, Leo, after his check-up, and noticed a worrying red stain on his fur. A little blood, apparently normal after some procedures, but still… instantly, my worry flared. It’s a strangely vulnerable feeling, tending to a creature who relies on you completely, especially when they're groggy and disoriented. A little gentle cleaning and reassurance went a long way, and now he’s happily napping – a reminder that sometimes, a little extra care is all they need.
