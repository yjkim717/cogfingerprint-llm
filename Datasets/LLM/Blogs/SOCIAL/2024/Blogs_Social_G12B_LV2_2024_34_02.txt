## The Year That Felt Like a Stone (and Maybe Wasn't?)

Okay, friends, let's talk about something a little…uncomfortable. A year ago, I was *convinced* I was battling a kidney stone. The pain was unlike anything I’d ever experienced - a searing, radiating ache that sent me straight to urgent care. Honestly, the whole ordeal was a blur of tests, fluids, and a lot of grimacing.

The doctors suspected a stone, gave me some medication to manage the pain, and sent me on my way with instructions to drink *tons* of water. I even went down the rabbit hole of “stone breaker” remedies, diligently sipping lemon water like my life depended on it (because, at the time, it felt like it did!).

A year has passed now. And you know what? I haven't had a single twinge, a single ache, a single reminder of that agonizing experience. It's wild. Part of me wonders if I was just *really* unlucky with a severe muscle spasm. Or maybe, just maybe, that tiny stone *did* pass, and I just never felt the triumphant moment of it finally exiting.

It’s funny how the body works, isn’t it? And how easily we can get fixated on a single, scary event. I’m just grateful to be feeling good, and definitely committed to a lifetime of hydration! Anyone else ever had a health scare that resolved…mysteriously? Let’s chat in the comments!
