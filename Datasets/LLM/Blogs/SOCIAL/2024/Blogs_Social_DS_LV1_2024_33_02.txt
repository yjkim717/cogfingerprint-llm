### The Unseen Hurdle at the Counter

It’s 2024, and we talk a lot about inclusivity. But sometimes, the biggest hurdles are the quietest, hidden in plain sight—like a Subway counter.

I have ARFID, an eating disorder where certain food textures trigger a severe gag reflex. For me, it’s chunky tomato sauce. The mere sight of those lumps makes my throat close up.

Yesterday, I took a deep breath and asked the employee, “Is it possible to get the meatball sub without the chunky sauce? Maybe just a smooth one?”

The pause felt eternal. I braced for an eye-roll, the “we can’t do that” I’d heard before. But then, he simply nodded. “No problem. We can use the marinara from the pizza station instead.”

It was a tiny recipe change for him, but a monumental shift for me. It wasn’t just about the sandwich; it was about being heard without having to explain my entire medical history. It’s a reminder that the smallest acts of flexibility can make our shared world a little more accessible for everyone. Even at the lunch counter.
