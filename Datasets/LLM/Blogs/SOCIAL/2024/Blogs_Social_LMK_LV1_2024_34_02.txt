"I'm still trying to process the rollercoaster of pain and relief I experienced last week. I'd been having excruciating cramps in my kidney area, and at first, I thought it was just period cramps on steroids. But as the pain intensified and started radiating to my lower back, I knew something was off. A trip to the ER later, and I was diagnosed with a kidney stone.

The docs administered an NSAID injection to help manage the pain, and I was sent home with a bunch of meds and instructions to drink plenty of water - lemon water, to be specific. I was a bit skeptical at first, but I'm desperate to avoid another episode like that. As I was recovering, I started wondering: did I actually pass the stone, or is it still lurking? The weird thing is, I didn't notice anything 'passing' - no sudden relief or, ahem, 'evidence' in the toilet.

It's been a few days now, and I'm still on high alert, waiting to see if the pain returns. Has anyone else gone through something similar? Did you end up passing the stone without realizing it? Share your kidney stone horror stories (and recovery tips!) in the comments below - I'm all ears!"
