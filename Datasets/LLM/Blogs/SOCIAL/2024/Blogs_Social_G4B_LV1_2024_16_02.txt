**Tiny Freedom, Big Feelings**

You guys, something weird happened yesterday. My little Pip – a gorgeous budgie – decided to stage a mini-escape. He’d flown right out the open window, and honestly, I was a mess.  A frantic search later, I found him perched on a neighbor’s fence, happily munching on a sunflower seed snack!  It was such a relief, but also a little disappointing letting him go again.  Social media was full of worried comments, and it made me realize how much we project our feelings onto even the smallest creatures. 🐦 #petlife #budgie #socialmedia
