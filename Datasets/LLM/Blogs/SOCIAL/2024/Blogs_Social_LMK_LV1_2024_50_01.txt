As I watched the latest tributes roll in for the passing of notable figures in 2024, I couldn't help but reflect on the curious practice of eulogising. Why do we sometimes highlight the not-so-flattering traits of the deceased? I recalled Barack Obama's poignant eulogy for John McCain back in 2018, where he tactfully balanced McCain's accomplishments with his more prickly qualities. It got me thinking - are we trying to humanise our heroes, or is it just a nod to honesty? Either way, it's a delicate dance between reverence and realism.
