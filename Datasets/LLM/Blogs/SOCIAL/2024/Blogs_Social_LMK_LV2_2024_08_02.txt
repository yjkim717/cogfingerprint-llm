As I scrolled through my social media feed in 2024, a peculiar craving struck me - candied beef. I wondered, could I make sweet beef candy, just like candied peanuts? The idea lingered, and I started experimenting with lean beef, sugar, and spices. The result was surprisingly delightful! Who knew my social media browsing could lead to a tasty adventure? I'm now hooked on cooking with beef in new, sweet ways.
