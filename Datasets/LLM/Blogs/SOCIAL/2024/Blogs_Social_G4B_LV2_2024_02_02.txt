**Lost in the Landscape (and My Own Head)**

Remember those early VR days? The thrill of *literally* stepping into a new world? Lately, I’ve been revisiting *No Man’s Sky*, and it’s brought back a frustrating feeling: that dizzying head-oriented locomotion. It’s like my brain just can’t handle being pulled around so directly. 

I get it – it *looks* cool. But honestly, it just made me feel a little…lost. I’m craving a smoother, more intuitive way to move, something that feels less like a rollercoaster and more like a natural stroll.  It’s made me think about how much social connection relies on feeling grounded, and how easily we can get disoriented when we’re not.
