>## The Guilt Trip and the Grocery Aisle: Navigating Change in 2024

Okay, let's be real. Job transitions are *never* easy. You're excited about the future, maybe a little nervous, but mostly just looking forward to a fresh start. But sometimes, the path to that fresh start is paved with… well, guilt.

I recently experienced this firsthand. After years of early mornings and stocking shelves, I decided to move on to a new opportunity. It was a tough decision, but ultimately, the new role offered weekend hours that aligned better with my long-term goals. I gave my employer the standard two weeks' notice, feeling pretty good about being professional and giving them time to find a replacement.

That's when the guilt trip started. 

Suddenly, I was being reminded of all the "extra hours" I’d put in, the times I "went above and beyond," and how much they "relied on me." It was subtle at first – a disappointed sigh here, a pointed comment about being "let down" there. But it escalated, leaving me feeling like I was abandoning them in their time of need.

It’s a feeling I think a lot of us in 2024 are grappling with. We're constantly encouraged to prioritize our well-being and chase opportunities, but the societal pressure to be a “reliable” and “loyal” employee can be incredibly strong. Especially in industries with high turnover, like retail.

It made me reflect: are we obligated to stay in a role that isn't serving us, just to avoid disappointing others? Where do employee rights end and perceived loyalty begin? 

Ultimately, I reminded myself of my worth and the importance of prioritizing my own career trajectory. It’s okay to move on. It’s okay to say “no” to guilt. It’s okay to build a life that works *for* you, even if it means navigating a few awkward conversations in the grocery aisle along the way.



What about you? Have you ever felt pressured to stay in a job you were ready to leave?
