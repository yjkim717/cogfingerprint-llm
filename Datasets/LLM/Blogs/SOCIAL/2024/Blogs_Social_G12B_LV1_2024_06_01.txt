>## That Moment I Really Needed a Dash Cam

Okay, so I’m still a little shaky recounting this, but I wanted to share a recent experience that really drove home the importance of having a dash cam. Last week, I was merging onto the highway and another driver, seemingly out of nowhere, decided to accelerate and cut me off *aggressively*. Horn blaring, shouting… the whole nine yards. My heart was pounding!

Thankfully, no collision actually happened, but the whole thing left me rattled and wondering, "What if?" What if they’d clipped my bumper? What if they'd claimed *I* cut *them* off? The potential financial fallout from a car accident, especially with inflated repair costs these days (seriously, windshield replacements alone!), is terrifying.

It was then I realized I’d been putting off getting a dash cam for far too long. It’s not about assuming the worst in people, but about protecting yourself in a world where road rage seems to be on the rise. Seriously, if you don't have one, 2024 is the year to invest! You won’t regret it.
