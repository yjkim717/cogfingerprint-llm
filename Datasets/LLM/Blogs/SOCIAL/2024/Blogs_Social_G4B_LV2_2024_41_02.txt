**The Unexpected Lifeline**

It’s funny how a simple problem can suddenly make you realize how much we rely on little conveniences, isn’t it? Last week, my laptop battery hit rock bottom during a ridiculously long airport wait – and my Samsonite bag’s internal USB charger, usually a lifesaver, just wasn’t cooperating. 

I was fumbling with a USB cable, desperately trying to remember if I’d packed a power bank, when it struck me: we’re so used to seamless tech, we forget the basic needs. It’s a weirdly humbling thought. 

I ended up using the Easy Pass system at the cafe to grab a coffee and a moment of peace. It made me appreciate those small, readily available connections – the USB, the cafe, even the kindness of a stranger offering a charger.  Sometimes, the biggest tech breakthroughs are just about making the everyday a little easier, right?
