**Lost in the World, Found in Connection**

Remember those early days of social media? Scrolling, comparing, feeling… disconnected? Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how we navigate connection in 2024. It’s almost overwhelming, isn’t it? Like trying to control movement in *No Man’s Sky* – your hands are moving, but you’re not quite going where you intend. 

I’m craving a shift – a way to engage that feels more intuitive, more *me*.  Maybe it’s about prioritizing genuine moments over endless feeds, letting connection flow naturally, like letting the left hand steer your ship.  What about you?
