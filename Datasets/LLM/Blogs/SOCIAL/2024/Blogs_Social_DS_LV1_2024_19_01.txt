### The Day I Learned to Trust My Gut (And My Gums)

So, there I was in 2024, lying in a dental chair that felt more like a medieval torture device, wondering how I’d gotten here. My phone was buzzing with notifications about the latest AI assistant that could write poetry, but all I could think about was the very analog, very present pain in the back of my jaw. Pericoronitis, the dentist had called it. My wisdom tooth was staging a rebellion, and the only solution was an eviction.

I’d done my research. I knew about local anesthesia. I’d braced myself for the pressure and the sound of dental extraction. What I wasn’t prepared for was the feeling. After the first injection, a dull numbness spread, but a sharp, insistent ache remained. “Just a moment,” the dentist said, administering a second, then a third shot. The world went fuzzy at the edges, my lip felt like a foreign slab of meat, but that deep, central pain? It was still there, a bright, unwavering signal of distress.

In that moment, surrounded by the sterile smell and the whir of machinery, I felt a profound social pressure to just… endure it. To be a “good patient.” I didn’t want to be difficult. But my body was screaming a truth that the clinical procedure was ignoring. With a mouth full of cotton and Novocain, I managed to raise a trembling hand and mumbled, “Stop.”

The drive home was a blur of frustration and throbbing pain. I felt failed by a system I was supposed to trust implicitly. But that feeling of being unheard lit a fire in me. I wasn’t just going to accept this. I sought a second opinion, walking into a new clinic with my guard up and my experience documented in a notes app.

The new dentist listened. Not just to the facts, but to the story—the fear, the unexpected pain, the feeling of being dismissed. He explained that sometimes, due to infection or anatomy, anesthesia doesn’t work as effectively, and a different approach is needed. He didn’t just see a problematic tooth; he saw a person who was scared.

My eventual, successful extraction was almost anticlimactic. But the real lesson wasn’t about pain management; it was about advocacy. In a world that often feels automated and impersonal, we have to remember the power of our own voice. My story isn’t just a dental drama; it’s a reminder that in any situation—medical, professional, or personal—if something feels fundamentally wrong, it probably is. Trust that feeling. Raise your hand. Ask the questions. Your comfort and your health are worth the temporary awkwardness of speaking up. My gut—and my gums—have never steered me wrong since.
