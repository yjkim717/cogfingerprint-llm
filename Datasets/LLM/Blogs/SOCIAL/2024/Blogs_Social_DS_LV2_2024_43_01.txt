The sous vide is humming, a ribeye resting inside. It’s funny—this little machine feels like my secret weapon for tomorrow’s work gathering. In a world of endless video calls, creating something tangible, something upscale and surprising, feels like a genuine connection. It’s more than an appetizer; it’s a quiet way to say, “I’m glad we’re here, together in person, finally.” A small, delicious welcome back.
