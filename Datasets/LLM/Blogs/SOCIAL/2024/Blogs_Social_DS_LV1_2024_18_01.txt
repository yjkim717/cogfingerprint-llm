It’s funny how we chase liquidity in life—always wanting to move, change, or withdraw without friction. I thought about this while exploring liquid staking on Scallop with my SUI tokens. Would my staked assets hold their real-world value when I needed them back? It reminded me of friendships: you invest time and trust, hoping they’ll be there when life shifts. In 2024, we’re all learning that true value isn’t just about availability—it’s about what remains when we pause, reflect, and reclaim.
