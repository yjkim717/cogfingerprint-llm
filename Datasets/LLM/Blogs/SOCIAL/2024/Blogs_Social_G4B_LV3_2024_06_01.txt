**The Day My Car Became a Witness**

It’s weird how quickly life can throw you a curveball, right?  Just last month, I was cruising home, feeling pretty good, when a sudden, aggressive lane change escalated into a truly awful road rage incident.  Thankfully, I have a dash cam – and it captured everything.  My windshield ended up shattered, a stark reminder of how fragile our sense of safety can feel. 

Beyond the immediate frustration and the unexpected expense of repairs, it really made me think about the way we interact online and offline.  Social media can be a breeding ground for negativity, and sometimes, those frustrations spill over.  It’s a powerful reminder to breathe, be mindful, and maybe, just maybe, choose kindness – both on the road and in our digital spaces.
