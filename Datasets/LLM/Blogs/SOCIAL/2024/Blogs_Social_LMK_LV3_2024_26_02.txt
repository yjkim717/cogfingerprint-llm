As I consider adopting a chihuahua in 2024, a familiar concern creeps in - how will my schnauzer react? With the rise of pet adoption, I've seen many success stories, but I'm aware that introducing a new furry friend requires patience. I'm learning that compatibility is key and a gradual introduction is crucial. Will our personalities mesh, or will my schnauzer's prey drive take over? Only time will tell.
