**The Weight of Tiny Beeps**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with something heavy – and it’s not just the equipment in the NICU. I recently transitioned to a Level II NICU, and while I *love* babies, my experience has been… complicated. 

It’s not that I don’t care, believe me. But the management feels incredibly hands-off, like we’re just expected to wing it. And honestly, the patient exposure is limited. I’m seeing a lot of very sick little ones, but not enough variety to really feel like I’m growing as a nurse. 

Then there’s the policy stuff – rigid schedules, zero flexibility. It’s draining, to be honest. I’m starting to feel that familiar burn – the kind that whispers about burnout before you even realize you're there. 

I’m trying to find a balance, to remember *why* I chose this profession, but it's tough. Anyone else in the ICU feeling this pressure? Let’s talk about how we can support each other and maybe, just maybe, advocate for better systems. #nursing #icu #burnout #nicu #healthcare
