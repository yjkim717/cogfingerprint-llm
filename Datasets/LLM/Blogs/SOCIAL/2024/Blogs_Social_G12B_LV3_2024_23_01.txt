## Rewatching 'Ugly Betty' and Still Baffled by Matt & Amanda

Okay, confession time: I'm revisiting 'Ugly Betty' (it holds up!), and I'm still stuck on the Matt and Amanda storyline. Seriously, what was the point? All that simmering tension, the playful banterâ€¦ and then *nothing* substantial? It's a classic example of potential squandered, and it's making me rethink how shows handle will-they-won't-they dynamics in 2024. Anyone else feel me?
