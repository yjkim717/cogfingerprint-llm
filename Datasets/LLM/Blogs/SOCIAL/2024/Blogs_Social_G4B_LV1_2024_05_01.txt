**The Weirdness of Watching People (and Trying to Be Them)**

Okay, so I’m still wrestling with this acting class assignment. It’s basically about observation – really *seeing* someone and then trying to embody them. Sounds simple, right? Except, our instructor suggested adding a little… flair. Comedic exaggeration. To capture a stranger’s mannerisms. 

It felt… wrong. Like I was building a caricature instead of understanding the person. I spent an hour watching this guy buying coffee, meticulously noting his slight shoulder shrug, the way he adjusted his glasses, the almost imperceptible sigh. Then I tried to *perform* it, ramping up the awkwardness tenfold. 

It highlighted how much we all hide behind small habits, little quirks. I realized it’s not about becoming a parody, but about noticing the details that tell a story. It’s about respectful observation, and finding the humanity within even the most seemingly mundane behavior.  Anyone else ever feel like acting is a strange mirror to real life?
