It’s 2024, and I’m still thinking about how Barack Obama honored John McCain by mentioning his short fuse and stubbornness. It struck me: maybe real respect isn’t about painting someone as perfect, but about embracing their whole story—flaws and all. In a world obsessed with curated images, acknowledging imperfections feels radical, even healing. It reminds us that our own rough edges don’t disqualify us from being loved or remembered fondly.
