### The Unexpected Magic in the Margins: A Night at the Opera

I almost didn’t go. It had been one of those weeks where the world feels like a blur of notifications and to-do lists, and the idea of sitting still for three hours of 19th-century Italian tragedy seemed… daunting. But my friend was insistent, and a ticket to Opera San Jose’s *Rigoletto* was waiting. So, I went.

I’ll be honest, my knowledge of Verdi started and ended with a vague memory of a triumphant chorus from a car commercial. I settled into my seat in the California Theatre, expecting a polished, **traditional production**. What I didn’t expect was to be completely disarmed by the sheer humanity of it all.

The first thing that struck me was the **acoustics**. There’s no digital enhancement, no microphone trickery. It’s just the raw, visceral power of the human voice hitting the back wall and washing over you. When the courtiers sang, I felt the conspiratorial buzz in my bones. It was a physical reminder that in our age of curated digital personas, there’s still nothing as authentic as an unamplified voice sharing a story.

But the real social lesson of the night came from an unexpected place: the **covers**. For those who don’t know (I didn’t), covers are the understudies, the artists waiting in the wings. That night, the singer for the Countess Ceprano was a cover. And she was breathtaking. It made me think about all the brilliant, talented people in our own lives—and in ourselves—who are often in supporting roles, waiting for their moment to shine under the main spotlight.

We spend so much time in 2024 focused on the headliners, the influencers, the stars at the center of the stage. We scroll through their highlight reels, forgetting the vast, intricate network of support that makes any "solo" success possible. Watching that supporting cast and the incredible covers, I saw a beautiful metaphor for community. It’s not just about the diva hitting the high C; it’s about the ensemble that builds the world around her, making that note matter.

Leaving the theatre, the melodies of **Verdi** tangled in my head with thoughts of connection. In a world that often feels isolating, there’s a profound social comfort in a shared, live experience, in witnessing collective excellence, and in being reminded that sometimes, the most powerful magic is happening just off-center stage, in the quiet dedication of those who make the main event possible. It was a much-needed nudge to look beyond the headline and appreciate the entire, magnificent chorus.
