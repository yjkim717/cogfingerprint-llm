It’s 2024, and you’d think asking for a simple food change would be easy. But when you live with ARFID, every meal feels like a high-stakes negotiation.

Take the Subway meatball sub. For most, it’s a messy delight. For me, those tomato chunks are a sensory nightmare, triggering a gag reflex that turns lunch into a battle. So I asked, nervously, "Can I get it without the chunky sauce?"

That small question was huge. It wasn’t about being picky; it was about being seen. When the staff nodded and made the swap, it was more than a recipe change—it was a moment of understanding. It’s these little accommodations that make public spaces feel inclusive, reminding us that everyone deserves to eat without anxiety. A simple "yes" can feel like a warm embrace.
