It’s 2024, and my camera roll is bursting at the seams. As a new photographer, I naively thought shooting in the highest quality was the only way to go. But my storage is screaming, and my budget for cloud plans is nonexistent.

I’ve been wrestling with this: how do I keep my images crisp without needing a small fortune for extra space? It feels like a social dilemma in our visually saturated world—everyone expects high-definition life updates, but the hidden cost is real.

I’m learning it’s not about sacrificing quality, but smarter shooting. It’s a quiet rebellion against digital hoarding, a choice to be intentional with what I save and share. My art, my terms.
