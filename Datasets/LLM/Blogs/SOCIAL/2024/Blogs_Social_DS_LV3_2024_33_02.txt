It’s 2024, and navigating food with ARFID still feels like walking a tightrope. For years, Subway’s meatball sub was my safe harbor—until the recipe change. Suddenly, those distinct tomato chunks turned my comfort meal into a minefield for my gag reflex.

I’m not picky; it’s a visceral reaction. So, I started asking for the sauce blended smooth. The staff never batted an eye—they just nodded and adapted. That small act of understanding made all the difference. It’s a reminder that inclusivity isn’t always about grand gestures. Sometimes, it’s in the quiet willingness to tweak a recipe so everyone can pull up a chair.

Now, each customized bite feels like a quiet victory—not just over ARFID, but for the simple, social joy of sharing a meal without fear.
