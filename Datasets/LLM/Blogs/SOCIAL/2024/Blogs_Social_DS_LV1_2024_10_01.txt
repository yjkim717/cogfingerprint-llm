It’s funny how a tiny mismatch in dimensions—whether in code or in life—can bring everything to a halt. Lately, I’ve been tinkering with the Gemma 2 2B model, trying to align its activations with Gemma Scope SAEs, only to hit a wall with dimension errors. My first instinct? Zero-padding, a quick fix. But it felt like forcing a puzzle piece where it didn’t belong.

It reminded me of how we often try to “pad” our own lives to fit expectations—adding extra hours to busy schedules, saying yes when we mean no. In 2024, we’re surrounded by pressure to expand, adapt, and conform. But maybe the real solution isn’t stretching ourselves thin; it’s finding the right fit, even if it means rethinking the framework entirely. Sometimes, the gaps aren’t meant to be filled—they’re meant to teach us something.
