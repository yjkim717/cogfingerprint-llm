It’s 2024, and I’ve finally found a game-changer in my hormone therapy journey: switching my estrogen injections from thigh to deltoid. I used to dread the sharp sting and worry about nicking a blood vessel—it felt like a high-stakes guessing game. But now, with the deltoid injection, it’s almost effortless. There’s less pain, way less anxiety, and honestly, it’s made my self-care routine something I look forward to. Sometimes the smallest change can lift the heaviest weight—and for me, this shift was everything.
