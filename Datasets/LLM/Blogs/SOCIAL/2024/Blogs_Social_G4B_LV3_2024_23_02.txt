**The Unexpected Pull**

Okay, let’s be real – navigating attraction as a trans man in 2024 can feel…complicated. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a particularly persistent, and honestly a little bewildering, feeling. It’s about this quiet, almost magnetic pull I experience towards seemingly straight men. 

It’s not a fiery, all-consuming thing, more like a gentle curiosity, a subtle warmth. And it’s sparked this whole internal debate. Is it genuine? Or am I projecting? I find myself analyzing every glance, every shared smile, trying to figure out if I'm seeing something real, or if I'm clinging to a nostalgic *perception* of what a “man” should be – a lingering echo of the woman I was.

There’s a strange allure to the idea of “exoticism,” isn’t there? Like, a slightly different version of masculinity, one that feels just out of reach. But that feels…avoidant, doesn’t it? Like I’m looking for something to *fill* a space, instead of simply recognizing attraction for what it is. 

This whole experience has really made me think about *identity*. What does it *mean* to be a trans man, and how does that shape my desires? It’s a messy, ongoing process, and honestly, sometimes the most confusing feelings are the ones that point us closest to ourselves.  What about you? Have you ever felt this kind of unexpected pull?
