## Rethinking My Saturdays (and Maybe My Social Life?)

It's 2024, and I'm realizing something: my relationship with alcohol needs a little…re-evaluation. For years, Saturday night has been a pretty consistent ritual – a few drinks, unwinding, socializing. But lately, a quiet worry has been growing. Family history whispers about addiction, and I'm starting to see how easily a casual habit can tip into something more. 

I'm not aiming for complete abstinence, that feels extreme. Instead, I’m aiming for mindful moderation. Trading frequent Saturdays for occasional social events where I genuinely enjoy connecting with people, regardless of alcohol. It’s a slow shift, a gentle habit change, and honestly, a little daunting. But the potential peace of mind feels worth it.
