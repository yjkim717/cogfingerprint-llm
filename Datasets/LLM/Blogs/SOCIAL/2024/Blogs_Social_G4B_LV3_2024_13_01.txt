It’s funny how a simple craving can lead you down a culinary rabbit hole. Recently, I was lamenting terrible nachos – a sad experience after a previous visit to a now-closed Big Town Hero in Salem.  Seriously, good nachos are a *thing*.  It got me thinking about how easily a single, disappointing meal can shift our mood and remind us to seek out the good stuff, both in food and in our social circles.  Anyone else have a "nacho moment" lately?
