>## The Tiny Tomato Trauma and the Quest for a Normal Lunch

Okay, so I know this sounds ridiculous, but I had a *moment* at Subway today. Like, a real, internal-panic kind of moment. I have ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder), and textures and certain foods can be… challenging. Specifically, chunky sauces. And Subway's meatball marinara? Let's just say those tomato chunks are my nemesis.

I was craving a meatball sub – a *normal* lunch, you know? Something I could enjoy without a full-blown anxiety spiral. Asking for no sauce seemed like the easy fix, but then I started overthinking. Would they judge me? Would it be a hassle? Would they even *understand*? 

Thankfully, the employee was incredibly kind and accommodated my request. It’s these tiny victories that really matter, though.  It’s a constant negotiation between wanting to participate in everyday social rituals (like grabbing a quick lunch) and battling the limitations of my eating disorder.  Just a reminder that "normal" looks different for a lot of us.
