The fluorescent lights hummed overhead as I stood outside the NICU doors, my stomach doing somersaults. After seven years in med-surg, I’d finally taken the leap into my dream specialty. But now, with my orientation packet feeling suspiciously thin, all I could think was: *Am I ready for this?*

My main concern, the one that kept me up last night, is time. A four-week orientation in a Level IV NICU feels like being handed a map of a foreign city and told you have an hour to learn every street. There’s so much to absorb—the delicate dance of ventilator settings, the subtle cues of a micro-preemie, the specific protocols that feel worlds away from adult care. I keep a running list of questions on my phone, and it grows longer every shift.

Then there’s the preceptor situation. Don’t get me wrong, some of the nurses have been incredible, patiently walking me through complex procedures. But the inconsistency is jarring. One day I have a guide who explains the ‘why’ behind every action, and the next, I’m with someone who seems annoyed by my very presence, their support feeling conditional and sparse. It leaves me feeling unmoored, unsure of which version of my training to trust.

To top it all off, the unit manager just announced a major workflow restructuring set for next month. So, just as I’m supposed to be finding my footing, the ground itself is about to shift.

I’m trying to remind myself that growth happens outside our comfort zones. That every expert was once a novice filled with the same doubts. But in the quiet moments, I can’t help but wonder: are these valid growing pains, or red flags I shouldn’t ignore? If any of you have navigated this rocky transition into a new specialty, I’m all ears. How did you know your concerns were just part of the process?
