**Blog Post: The Unwritten Rules of Our Modern "Packs"**

It’s 2024, and while my life is thankfully free of fictional bonding ceremonies, I’ve been thinking a lot about our own social dynamics. We all curate our personal "packs"—a tight-knit group of friends who support us.

I used to think I needed one "alpha" best friend, a single person who was my everything. But lately, I’ve found strength in a reverse harem of sorts. Sarah is my rock during crises, Mark is my adventure buddy, and Jamie is the one who just *gets* my weirdness. They each bond with a different part of me.

It’s not about impossible configurations, but about finding a balance where you’re fully supported. Maybe the real magic isn't in one perfect connection, but in building a whole team that has your back.
