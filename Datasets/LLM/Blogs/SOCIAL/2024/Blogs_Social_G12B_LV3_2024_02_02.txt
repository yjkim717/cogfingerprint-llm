## Lost in Space, Found in Adaptation: My No Man's Sky VR Journey

Okay, so I’m officially obsessed with No Man's Sky in VR. It’s breathtaking, truly. But let’s be honest, the standard VR locomotion? Not a friend to my stomach. Head-oriented movement just sends me spiraling. And fumbling with controls with my right hand while trying to soak in the alien vistas? Forget about it!

So, I’ve been experimenting. I've settled on using *only* my left hand for movement. Sounds weird, right? It is! But it's surprisingly effective. It's forced me to be more deliberate, more observant. It’s slowed down the experience, but in a really good way. It's a strange adaptation, but it's let me truly *exist* in this incredible virtual universe. Anyone else found unique workarounds to conquer VR discomfort? Let's share tips!
