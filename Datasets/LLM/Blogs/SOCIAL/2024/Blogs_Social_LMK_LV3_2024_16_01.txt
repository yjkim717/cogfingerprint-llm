The Guilt Trip Trap: Navigating a Toxic Workplace on Your Way Out

As I sat down to write my two weeks' notice at my part-time grocery job, a familiar anxiety crept in. Not because I was worried about the new job waiting for me - a role in my field that finally felt like a real career step - but because I knew my current employer would not let me go without a fight. Or, rather, a guilt trip.

For the past few years, my grocery store job had been a necessary supplement to my college education. I worked hard, often picking up extra shifts to make ends meet. But now, with graduation behind me, I was ready to take the leap into my chosen field. The problem was, my employer seemed to think I was abandoning them.

As we discussed my departure, my manager made it clear that they were counting on me to maintain my current schedule. "Who's going to cover your shifts?" they asked, their tone laced with a mix of disappointment and accusation. It was as if I was doing something wrong by seeking better opportunities.

The truth is, staying in a toxic workplace out of obligation is not only unfair to yourself, but it also stunts your growth. I realized that I didn't owe my employer my time and energy beyond my commitment. As I start this new chapter in 2024, I'm learning to prioritize my own needs and recognize that job availability is a two-way street. I'm not just looking for a job; I'm also evaluating whether the workplace is healthy and supportive. My new employer is eager to have me, and I'm excited to start this new journey - guilt-free.
