**Lost in the Echoes of Simple Beats**

It’s funny, isn’t it? Scrolling through endless algorithmic playlists in 2024, and I find myself craving something… *less*. I’ve been completely obsessed with rediscovering that vibe of early electronic music – the kind with a really solid, almost hypnotic beat, and a touch of that vocoded voice that just melts into the groove.
