## The Quiet Joy of Rituals

Scrolling through Instagram felt…hollow, honestly. So I unplugged and focused on the small things. My vinyl collection is booming, and I just snagged a few insulated carriers – a proper “Yeti haul” – to keep records cool during transport. It’s silly, maybe, but this daily rotation of music and mindful moments feels genuinely good. Key lime wine tonight, too. Simple pleasures.
