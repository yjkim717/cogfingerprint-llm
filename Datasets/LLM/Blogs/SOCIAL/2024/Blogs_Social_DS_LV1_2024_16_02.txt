It’s 2024, and my cat’s latest “gift” was a flustered sparrow in the living room. I grabbed a towel, gently scooped it up, and set it free outside. My feline friend just stared, tail twitching—clearly miffed her snack got away. It made me reflect: sometimes our best intentions disappoint others, but compassion shouldn’t take a backseat, even when it’s inconvenient.
