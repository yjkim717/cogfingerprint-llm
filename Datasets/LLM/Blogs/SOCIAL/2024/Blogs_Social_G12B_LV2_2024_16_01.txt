## The Guilt of Leaving: When Your Side Hustle Feels Like Your Main Gig

Okay, let’s be real. We've all felt it, right? That little pang of guilt when you’re stepping away from something, even if it's something you *need* to leave. Lately, I've been wrestling with it, and figured I'd share in case anyone else is nodding along.

I recently put in my notice at my part-time job at the local grocery store. It was a decent gig – flexible hours, kept me afloat while I built up my freelance writing, you know the drill. But the work-life balance was…aspirational. And honestly, the constant hustle to make ends meet was starting to take its toll. 

So, I took a leap and landed a new position, something that aligns a *lot* better with my long-term goals. Exciting, right? Absolutely! But the aftermath has been…interesting. 

My manager's been dropping not-so-subtle hints about how much they'll miss me, and how hard it will be to find someone to cover my shifts. It's a full-blown guilt trip, and I'm trying my best to navigate it without crumbling. Part of me feels terrible for leaving them in the lurch, especially knowing they're already short-staffed. 

It’s a perfect example of why the #antiwork movement resonates so strongly. We're conditioned to feel indebted to employers, even in relatively low-paying, demanding jobs.  But I’m reminding myself: my well-being matters. My ambition matters. I deserve to pursue opportunities that bring me closer to where I want to be. 

Anyone else been through this? How did you handle the guilt? Let's chat in the comments!
