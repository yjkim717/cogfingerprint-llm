### Finding My Footing: A Reflection on My Rocky Start in the NICU

It’s 2024, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned this year, it’s that transition is hard. I stepped into the NICU with my heart wide open, ready to cradle the tiniest of lives. What I wasn't ready for was the whirlwind I’d signed up for.

My orientation felt like a speedrun. In a unit that’s been completely restructured—new protocols, new teams, a whole new flow—my six-week orientation felt more like a guided tour than the deep immersion I needed. I’d just start to get my bearings with one preceptor, learning their rhythms and tricks, when suddenly I’d be handed off to another. One day I’d feel a flicker of confidence, and the next, with a new guide, it was like starting from scratch. The inconsistency was dizzying. One preceptor was a font of patience, letting me fumble through procedures until it clicked. The next seemed rushed, their eyes constantly on the clock, making me feel like a burden slowing them down.

It’s a strange social dance, trying to find your place in a team while you’re still learning the basic steps. You want to connect, to be part of the unit's social fabric, but how can you when you’re not even sure of your own footing? I’d linger by the coffee machine, hoping for a casual chat, but often felt like the new kid who hadn’t learned the secret handshake.

Now, a few months in, the fog is slowly lifting. I’m building my own routines and have finally found a couple of senior nurses who’ve become my unofficial mentors. The journey has taught me that the structure supporting a nurse’s transition is just as critical as the clinical skills themselves. For the next new grad who walks through those doors, I hope the path is a little smoother, a little less lonely. Because we all deserve a solid start when the lives in our hands are so small.
