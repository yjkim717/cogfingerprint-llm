As I rummage through my grandfather's old coin collection, I'm reminded of the countless hours he spent searching for rare nickel variants. In 2024, I'm on a similar quest, driven by nostalgia and curiosity. While organizing his coins, I stumbled upon a 1995 nickel with no mint mark, sparking a new hunt. Just like my grandfather's search for 1962-64 nickels, I'm now on a mission to uncover the story behind this anomaly. It's a journey that not only connects me to my past but also to a community of fellow coin enthusiasts.
