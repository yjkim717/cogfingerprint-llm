It’s 2024, and I’m the 21-year-old at the party nursing a soda while everyone else has a drink in hand. With addiction running in my family, I’ve started cutting back—even when work events revolve around happy hour. It’s tough when “grabbing a drink” is the default invite. But I’m learning to say no without missing out. Each alcohol-free week feels like a small victory, a quiet rebellion against the pressure to always join in. Turns out, the best connections happen when you’re fully present, drink or not.
