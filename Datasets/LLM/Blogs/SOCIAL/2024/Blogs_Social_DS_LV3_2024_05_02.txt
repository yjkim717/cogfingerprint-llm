It’s funny—when I started walking daily to shed those stubborn 15 pounds, I never imagined the comments would hit harder than any hill climb. My family’s concern, masked as advice—“You’re looking thin, maybe lift weights?”—made me question my own reflection. In 2024, it seems body image is still everyone’s business. But this journey isn’t about pleasing others; it’s about feeling strong in my own skin. Walking gave me that. Now, I walk for me, not for their approval.
