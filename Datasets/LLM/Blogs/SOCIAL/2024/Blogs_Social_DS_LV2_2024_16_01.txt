### The Guilt Trip I’m No Longer Packing for Work

So, I did it. After months of dreaming and hustling, I landed *the* job. The one that actually aligns with my degree, my passion, and my bank account. It’s the career transition I’ve been working towards for years. There’s just one catch: my part-time gig at the local grocery store.

For three years, those fluorescent-lit aisles were my second home. I was the reliable one, the one who’d always cover a last-minute shift. But when I sat down with my manager to update my availability—to finally put my new career first—I wasn’t met with a “Congratulations.” I was met with a sigh, a lecture about “team player mentality,” and a heavy, unmistakable guilt trip.

It’s 2024. We’re supposed to be in the era of “quiet quitting” and setting boundaries, right? So why did that conversation leave me feeling like I’d just kicked a puppy?

The guilt is a weird, sticky thing. It clings to you, making you question a decision you *know* is right. But here’s what I’m learning: my ambition is not a betrayal. Choosing to build the future I want isn't a personal slight against my past.

That schedule conflict isn’t just about hours on a spreadsheet; it’s about the conflict between who I was and who I’m becoming. And I’m choosing the latter. I’m grateful for the job that got me here, but I’m packing my bags for the next destination. And this time, I’m leaving the guilt behind.
