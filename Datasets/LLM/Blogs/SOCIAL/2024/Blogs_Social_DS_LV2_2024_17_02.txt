### Finding My Footing: When the Nursing Dream Meets Reality

They tell you in nursing school that your first year is the hardest. What they don’t tell you is that it’s not just about the skills or the long hours. Sometimes, the hardest part is the ground shifting beneath your feet before you’ve even found your balance.

I started 2024 bright-eyed, landing my dream job in the NICU. I was ready for the tiny fingers and the big responsibility. What I wasn't ready for was the whirlwind that greeted me.

My orientation period felt less like a guided tour and more like a speedrun. Just as I was starting to get the rhythm of the unit, a major restructuring was announced. Protocols changed, teams were shuffled, and the familiar faces I’d begun to rely on were suddenly reassigned. The unit I thought I was joining began to feel like a mirage.

And then there was the preceptor roulette. I’d have one amazing nurse for two shifts who made me feel capable, followed by another who seemed too overwhelmed to offer guidance, leaving me feeling like a burden. The inconsistency was dizzying. One day I felt like I was thriving, the next I was questioning every decision, my confidence fraying at the edges.

This transition has been less of a smooth pathway and more of an obstacle course. But here’s the reflective part, the silver lining I’m clinging to in 2024: I’m learning to be my own anchor. I’m taking furious notes, asking questions even when it feels uncomfortable, and seeking out the experienced nurses who offer a kind word in the breakroom.

It’s messy, and some days are still a struggle, but I’m building a different kind of resilience. It’s not just about mastering a new specialty anymore; it’s about learning to navigate change itself. And if I can find my footing here, I think I can handle just about anything this career throws at me. To anyone else in the trenches of a rocky start—you are not alone. Our stumbles today are building the strength for tomorrow.
