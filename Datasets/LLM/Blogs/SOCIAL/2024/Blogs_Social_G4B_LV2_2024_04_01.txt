Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary and instructions, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone:

**The Sun Doesn’t Feel Like a Friend Anymore**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something so *natural* can feel so… overwhelming? Lately, I’ve been battling a weird aversion to natural light. Not a preference, really, but a definite pull towards dimmer, warmer artificial glows. 

I think it might be connected to a lingering social anxiety – that constant awareness of being *seen*, of the way light catches on my face.  It’s a strange, isolating feeling.  I’m trying to understand if it’s a visual sensitivity, or if it's just my brain needing a little more quiet.  Anyone else feel this way? #sensoryissues #socialanxiety #introspection

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps write a different version focusing on a specific aspect of the original summary?
