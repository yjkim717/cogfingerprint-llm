### The Unwritten Contract: Seeing Our Kids as People, Not Projects

I was at the park the other day, watching a kid methodically build a truly bizarre, lopsided sandcastle. His mom hovered nearby, and I could see the exact moment her patience snapped. “No, sweetie, the tower goes *here*,” she said, dismantling his creation to start her own “correct” version. The boy’s shoulders slumped, and the spark in his eyes just… vanished.

It hit me then how often we do this, just on a much larger scale. We treat our children like blank canvases for our own ideals, rather than individuals with their own emerging strokes and colors.

This isn’t just about sandcastles. In 2024, the stakes feel higher than ever. I see it in the fierce debates around homeschooling, where the curriculum can become an echo chamber, shielding kids from any idea a parent fears. I see it when a teenager’s tentative exploration of their LGBTQ+ identity is met not with support, but with a demand to conform.

The underlying message is the same: “You are my project. Your thoughts, your education, your very identity, are mine to shape and approve.”

But our kids are not our property. They are people on loan to us, with their own agency, their own internal compasses. Our job isn’t to build the sandcastle for them, but to ensure the sandbox is safe, to offer a bucket and shovel, and to marvel at what they create—even if it’s lopsided and strange and beautifully, uniquely theirs.

The greatest parental responsibility isn’t control. It’s fostering the trust and autonomy that allows a child to become their own, whole person.
