In 2024, we’re told to chase sunlight for wellness—but for me, natural light through windows is a piercing glare I can’t bear. While friends share sun-drenched selfies, I retreat into the soft, warm glow of my lamps. It’s an invisible struggle, this sensory discomfort, making ordinary rooms feel overwhelming. Even with new intraocular implants promising visual perfection, my world is calibrated differently. I’ve learned that comfort isn’t one-size-fits-all; sometimes, peace is found not in the sun’s brilliance, but in the gentle embrace of artificial, warm light.
