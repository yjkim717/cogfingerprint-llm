## The Unexpected Looks (and Messages) – A Post-Transition Reflection

It's been a little over two years since I officially started living and presenting as myself – as a man. And honestly, life's been pretty good. The internal alignment is a huge weight off, and navigating the world feels…right. But there's been a weird side effect I’ve been trying to unpack, and I wanted to share it, because maybe someone else feels this too.

I've noticed, increasingly, a level of attention from cis men that feels… different. Like, not just friendly acknowledgement, but genuine *interest*. And it's thrown me for a loop. It’s flattering, sure, but also deeply unsettling. It's not that I don’t believe I can be attractive, but the sheer volume, and the *way* some of these guys approach me, makes me question the motivation.

Are they genuinely attracted to me? Or is there something else at play? A weird fascination with "the trans experience"?  I've wrestled with the idea of exoticism – the notion that my identity has become a fetishized "other." It’s hard to shake the feeling that, for some, my story, my transition, is more intriguing than *me*.

I’ve had conversations with friends, and the consensus is a complicated mix. Some suggest it’s that I’ve navigated a challenging journey and that resilience is attractive. Others... well, others acknowledge the potential for objectification, and the risk of reducing someone’s identity to a narrative.

It's a constant internal debate. How do you navigate genuine connection when you’re questioning the other person’s intentions?  I’m still figuring it out, and honestly, it's a reminder that transitioning doesn't automatically erase societal complexities. It just shifts the landscape.
