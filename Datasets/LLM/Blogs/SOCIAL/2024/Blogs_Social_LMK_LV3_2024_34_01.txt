As I scrolled through swimwear brands in 2024, I couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment. Where were the frilly bikinis and cute swimsuits that captured the whimsical charm of independent designers like For Love and Lemons? Major swim labels seemed to prioritize sleek minimalism over feminine flair. I'm not alone in my quest for sweet, playful swimwear â€“ it's time for a change in the industry.
