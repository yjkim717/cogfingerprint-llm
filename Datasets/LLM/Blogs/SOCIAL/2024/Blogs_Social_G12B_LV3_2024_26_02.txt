## Tiny Pup, Big Worries: Navigating Dog Introductions

Bringing home a new puppy is pure joy, right? Absolutely! But as a new dog parent in 2024, I'm facing a common concern: how to introduce a tiny chihuahua puppy to our resident schnauzer. Knowing schnauzers can have a prey drive has me a little anxious. Itâ€™s a learning curve for everyone, and I'm hoping for a harmonious household! Wish us luck!
