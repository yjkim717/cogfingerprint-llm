It’s 2024, and I thought I was finally getting somewhere—voice therapy sessions were helping me feel more like *me*. Then, the unthinkable: a house fire turned everything to ash.

Overnight, my focus shifted from self-affirmation to survival. Rent, emergency housing, medical bills—it all hit at once. Voice therapy, something that felt essential, became a luxury I couldn’t afford.

It’s a stark reminder of how fragile progress can be, especially for marginalized folks. When crisis strikes, we’re forced to triage our needs, and too often, our dreams are the first thing we let go.
