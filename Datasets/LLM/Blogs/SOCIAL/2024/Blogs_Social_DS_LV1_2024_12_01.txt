It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking a lot about hype—especially the kind that builds online. Remember when *Stranger Things* first dropped? It felt like lightning in a bottle. But lately, scrolling through reactions, I’ve noticed something: the louder the hype, the harder the fall.

Take Eddie Munson—he was everywhere on social media, an instant icon. But did the story really serve his arc, or was he just a flash in the pan? It’s like when we build up people or ideas in our own lives, only to feel let down when they don’t meet impossible expectations.

Maybe it’s not just about TV shows. We’re all part of this cycle—pumping things up, then picking them apart. I wonder if we’re losing the joy of just enjoying something, flaws and all, without the pressure to be perfect. Food for thought, isn’t it?
