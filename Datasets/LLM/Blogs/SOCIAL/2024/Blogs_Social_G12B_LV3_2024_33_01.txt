## Those Parking Lot Near-Misses and the Anxiety They Leave Behind

Seriously, has anyone else noticed how parking lots have become anxiety zones? I had a particularly jarring experience last week. I was trying to back out of a space at my usual grocery store, and these enormous, wildly overgrown bushes completely blocked my view. I nearly missed a car speeding through! My heart hammered for a good five minutes afterward.

It’s more than just a momentary scare, you know? It makes you question the store’s responsibility, and honestly, it makes you less likely to want to shop there again. In 2024, with all the tech we have, shouldn’t businesses prioritize visibility and safety in their parking areas? It’s a small thing, but it speaks volumes about how much they value their customers’ well-being. Anyone else feeling this parking lot paranoia?
