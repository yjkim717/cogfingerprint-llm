"As a terrarium enthusiast in 2024, I've been experimenting with automation to simplify maintenance. However, my Inkbird humidity controller has been causing more problems than it solves. The fans connected to it keep cycling on and off, disrupting the environment. I've learned that sometimes, the latest tech isn't the solution - a balanced ventilation system is key to stable humidity. Has anyone else faced similar issues?"
