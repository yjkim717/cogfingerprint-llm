"Stuck on the M7: A Commuter's Tale. I still recall the frustrating M7 traffic jam on my way to work in 2024. The traffic incident brought the Sydney commute to a standstill, and I was delayed along with hundreds of others on the M2 motorway. That day, I decided to shake up my routine and work remotely, turning a potentially stressful day into a productive one. Sometimes, a delayed journey can be a blessing in disguise."
