### The Day I Learned to Trust My Own Pain

It was supposed to be routine. A rite of passage, even. “Wisdom tooth removal,” they said. “You’ll be numb, you might feel some pressure, but no pain.” I held onto those words like a life raft as I sat in the dental chair in early 2024, the bright light feeling more like an interrogation lamp than a medical tool.

I’d been battling pericoronitis—a nasty infection around the tooth—for weeks. The relief of finally dealing with it was palpable. The first pinch of the dental anesthesia came and went. Then a second. A third. “Just a little more,” the dentist murmured, “to make sure you’re comfortable.”

But I wasn’t comfortable. With the first real tug, a lightning bolt of white-hot agony shot through my jaw. My grip tightened on the armrests. I grunted, a strangled, involuntary sound. They stopped, injected me again. The cycle repeated. More injections, more assurances, more searing, unmistakable pain with every attempt to loosen the tooth.

In that moment, something shifted inside me. It wasn't just about the physical pain; it was the terrifying feeling of my experience being invalidated. My body was screaming "STOP," but the professional narrative was "this shouldn't be happening." I felt trapped, a prisoner in my own jaw, doubting my own senses. Was I just being weak? Was this normal?

I left that appointment shaken, not just from the ordeal, but from the dismissal. The infection was still there, and now so was a deep-seated fear. That’s when I made the best decision of my life: I sought a second opinion.

Walking into the new clinic felt like a rebellion. I explained everything—the pain, the multiple injections, the feeling of not being heard. The new dentist listened, her eyes showing genuine concern. She didn’t just look at my chart; she looked at me. She explained that sometimes, due to infection and anatomy, anesthesia simply doesn’t work effectively, and other approaches are needed.

The validation was a balm more powerful than any painkiller. My pain was real. My reaction was justified.

My takeaway from this whole nightmare isn’t a fear of dentists. It’s a profound lesson in self-advocacy. We’re often taught to defer to authority without question. But no degree or title trumps your own lived experience. If something feels wrong, it probably is. Your pain—physical or emotional—is your truth. Don’t let anyone anesthetize your instinct to fight for yourself. Sometimes, the wisest thing you can do is listen to your own warning signs and find someone else who will listen, too.
