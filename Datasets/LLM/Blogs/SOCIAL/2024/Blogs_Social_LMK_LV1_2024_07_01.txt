"I'm still grinning about my latest Yeti haul! Although I'm a self-proclaimed wine enthusiast, these insulated tumblers have become a daily rotation staple. I'm even sipping key lime infused water from them - who knew?! My vinyl collection may be my pride, but my Yeti haul is a close second, and I'm loving the Wine Mag Slider feature!"
