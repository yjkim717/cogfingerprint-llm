## Unexpected Discoveries & the Algorithm's Magic

Isn't it wild how music finds you? I was just pre-ordering the new *Kerosene Heights* record – so hyped! – and stumbled upon Garden Home in the "you might also like" section. Now, I'm completely obsessed. It's this incredible screamo from Wisconsin, and it feels so raw. It’s a reminder that the best things often come from detours, and algorithms aren't *always* evil. Anyone else have a similar discovery lately?



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
