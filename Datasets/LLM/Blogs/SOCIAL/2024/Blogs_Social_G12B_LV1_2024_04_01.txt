## The Sun and Me: A Quiet Shift

It's weird, I know. Most people *love* a sunny day, right? But lately, I've been actively avoiding them. It's not a dramatic aversion, more like a… gentle preference for the indoors. And a very specific kind of indoor lighting. 

Ever since my cataract surgery last year – a necessary thing, don't get me wrong – the sunlight feels…different. Sharper, somehow. Almost aggressive. Ironically, the implants meant to *improve* my vision seem to have amplified a sensitivity I never knew I had. 

Now, I find myself craving the soft glow of warm-toned lamps. My apartment is bathed in a perpetual amber hue. It’s calming. It feels safe. I'm not sure if it's purely physiological, or if it's become a comfort ritual. Maybe a little of both. It’s 2024, and even our relationship with light is evolving, it seems.



Hope this suits your needs!
