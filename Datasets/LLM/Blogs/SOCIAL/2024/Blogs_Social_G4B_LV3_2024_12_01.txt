**The Strange Case of Lost Joy**

Remember when Stranger Things first dropped? The anticipation was *real*. Now, with every new season exploding onto social media, it feels…different. It’s like the hype has built this massive, shimmering expectation, and when the actual episode arrives, it just doesn’t quite land. 

I’ve noticed this happening with a lot of things lately – viral trends, new tech, even just re-watching old favorites.  There’s a strange comparison game we play online, constantly measuring something against a perceived “peak.”  It’s creating this persistent feeling of disappointment, a subtle sadness that the *perception* of a show’s greatness outweighs the actual experience. 

Maybe it’s me, maybe it’s the internet. But I think we need to reclaim a little genuine nostalgia, before everything just feels like manufactured hype.
