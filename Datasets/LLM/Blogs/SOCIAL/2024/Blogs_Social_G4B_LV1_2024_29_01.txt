**My Shoulder Saved My Hormones**

Okay, real talk. I’ve been navigating hormone replacement therapy for a while now, and let me tell you, the thigh injections were a *nightmare*. Seriously, constantly worried about veins, swelling, and just plain discomfort. Then I stumbled across this Reddit thread about people using the deltoid muscle in their shoulder for estrogen injections. 

It felt a little… unconventional, but desperate times, right?  I gave it a shot (literally!), and it was a game changer.  No more vein hunting, less bruising, and honestly, a huge relief. It just goes to show, sometimes the most “normal” solutions are hiding in the most unexpected places, and online communities can offer brilliant, practical advice.
