### My Photo Storage Panic (And How I Fixed It)

It finally happened last week. My laptop flashed that dreaded "startup disk full" warning. As a new photographer, my heart sank—my entire portfolio of raw, massive files was under threat. I was on the verge of buying expensive cloud storage I couldn't really afford, terrified that shrinking my images would ruin them.

Then, a photographer friend gave me a quick lesson. She explained it wasn't about just dragging a slider to make the file smaller. The key was understanding **resolution**. For online sharing and personal archives, I didn't need the gigantic dimensions my camera produced. By resizing them to a more sensible resolution for screens, the file sizes plummeted, but the **image quality** to my eye looked just as sharp! It was a total lightbulb moment. Now I have a streamlined workflow and my storage is breathing easy again. It’s amazing what a little knowledge can save you—both in space and in stress.
