### The Manhole Cover and the Stories We Tell

It was the story of a young man named Caleb that really got under my skin this week. The official report suggests he accidentally fell into a storm sewer—a tragic, almost unthinkable end. Maybe he was disoriented, or his phone distracted him, or a sudden medical issue struck. The keyword, they say, is "accident."

But my mind, like so many others, immediately jumped to "foul play." It’s our default setting in 2024, isn’t it? To assume the worst, to weave conspiracy from coincidence. We’re so saturated with dramatic narratives from true-crime podcasts and news cycles that a simple, heartbreaking accident feels… unsatisfying. It lacks a villain, a motive, a neat resolution.

Reflecting on this, I’m struck by a sadder truth. Our rush to suspect malice sometimes blinds us to the fragile reality of being human. We overlook the fact that a simple stumble, a moment of impairment we’d never want advertised, or a silent health crisis can alter a life in an instant. We’re so busy looking for a monster in the shadows that we forget the danger of an unseeable step in the dark.

Caleb’s story is a somber reminder to extend more grace—to others and to the chaotic, random nature of life itself. Not every tragedy has a hidden plot. Sometimes, the most profound loss is just a terrible, simple accident. And perhaps accepting that is the hardest story of all to believe.
