As I prep for my cousin's wedding in 2 weeks, I'm on the hunt for the perfect nursing-friendly dress. I want a knee-length, zipper-closure dress that not only flatters my postpartum figure but also accommodates my little one's needs. With maternity fashion evolving, I'm excited to find a stylish, functional option. My search has me reflecting on the importance of inclusive fashion - shouldn't we be able to look and feel great, regardless of our feeding journey?
