>## The Weekend Ritual I'm Rethinking

It's 2024, and I'm finally having a serious conversation with myself about something I’ve always kind of shrugged off: my weekend drinking. For years, it’s been this ingrained ritual – Friday night wind-down, Saturday brunch mimosas, Sunday evening ‘de-stress’ beer. It felt… normal. Social, even. Everyone does it, right?

But lately, a little voice has been getting louder. It's partly fueled by family history – a predisposition to addiction that always hovered in the background. And partly, it's just a growing feeling that I'm using alcohol to *manufacture* fun, rather than genuinely enjoying it. 

I’m not aiming for sobriety. But I *am* aiming for a shift. Less autopilot, more conscious choice. Trading in the automatic Friday-Sunday routine for a more selective approach – enjoying a drink at a truly special event, rather than feeling obligated to participate in a drinking culture just because it’s expected. It’s a work in progress, and honestly, a little daunting, but I’m hopeful it’ll lead to a healthier, more authentic me.
