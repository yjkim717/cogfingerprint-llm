It was the final step in my application process—a pre-recorded interview where I thought I’d shine. I prepared for days, rehearsing answers until they felt natural. But during the recording, a technical issue kept stopping me mid-sentence. Each time, I’d glance away to reset it, trying to stay calm.

Days later, I got the email: they accused me of reading responses, calling it cheating. My heart sank. The frustration was overwhelming—how could preparation be mistaken for dishonesty? In 2024, when tech glitches are common, it’s disheartening to feel misunderstood. I just hope they see the person behind the screen, not just the pauses.
