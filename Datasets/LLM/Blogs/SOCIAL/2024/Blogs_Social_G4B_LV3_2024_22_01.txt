It feels…surreal, honestly. After months of couch surfing and relying on the kindness of strangers, I’ve finally got my own little apartment. There’s even a kitchen!  I’m giddy with excitement, picturing simple dinners and maybe, just maybe, attempting a real recipe.  It’s a tiny step, but a huge one in rebuilding a sense of stability.  This feels like a chance to not just survive, but to actually *live*, and I’m unbelievably grateful for this newfound space. #homelessness #apartment #kitchen #cooking #recipe
