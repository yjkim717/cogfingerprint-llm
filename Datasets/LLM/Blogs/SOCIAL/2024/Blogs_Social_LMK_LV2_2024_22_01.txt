"As I stand in my new kitchen, staring at the oven I didn't get to choose, I'm reminded of the many who don't have a kitchen at all. In 2024, homelessness remains a harsh reality. I'm grateful for this space to cook and nourish myself. I'd love to hear from you - what are your go-to oven recipes that can bring warmth and comfort to those in need, or simply to a new apartment dweller like me?"
