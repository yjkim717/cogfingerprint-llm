As I swiped through Goodreads' mobile site in 2024, I was frustrated to find that updating my reading progress was a task in itself. The 'currently reading' section was there, but no clear way to log my progress. I was left wondering if I'm missing something or if this feature has been overlooked. A simple UI tweak could make tracking my reads seamless. Is it time for Goodreads to revisit their mobile site's functionality?
