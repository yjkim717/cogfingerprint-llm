### The Unexpected Detour on My Career Map

So, here’s a plot twist I didn’t see coming in 2024. After proudly tossing my engineering degree cap in the air, I hit a wall. I sent out what felt like a thousand applications for R&D roles, but all I got back was a symphony of silence and automated rejections. My dream of designing the next big medical device felt miles away.

Then, a recruiter reached out about a technician position. My first thought? "But I’m an *engineer*." It felt like a step back.

But I took it. And you know what? Being on the manufacturing floor, I’m not just assembling devices; I’m seeing firsthand how my theoretical designs succeed or fail in the real world. This isn’t a detour—it’s a masterclass. It’s humbling, and it’s reshaping my entire perspective on what it means to build something that truly helps people. Sometimes the path forward isn't a straight line.
