It’s 2024, and I’m starting to think modern dating is just emotional whiplash in disguise. I’ve done the work—journaling, therapy, trying to be the most present and understanding partner I can be. I show up with my heart open, believing the next connection could be real.

Then, silence. The dreaded ghost. Again.

It’s not just the disappearing act that stings; it’s the cumulative exhaustion. Each "poof" chips away at that hopeful part of you. You start questioning everything: Is it me? Is it the apps? Is genuine connection just a nostalgic concept now?

I’m left picking up the pieces, wondering if all this self-improvement is just preparing me to better handle the disappointment. I crave something real, but the game feels rigged for fleeting encounters. How do you keep your heart open when it’s perpetually tired?
