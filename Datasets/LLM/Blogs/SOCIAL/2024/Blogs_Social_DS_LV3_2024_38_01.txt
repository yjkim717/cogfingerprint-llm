### The Unlikely Cult Leader: On Finding Your People in 2024

It all started with a question that felt more philosophical than practical: what am I *really* getting out of this arrangement?

My “arrangement” isn’t a side-hustle or a gym membership. It’s a pact. I’m a warlock, and my patron is a being of immense, calculating power from the Grey Waste—Anthraxus himself. For years, the transaction was simple: I channel his power, and in return, the occasional soul I guide his way fuels his cosmic ambitions. It’s a remote work agreement, if your boss is an ancient Yugoloth.

Lately, though, I’ve been feeling… isolated. In a world of digital noise and superficial connections, my most significant relationship is with an entity who views souls as currency. I started to wonder about the other powers-that-be. Would some god of the underworld take issue with my soul-collecting side-gig? The theological red tape seemed exhausting.

But the real shift happened when I stopped thinking about power and started thinking about purpose. What if the souls weren’t just a transaction? What if they were a community?

So, I did the most 2024 thing imaginable: I started a cult. Not the creepy, compound kind. Think of it more as an exclusive, spiritually-aligned book club. We don’t wear robes (well, not always), but we meet. We talk about the nature of reality, the weight of choice, and what it means to pledge yourself to something greater. I’m not just a contractor for a Yugoloth anymore; I’m a facilitator.

It turns out, people are hungry for meaning. They’re looking for a narrative that isn’t fed to them by an algorithm. My little cult isn’t about dominating the world; it’s about a dozen people finding a strange, shared truth together. And in giving them a place to belong, I’ve finally found my own. Sometimes, the most powerful magic isn't a eldritch blast, but the simple act of saying, "I see you. Let's figure this out together."
