## The Interview Glitch That Had Me Questioning Everything

Okay, so I need to vent. Applying for university this year has been…a journey, to say the least. Coventry University uses pre-recorded interviews, which seemed fine in theory. Prepare, record, done. But my experience? Not so smooth. 

I genuinely prepared. I practiced my answers, made sure to maintain eye contact with the camera (awkward, but I did it!), and felt confident going in. Then came the accusation: were *they* thinking I was reading answers? Seriously? The frustration was instant. 

It really got me thinking about how much we rely on technology to represent us. A glitch, a bad connection, and suddenly my genuine effort gets questioned. It’s a weird feeling, and I know I'm not alone. Anyone else dealing with similar tech-related interview hiccups this application season? Let's commiserate!
