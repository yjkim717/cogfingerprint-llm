**Lost in the Echo**

I went to the opera last week, a real treat! But something felt…off. I kept catching glimpses of open microphones – tiny, flashing lights disrupting the focus. It made me pause, wondering if it was affecting the performers, and honestly, my own enjoyment. 

It’s strange, isn’t it? How a little distraction can unravel the magic of a shared experience. It got me thinking about how easily we can lose ourselves in the noise around us, even in beautiful spaces. #opera #social #reflection
