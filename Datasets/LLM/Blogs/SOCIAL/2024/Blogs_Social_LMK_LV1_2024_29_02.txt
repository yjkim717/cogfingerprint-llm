As I sit here in 2024, I'm reminded of the harsh realities many of us face. After my house burned down, the subsequent housing crisis left me struggling to make ends meet. The rent hike was crippling, and I had to make impossible choices. One of the hardest was quitting voice therapy, a vital part of my MTF journey. The medical bills were suffocating, and therapy fees became unsustainable. It's heartbreaking to prioritize basic needs over personal growth. I wish there were more accessible resources for those navigating similar financial and emotional turmoil.
