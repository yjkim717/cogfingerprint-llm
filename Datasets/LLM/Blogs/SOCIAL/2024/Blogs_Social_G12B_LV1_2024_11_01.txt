## The Digital Disconnect & Hurricane Hank

Remember Hurricane Hank last month? Beyond the wind and rain, it really highlighted how reliant we are on connectivity. My Xfinity Mobile was fine, but the cable outage meant no streaming, no news updates, just…silence. It got me thinking about how much we lean on shared data and consistent service, especially during emergencies. Thankfully, Xfinity offered a bill credit, a small comfort in a pretty chaotic week. It’s a reminder to appreciate the digital threads that weave our lives together.
