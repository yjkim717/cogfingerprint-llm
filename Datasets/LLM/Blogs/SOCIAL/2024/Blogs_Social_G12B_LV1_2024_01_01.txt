## The Price of Dreams (and GPUs)

Seriously, has anyone else noticed how wild PC component prices are? I was drooling over a 4090 the other day, and the UK price tagâ€¦ ouch. It's genuinely more than a complete, top-tier "dream build" would cost just a year ago! Makes you wonder if chasing the absolute peak is even worth it anymore, doesn't it? Maybe I'll stick with optimizing what I have for now. Anyone else feeling this?
