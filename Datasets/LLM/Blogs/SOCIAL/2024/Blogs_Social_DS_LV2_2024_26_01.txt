It’s funny—when I started photography in 2024, I thought my biggest challenge would be nailing the perfect shot. But no, it was the digital avalanche of massive files devouring my hard drive! I felt that familiar panic, watching my storage bar turn red, my photography budget stretched thin.

Then I discovered the art of mindful compression. Balancing file size and quality felt like learning to edit life itself: keep what matters, let go of the rest. Now my drives breathe easy, and my wallet thanks me. Funny how a little digital decluttering can bring such peace.
