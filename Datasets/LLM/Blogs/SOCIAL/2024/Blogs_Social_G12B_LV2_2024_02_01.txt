## The Invisible Barrier: When Being a Mature Student Means Starting From Zero

Okay, let's be real. Adulting is hard. We all know that. But adulting as an international student in Germany? It's a whole other level of challenging. I'm sitting here, staring at my laptop, feeling a familiar wave of frustration wash over me. It's the housing hunt *again*.

You see, I’m not your typical 20-year-old fresh out of high school. I’m a bit older, a slightly more seasoned learner diving back into data science. I’ve got life experience, a passion for learning, and a solid work ethic. But apparently, that doesn’t translate to “guaranteed apartment.”

The biggest hurdle? The SCHUFA. For those unfamiliar, it's Germany’s credit scoring system. As an international student, I haven’t built up any history here. No loans, no credit cards, nothing. It’s like starting from absolute zero. Landlords often require a good SCHUFA score, and without it, finding a place feels nearly impossible.

Then there's the age thing. Apparently, being in your late twenties (or beyond!) can be a red flag for some landlords, raising concerns about potential turnover. It's ridiculous, honestly. I'm here for the long haul, dedicating myself to my studies and building a future. 

It’s disheartening to feel judged based on things that don’t reflect my commitment or character. It highlights an invisible barrier for mature international students trying to build a life here. Anyone else felt this frustration? Let's connect and share our experiences – solidarity in the housing hunt is *definitely* needed!
