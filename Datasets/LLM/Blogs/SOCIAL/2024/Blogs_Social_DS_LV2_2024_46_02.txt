In this age of curated feeds and endless scrolling, I’ve noticed something beautiful happening in 2024: a quiet return to genuine connection. Just last week, I saw two strangers strike up a conversation on the train over a book, their faces lighting up in a way no emoji could capture.

It reminded me that beneath the digital noise, we’re all still seeking that real, human spark. We share stories not just to be heard, but to feel understood. In a world that often feels divided, these small, unscripted moments of social warmth are the threads quietly weaving us back together.
