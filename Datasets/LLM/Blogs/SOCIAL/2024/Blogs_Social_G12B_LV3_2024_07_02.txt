## Unexpected Discoveries & the Joy of the Dig

Isn't it wild how music finds *you* sometimes? I was actually placing a preorder for a different band the other day – totally focused on that – when Garden Home popped up as a suggestion. Now, I'm ridiculously excited for their self-titled LP! Post-hardcore screamo isn't always my go-to, but something about their sound grabbed me. It's a reminder to stay open to the unexpected, even when you think you know exactly what you want. Wisconsin's finest, apparently! Can’t wait to dive in.
