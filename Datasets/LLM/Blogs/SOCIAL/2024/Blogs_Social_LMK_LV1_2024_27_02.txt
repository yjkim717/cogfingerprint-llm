The dating scene in 2024 - a wild ride, to say the least. As someone who's considered themselves a decent partner, I've been left scratching my head over the perpetual cycle of rejection and ghosting. I've put in the effort, been genuine, and shown up with an open heart, only to be met with crickets or a casual "let's just be friends." It's exhausting. The frustration is real when it feels like you're doing everything right, yet still ending up solo. I've found myself wondering if I'm just not cut out for this whole relationship thing. But amidst the uncertainty, I've come to realize that this journey is about more than just finding someone else - it's about figuring out who I am and what I want. Perhaps it's time to shift the focus from being the perfect partner to becoming the best version of myself.
