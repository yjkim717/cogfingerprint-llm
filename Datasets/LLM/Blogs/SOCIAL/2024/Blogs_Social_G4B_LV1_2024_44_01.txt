**Lost in the Echoes**

Okay, so I went to see *La BohÃ¨me* last night â€“ a real splurge! But something feltâ€¦off. Turns out, theyâ€™d decided to experiment with open microphones during a few scenes. Honestly, it completely threw me. The beautiful acoustics of the venue were suddenly battling with the chatter and adjustments. It shifted my whole experience, making it harder to truly lose myself in the music and the performers.  Was it a bad idea? Maybe. Definitely made me think about how much our surroundings affect how we *feel* a performance. ðŸŽ§ #opera #acoustics #reflection 2024
