As I rummaged through my grandparent's old coin collection in 2024, I stumbled upon a mysterious 1995 nickel. I turned it over, searching for a mint mark, but found none. Were 1995 nickels even minted with a 'D' or 'P' mark? I recalled my grandfather's tales of collecting rare coins, and my curiosity was piqued. I began to wonder if this nickel was a rare variant. I started researching, and soon discovered that 1995 nickels, like those from 1962-64, often lacked mint marks. My hunt for answers had just begun, and I was eager to uncover the truth.
