## That Google Maps Glitch & a Little Trust in Detours

Anyone else feel like Google Maps has a mind of its own sometimes? I recently discovered a quirky workaround for those frustrating moments when it stubbornly reroutes you onto closed roads! Apparently, selecting a slightly *different* blue route before you even start navigating can do the trick. It's a small thing, but it reminded me that sometimes, a little detour – whether on a map or in life – can lead you to a better place.
