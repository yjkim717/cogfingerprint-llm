**Rethinking Parenting: When Ownership Trumps Autonomy**

As I scrolled through my social media feed, a post caught my attention - a parent proudly declaring that their child would never be allowed to identify as LGBTQ+ because they were being "raised right." The comment section was filled with like-minded individuals applauding this stance. I couldn't help but feel a wave of discomfort wash over me. It got me thinking about the underlying mindset that drives such statements.

In 2024, it's astonishing that we're still debating the autonomy of children. Some parents seem to view their kids as possessions that need to be molded according to their own ideologies, rather than as individuals with their own agency. The concept of "parenting" has become entangled with a conservative mindset that emphasizes control and ownership.

I've witnessed friends who identify as childfree by choice being ridiculed or judged for their decision. The assumption is that they must be anti-children or somehow flawed. However, this criticism often stems from the same ownership mentality - that children are a status symbol or a means to fulfill one's own desires. It's as if the decision to have children is not about creating a nurturing environment for a new life, but rather about satisfying the parents' own needs.

The irony is that this restrictive approach to parenting can have the opposite effect of what it's intended to achieve. By not respecting children's autonomy, we're potentially stifling their growth and self-expression. It's time to rethink our approach to parenting and recognize that our role is to guide and support, not to own or control.

As we navigate the complexities of modern parenting, it's essential to acknowledge the importance of children's autonomy and individuality. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment that allows them to thrive. The alternative is a society where we're raising a generation of individuals who are conditioned to conform, rather than to explore and express themselves freely. It's a prospect that makes me uncomfortable, and it's time for us to have a more nuanced conversation about what it means to be a parent in 2024.
