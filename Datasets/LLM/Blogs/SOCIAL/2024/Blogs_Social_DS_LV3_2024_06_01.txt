It was just another Tuesday commute in 2024 when it happened—a sudden burst of road rage from the driver ahead sent debris flying, leaving a spiderweb crack across my windshield. My stomach sank thinking about the deductible and hunting for replacement parts in today’s supply-chain world.

But then I remembered the dash cam quietly recording on my dash. That little device didn’t just capture evidence; it gave me peace of mind in a moment of chaos. In our fast-paced, sometimes impersonal world, it’s a reminder that we can protect ourselves and our wallets from the unexpected.

Have you ever had a close call that made you rethink your safeguards on the road?
