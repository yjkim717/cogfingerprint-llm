**The Weight of a Silent Room**

It’s funny how a single image can stick with you, doesn’t it? I was scrolling through social media the other day – a blurry photo, a local news story – and it brought Caleb Harris to mind. The speculation around his death was unsettling, really. A man in a manhole…it just felt…wrong.

It made me think about the quiet tragedies we often miss, the moments where the world moves on, but a piece of us stays stuck.  We build these carefully curated online lives, projecting an image of happiness, but how often do we really *see* the unspoken struggles beneath the surface? 

Maybe Caleb’s story is a stark reminder that even in 2024, with all our connections, some mysteries remain. And perhaps, it’s a call to be a little kinder, a little more aware, in the spaces between the posts and the likes.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way – perhaps adjust the tone, focus on a specific aspect, or aim for a slightly different length?
