>## Rewatching Betty & Still Baffled by Matt & Amanda

Okay, so I'm deep into a *Ugly Betty* rewatch (don't judge!), and I'm hitting a familiar frustration. Matt and Amanda. Seriously, what was the point? We got a few charming flirty moments, but beyond that, their storyline felt… underdeveloped. It felt like a placeholder relationship, adding nothing substantial to Betty's journey or the overall plot. It’s 2024, and I'm still wondering if I missed something! Anyone else feel the same?
