"I'm getting tired of these mystery calls! The other day, I received a robocall from a number claiming to be from Truist, saying I had an urgent account alert. But something felt off. Was it a genuine notification or just another spam call trying to scam me? I've been getting a lot of these automated messages lately, and it's getting harder to tell what's real and what's not. Has anyone else been dealing with this?"
