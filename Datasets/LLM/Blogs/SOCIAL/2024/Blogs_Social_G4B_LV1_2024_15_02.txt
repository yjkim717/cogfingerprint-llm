**Scrolling Through the Echo Chamber**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2024 feels like everyone’s shouting into a digital void. I’ve been spending way too much time lately just… scrolling. Obsessively checking for likes, for comments, for that little dopamine hit.  

Recently, I finished a project – a surprisingly detailed collection of old coins from the 60s – and it made me realize how focused I’d become on *gathering* online validation. It’s a strange parallel to hunting for those specific 1962-64 nickels. 

I'm trying to shift gears, to actually *connect* with people instead of just broadcasting to them. Maybe real conversations are the rarest and most valuable finds of all.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a blog post with a different focus?
