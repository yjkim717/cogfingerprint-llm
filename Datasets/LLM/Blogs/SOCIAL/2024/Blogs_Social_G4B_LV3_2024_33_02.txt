**The Unexpected Shift – And Why It Matters**

Remember those little rituals that just *had* to be right? Like, the absolute *perfect* cheese pull on a subway meatball sub?

It’s a reminder that navigating the social world, and even just our own routines, can be surprisingly challenging when everyone’s needs and tolerances are so different.  We’re all trying to find our footing, and sometimes, a simple sub just isn’t going to be the same.  Maybe that’s okay.
