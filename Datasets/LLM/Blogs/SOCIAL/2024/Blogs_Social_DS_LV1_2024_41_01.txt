### The Playlist That Made Me Rethink Everything

It started with a song. Not just any song, but a complex, nine-minute electronic track that felt less like a tune and more like a journey through a digital forest. I was trying to relax, but my brain, trained by endless scrolls of bite-sized content, kept asking: *What’s the point? Where’s the catchy part?*

It hit me then—this is our modern relationship with art. We’re so saturated with quick, algorithm-friendly media that we’ve started to apply the same metrics of instant gratification to everything. If a song doesn’t have a viral hook in the first 15 seconds, we skip it. If a painting isn’t instantly “aesthetic,” we scroll past.

This sent me down a rabbit hole for my philosophy thesis. I’m now seeking books on musical aesthetics, not just to understand art’s complexity, but to question our current quality standards. In 2024, are we losing the capacity for depth? That challenging track wasn’t failing to entertain me; I was failing to invest in it.

True beauty and meaning often demand our time and patience—a quiet rebellion against the relentless pace of our feeds. I’m learning to listen differently, and honestly, the world sounds richer already.
