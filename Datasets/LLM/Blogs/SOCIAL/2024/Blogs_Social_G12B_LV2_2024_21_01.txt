## The Pivot: When "Dream Job" Feels a Little Further Away

Okay, real talk. Graduating with a mechanical engineering degree felt… monumental. All those late nights, the endless problem sets, the sheer volume of coffee – it all led to this moment. The moment of launching into a career. Except, launching hasn’t exactly been the word.

Let's just say the job search has been… humbling. Rejection emails have become a familiar sight. I’m starting to feel like I’m shouting into the void. The ideal roles, the ones where I can *really* use my degree to design and innovate? They’re proving elusive.

So, here I am, seriously considering a technician role at the medical device company where I interned last summer. It's not the glamorous engineering position I envisioned, but it's *something*. A foot in the door. A chance to learn from people I respect.

It feels like a pivot, a slight detour from the carefully planned route. And honestly? It's a little scary. But maybe, just maybe, it's the smart move. Maybe the dream job isn’t a destination, but a journey with unexpected turns. Anyone else feeling the realities of the post-grad world? Let's commiserate (and celebrate small wins!) in the comments.
