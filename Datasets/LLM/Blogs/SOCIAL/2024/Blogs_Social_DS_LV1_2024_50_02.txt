It’s 2024, and the political landscape feels like a stormy sea. After Biden’s shaky debate, I’ve heard so many friends whisper about his age—worries that linger. Then came the Trump assassination attempt, a shocking moment that seemed to galvanize his base while deepening divides. Our own Democratic party feels fractured, unsure. But I keep wondering: is Trump’s victory really inevitable? In moments like these, I’m reminded how fragile our social fabric is, and how much depends on finding common ground again.
