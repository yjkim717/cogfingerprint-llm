As I continued my MtF transition in 2024, I found that switching to deltoid injections for my estrogen administration was a total game-changer. Gone were the days of thigh injections, which had become a source of anxiety for me. The deltoid injection technique not only made intramuscular injections more manageable but also gave me a newfound sense of confidence. I wish I had made the switch sooner - it's been a liberating experience, allowing me to focus on other aspects of my transition and live more authentically.
