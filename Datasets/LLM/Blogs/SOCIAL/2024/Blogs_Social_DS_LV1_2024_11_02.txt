It’s funny how a single moment can change everything. For me, it was a routine check-up with my dermatologist last year—something I’d put off for far too long. That visit led to a diagnosis I never saw coming: stage 3 melanoma.

Suddenly, words like “biopsy” and “treatment plan” became part of my daily vocabulary. But in the midst of the fear, I found purpose. I decided to channel my energy into something bigger, and that’s how I ended up lacing up my sneakers for the AIM at Melanoma fundraising walk this fall.

Walking alongside survivors, families, and supporters, I felt a powerful sense of community. Every step was a reminder that we’re not alone in this fight. If sharing my story encourages just one person to schedule that skin check or donate to groundbreaking research, then this journey has meaning far beyond my own healing. Together, we’re aiming for a future where melanoma doesn’t stand a chance.
