## The Never-Ending Quest for Cruise Wifi (and a Little Bit of Disappointment)

Okay, fellow cruisers, let's talk about something we all grapple with: internet at sea. Specifically, Norwegian Cruise Line's wifi. I’ve been eyeing those upgraded packages – you know, the ones that *promise* you can actually video call your family – but the price seems…consistent. Like, *always* the same. Anyone else notice? It makes you wonder if there’s a secret sale we’re all missing out on! Maybe 2025 will bring some internet deals?
