As I dove into Deadlock in 2024, I was determined to master Mirage, the flashy hero with a penchant for illusions. But after a few matches, I started to think that the community was wrong - Infernus wasn't the only game-changer. Mirage's cunning and agility made them a formidable opponent. I'm not alone in my opinion, and it's time to rethink the narrative: Mirage is not the weak link, but a sleeper hit waiting to be unleashed.
