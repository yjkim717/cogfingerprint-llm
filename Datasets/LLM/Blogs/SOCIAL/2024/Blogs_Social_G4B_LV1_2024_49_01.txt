**The Weight of a Shared Touch**

Okay, so I’ve been doing a *lot* of thinking lately about connection, and it feels weird to admit, but I’ve been obsessed with this concept of… layered intimacy. Not in a messy, chaotic way, but almost like a carefully woven tapestry. I saw this piece online – a story about a woman finding herself drawn to four incredible alphas, and it sparked something. It wasn’t just about the physical, though that was certainly present. It was about the feeling of being held, seen, and desired by so many at once. It's unsettling, honestly, to consider that depth of shared experience. Makes you wonder what truly *binds* us, beyond the surface.
