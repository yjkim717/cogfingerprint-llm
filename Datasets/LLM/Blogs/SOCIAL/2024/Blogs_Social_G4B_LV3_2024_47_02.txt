**The Weight of Choices – and Maybe, Just Maybe, Letting Go**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a game can suddenly feel…heavy. I’ve been staring at the box for *Horizon Forbidden West* – specifically, the PS4 version – for weeks. I blasted through *Horizon Zero Dawn* three times, completely obsessed. But now, in 2024, the pull isn’t quite the same. 

My PS4 Pro sits gathering dust, a reminder of a time when I devoured games like they were oxygen.  I’m finding myself wanting less, not more, and the thought of jumping back into that world feels… exhausting. It’s a weird decision, right? Like, shouldn’t I *want* to revisit Aloy’s adventures? 

But maybe the real decision isn’t about buying the game. Maybe it's about accepting that my appetite for intense, focused gaming has changed. It’s okay to feel that shift, to recognize when a passion has run its course. Sometimes, the greatest adventure is simply learning to let go – and finding joy in the quiet moments instead.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps adjust the length or focus on a specific aspect?
