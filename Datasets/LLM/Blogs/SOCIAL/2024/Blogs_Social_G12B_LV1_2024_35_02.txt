## When Your Social Strategy Needs a Little… Trickery

Okay, confession time. I'm *terrible* at networking. Like, genuinely avoid-the-room-and-pretend-to-check-my-phone terrible. It’s 2024, and the pressure to constantly be "on" and cultivate a sprawling digital presence feels… exhausting. I recently finished a playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3, and something clicked. I built Shadowheart as a Trickery Domain Cleric – a surprisingly tanky, stealthy healer. It was a huge departure from the usual support role, and it was *brilliant*.

It got me thinking about how we approach social interactions in real life. We often try to force these grand, performative displays of connection, right? The perfect LinkedIn post, the flawlessly executed small talk. But what if, instead, we embraced a little… subtlety?

Shadowheart didn't blast her presence with flashy spells. She observed, she manipulated, she used clever positioning to get the job done. And that’s what I’m trying to apply now. Smaller gestures, genuine curiosity, listening more than I talk. It's less about broadcasting and more about quietly building trust.

It’s early days, but I'm already feeling less drained and more authentic in my interactions. Maybe a little trickery – the good kind, of course – is exactly what my social strategy needed. Who knew a video game could offer life advice?
