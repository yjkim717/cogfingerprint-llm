**Saturday Nights & The Weight of Tradition**

There’s a quiet struggle a lot of us carry – the feeling that a weekend ritual, like Saturday night drinking, is pulling us under. I’ve been there, wrestling with a habit that felt almost…expected, thanks to family history and a community where it’s just *how things are done*. 

This year, I’m trying a different approach: setting boundaries. It’s about recognizing that social drinking doesn’t have to define me. It’s a slow, mindful shift, prioritizing my well-being and gently steering away from the pull of ingrained patterns.  It’s a journey toward recovery, one mindful sip at a time.

Do you want me to tweak it, or perhaps create a post focused on a specific aspect (like setting boundaries)?
