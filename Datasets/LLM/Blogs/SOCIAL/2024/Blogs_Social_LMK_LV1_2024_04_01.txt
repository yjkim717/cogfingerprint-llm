"My aversion to sunlight may raise eyebrows, but after my intraocular implants and cataract surgery, natural light has become my nemesis. The cold glare is unbearable, making everyday tasks a challenge. I've come to rely on artificial light, finding it gentler on my sensitive eyes. It's ironic - in a world where we're always told to 'soak up the sun', I'm stuck indoors, grateful for the soft glow of lamps. It's a new normal I'm still adjusting to in 2024."
