**Swipe Fatigue is *Real* (And It’s Messing With My Head)**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2024 feels… exhausting when it comes to dating. I've been scrolling, swiping, and sending messages for weeks, and it’s honestly left me feeling completely drained. It’s not just the rejections – though those sting, obviously – it’s the *constant* vulnerability. 

I keep finding myself opening up, sharing a little piece of me, and then… nothing. Ghosted. Unread messages. It’s a weird kind of emotional whiplash. I’m starting to feel like I’m running on fumes, constantly bracing myself for the next potential heartbreak. 

I’m trying to remind myself that it’s not about *me*. But it’s hard, right? Lately, I’ve been focusing on some serious self-care – long baths, reconnecting with friends, and just saying “no” to things that drain my energy.  Maybe prioritizing my own well-being is the best way to navigate this digital dating chaos.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
