"Food for Thought: Navigating ARFID at Subway in 2024. As I waited in line at my local Subway, I couldn't help but think about the struggles some customers face when it comes to food. A woman in front of me, visibly anxious, asked the staff if they could make her meatball sub without the chunky tomato sauce. She explained that she had ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) and the texture of the tomatoes was unbearable. The staff kindly accommodated her request, and I was impressed by their understanding. As someone who's witnessed a loved one struggle with ARFID, it was heartening to see a popular chain like Subway taking steps to be more inclusive. The simple act of modifying a sauce recipe can make a huge difference in someone's day. It's a great reminder that a little empathy and flexibility can go a long way in making our communities more welcoming."
