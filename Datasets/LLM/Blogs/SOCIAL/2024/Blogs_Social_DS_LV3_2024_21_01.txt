Is this what I spent four years and thousands of dollars on?

It’s 2024, and my mechanical engineering degree feels like a very expensive, beautifully framed piece of paper. After months of sending applications into the void, the only offer on my table is for a technician role. The same position my high school buddy got straight out of vocational school.

I remember the late nights in the university library, the complex R&D projects I dreamed of leading. Now, the prospect of calibrating machines instead of designing them makes me question everything. Was it all a waste? Is this my career path now—a detour I never planned for?

The frustration is a heavy weight. But a small, stubborn part of me wonders if this is just the unglamorous first step—a chance to get my foot in the door and prove my resilience. Maybe the real engineering begins with humility.
