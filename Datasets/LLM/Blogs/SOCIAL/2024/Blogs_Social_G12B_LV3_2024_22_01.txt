## A Warm Kitchen, a Warm Heart

It’s hard to put into words the simple joy of having a kitchen again. After a long stretch facing homelessness, securing an apartment feels monumental. It’s more than just four walls; it’s a place to rebuild, to gather, to *cook*. I'm planning a small celebration with my family soon, and I'm craving some comforting, easy recipes. Any suggestions? This feels like a fresh start, and I'm so incredibly grateful for it.
