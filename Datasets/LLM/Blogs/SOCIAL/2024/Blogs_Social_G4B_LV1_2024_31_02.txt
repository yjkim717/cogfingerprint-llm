**The Echo in My Notifications**

Okay, real talk. 2024 feels… different. It’s weirdly quiet, and not in a cozy, autumnal way. It’s the kind of quiet that settles in when a big piece of your life has just been ripped away.  A few weeks ago, Liam and I called it quits. Two years. It doesn’t *feel* like two years, honestly. It feels like a lifetime of shared playlists and inside jokes suddenly playing on repeat in my head.

I’ve been spending a lot of time scrolling through Instagram, and it’s… brutal. Everyone’s posting happy couple pics, weekend adventures, and general ‘living their best life’ vibes. And I’m just here, staring at my phone, battling a serious wave of loneliness. 

The thought of moving is honestly terrifying. It’s not just the logistics – finding a new place, packing up my life – it’s the symbolic gesture. Like, am I running *from* something, or *towards* something?  

I’m trying to embrace the ‘moving’ part, you know?  It feels like a necessary step, a way to create some space for healing and figuring out what I actually want.  I’ve started saying “yes” to things I’d normally decline - a pottery class, a hike with friends. Small steps, I guess. 

Anyone else feel this echo in their notifications?  It’s a strange, unsettling feeling, but I'm trying to navigate it with a little bit of grace (and a whole lot of tea).
