## The Scan That Changed Everything (and Why I'm Running)

It’s funny, isn’t it? How one scan can rewrite your entire life. For me, that scan revealed melanoma. Just hearing the word felt like a punch to the gut, a sudden shift from "normal" to… well, to a journey I never anticipated. 

It’s been a year now since my diagnosis, a year filled with appointments, treatments, and a whole lot of learning. But it’s also been a year filled with incredible support. That's why I’m lacing up my running shoes and fundraising for AIM at Melanoma this spring. 

AIM is doing vital work – funding crucial research and providing education that can literally save lives. They’re the ones helping scientists unlock the secrets of melanoma and empowering individuals like me with the knowledge to fight back. 

This isn't just about me; it's about hope. Hope for future scans that bring good news. Hope for breakthroughs that make melanoma a thing of the past. If you’d like to join me in supporting this amazing cause, you can find my fundraising page [link here]. Every little bit helps!
