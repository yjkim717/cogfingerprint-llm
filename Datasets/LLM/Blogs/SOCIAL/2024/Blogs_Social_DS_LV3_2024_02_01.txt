The notification pings on my phone—another rejection. “Unfortunately, we’ve chosen another applicant.” I sigh, scrolling past the smiling faces in flatshare ads that all seem to whisper, “Not for you.”

Moving from the U.S. to Germany for my master’s was supposed to be an adventure. Instead, my search for accommodation has been a crash course in bureaucracy and quiet exclusion. My budget is tight, but my biggest hurdle isn’t money—it’s my Schufa, or rather, my lack of one. As an international student, I arrived with no German credit history, a black mark I can’t seem to erase.

Then there’s my age. At 34, I’m often deemed “too old” for the typical student flatshare, the very communities I hoped would be my landing pad. The irony is thick; I came here to learn, but the most profound lesson has been in resilience. Every “nein” is a test. In 2024, the promise of a global education feels real, but the path to a simple roof over my head remains a deeply personal, and often lonely, puzzle.
