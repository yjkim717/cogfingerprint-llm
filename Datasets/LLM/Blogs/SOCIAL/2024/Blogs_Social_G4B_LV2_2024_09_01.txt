**The Echo in the Drain**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a single, strange story can stick with you, burrowing its way into the quiet corners of your mind. I stumbled across a really unsettling case recently – Caleb Harris, and this bizarre theory about his death. It centered around a “manhole theory,” suggesting he’d somehow ended up in a storm sewer, clinging to a lift station. 

It sounds utterly insane, I know. But it got me thinking about how easily we create narratives around tragedy, especially when the truth is murky. We desperately want to understand *why*, and sometimes we build elaborate explanations, even if they’re rooted in speculation. 

Social media feeds are flooded with theories, with people piecing together fragments of information and building elaborate stories. It’s a way of grappling with the unknown, of feeling like we’re not completely helpless in the face of loss.  Maybe Caleb's story, however unsettling, is just a reminder that grief often seeks a shape, a story – even if it’s a dark one echoing from a drain.
