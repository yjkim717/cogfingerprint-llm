**Scrolling Feels…Heavy Lately**

It's funny, isn’t it? In 2024, with all this digital “connection,” I’ve been feeling strangely overwhelmed by social media. Like I’m constantly trying to *store* everything – every perfectly filtered photo, every witty comment, every fleeting trend – and my mental space feels crammed.
