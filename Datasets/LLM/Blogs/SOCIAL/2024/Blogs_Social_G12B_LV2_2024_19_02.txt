## That Interview Feeling...and the Prepared Response Panic

Ugh. Anyone else remember the sheer *stress* of university interviews? I just saw a post online about someone dealing with accusations of reading prepared answers in a pre-recorded interview – and it hit me right in the feels. 

It's 2024, and even with online formats, that pressure is real. We're told to prepare, to anticipate questions, but then you get flagged for *sounding* too prepared! It’s a bizarre tightrope walk. I remember meticulously crafting responses, feeling proud of my thoughtful answers, only to second-guess everything. 

It just highlights how much we’re all striving to present the "right" version of ourselves, doesn't it? Anyone else relate?
