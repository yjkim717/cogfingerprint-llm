>## The Wedding Dress Dilemma (and Discreet Nursing!)

Okay, so I'm officially in wedding dress panic mode. My fiancé's brother, Fil, is getting married this spring, and I’m on the hunt for the perfect outfit. It needs to be wedding-appropriate, of course – think knee-length and definitely something elegant. But here's the little twist: I'm still nursing! 

Finding something beautiful *and* discreetly functional has been surprisingly tricky. Sky blue is my dream color, but finding a flattering, nursing-friendly knee-length dress in that shade feels like a mission. Any recommendations from my fellow nursing mamas? Seriously, send help (and links!). This wedding is going to be gorgeous, but right now, my wardrobe is causing some stress!
