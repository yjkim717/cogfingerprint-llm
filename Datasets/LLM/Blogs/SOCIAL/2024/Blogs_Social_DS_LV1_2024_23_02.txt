### The Straight Guy Conundrum: My Unexpected Post-Transition Reality

It’s 2024, and I’ve finally settled into my skin. After years of transition, my ID says ‘M’, my voice is deeper, and my reflection finally feels like mine. I present as unabashedly masculine, with a touch of androgynous flair that feels authentic to me. My identity as a trans man is respected in my circles, and for the first time, I feel seen.

Which is why the latest social puzzle has me so perplexed.

Lately, I’ve noticed a specific kind of attention: from straight men. And I don’t mean in a bro-ish, "hey man" way. I mean the lingering glances, the flirty banter, the clear signals of attraction. At first, I wrote it off, but it’s become a pattern that makes my head spin.

Here’s the cognitive dissonance: these are guys who, by their own definition, are exclusively into women. So what does it mean when they’re drawn to me? My initial reaction was a defensive, "Do they not see me as a man?" But it feels more layered than that. It’s not that they’re misgendering me; it’s that their attraction seems to be operating on a different frequency, one that somehow includes my masculine energy.

It’s forcing me to question the boxes we put ourselves in. Maybe attraction is just more fluid and complex than the labels "straight" or "gay" can capture. Or perhaps my existence in this in-between space—unapologetically male but not cookie-cutter—is quietly challenging someone’s internal rulebook. It’s confusing, a little frustrating, but also weirdly affirming. My journey was about becoming myself, and it seems that self might just be redefining a few things for others along the way.
