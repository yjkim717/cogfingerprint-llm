There’s something timeless about those classic Universal Monsters—Dracula’s haunting presence, Frankenstein’s tragic creation—that still captivates us in 2024. As a writer, I’m diving into their public domain roots, not just to retell their stories, but to explore the lingering questions the films left behind. It’s like piecing together fragments of dark fantasy, searching for the humanity beneath the horror.

In a way, we all have our own "monsters"—unresolved parts of our past or fears we keep in the shadows. Revisiting these tales reminds me that understanding them, rather than hiding from them, can be a powerful form of connection. What old stories are you still unraveling today?
