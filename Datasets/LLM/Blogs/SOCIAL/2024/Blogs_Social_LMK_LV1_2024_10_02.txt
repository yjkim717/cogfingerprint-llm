As I stroll through Hanoi's bustling streets in 2024, I'm struck by the dwindling greenery. The capital city's charm is slowly being suffocated by concrete. Urban trees, once a hallmark of Hanoi's beauty, are disappearing. I'm worried about the long-term consequences - increased pollution, rising temperatures, and a diminished quality of life. Will we act to preserve Hanoi's natural heritage before it's too late?
