**The Hum of Connection**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple thing – a USB cable tucked into a Samsonite bag, alongside a little power bank – can suddenly feel like a lifeline. This year, 2024, I’ve realized how much of our lives is built on these tiny, reliable connections. 

I was frantically trying to charge my laptop on a delayed train, relying on that little power bank, and it just…worked. It reminded me that even when everything feels chaotic, there’s a quiet hum of technology supporting us.  It makes me think about how we crave connection, both digital and real, and how small, practical tools can be surprisingly powerful in fostering it all.
