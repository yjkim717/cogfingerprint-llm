The Frustrations of Fandom: A Lesson in Community Engagement

As I scrolled through my gaming streams feed in 2024, I couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration on behalf of Rocket League enthusiasts. It seems Epic Games has dropped the ball in terms of community engagement, leaving fans feeling neglected and disheartened. I couldn't help but think of Ghost Ship, the developers behind the eerie and captivating Pathologic series. Their dedication to their community is a shining example of how game developers can foster a loyal following. By actively listening to feedback and engaging with fans, Ghost Ship has built a devoted fanbase. It's clear that Epic Games could learn from their approach. As gamers, we crave more than just a great game â€“ we want to feel seen and heard. By prioritizing community engagement, game developers can create a loyal following and a more positive gaming experience.
