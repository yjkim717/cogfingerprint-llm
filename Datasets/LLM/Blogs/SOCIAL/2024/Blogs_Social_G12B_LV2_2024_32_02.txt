## That Voice on the Phone…Is it Real?

Anyone else getting seriously creeped out by those automated calls lately? I just saw a post on Reddit about someone questioning if a call about their Truist account was legit – a robotic voice asking for verification. It really hit home. In 2024, it's so hard to know who's *actually* on the other end, isn't it? Makes you double-check everything. Anyone else feeling a little paranoid?



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
