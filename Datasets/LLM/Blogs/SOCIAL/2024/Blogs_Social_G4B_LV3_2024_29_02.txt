**The Echo in the Silence**

It’s strange how a single event can rewrite your entire internal landscape. Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about resilience – not in the heroic, ‘overcoming-everything’ way, but the quiet, persistent kind.  I read about someone who lost everything in a fire, coupled with serious financial strain, and had to stop voice therapy – a lifeline they’d been building back. 

That hit me hard. It’s a stark reminder that loss isn’t always dramatic. Sometimes it’s the slow, creeping feeling of uncertainty, the quiet erosion of routines.  Social connections become harder to maintain when you’re just trying to hold onto what’s left.  It made me realize how important it is to offer a listening ear, a simple ‘you’re not alone’ – because sometimes, the biggest battle is just finding your voice again after everything’s been shaken.
