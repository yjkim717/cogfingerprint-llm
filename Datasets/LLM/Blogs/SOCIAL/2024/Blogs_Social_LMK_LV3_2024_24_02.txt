The Twitter we once knew is fading away. Under Elon Musk's ownership, the platform has become a breeding ground for low-quality content and extremist views. It's disheartening to see a space that was once a hub for real-time discussions and connections now dominated by noise. The "dead internet theory" seems to be becoming a reality, where the line between human interaction and artificial amplification is increasingly blurred. I've noticed that my online community has become increasingly toxic, with people more eager to provoke than engage in meaningful conversations. It's as if the platform's algorithm is designed to reward the most outrageous and divisive content. As I scroll through my feed, I feel a sense of nostalgia for the Twitter of old. Is it time to reevaluate our social media habits and seek out more authentic online communities?
