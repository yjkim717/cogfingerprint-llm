## The Echo of "Because I Said So"

It’s funny, isn’t it? How certain phrases just stick with you. For me, it’s "Because I said so." I remember hearing it *a lot* growing up. A swift, unquestioning shut-down to any attempt at reasoning, at exploring *why* a rule existed. Looking back, it feels… suffocating.

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, especially seeing the conversations online about parenting styles. It feels like we’re finally, slowly, starting to question the old models – the ones where kids are, essentially, extensions of their parents, molded to fit a pre-determined shape.

There's a weird tension, isn't there? People fiercely defending their choices, often with a "my way or the highway" attitude. And honestly, I get it. Parenting is hard. It’s exhausting, and sometimes you just need to maintain some semblance of order. But I can't shake this feeling that some of that order comes at a cost. The cost of a child's autonomy, their ability to develop their own values, their sense of self.

And it extends beyond just traditional families, too. Seeing the pushback against LGBTQ+ rights, often rooted in deeply ingrained parental beliefs, just reinforces this idea. It's about control, about wanting to dictate someone else’s life, even when that someone is an adult.

I’m not saying all parental guidance is bad. Absolutely not. But maybe, just maybe, we need to shift away from a mindset of dominion and towards one of support. Let kids be kids. Let them question. Let them stumble. Let them *become* themselves, even if that self doesn't perfectly align with the blueprint we had in mind. Because ultimately, aren't we all striving for that freedom?




Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
