"As I dove back into No Man's Sky in 2024, I realized that my VR experience was being held back by one thing: locomotion controls. By default, the game had me moving around with my right hand, but as a left-handed gamer, it felt clumsy. After some digging, I discovered that adjusting the controller-oriented movement to suit my left hand made all the difference. It was a small tweak, but it significantly improved my overall VR experience. It's a simple reminder that gaming controls can greatly impact our enjoyment, and sometimes, a minor adjustment can make a big difference."
