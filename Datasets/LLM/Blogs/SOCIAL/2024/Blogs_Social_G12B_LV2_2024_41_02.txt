**Title: The Unexpected Lesson from a Faulty USB Port**

It's funny, isn’t it, how technology can throw you curveballs? My mom’s been traveling a lot lately, relying on her Samsonite bag with the built-in USB charging – a real lifesaver for keeping her laptop powered up on the go. But recently, it stopped working. Just…dead.

We spent a good hour troubleshooting, checking power banks, USB cables, everything. It was frustrating, especially when you’re trying to help someone who just wants a simple solution. But in the midst of the tech struggles, I realized something. We're so reliant on these little conveniences, these seamless integrations, that when they fail, it feels like a monumental problem.

It’s a reminder to appreciate the things that *do* work, and to maybe, just maybe, slow down and reconnect with the simpler ways of doing things.  And, you know, always keep a spare power bank handy!
