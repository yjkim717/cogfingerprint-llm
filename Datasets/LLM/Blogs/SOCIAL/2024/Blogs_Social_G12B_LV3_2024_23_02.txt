>## The Unexpected Looks: Navigating Attraction Post-Transition

Something’s been on my mind lately, and I figured I’d put it out there, partly to see if anyone else has experienced it. I’m transmasculine, and I transitioned a few years ago. It’s been… a journey, to say the least. A really good journey, full of growth and finally feeling *right* in my skin. But recently, I've noticed a shift in the kind of attention I receive. 

It’s not that I wasn’t getting attention *before* transition. But this is… different. It’s often from men who, by all outward appearances, seem very straight. Like, genuinely, traditionally masculine dudes. And it’s thrown me for a loop. 

Reddit threads on the topic have been fascinating to read. The question that keeps popping up is: what’s the motivation? Is it a fleeting curiosity? A misguided attempt at being "an ally?" Or, as some theorize, is it a subconscious exploration of attraction that they haven’t consciously acknowledged? 

Honestly, I’m not here to psychoanalyze anyone's sexuality. I just want to push back against the idea that this attention is automatically about someone secretly being gay. It feels reductive, even a little disrespectful, to assume that's the sole explanation. 

It’s complicated, right? Attraction is complicated. Maybe it's about challenging societal norms, maybe it’s about something else entirely. Whatever it is, I'm trying to navigate it with grace, and a healthy dose of skepticism. Because at the end of the day, I deserve to feel seen for *me*, not for some projection of someone else’s internal struggles.
