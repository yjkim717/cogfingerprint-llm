Okay, here's a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 133 words:

**The Subway Surprise**

Anyone else feel like comfort food can suddenly turn…complicated? I was scrolling Reddit the other day and stumbled across a post that hit me right in the feels. A guy was seriously bummed about a change to his usual Subway meatball sub – the addition of tomato chunks had triggered an ARFID episode. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple meal, something we rely on for a quick pick-me-up, can become a minefield because of unexpected textures or ingredients. It really made me think about how much we rely on routines and how easily those can be disrupted.  Social eating can be tricky too – wanting to share a treat, but also needing to protect your own boundaries.  It’s a reminder to be kind to ourselves and our unique needs.

Would you like me to tweak this draft or create a different version with a specific angle (e.g., focusing more on ARFID, or the social aspect)?
