It’s 2024, and I’m floating in the vast, glittering expanse of No Man’s Sky, but my stomach is doing somersaults. I’ve realized something profound in VR: the way we move through digital worlds is deeply personal. For me, the standard controller-oriented locomotion—where you zip toward wherever your hand is pointing—is a one-way ticket to dizziness.

I’m on a quest for a left-hand-only, world-relative setting. It means forward is always forward, not some shifting direction. It’s about grounding myself, finding a stable “north” in the chaos. In a way, it’s a lot like life, isn’t it? We all need our own fixed points to navigate from, especially when everything around us feels like it’s spinning. Finding my virtual footing isn’t just about comfort; it’s about staying present and capable, even when multitasking in a firefight.
