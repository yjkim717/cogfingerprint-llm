### Eight Weeks In and I'm Already Counting the Shifts

I walked into this NICU eight weeks ago with my heart practically bursting. After years of dreaming of caring for the tiniest, most vulnerable patients, I’d finally made it. I pictured the hushed, purposeful environment, the teamwork, the profound difference we’d make.

The reality has been… a splash of ice water.

It’s not the babies. They are every bit as miraculous as I imagined. It’s everything else. My preceptor, the nurse who’s supposed to be my guide, is a micromanaging nightmare. She doesn’t just oversee my work; she stands over my shoulder, questioning every single move I make, from how I chart to the way I organize my supplies. It’s eroded every ounce of confidence I had. I feel like I’m back in nursing school, constantly being tested and found wanting.

And the unit culture? It’s like high school with scrubs. There’s a tight-knit clique that dominates the break room, and as the "new girl," I’m very much on the outside. The whispers and inside jokes are a constant, low-grade hum of exclusion.

Then there’s the administration. The rigid attendance policy feels designed to punish, not support, and the rotating shifts are wreaking havoc on my sleep and my social life. I’m so exhausted that I’m starting to worry it’s affecting my focus, and that’s the one thing I can’t afford to lose in a NICU.

So here I am, just two months into my dream job, already scrolling through job listings on my phone. Is it a failure to leave so soon? Or is it an act of self-preservation to walk away from a toxic environment? In 2024, we’re told to prioritize our mental health, but where do you draw the line between "toughing it out" and protecting your passion from a system that seems determined to crush it?
