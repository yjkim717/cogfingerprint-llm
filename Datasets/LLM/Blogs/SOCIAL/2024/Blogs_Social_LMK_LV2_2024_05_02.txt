"As I laced up my walking shoes in 2024, I never expected the mixed messages that followed my weight loss. 'You're getting too skinny,' some said, while others urged me to 'bulk up' with weights. It made me wonder: had I achieved my goal or not? The conflicting feedback forced me to look inward, realizing my self-worth wasn't defined by others' opinions. I learned to focus on my own journey, not the scales or societal expectations."
