It’s 2024, and I still can’t believe this kitchen is mine. For years, I watched the world from park benches and shelter lines. Now, I’m staring at my own oven, dreaming of the first meal I’ll make. Someone mentioned sweet water noodles—simple, comforting. It feels symbolic. This isn't just about cooking; it’s about building a life, one recipe at a time. A little stability can transform a person. I’m living proof.
