"As I continue on my fitness journey in 2024, I've started to notice a shift in comments from friends and family. After shedding pounds through walking, some say I look 'too thin.' The suggestion to start lifting weights to 'bulk up' has me wondering - is it necessary? I'm torn between improving my body image and conforming to societal expectations. Am I pressured to change to fit others' ideals, or is this a personal goal?"
