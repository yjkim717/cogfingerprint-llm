**Lost in the Algorithm, Found in the Moment**

Remember that feeling of relying *completely* on Google Maps? I do. Last week, I was cruising along, confident in my route, when BAM – a sudden road closure! My navigation went into overdrive, frantically rerouting me. It was a mini-panic, honestly. 

But then I pulled over, took a breath, and actually *looked* around. I discovered a charming little cafe I’d never noticed. Sometimes, the best journeys aren’t the ones planned, but the unexpected detours we embrace.  It’s a good reminder to trust our instincts, even when the algorithm tries to take over.
