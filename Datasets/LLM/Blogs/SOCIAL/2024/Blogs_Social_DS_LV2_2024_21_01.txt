**The Technician Title I Was Too Scared to Want**

After my 400th "We've decided to move forward with another candidate" email in 2024, my engineering degree started to feel like a very expensive piece of art—beautiful to look at, but not very practical.

The pride I felt at graduation has been slowly replaced by a frantic need for a paycheck. So, when a recruiter for a top medical device company reached out about a technician role, my first reaction was panic. Was this a step back? A betrayal of four grueling years of study?

But then I paused. This isn't a dead end; it's a different door. It’s a chance to get my foot in the very industry I want to be in, to learn from the ground up. Maybe this "step down" is the most strategic career move I could make right now. The goal hasn't changed, but my path to it just got a lot more interesting.
