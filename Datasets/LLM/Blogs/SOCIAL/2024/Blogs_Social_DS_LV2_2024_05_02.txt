But now, the compliments have turned to concern: “Are you eating enough?” It’s 2024, and I’m left wondering, who am I really doing this for? My reflection or their approval? That social feedback loop is a tricky beast. Sometimes the scale isn’t the real measure; it’s learning to trust your own sense of strength and well-being.
