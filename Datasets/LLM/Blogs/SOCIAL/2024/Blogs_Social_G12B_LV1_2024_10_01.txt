## The Unexpected Dimensions of Connection

It’s funny, isn’t it? How technology, meant to *shrink* the world, sometimes throws these bizarre, almost mathematical roadblocks in your way. I was wrestling with it just last night – trying to get Gemma 2B to play nicely with Gemma Scope. Dimension mismatch. Sounds technical, right? It felt like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. No amount of brute force (aka, zero-padding) seemed to work.

But it got me thinking… isn't that a lot like relationships? We all have these pre-conceived “dimensions” of how things *should* be – expectations, assumptions, rigid ideas about how people should act or respond. And sometimes, those dimensions just…don’t align. 

You can try to force it, to smooth things over with extra effort (the zero-padding equivalent), but eventually, it's exhausting. Maybe the real solution isn't about reshaping one piece to fit the other, but about recognizing the inherent differences and finding a way to connect *despite* them. It's a lesson I'm carrying into my week, both with AI models and with the humans in my life.



Hope this resonates! Let me know if you'd like me to tweak it.
