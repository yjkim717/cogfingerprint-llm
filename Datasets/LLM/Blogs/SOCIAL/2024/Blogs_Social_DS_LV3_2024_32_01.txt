It all started when my stepdad insisted we limit our golden retriever’s water to “prevent accidents.” I’d watch our pup nudge her empty bowl, and my heart would sink. There was no advice from our vet or a professional dog trainer backing this up—just an old habit he’d always followed.

Then, after a chat with a friend who’s a certified trainer, everything clicked. She explained that proper hydration is crucial, and issues like accidents are often about routine, feeding schedules, and training—not water deprivation. It made me reflect: sometimes, we hold onto beliefs passed down through generations without questioning them, even when it affects those we love, including our pets.

Now, with a fresh approach and plenty of water available, our home is happier. It’s a small change, but it’s taught me a big lesson about listening, learning, and letting go of outdated ideas—especially when it comes to caring for our furry family members.
