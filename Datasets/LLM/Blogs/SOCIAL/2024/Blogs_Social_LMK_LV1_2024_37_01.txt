As I binge-watched John Adams on HBO in 2024, a line struck me - "We are not the masters, we are the servants of history." It made me think of Rooster Teeth's founders, burning the midnight oil to shape online entertainment. Just like America's founding fathers, they're visionaries, leaving a lasting impact on their craft. Their legacy will be felt for years to come.
