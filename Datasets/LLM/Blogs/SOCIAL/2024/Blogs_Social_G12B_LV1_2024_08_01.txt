## The Red Stain & A Little Worry

Okay, so last week’s vet visit was… eventful. Little Leo got a blood draw, and now I'm staring at a distinctly crimson patch on his fluffy grey fur. The sedation's still wearing off, he's a bit wobbly, and I'm torn. Do I risk a bath now, potentially stressing him further? Or wait, hoping it dries and brushes out? 

Honestly, it's more than just the fur. It’s this little wave of worry that always hits post-vet. Anyone else feel this way? Sharing tips appreciated! #catcare #petworries #2024
