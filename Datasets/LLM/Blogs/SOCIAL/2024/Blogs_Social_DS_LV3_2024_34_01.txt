There’s something magical about slipping into a swimsuit that feels like it was made just for you—not by some giant brand, but by an independent designer pouring artistry into every stitch. This summer, I’m drawn to bikinis with delicate lace and soft frills, pieces that whisper romance and confidence. It’s more than a trend; it’s about wearing a story, celebrating individuality, and feeling utterly, beautifully yourself in 2024.
