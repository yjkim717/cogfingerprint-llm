As I watched my little one try to catch a bird in our backyard in 2024, I couldn't help but laugh at the ensuing chaos. The look of determination on their face quickly turned to surprise as they tumbled to the ground. It's moments like these that remind me of the delicate balance of parenting - knowing when to supervise and when to let childhood curiosity unfold, even if it means a few humorous mishaps along the way.
