There’s something special about feeling heard—truly listened to—by the people behind the games we love. I was thinking about this recently while playing Deep Rock Galactic, a game whose developers, Ghost Ship Games, feel more like friends than faceless corporations. They’re in the trenches with their community: transparent roadmaps, candid dev streams, and a genuine back-and-forth that makes players feel valued.

Then my mind drifted to Rocket League, a game I’ve adored for years. Since Epic Games took over, it’s felt different—like shouting into a void. Updates drop without context, feedback seems to vanish, and that sense of shared excitement has faded.

It’s 2024, and we’re craving connection more than ever. Developer interaction isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s the soul of a game’s longevity. I hope companies like Epic take a page from Ghost Ship’s playbook. Because when developers and players build something together, everyone wins.
