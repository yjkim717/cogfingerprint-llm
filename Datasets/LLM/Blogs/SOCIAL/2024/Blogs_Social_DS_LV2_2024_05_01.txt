### The Day I Almost Over-Acted My Way Out of Learning

So, there I was in my first real acting class, feeling equal parts exhilarated and utterly terrified. Our instructor gave us a deceptively simple task: "Go to a coffee shop, observe someone for ten minutes, and then embody their physical mannerisms."

Easy, right? I found my subject—a man in a tweed jacket, methodically stirring his coffee while staring into the middle distance. I noted his slight slouch, the way his fingers tapped the cup.

But then, my inner critic piped up. *This is too subtle. It’s boring. Shouldn’t you add something? A dramatic sigh? A pained, expressive grimace?*

I was so close to "improving" the performance with exaggerated facial expressions, believing it would make my work more compelling. I almost fell into the classic 2024 trap of thinking that more is more—that every emotion needs to be broadcast in high-definition for it to be valid.

But I paused. The assignment wasn’t to perform for an audience; it was to see another person. Truly see them. By trying to add a layer of "interesting," I was about to erase the quiet, authentic story he was already telling.

It hit me later: this isn't just an acting lesson. How often do we do this in our own lives? We see a friend's subtle post and amplify its meaning, or we feel a quiet sadness and judge it as not being "big" enough to count.

That day, I learned that the most powerful connection—to a character or to each other—often starts not with what we add, but with the courage to simply observe what’s already there. The truth is usually in the stir of the coffee, not the slam of the cup.
