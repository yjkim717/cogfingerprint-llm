## The Tightrope of Saying Goodbye

It's a strange thing, isn't it? How we curate narratives, especially when someone passes. I was thinking about it recently, remembering Barack Obama’s eulogy for John McCain. It wasn’t just a highlight reel of achievements; he acknowledged McCain’s stubbornness, his occasional prickly nature. And it struck me – why *do* we feel the need to include those less-than-perfect details?

Social media certainly amplifies this. We're so used to presenting polished versions of ourselves, it feels almost jarring to see vulnerability displayed, even in grief. But maybe that’s the point. Maybe acknowledging flaws – even respectfully – makes a tribute feel more *real*, more human. It’s a delicate balance, showing respect while still offering an honest reflection of a complex life. What do you think?
