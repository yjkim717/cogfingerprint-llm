It’s 2024, and I’m dusting off my PS3, wondering if anyone else out there is still holding onto SoulCalibur V. There’s something special about firing up the old console, hearing that familiar hum, and diving back into online matches—even if it takes a while to find an opponent.

I’ve been maining Devil Jin lately, grinding for those elusive Dark Knight Gauntlets, but it’s not just about the gear. It’s about the quiet hope of reconnecting with a scattered community. In an era of instant updates and crowded servers, there’s a strange comfort in this digital ghost town. Every match feels like a small victory, a nod to the players who, like me, refuse to let go.

Maybe we’re not just keeping a game alive—we’re preserving the friendships and rivalries that made it matter. Anyone else still out there?
