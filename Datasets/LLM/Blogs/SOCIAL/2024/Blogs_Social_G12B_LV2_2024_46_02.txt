## The Ghosts in Our Digital Libraries

Isn't it strange how easily things vanish? I saw a post online the other day from someone desperately trying to track down a short story collection – a black and white photo of two dogs, a specific vibe… and it just slipped away. It got me thinking about all the forgotten corners of the internet, the books and memories lost in the shuffle.

We’re building these massive digital libraries, yet finding a single, specific thing feels harder than ever. It’s a little haunting, isn’t it? Like chasing ghosts through endless pages. Makes you appreciate the tangible, the things you can hold in your hand. Anyone else feel that lately?
