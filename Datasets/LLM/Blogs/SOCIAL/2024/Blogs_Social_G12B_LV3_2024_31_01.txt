## The Empty Space at the Foot of the Bed

It’s December 23rd, 2024, and the festive cheer everyone's talking about feels…muted. A friend’s post on social media has hit me hard today, and it’s a stark reminder that joy and worry often exist side-by-side. Her little indoor cat, Taro, has gone missing. Just vanished. 

My heart aches for her. You see, Taro is more than just a pet; he’s family. And the thought of him lost and alone, especially with this biting cold, is just devastating. The worst part? She's away for Christmas, leaving a gap in Taro’s routine and her own.

It’s a potent reminder of how fragile things can be. How easily routines, comfort, and love can be disrupted. Scrolling through social media can sometimes feel like a highlight reel, but moments like these pull you right back down to earth. They remind you of the real, raw emotions people are navigating, often unseen. 

I'm sending all my positive thoughts and hoping for Taro's safe return. It’s a good lesson: check in on your loved ones, furry or otherwise, especially during the holidays. You never know who might be feeling a quiet ache of worry.
