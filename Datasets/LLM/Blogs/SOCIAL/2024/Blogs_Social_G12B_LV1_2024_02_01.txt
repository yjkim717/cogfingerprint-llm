## Adulting in Deutschland: When Your Past Gets in the Way of Finding a Couch

So, I’m officially a few months into my “adult abroad” adventure here in Germany, and let me tell you, it's been… a learning curve. I came here to study, a slightly older student than most – late twenties, life experience, you know the deal. I thought I was prepared. I'd budgeted, I had my visa, I even attempted to learn some basic German. What I *wasn’t* prepared for was the sheer, bureaucratic beast that is finding a flatshare.

Seriously. It's brutal. 

I've sent out countless applications, crafting perfect, enthusiastic messages. But time and again, I hit the same wall: the *Schufa*. Apparently, having a solid credit history is essential, even for a short-term rental. As someone who’s bounced around a bit and built a life outside of traditional German systems, I don’t have one. It’s frustrating.

Then there’s the age thing. I’ve noticed a subtle, but persistent, preference for younger applicants. Apparently, the assumption is that older students are… less reliable? More likely to move on? It feels a little unfair, honestly. I’ve got a stable income, a clear plan, and a genuine desire to be a good flatmate. 

It’s made me think a lot about how systems often prioritize a certain *type* of person - a young, financially established individual with a pristine record. It’s highlighted the challenges of navigating a new country when you don't quite fit the established mold. Thanks to "itsmydata" and similar initiatives, I'm trying to understand my data footprint better, but it’s a slow process. For now, I'm still couch-surfing, and hoping my next application finally clicks. Wish me luck!
