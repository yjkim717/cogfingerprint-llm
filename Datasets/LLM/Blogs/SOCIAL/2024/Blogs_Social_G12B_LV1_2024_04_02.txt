## The Filter & My Plate

It’s 2024, and honestly, scrolling through Instagram feels like a daily battle. Everyone’s highlight reel is a perfectly curated salad bowl or a flawlessly sculpted smoothie. I get it, aesthetics are a thing. But lately, it’s been… a lot. I find myself constantly comparing what I'm eating – or *not* eating – to what I see online. 

It's become a weird ritual: analyze, restrict, feel guilty. My energy is low, and my clothes are hanging off me.  I'm starting to wonder if this constant pressure, this chasing of an impossible ideal, has twisted into something unhealthy. Maybe I need to seriously rethink my relationship with food and, well, with social media too. Anyone else feeling this?
