As an Amazon Flex driver in 2024, I've come to realize that flexibility is a double-edged sword. When a family emergency arose, I needed time off for care. But with Amazon's hour cap in place, I worried about penalty points for not meeting the minimum hours. I wondered, is the flexibility that Amazon Flex promises just an illusion? How can we balance work and family responsibilities without facing penalties?
