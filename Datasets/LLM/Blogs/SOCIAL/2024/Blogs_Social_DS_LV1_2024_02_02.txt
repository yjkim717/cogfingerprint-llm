### Finding My VR Legs: A Small Setting That Changed Everything

I almost gave up on VR. The constant swaying in my stomach, that disorienting lurch when I moved—it was a battle. I loved the worlds, but my body hated the journey. Then, I discovered world-relative locomotion.

Instead of my character stumbling in the direction I was looking (head-oriented) or where my hand pointed (controller-oriented), I set my left thumbstick to a fixed north. Push forward, I go north. Always. It sounds simple, but it was revolutionary. My brain finally decoupled my virtual movement from my physical head turns. The dizziness vanished.

Now, with my dominant hand free, I can effortlessly manage my multi-tool or return fire while strafing. It’s no longer me fighting the controls; it’s me, fully immersed, just playing the game. Sometimes, the biggest adventures begin with a small, stable foundation.
