### The Fine Line Between a Character and a Caricature

I stood in front of my bathroom mirror last Tuesday, face contorted into what I can only describe as a “theatrical gasp.” Eyebrows practically in my hairline, jaw unhinged like a cartoon snake. My acting class assignment was to observe someone in a coffee shop and recreate their physical mannerisms. I’d chosen a man who was perpetually, hilariously surprised by the contents of his own phone.

But as I practiced, a familiar doubt crept in. Was my exaggerated version still honest? Or was I just creating a caricature for cheap entertainment?

This is the tightrope we walk, not just in acting class, but in life, especially in the hyper-visual world of 2024. On one hand, we’re told to be authentic. On the other, the digital stage rewards big, bold performances. A subtle, nuanced expression can get lost in a sea of viral Reels and TikToks that thrive on maximalist reactions.

My instructor’s advice finally cut through the noise. “Exaggeration isn’t the enemy of truth,” she said. “It’s the amplifier. The key is to start from a place of genuine observation.” I realized my mistake. I’d started with the big finish—the gasp—without building the quiet, internal moment that prompted it.

So I went back to the drawing board. I focused less on the gasp itself and more on the slight intake of breath, the quickening blink, the tiny lean forward. The exaggeration became a choice, not a default. It’s a lesson in confidence: trusting that the small, real things are strong enough to build upon. Because the most compelling performance, on stage or online, isn’t the loudest one—it’s the one that feels undeniably, humanly true.
