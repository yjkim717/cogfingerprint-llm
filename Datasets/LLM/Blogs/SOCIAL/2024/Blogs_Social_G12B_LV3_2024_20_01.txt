## The Quiet I Crave (and Why It Feels So Far Away)

It's 2024, and everyone's talking about self-care and burnout recovery. I *thought* I was on the right track â€“ meticulously planning a future trip, promising myself a serious break from work. But here's the thing: even the idea of relaxing at home feels impossible. My misophonia flares with every little sound, turning the sanctuary I need into a source of constant stress. It's a frustrating paradox. I desperately need peace, a chance to recharge, but the noise sensitivity just won't let me. Anyone else feel like recovery is a battle fought on multiple fronts?
