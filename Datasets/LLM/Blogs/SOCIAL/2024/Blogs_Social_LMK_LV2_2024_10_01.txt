As I sat with my morning coffee in 2024, I pondered the complexities of social media's impact on our lives. We share curated moments, yet feel isolated. I realized that our online presence is like a Gemma Scope - a tool meant to reveal insights, but often distorted by dimension mismatches between our true selves and our digital personas. Just as sparse autoencoders help adjust these mismatches, we must adjust our online behaviors to align with our genuine connections. By doing so, we can transform our social media experience, making it more authentic and meaningful.
