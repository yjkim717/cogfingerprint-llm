You know that moment when you’re just trying to get home after a long day, and suddenly—*thump*—a chunk of debris flies off the truck ahead and cracks your windshield? That was me last week.

I pulled over, heart pounding, and watched the truck speed off. No license plate, no witnesses. Just me, my cracked glass, and a sinking feeling.

I’d always thought dash cams were for people expecting trouble. But in that moment, I realized: it’s not about expecting the worst—it’s about being ready for the unpredictable. Now I’m dipping into my vacation fund to cover the deductible, all because of a split-second incident I couldn’t prove.

Lesson learned: sometimes the best insurance is the one that captures the truth.
