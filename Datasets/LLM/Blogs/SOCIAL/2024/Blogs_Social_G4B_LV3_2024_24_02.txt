**Is This Really What We Wanted? A Twitter Reflection**

Okay, let’s be honest – scrolling through Twitter lately feels… unsettling. It’s like watching a once-vibrant garden slowly choked by weeds. Remember when it was a chaotic, brilliant mess of ideas and connections? Now, it often feels dominated by the loudest, most divisive voices, fueled by a relentless push for… well, *something*.

I’m not going to pretend I’m immune to the frustration. The constant barrage of negativity, the blatant attempts at monetization layered over genuine conversation – it’s starting to feel like the beginning of the “dead internet” we’ve been warned about. 

It’s weird, isn’t it? We built this space to share and connect, and now it feels like a battleground. Elon Musk’s changes have certainly shaken things up, but I wonder if we’ve lost sight of what made Twitter – and social media in general – valuable in the first place.  Maybe it’s time to reassess what we’re seeking online, and where we choose to spend our attention.
