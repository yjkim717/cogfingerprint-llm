**The Weight of the Shift**

Let’s be honest, scrolling through social media lately feels… heavy. We’re all sharing snippets of our lives, highlighting the ‘good’ – the perfect vacations, the amazing promotions, the effortlessly chic outfits. But what about the quiet struggles? I’ve been feeling a lot of that lately, actually, and it’s surprisingly connected to my work as a nurse. 

Recently, I moved into a new NICU, and while the patients are incredible, the whole experience has been hitting me with a wave of dissatisfaction. Constant unit changes, a frustrating lack of autonomy – it’s breeding this unsettling career uncertainty. It’s not just about the micromanagement, it’s about feeling like my expertise isn’t valued. 

I find myself comparing my reality to everyone’s curated feeds, and it’s a painful reminder that success isn’t always a beaming highlight reel.  It's making me rethink what I truly want from my career and, honestly, exploring some options beyond this current role.  Anyone else feeling this tug between the pressure to project a perfect image and the need to prioritize their own well-being? #burnout #nursinglife #careeruncertainty
