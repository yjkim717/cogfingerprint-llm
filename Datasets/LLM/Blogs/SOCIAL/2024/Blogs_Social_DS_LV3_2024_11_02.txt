It’s funny how life can pivot in a single moment. For me, that moment came in 2024 with three words: “It’s stage 3 melanoma.”

Suddenly, words like “fundraising” and “research” weren’t just abstract concepts I saw online; they became my lifeline. They represented the scientists working tirelessly for a cure and the community that rallies around people like me. This journey has taught me that a diagnosis can feel incredibly isolating, but you are never truly alone.

That’s why I’m lacing up my shoes this fall for the AIM at Melanoma walk. It’s more than a fundraiser; it’s a powerful statement of collective hope. Every step we take and every dollar we raise fuels vital education and brings us closer to turning the tide against this disease. Your support doesn’t just fund research—it strengthens a community. Will you join us?
