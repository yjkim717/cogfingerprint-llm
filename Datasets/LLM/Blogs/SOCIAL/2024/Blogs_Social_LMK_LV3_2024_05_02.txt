As I walked out the door, feeling confident in my newfound fitness, I couldn't help but notice the side glances and comments. "You should try lifting weights," someone said. My mind began to wander - was my weight loss not enough? I realized that others' opinions often stem from their own biases, not my journey. I chose to focus on my progress, not their perceptions. My walking routine had given me a sense of self-worth; I wasn't about to let others define it.
