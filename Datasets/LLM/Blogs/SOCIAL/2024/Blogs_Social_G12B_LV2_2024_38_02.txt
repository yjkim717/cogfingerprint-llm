## The Ghosts in the Machine (and My New Novel)

So, I’m diving deep into a project that’s been rattling around in my head for ages: a spin-off novel set in the world of the Universal Monsters. Think Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolfman – that whole classic, shadowy crew. It’s thrilling, honestly, but also surprisingly tricky.

I recently saw a post from another writer struggling with the same thing. How do you maintain genuine *horror* when these characters are so ingrained in our cultural consciousness? They’re icons! We *know* Dracula. We’ve seen countless versions of him. How do you make him scary again?

It got me thinking about how familiarity breeds… well, not contempt, but maybe a kind of emotional distance. We’ve consumed so much media, we’re inoculated against a lot of the jump scares.  Real horror, I think, comes from a place of vulnerability and unsettling the familiar. It’s a challenge, especially when dealing with beloved, public domain figures steeped in dark fantasy. Wish me luck – I’m going to need it!
