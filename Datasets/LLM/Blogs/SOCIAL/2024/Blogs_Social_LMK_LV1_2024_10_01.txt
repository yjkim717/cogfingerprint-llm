As I dove into the world of local LLMs (Large Language Models) in 2024, I stumbled upon an intriguing challenge. I was experimenting with the Gemma 2 2B model, fascinated by its capabilities, and decided to integrate it with the Gemma Scope repository. However, my excitement was short-lived as I encountered a dimensionality mismatch error. It turned out that the activations from the Gemma 2 2B model didn't match the expected input dimension in the Gemma Scope repo.

After some digging, I realized that this issue wasn't unique to me; many developers were facing similar problems due to the rapidly evolving landscape of AI tools. It highlighted the need for better compatibility and documentation across different projects. This experience not only taught me the importance of checking the fine print but also the value of community-driven solutions. By sharing our struggles and workarounds, we can collectively push the boundaries of what's possible with local LLMs and sparse autoencoders.
