"Smart Home Snafus: When Automation Goes Awry. I've been loving my smart home setup, but my Inkbird humidity controller has been driving me crazy! The fans keep cycling on and off, making a racket. I've got a plexiglass panel to contain the humidity, but it's not helping. Has anyone else had issues with humidity control? It's 2024 and I'm wondering if I'm just being too nitpicky or if there's a fix out there."
