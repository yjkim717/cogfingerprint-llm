In 2024, I'm not alone in shunning sunlight. As someone with intraocular implants, natural light aversion is my reality. Harsh rays exacerbate my sensitivity to light, making artificial lighting my preference. I've learned to adapt, opting for cozy, dimly lit spaces. It's not just about comfort; it's about thriving in a world that often overlooks visual discomfort. I'm seeking understanding and connection with others who share my experience.
