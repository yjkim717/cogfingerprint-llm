As I sit at my desk, exhausted from another long day, I'm reminded that burnout is more than just being tired. For me, it's being overwhelmed by the constant noise - at work, on my commute, and even at home. Misophonia makes everyday sounds feel like nails on a chalkboard. I'm not alone; noise pollution is a growing concern. It's time to take a stand and demand a quieter, healthier work-life balance - starting with using my PTO to recharge.
