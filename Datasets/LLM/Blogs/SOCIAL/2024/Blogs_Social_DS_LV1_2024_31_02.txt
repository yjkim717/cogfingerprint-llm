### The Ghost in the Next Room: Living with a Love That's Already Gone

It’s 2024, and my biggest relationship status isn’t “single” or “it’s complicated.” It’s “roommates.”

Two years. That’s how long we built a life in this apartment. Now, we’re trying to un-build it while still sharing the same four walls. The breakup was a quiet, mutual unraveling—less a dramatic fire and more a slow, chilling leak. There was no single betrayal, just a gradual emotional abandonment that left us both stranded on our own little islands in the living room.

The logistics are a nightmare, sure. The awkward fridge-divvying and the silent negotiation over who gets the TV remote. But that’s not the hard part. The hard part is the ghost of our relationship that haunts this place. It’s in the worn spot on the couch where we’d curl up to watch movies, and in the empty space beside me in our king-sized bed, which now feels impossibly vast.

The loneliness I feel now is a different species from the kind I knew before we met. It’s a sharp, specific ache. It’s hearing his key in the lock and feeling a jolt of hope, only to remember a second later that his arrival means nothing to me anymore. It’s the silence that hangs between us, so much heavier and louder than any argument we ever had. We’ve become experts in parallel living, two satellites orbiting the same space but no longer transmitting.

Everyone asks, “When are you moving out?” as if it’s that simple. In this economy? Finding a new place feels like a distant, fictional future. So, for now, we’re stuck in this purgatory, two people grieving the same loss but doing it completely alone, just feet apart.

I’m learning that a breakup isn’t a single event; it’s a process. And sometimes, that process involves watching the person who was once your home become a polite stranger who just happens to know where you keep the extra toilet paper. You have to mourn in real-time, with the source of your heartbreak right in the next room, reminding you every day of what was, and what painfully, quietly, is no longer.
