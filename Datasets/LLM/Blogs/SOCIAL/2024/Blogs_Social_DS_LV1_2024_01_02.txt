It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what makes a community feel alive. I remember logging into Rocket League a few months back, excited for some news—only to find the usual silence from Epic. No streams, no roadmap, just… radio silence. It felt like shouting into a void.

Then I stumbled onto a Ghost Ship Games dev stream for Deep Rock Galactic. The difference was night and day. The developers were right there, laughing, answering questions, and sharing their two-year roadmap like we were all in it together. It wasn’t just about updates; it was a conversation.

That’s when it hit me: real community isn’t built on big announcements or flashy trailers. It’s built on showing up, listening, and making people feel heard. In a world where so much feels disconnected, those little moments of connection—like a developer remembering your username—are everything. Ghost Ship gets it. I wish more companies did, too.
