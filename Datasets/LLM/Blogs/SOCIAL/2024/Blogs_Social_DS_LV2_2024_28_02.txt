At 21, I’m learning that cutting back doesn’t mean missing out. With addiction in my family, every social event felt like a tightrope walk—work happy hours, weekend parties. But stepping back from the drinking culture has been freeing. I order a sparkling water, focus on conversations, and wake up clear-headed. It’s not about saying no to fun, but yes to myself. Moderation isn’t a limit; it’s my choice. And honestly? I’ve never felt more present in my own life.
