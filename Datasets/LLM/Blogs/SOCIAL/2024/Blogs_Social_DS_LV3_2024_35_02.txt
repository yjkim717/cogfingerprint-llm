### The Unlikely MVP: How My Worst Fighter Became My Favorite Character

It’s 2024, and in my latest playthrough, I decided to do something different. I’m playing as Karlach, the fiery-hearted tiefling, and I’ve set my romantic sights on the enigmatic cleric, Shadowheart. I’ll be honest, I chose her Trickery Domain for the story flavor, fully expecting her to be a bit of a liability in a straight fight. Let’s just say her accuracy with a mace is… aspirational.

But something magical happened. While Karlach was cleaving through the front lines, Shadowheart was just… standing there. Enemies would swarm her, blades flashing, and they’d just clang harmlessly off her absurdly high armor class. She became this unshakeable pillar on the battlefield, a master of survival who simply outlasted everyone.

It completely reframed the game for me. I stopped seeing her as a character who *couldn't* land a hit and started seeing her as the one who *refused* to fall. In a world—both in-game and out—that often feels like it’s about dealing the biggest blow or getting the final word, there’s a profound strength in just being the one who remains standing. My romance with Shadowheart wasn’t just about sweet conversations; it was built on the trust that she’d always have my back, a quiet, resilient force ensuring we made it through another day, together. Sometimes, the real power isn't in the flashy attack, but in the unwavering will to endure.
