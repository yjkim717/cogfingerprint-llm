## The Weight of Stone and Choice: My Baldur's Gate 3 Gamble

Okay, so I’m three playthroughs deep into Baldur's Gate 3, and this one… this one feels different. I just wrapped up Grymforge, and I *know* I’ve veered way off the beaten path. I sided with Nere, essentially throwing the Duergar under the bus and aligning myself with the Gondians. It felt right in the moment, a pragmatic choice fueled by a desire to help those who seemed most vulnerable. But now, staring down Act 2, I’m genuinely anxious. Did I just lock myself into a world of trouble? It’s a fascinating reminder that even in a game, choices have consequences, and sometimes, the most interesting stories are the ones you don't see coming.
