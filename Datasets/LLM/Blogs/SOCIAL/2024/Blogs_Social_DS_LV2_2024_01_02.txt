It’s 2024, and I’ve been thinking a lot lately about what makes a game feel alive—not just the graphics or mechanics, but the people behind it. I remember playing Rocket League and feeling disconnected from Epic Games, like shouting into a void with no echo. The silence on roadmaps and updates left our community guessing, and honestly, it stung.

Then I tried Deep Rock Galactic by Ghost Ship Games, and wow—what a difference. Their developers don’t just release patches; they chat with us, share insights, and listen. It’s like having a conversation with friends who happen to make an awesome game.

It hit me: in gaming, as in life, connection is everything. When developers engage openly, it transforms pixels and code into a shared experience. Here’s hoping more companies learn that lesson—because a game without a heart is just software.
