## The WiFi Dilemma: Still Paying a Premium at Sea?

Okay, fellow cruisers, let's talk about something we all grapple with: internet at sea. I’m planning a Norwegian Cruise Line trip later this year, and I've been diving deep into their WiFi packages. Honestly, I’m a little disappointed. 

It feels like, in 2024, we *expect* some decent deals on connectivity. I've been checking out other lines, and they seem to offer more flexible options and occasional discounts. NCL? Not so much. 

Does anyone else feel like they’re paying a premium just to check emails and maybe post a quick Instagram story while sailing? I'm hoping to find a hidden gem, a special promotion, *something* to ease the sting. Any tips or past experiences with NCL WiFi deals would be hugely appreciated! Let's share the knowledge!
