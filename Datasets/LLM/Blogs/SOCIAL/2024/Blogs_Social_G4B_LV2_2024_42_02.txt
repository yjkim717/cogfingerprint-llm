**The Weight of a Brushstroke**

It’s funny how memories can cling to the most unexpected things. I was thinking about my dad this week, and it brought back a vivid image: him, completely absorbed in painting my childhood drawings. Not *with* me, but *of* me, meticulously recreating my crayon masterpieces in layers of paint. 

It started as a sweet gesture, a way to remember. But as I got older, it felt…heavy. Like a constant pressure, a need to capture and control my evolving self. Now, looking back, I realize it might have been a way for him to manage his own anxiety, a repetitive behavior mirroring my own attempts to find stability. It’s a strange, poignant reminder of the complex dynamics within a parent-child relationship, and how even love can sometimes feel like a weight.
