As I sat down to write my Universal Monsters novel, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was veering off course. I wanted to craft a chilling Horror story, but the more I wrote, the more it seemed to morph into Dark Fantasy. I worried that I was losing the essence of the classic monsters that have captivated audiences for decades, from Dracula to Frankenstein. I'm seeking feedback: am I alone in this struggle, or are others also blurring the lines between Horror and Dark Fantasy in their writing?
