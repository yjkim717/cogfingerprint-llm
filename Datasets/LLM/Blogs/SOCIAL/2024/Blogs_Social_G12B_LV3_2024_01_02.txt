## The Echo in the Arena: When Developers Stop Listening

It’s 2024, and we’re all pretty savvy about how companies *should* interact with their player base, right? Yet, I've been wrestling with a feeling lately, especially when thinking about *Rocket League*. It's a game I love, have sunk countless hours into, but something feels…off.

There's a disconnect. Epic Games, with all its resources, sometimes feels distant. It’s a stark contrast to what I’ve seen from smaller studios like Ghost Ship Games (Sea of Thieves, anyone?). They've built a *community*, a genuine dialogue where feedback feels heard and acted upon. 

It makes you wonder, doesn't it? Is scale inherently detrimental to connection? Is it possible to maintain that vital, responsive relationship with a player base when you're a massive corporation? 

I miss that feeling of being seen, of knowing your voice matters. It's not just about getting the features you want; it's about feeling valued as part of the game's ongoing evolution. Maybe it's time for a serious reflection on how we, as players, can advocate for more meaningful engagement.
