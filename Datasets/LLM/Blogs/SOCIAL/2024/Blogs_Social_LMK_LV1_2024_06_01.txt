As I gazed out at the shattered remains of my windshield in January 2024, I couldn't help but think about the countless times I'd narrowly avoided similar incidents on the road. A hit-and-run driver had struck my car, leaving me shaken and a valuable lesson. This close call drove home the importance of having a dash cam installed - not just for insurance purposes, but as a safeguard against vandalism and a witness to driving hazards. In an era where road safety is paramount, I'm now a staunch advocate for dash cams, having learned the hard way.
