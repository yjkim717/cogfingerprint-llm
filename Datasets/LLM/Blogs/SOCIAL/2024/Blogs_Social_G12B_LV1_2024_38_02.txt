## The Shadows Between the Frames: Building a World Worth Haunting

It's funny, isn't it? How certain things just *feel* right, even if they're decades old. Lately, I've been completely consumed by the Universal Monsters. Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolfman… that whole era of classic horror just has a weight to it, a specific atmosphere that modern stuff often misses.

I'm actually working on a novel now, a sort of spin-off that delves into the underlying rules of that universe. What *really* powers Dracula’s immortality? What’s the science (or dark magic!) behind the transformations? It's a fascinating rabbit hole, and the fact that these characters are now firmly in the public domain is just incredible.

But here’s the thing: I want to do it justice. I don’t want to turn it into a cheesy, action-packed romp. This is about dread, about the uncanny, about the kind of slow-burn horror that gets under your skin. So, I'm reaching out! What are *your* expectations? What elements of the Universal Monsters feel absolutely essential to preserve? Let's build this world together, and keep the shadows long and the fear real. Hit me with your thoughts in the comments – I'm genuinely eager to hear them!
