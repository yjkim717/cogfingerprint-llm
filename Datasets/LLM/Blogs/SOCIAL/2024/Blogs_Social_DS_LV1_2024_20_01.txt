It’s 2024, and I’m supposed to be recharging during my PTO, but my misophonia has other plans. Every neighbor’s leaf blower or distant TV laugh track feels like a personal attack. I came home to escape burnout, but instead, I’m trapped in a cycle of noise and stress. My sanctuary has become a sensory minefield. I scroll through social feeds seeing others unwind effortlessly, and I wonder—does anyone else feel this way? Sometimes, the loudest battles are the ones no one else can hear.
