## The Tiny Annoyance That Undermines My Reading Life

Okay, Goodreads, we need to talk. It's 2024, and I’m still banging my head against the mobile site trying to update my reading progress. Seriously, just *marking* a book as "currently reading" isn’t enough! I want to log chapters, percentages… anything beyond that binary state. It's a small thing, I know, but these little UI frustrations really chip away at the joy of tracking my reading journey. Is it too much to ask for a smoother experience?
