**Lost in the Algorithm, Found in a Band**

Okay, real talk â€“ 2024 feels like a constant scroll. Itâ€™s easy to get swallowed by endless feeds, chasing the next viral sound. But lately, Iâ€™ve been intentionally *getting lost*. I stumbled across Garden Home through a friendâ€™s recommendation, originally while exploring a screamo bandâ€™s EP. 

Then, I pre-ordered their new self-titled album! It's such a cool feeling, this unexpected music discovery. It reminds me that the best things aren't always shouted from the rooftops â€“ sometimes theyâ€™re quietly waiting to be found in the depths of the internet.  Anyone else feeling this lately? ðŸŽ§ #musicdiscovery #posthardcore #gardenhome
