## The Slow Fade of the Town Square

It's strange, isn't it? How something you once found endlessly fascinating can just…lose its luster. I've been thinking a lot about Twitter lately, or X, or whatever it’s calling itself this week. Remember when it felt like the digital town square? A chaotic, sometimes infuriating, but ultimately vibrant place where news broke, conversations sparked, and you could connect with people from all walks of life?

Now? It feels…different. A little hollow. A little…sad.

I won't rehash the headlines. We all know the story. The rapid changes, the shifting priorities, and the constant feeling that something's just *off*. It’s hard to ignore the sheer volume of bots and questionable accounts that seem to dominate the feed. Scams feel bolder, and the overall tone has shifted – a pervasive undercurrent of negativity and, frankly, toxicity. 

It’s almost perverse, I admit. Part of me feels a strange, unsettling satisfaction witnessing this decline. It's like watching a once-beloved landmark slowly crumble. There's a morbid curiosity, a sense of inevitability. But mostly, there’s just a quiet disappointment.

I still log on occasionally, out of habit more than anything. I scroll, I observe, and then I log off, feeling a little emptier than when I started. Perhaps this is just the natural evolution of social media. Maybe the town square needs to relocate, find a new digital home. Or perhaps, it's a reminder that even the most revolutionary platforms aren't immune to change – and sometimes, change isn't for the better.



What about you? How do you feel about the current state of social media?
