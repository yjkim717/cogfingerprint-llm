## The World is Bright, But My Eyes…

Something shifted for me this year. It’s not a dramatic change, but a quiet, persistent sensitivity to light. I used to love basking in sunshine, but now even a moderately bright day feels… overwhelming. It’s a strange feeling, this disconnect from something so universally enjoyed.

I recently learned from a Reddit thread that others experience this, particularly those with cataracts and subsequent intraocular implants. It’s a surprising connection! It’s comforting, in a way, to know I’m not alone. 

This isn’t about sadness; it’s about adjusting. Finding ways to navigate a world designed for bright light when my eyes prefer the gentle glow of dusk. It's a reminder that our experiences are unique, and sometimes, our perception of the world changes in unexpected ways.
