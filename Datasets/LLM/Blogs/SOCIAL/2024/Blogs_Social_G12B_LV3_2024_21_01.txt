## The Weight of a Degree (and a Growing Pile of Rejection Emails)

Okay, let's be real. Graduating with a mechanical engineering degree felt like reaching the summit. Four years of late nights, exams, and caffeine-fueled projects – I was ready to conquer the world! It's 2024, and the world feels… less conquerable.

The job search has been brutal. Endless applications, automated rejections, and the gnawing feeling that maybe I chose the wrong path. I'm staring down the possibility of taking a technician role at a company where I interned – a good opportunity, sure, but it feels like a step *back* after all that effort. 

It's not about the money, though that's a factor. It's the fear that this hard-earned degree might just be… a piece of paper. A really expensive piece of paper. Anyone else ever felt that crushing weight of expectation versus reality? Let’s chat. Seriously. I need to know I’m not alone in this career frustration.
