## Wrestling with Monsters (and Lore!)

Okay, fellow creatives, I’m facing a fun, yet tricky challenge! I’m diving into a Universal Monsters spin-off novel – think Dracula, Frankenstein, the whole classic crew. It’s incredibly exciting, but also comes with a responsibility. 

I'm really trying to honor the original horror vibe, not veer into dark fantasy. Specifically, I’m grappling with Dracula’s brides and any potential offspring. The established lore is…complex, to say the least! It's easy to get carried away with elaborate backstories, but I want to preserve that unsettling, primal fear at the heart of the character. 

Anyone else ever felt that pressure when building on existing legends? What's your strategy for respecting the source material while still forging your own path? Let's chat in the comments!
