"As I watched our mischievous cat, Whiskers, let our pet bird fly free only to try and catch it again, I couldn't help but think about the delicate balance between freedom and captivity. In 2024, as we navigate our own lives, we often find ourselves torn between holding on and letting go. Whiskers' antics reminded me that sometimes, releasing our grip can be the most liberating act of all - just like when we finally released the bird outside, safe and sound."
