"As I scrolled through my social media feeds in 2024, I couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment. The same mainstream swimwear brands were dominating my screens, with their sleek, minimalist designs. I yearned for something more - a frilly, lacey bikini with cute bows, Ã  la Love and Lemons. So, I started digging into independent designers and lesser-known swim brands, and discovered a treasure trove of unique, eye-catching swimwear that made my summer."
