Navigating Food Freedom: Understanding ARFID and Dining Out. 
In 2024, being mindful of others' needs is more important than ever, especially when it comes to dining out.

By accommodating simple requests like this, we can make a big difference in someone's day. This experience reminds us that being understanding and flexible when interacting with businesses can greatly impact individuals dealing with food allergies or eating disorders, promoting a more inclusive environment for everyone.
