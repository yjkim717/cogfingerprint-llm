My M2/M7 crawl today was a brutal two-hour reminder of our fragile work-life balance. Stuck in gridlock, I realized my laptop was right there in the passenger seat. By the time I inched forward, I'd already logged on from the car. It's 2024â€”maybe the daily commute is the real traffic jam for progress. Sometimes, the road less traveled is the one that doesn't move at all.
