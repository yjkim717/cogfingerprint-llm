"Getting Lost in the Vastness of Space: A VR Conundrum"

As I dove back into No Man's Sky in VR mode in 2024, I found myself craving a more immersive experience. Specifically, I wanted to control my locomotion with my left hand using the controller.

After some digging, I discovered a solution that allowed me to navigate the game's vast universe with ease. For fellow VR enthusiasts, I'm sharing my findings - a game-changer for controller-oriented locomotion.
