**The Quiet Hunger**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a perfectly normal scroll through Instagram can feel like a tiny, insidious battle? Lately, I’ve been noticing this… a persistent, quiet hunger that isn’t about food. It’s about feeling constantly judged, about comparing myself to everyone’s curated highlight reel. I caught myself staring at my reflection today, feeling acutely aware of how underweight I’ve become, and a little voice whispered, “Is this more than just a phase?”  I’m trying to remember that my worth isn't measured in likes, and that my anxiety doesn't need to dictate my food choices.  It's a work in progress.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
