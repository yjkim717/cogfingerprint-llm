**The Weight of “Should”**

Let’s be honest, social media can be a minefield, right? Scrolling through feeds filled with beaming families and idyllic baby photos can sometimes feel…heavy. I’ve noticed a trend lately – a subtle, yet persistent, pressure to be ‘doing’ something significant, something that aligns with the unspoken expectation of adulthood: having kids. 

Recently, I read a really poignant Reddit thread about a person grappling with their parents’ relentless desire for grandchildren. It wasn’t just about a simple dislike of children; it was layered with anxieties about the future – the cost of raising a family in this economy, the feeling that a child’s potential might be limited by the choices we make for them. 

It really resonated with me. We’re living in a time where personal autonomy feels increasingly fragile.  There’s a huge generational difference in how we view success and fulfillment. For my parents’ generation, perhaps having a family was the default. But for many of us in 2024, choosing a childfree life – or prioritizing other passions – feels like a brave, deliberate act. 

It's not about rejecting family entirely; it’s about defining *my* family, *my* values, and *my* future, without the constant echo of “should.”  And honestly, that takes a lot of courage.  What about you? Are you feeling the weight of “should” too?
