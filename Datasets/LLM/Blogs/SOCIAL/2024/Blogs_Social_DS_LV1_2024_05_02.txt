It’s 2024, and I’m 32. After months of walking daily, I’ve lost weight and feel healthier. But lately, I’m getting concerned comments: “You need to eat more,” or “Try lifting weights.” It’s strange—I thought this was progress. Now I’m questioning my own reflection. Is it about health, or others’ expectations? Social feedback can cloud the pride in personal achievements. I’m learning to trust how I feel, not just how I’m seen. After all, my journey is mine alone.
