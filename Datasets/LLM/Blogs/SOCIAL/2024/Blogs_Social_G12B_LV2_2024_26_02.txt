## The Tiny Pup and the Big Worry: Navigating Dog Introductions

Just saw a post on Reddit that really struck a chord. Someone’s bringing home a chihuahua puppy and already fretting about introducing it to their schnauzer – specifically, the dreaded prey drive. It's a feeling I totally get! Bringing a new dog into a pack is always a leap of faith. 

We all want harmony, right? It’s a reminder that dog ownership isn’t just about cuddles and cute photos. It's about careful planning, understanding canine behaviour, and a whole lot of patience. Wishing that Redditor all the best – slow introductions and positive reinforcement are key! Anyone else been through this? Share your tips!
