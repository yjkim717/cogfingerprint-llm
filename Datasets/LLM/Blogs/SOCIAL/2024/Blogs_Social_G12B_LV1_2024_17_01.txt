## Eight Weeks and a Whole Lot of Questions

Okay, friends, I need to vent a little, and maybe get some perspective. I landed a job at a Level III NICU back in January, and honestly, the first couple of weeks felt like a dream. Tiny humans, incredible technology, a chance to *really* make a difference. I was so excited!

But… the shine has definitely worn off. It's not the work itself – caring for these babies is still incredibly rewarding. It's… everything else.

There's a palpable sense of a closed-off culture here. It feels like there’s an established “inner circle” of nurses, and as the newbie, I'm very much on the outside looking in. Lunch breaks are eaten in small, tight groups, and when I try to join in, the conversation just… stops. Awkward silence. Smiles that don’t quite reach the eyes.

Even more frustrating is the micromanagement. Every. Single. Thing. needs to be checked and double-checked. I get it, it's a high-stakes environment, but the constant hovering and second-guessing is stifling. And the attendance policy? Forget being sick. Even a doctor's appointment requires a mountain of paperwork and feels like a personal failing.

They’ve also implemented these “patient pods,” which, in theory, are great for continuity of care. But in practice, it just means more isolation and less collaboration with the wider team.

So, here's the big question I've been wrestling with: Is it okay to walk away after just eight weeks? I feel guilty, like I haven't given it a fair shot. But is enduring this environment – this constant scrutiny and feeling like an outsider – worth it? I’m genuinely torn.  Anyone else ever felt this way in a new job? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
