Navigating the Quest for Affordable Accommodation in Dusseldorf. 
As I settled into my new life in Dusseldorf in 2024, eager to dive into the Artificial Intelligence and Data Science program at Heinrich Heine University, one challenge loomed large - finding affordable accommodation. As an older international student, I faced a unique set of hurdles. The hunt for student housing was grueling; options were limited, and prices were steep. I wasn't alone in this struggle. Many of my peers were in the same boat, scrambling to secure a place to call home amidst the rising costs of living. The quest for affordability became a defining aspect of my student life. It forced me to explore beyond the university's offerings, seeking out local solutions and connecting with fellow students to share resources. Though daunting, this journey taught me valuable lessons about resilience and the importance of community in overcoming the challenges of studying abroad.
