"As I considered adopting a chihuahua in 2024, I worried about how my schnauzer would react. With its high prey drive, I wasn't sure if they'd get along. But I was determined to give it a try. After some careful introductions and patience, they became unlikely friends. It was a heartwarming reminder that with love and effort, even the most unlikely pets can become a harmonious family."
