It’s funny—sometimes the smallest mismatch can throw everything off balance. I was working with the Gemma 2 2B model recently, trying to align activations with SAEs in the Gemma Scope repo, and ran straight into a dimension mismatch. It felt like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

I spent hours wrestling with zero-padding and projection methods, wondering if I was on the right track. In a way, it reminded me of those moments in life when we try to force connections that just aren’t meant to be—whether in friendships or collaborations. The frustration is real, but so is the clarity that comes from stepping back, asking for advice, and finding a better way to bridge the gap. It’s a reminder that even in tech, patience and community support make all the difference.
