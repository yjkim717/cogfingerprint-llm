"As I dove into the world of DeFi on Scallop in 2024, I wondered: what happens to my staked SUI when I opt for liquid staking? Will its value still match the market price when I withdraw? After digging deeper, I discovered that liquid staking derivatives like sSUI are designed to mirror the underlying SUI's value. This means that, in theory, the value of my staked SUI should remain tied to its market price, giving me the flexibility to use my assets elsewhere while still earning staking rewards. What a game-changer for DeFi users like me!"
