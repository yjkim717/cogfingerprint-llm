## The Boxes Are Almost Gone (and So is the Certainty)

Okay, deep breath. It’s been…a month. A month since Liam and I officially stopped being "us." Two years. Two years feels like a lifetime, and also like it evaporated in a puff of unanswered texts and increasingly awkward silences. It’s weird, isn't it, how something that felt so solid, so *permanent*, can just…shift?

I’m sitting surrounded by cardboard. Not the fun, holiday-decorations kind of cardboard. The sad, "my-life-has-been-rearranged" kind. I’m moving. Which, honestly, felt like the only logical next step. Staying in *our* apartment, with *our* furniture, looking at the spot where *he* used to sit… it was just too much. Every corner held a memory, and most of those memories were good, genuinely good. But the weight of what *isn’t* anymore? Suffocating.

The rental market in this city is *brutal* right now, too. Seriously, 2024 is wild. I feel like I’ve applied to a million places, battled bidding wars with people who clearly have more disposable income than I do, and gotten rejected for reasons ranging from "not enough income relative to rent" (thanks, inflation!) to “your cat looks suspicious.” My cat, Mr. Fluffernutter, is a perfectly respectable gentleman. He just prefers dramatic entrances.

It’s not just the logistics that are throwing me, though. It’s the…emptiness. The quiet. I’m used to having someone around. Someone to share a cup of coffee with in the morning, someone to debate the merits of different streaming shows with, someone to just *be* with. Now, it’s just me and Mr. Fluffernutter, and while he’s a great companion, he’s not exactly a conversationalist.

People keep saying things like, “You’ll be fine! You’re strong!” And I appreciate the sentiment, I really do. But it's hard to feel strong when you're sorting through a box of photos and realizing how much of your life was intertwined with someone else. It’s hard to feel fine when you’re staring at an empty space on your couch and wondering what your future even *looks* like without them in it.

I’m trying to focus on the positives. This is a fresh start. A chance to rediscover who *I* am, independent of a relationship. A chance to decorate a space that’s entirely *mine*. And, honestly, a chance to finally binge-watch that reality show Liam always made fun of.

The boxes are almost gone. The apartment is almost empty. And while the certainty of the future is still a little shaky, I’m starting to feel…okay. Maybe even a little hopeful. One cardboard box, one apartment application, one dramatic cat entrance at a time.
