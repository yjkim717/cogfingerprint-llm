It’s 2024, and I’ve spent months trying to automate my way to the perfect indoor environment—humidity controllers, fans whirring on cue, even plexiglass barriers to direct airflow. I thought if I could just optimize every variable, I’d find balance. But lately, I’ve realized something: life, like humidity, has its own rhythms.

Sometimes the fans kick in too late, or the readings spike unexpectedly. At first, it frustrated me. Now? I’m learning to accept the fluctuations. Control isn’t about eliminating every variable—it’s about creating a space where you can breathe, even when things aren’t perfect. In a world pushing for total automation, maybe the real stability comes from embracing imperfection and trusting the process, not just the system.
