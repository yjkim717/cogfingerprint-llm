Scrolling through Goodreads on my phone again, stuck. Marked it "currently reading," but the progress bar is frozen. In 2024, we can share our lives in an instant, yet this simple update—a page number—feels like a social failure. It’s a small, quiet reminder of how our digital connections are sometimes just out of reach, leaving our stories untold.
