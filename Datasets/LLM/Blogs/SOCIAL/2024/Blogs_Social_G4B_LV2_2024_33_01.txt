**The Parking Lot Mirror**

Anyone else feel like parking lots are just… stressful? Last week, I had a mini-meltdown at a grocery store. Seriously, the visibility was awful – a thick line of bushes completely blocked the view when I was trying to pull out. It made me realize how much we rely on those little cues, and how easily a smaller car can get lost in the chaos. It’s a weird reflection, isn’t it?  A reminder to be patient, and maybe a little more aware of our surroundings, both on the road and in the social sphere.

Would you like me to tweak this or create a different version?
