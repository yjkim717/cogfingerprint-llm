### The Unseen Pebble: A Year of Wondering

It all started with a backache I swore was from lifting a heavy box. But the pain quickly morphed into a sharp, stabbing sensation that left me curled up in the ER. The diagnosis was swift: a kidney stone. I remember the surreal mix of relief and dread. Relief to have a name for the agony, dread for the infamous "passing" process everyone warns you about.

After a powerful NSAID injection eased the crisis, I went home armed with a strainer and instructions. I drank water until I felt like a human aquarium, waiting for the tiny, jagged proof of my ordeal. It never came.

Every twinge in my back, no matter how minor, makes me wonder—is that little stone still in there, just… waiting? It’s a quiet reminder of how our bodies can hold onto things, long after the initial pain has faded. Sometimes, the most persistent aches aren’t physical at all, but the lingering echo of an unanswered question.
