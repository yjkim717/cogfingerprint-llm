"Stuck in Limbo: The Post-Grad Blues of Job Hunting"

As I scrolled through my job applications, the number stared back at me like a cruel joke - 427 and counting. It's been months since I graduated with an engineering degree, and the job market still seems like a distant dream.

In 2024, with the job market still recovering, it's hard not to feel like I'm settling. Many of my friends are in the same boat, struggling to land a job that matches their degree. As I ponder my next step, I'm reminded that it's okay to take a detour. Perhaps this technician role is not a consolation prize, but a chance to gain experience and lay the groundwork for a brighter future.
