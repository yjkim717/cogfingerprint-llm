This third playthrough in Grymforge felt different. Saving Nere and the gondians wasn't just a quest—it was a choice about community over conflict. In 2024's divided world, that small act of unity in a game reminded me how powerful solidarity can be, even in pixels. It’s the connections we foster that truly save us.
