Ever since my lens implants, I’ve become the friend who dims the lights. My friends used to tease me for keeping the blinds shut, but natural light indoors? It’s harsh—all glare and cold edges. Give me the soft, warm glow of a lamp any day.

It’s funny how something so small reshapes your social space. Now, our gatherings are cozier, lit by gentle artificial light that feels like a hug. Who knew my eyes would turn me into the unofficial ambiance curator? Sometimes, limitations bring their own kind of warmth.
