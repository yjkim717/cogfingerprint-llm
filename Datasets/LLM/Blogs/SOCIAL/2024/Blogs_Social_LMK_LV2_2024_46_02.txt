As I scroll through my social media feed in 2024, I'm struck by the nostalgia of old photographs. A black-and-white photo can evoke a powerful sense of timelessness. It reminds me of a short story collection I once read, with a cover that has long since faded from memory. Published sometime between the late 80s and early 2000s, this contemporary American literature gem has left a lasting impression. I'm on a mission to rediscover it - can you help me identify the book that has been lingering in my mind for years?
