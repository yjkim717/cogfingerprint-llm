## The Pivot I Wasn’t Expecting

It’s officially been six months since graduation, and the “fresh engineer” sheen is definitely fading. Remember all those LinkedIn pep talks about how my mechanical engineering degree would open doors? Yeah, well, those doors seem to be locked tighter than Fort Knox. I’ve sent out *so* many applications, tailored cover letters, even tried the whole “connect with everyone” strategy. The silence is deafening.

Honestly, the rejection is starting to sting. I'm starting to question if I should have specialized more. Or maybe just…applied somewhere else?

Then, an email popped up. My old internship supervisor at MedTech Solutions. They're looking for a technician. Not the glamorous engineering role I envisioned, but it *is* a foot in the door. A guaranteed paycheck. A chance to be around the kind of innovation I crave.

It feels like a pivot, a temporary detour from the grand plan. But maybe sometimes the path you *thought* you were on isn’t the right one. Maybe building a solid foundation, even as a technician, is exactly what I need right now.  Wish me luck - I'm seriously considering it. #engineeringlife #jobsearch #pivot #medtech #2024struggles
