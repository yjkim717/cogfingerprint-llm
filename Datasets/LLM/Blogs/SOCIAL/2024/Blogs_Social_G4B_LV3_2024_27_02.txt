**Swipe Fatigue: Is Anyone Really *Seeing* Me?**

Okay, let’s be real. 2024 feels… exhausting. Especially when it comes to dating. I’ve been wading through a swamp of ghosting, breadcrumbing, and just plain, frustrating rejection lately. It’s not just the initial sting of a ‘no’ – though that definitely hurts – it’s the *pattern* that’s starting to creep in. 

I used to fall for the curated highlight reels, the witty bios, the promises of “deep connection” on those dating apps. I’d invest time, energy, and a little bit of my heart, only to be met with silence. It’s breeding this uncomfortable loneliness, a feeling that maybe I’m somehow doing something wrong. 

I'm starting to question everything – the whole “find your person” narrative. Is it even real anymore? Or are we just chasing a manufactured ideal, endlessly scrolling, and feeling more isolated with each swipe? 

Honestly, I’m wrestling with disappointment.  I want genuine connection, not just fleeting validation.  I’m trying to shift my focus inwards, to explore what *I* want and need, rather than trying to fit into someone else’s version of a relationship.  It's a slow process, and there are days when the frustration is overwhelming, but I’m determined to find a space where I’m actually seen – not just for a quick scroll.

Would you like me to refine this further, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or tone?
