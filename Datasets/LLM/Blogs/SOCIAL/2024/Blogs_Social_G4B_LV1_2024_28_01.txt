**Disconnect to Connect**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Scrolling through Reddit, seeing everyone’s curated lives, while my own felt completely…offline. Lately, I’ve been spending every possible hour with my dad. He’s not doing great, and it’s a stark reminder that life moves fast, even when you’re trying to slow down.

Maybe disconnecting from the digital world is the only way to truly connect with what matters.
