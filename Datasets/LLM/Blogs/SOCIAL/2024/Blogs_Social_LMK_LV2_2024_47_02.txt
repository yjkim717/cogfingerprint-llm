As I sat with my controller, reflecting on my third playthrough of Horizon Zero Dawn, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. The memories of Aloy's journey through a world overrun by machines still lingered vividly in my mind. Now, with Horizon Forbidden West on the horizon, I found myself at a crossroads. Should I dive back into the world of Aloy on my trusty PS4 or wait for the PS5 version? It's 2024, and gaming has come a long way, but for me, it's not just about the graphics or the tech – it's about the experience. As I weigh my options, I'm reminded of how gaming has become a significant part of my social life. The friends I've made, the late-night conversations about game lore, and the shared excitement for new releases have all become integral to my gaming journey. So, PS4 or PS5 – the decision isn't just about the console; it's about reliving the magic with the community I love.
