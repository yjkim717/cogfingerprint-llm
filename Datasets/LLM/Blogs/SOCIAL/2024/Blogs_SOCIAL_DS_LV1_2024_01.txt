### The Empty Litter Box

It’s the small, silent things that get you. For me, it’s the sight of a perfectly clean, unused litter box in the corner of my friend’s apartment.

Just last week, her cat Taro—a dedicated indoor prince who’s never known a world beyond these four walls—slipped out a door left ajar too long. He vanished into a January freeze so severe the weather apps sent hypothermia warnings. The digital world of 2024, with its pet-tracking gadgets we all meant to buy, suddenly felt useless.

My friend’s distress is a physical weight in the room. We’ve done all the modern things: shared his picture across every social feed, alerted the neighborhood app, and walked the icy streets calling his name until our own faces went numb.

But this experience has revealed a different, warmer network. Neighbors we’ve only ever nodded to are now checking their sheds and under their decks. A community, usually existing in parallel digital and physical spaces, has fused into a single, determined search party. It’s a powerful reminder that when a small life is on the line, our most essential technology isn't an app—it's simply looking out for one another. We’re holding onto hope, and that clean litter box, for his return.
