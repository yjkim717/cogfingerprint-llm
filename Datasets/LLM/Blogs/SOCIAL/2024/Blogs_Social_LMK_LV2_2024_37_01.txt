As I binge-watched the HBO show John Adams in 2024, a particular line struck a chord - "They're not a club, they're a revolution." Reflecting on the American Revolution, I drew a parallel between the Founding Fathers and the Rooster Teeth founders. Both groups of visionary individuals challenged the status quo, driving change and innovation. Their passion and perseverance continue to inspire new generations, reminding us that revolution can take many forms, both online and offline.
