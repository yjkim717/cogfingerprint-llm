>## Is it Just Me? Navigating the NICU Transition and a Whole Lot of Butterflies

Okay, let's be real. Anyone else ever feel like you're standing on the edge of a cliff, butterflies doing acrobatic routines in your stomach, and wondering if you’re about to jump or if you're completely crazy for even considering it? That's pretty much where I’m at right now.

I recently transitioned into a new role in the NICU – Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, for those unfamiliar – and I'm… well, I'm feeling a lot. Excitement, definitely. A huge sense of privilege to be caring for these tiny, fragile lives. But also, a significant dose of apprehension.

Part of it is the sheer intensity of the environment. The constant beeping, the complex equipment, the weight of responsibility… it's a far cry from my previous role. And honestly, the orientation period felt… short. Really short. Like, “learn everything about neonatal physiology and critical care in two weeks” short. I’m trying to soak it all in, asking a million questions, but sometimes I feel like I’m drowning in information.

Adding to the mix is an upcoming unit restructure. Changes are happening fast, and it’s hard to feel settled when the ground is shifting beneath your feet. It makes it difficult to establish a solid foundation, you know? 

Then there’s the preceptor situation. While I appreciate the support I *have* received, it's been a little inconsistent. Some days I feel confident and guided, other days I’m left feeling a little lost, wondering if I'm missing something crucial. 

So, I'm sitting here, in 2024, feeling a little vulnerable, and wondering if these feelings are just… normal? Is it just me who feels this overwhelmed during a big job transition, especially in a high-stakes environment like the NICU? 

I’d love to hear from others who’ve been through something similar. Did you have a rocky start? What helped you navigate the uncertainty and build your confidence? Let’s share our experiences and support each other through these challenging, but ultimately rewarding, journeys. Because we’re all in this together, right?
