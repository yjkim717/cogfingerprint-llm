**The Dreaded Robot Voice**

Okay, let’s be real – 2024 feels like a constant battle against automated intrusions. I got a call yesterday that instantly made my skin crawl. A robotic voice, claiming it was Truist, saying there was an “urgent issue” with my account. Seriously? It’s unsettling how convincing these things are. I hung up, of course, but it got me thinking about how much we’re trusting – and maybe being tricked by – these automated messages online and on our phones.  Anyone else feeling this anxiety? 📱😬
