Of all the things I thought I’d spend my 2024 vacation fund on, a new windshield wasn't one of them. It happened in a split second—a moment of road rage, a flying object, and the sickening crack of glass.

As I stood there staring at the spiderweb of damage, the sinking feeling wasn't just about the cost. It was the frustration of having no proof. No evidence for insurance, no license plate to report. Just my word against a stranger's reckless anger.

I'd always put off buying a dash cam, thinking it was an extra, not a necessity. Now, I see it as essential vehicle safety—a silent witness that could have saved my savings and my peace of mind. Don't make my mistake.
