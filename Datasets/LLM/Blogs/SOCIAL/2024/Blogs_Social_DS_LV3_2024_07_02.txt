There’s something special about the thrill of a preorder arriving—especially when it’s from a band like Wisconsin’s own garden home. I stumbled upon their raw, post-hardcore sound while grabbing another EP online, and their self-titled LP just landed today. In a world of endless digital streams, holding this vinyl feels like a real connection. I can’t wait to get home, drop the needle, and let those screamo rhythms fill the room. Sometimes, the best discoveries come from taking a chance on something new.
