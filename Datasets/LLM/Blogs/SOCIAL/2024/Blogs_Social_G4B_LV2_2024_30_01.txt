**The Echoes in My Feed**

Scrolling through social media lately feels… exhausting. It’s not just the perfectly curated lives, though that’s a big part of it. It’s this undercurrent of conflict, of people desperately seeking validation, and sometimes, it just feels like a really subtle form of manipulation. 

I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about the impact of relationships – especially unhealthy ones – and how they can linger, even when they’re over. It reminded me of a difficult chapter in my past, a pattern of narcissistic behavior from my mother that left me feeling constantly undermined and questioning my own reality. 

Seeing carefully crafted arguments and accusations pop up in comment sections, or witnessing people desperately trying to prove they’re ‘right’ online… it’s like hearing echoes of that dynamic.  It’s sparked a real need to protect my peace and set boundaries, not just online, but in all my relationships.  It’s a conscious choice to step away from the noise and prioritize my emotional wellbeing.  Anyone else feeling this lately?
