    blog_post = f"In {2024}, I'm still on a mission to make dining out easier for those with food allergies and restrictions. Recently, a friend with ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) asked me if Subway can accommodate their request for a meatball sub without chunky tomato sauce. This got me thinking - how often do we assume that restaurants can't cater to our needs? The answer is, they often can, if we just ask. I took my friend's question to Subway, and to our delight, they were more than happy to modify their meatball sub to suit their dietary needs. It's a small act of kindness, but it makes a big difference to someone with a food allergy or condition like ARFID. Let's start a conversation and make dining out more inclusive, one meal at a time."
