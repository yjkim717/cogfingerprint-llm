It’s been a year since that searing, unmistakable kidney stone pain sent me to the emergency room. I remember clutching my side, thinking, *This is it—the pain everyone warns you about.* The diagnosis was swift: a small but stubborn stone. I followed all the doctor’s orders—drank water like it was my job, took the prescribed meds, and even added a daily supplement that promised to support kidney health.

The urine tests came back clear after a few months, and the pain faded. But here’s the strange part: I never actually saw the stone pass. Not a glimpse. So now, in 2024, I’m left with this quiet uncertainty. Is it gone for good, or is it just…hiding? It’s a weirdly social experience, too—when friends share their own kidney stone sagas, I nod along but feel like an imposter. My story has no tangible ending, just a lesson in patience and the humbling truth that some of life’s battles resolve in silence.
