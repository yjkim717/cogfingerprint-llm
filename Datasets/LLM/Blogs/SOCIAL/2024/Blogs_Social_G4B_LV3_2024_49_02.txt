**Getting Lost in the Echoes of Grymforge**

I’ve been completely swallowed by Baldur’s Gate 3 lately – specifically, my third playthrough. It’s wild how much a single choice can ripple through an entire campaign. This time, I dove deep into the Dreugar and Nere, and honestly, it felt… unsettling. 

Grymforge isn’t just a location; it’s a place that clings to you. The echoes of those ancient conflicts, the weight of those decisions – it really forces you to confront the consequences of your actions. It’s made me think a lot about how our own choices shape the people around us, and how easily we can get lost in the reverberations of the past.
