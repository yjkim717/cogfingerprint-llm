"Finding a Flat in Düsseldorf: A Struggle for International Students"

As I scrolled through WG-Gesucht, the popular German flat-sharing platform, I couldn't help but feel a pang of frustration. As an international student in my mid-30s, I was having a tough time finding affordable accommodation in Düsseldorf. It seemed like every ad had a familiar caveat: "Schufa report required" or "only for students under 25." I couldn't understand why my age was a liability. In my home country, experience and maturity are valued, but here, they seemed to be a hindrance. I finally found a place, but not before realizing that I'm not alone in this struggle. Many international students like me face similar challenges, navigating a complex rental market with stringent credit requirements and age biases. As we strive for inclusivity, it's time to rethink these norms and make student housing more accessible to all.
