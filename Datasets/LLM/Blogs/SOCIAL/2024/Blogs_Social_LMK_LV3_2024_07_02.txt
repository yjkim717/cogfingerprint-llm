"Getting my hands on Garden Home's self-titled LP was a highlight of my week. As I unwrapped the package, I couldn't help but feel a rush of excitement. Preordering this album had been a labor of love, and now it's finally here. I'm looking forward to diving in after work and discovering the raw energy of post-hardcore that has me hooked. Sometimes, new music is just what we need to shake things up."
