It’s funny how life can pull the rug out from under you just when you think you’re finding your footing. Earlier this year, a house fire turned everything upside down—not just my home, but the careful plans I’d made. As a trans woman, voice therapy felt like a lifeline, something just for me. But with financial strain tightening its grip, I had to let it go.

It stings, choosing survival over self. But in this quiet, I’m learning that my voice isn’t just about pitch—it’s in my resilience, my truth. Sometimes, stepping back isn’t giving up; it’s gathering strength for the journey ahead.
