As I unpack in my new apartment, I'm thrilled to finally have a real kitchen. Cooking is more than just a necessity - it's a way to feel grounded. Having experienced homelessness, I appreciate the stability a kitchen brings. My new oven may not be ideal, but it's mine. I'm excited to experiment with new recipes and make this space truly feel like home, one meal at a time.
