## The Algorithm of Apartment Hunting: A Student’s Dilemma in 2024

So, you’re an international student chasing a dream in Germany, right? I get it. I'm right there with you, diving headfirst into the fascinating world of AI and Data Science here in Dusseldorf. But let's be real, the textbooks aren't the only challenge. The housing market? It's a beast of its own.

I’m a little older than your average student, which, I'm discovering, can be a surprising hurdle. Landlords seem to prioritize younger applicants, and then there’s the dreaded *Schufa* – the German credit report. Apparently, having just arrived from another country and *not* having established credit here is a major red flag. 

It’s frustrating, to say the least. I’m pouring my heart and energy into my studies, excited to learn and contribute, but the constant search for a decent, affordable place to live is exhausting. Honestly, it's starting to feel like a full-time job alongside my degree. 

I keep wondering – is the housing situation here so incredibly tough that it will force students, especially those of us who are a little older or from abroad, to abandon their studies altogether? It shouldn’t be this hard to pursue education. 

Anyone else feeling the pressure? Let’s connect and share our experiences. Maybe, just maybe, we can navigate this algorithm of apartment hunting together.
