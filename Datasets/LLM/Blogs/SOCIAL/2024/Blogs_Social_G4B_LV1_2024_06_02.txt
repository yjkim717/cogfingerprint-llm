**The Blue Shift**

Seriously, I’ve been obsessed with muscle cars lately. I’d pictured a pitch black Mustang, maybe octane red – classic, right? But then I saw *this* blue one at the show last week. It just…hit different. It wasn’t my first choice, definitely. I even had a ridiculous inflatable banana as a decoration (don’t ask!). I swapped it for a simple license plate. Sometimes, you just have to let a car choose *you*. #musclecar #bluebeauty #socialshifts 2024
