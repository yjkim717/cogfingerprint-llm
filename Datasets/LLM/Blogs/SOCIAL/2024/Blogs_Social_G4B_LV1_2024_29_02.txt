**The Echo in the Silence**

It feels weird to even type this, but I had to share. Last year was… a lot. A small house fire, a scramble for insurance, and then the crushing weight of financial hardship hit. It was a perfect storm, really. I’d been seeing a voice therapist – finally tackling some anxiety that’d been building for years – and it was genuinely helping. 

But the bills kept piling up, and the sessions just… stopped. It wasn’t a dramatic decision, more like a quiet acceptance. I saw a post on Reddit about someone going through a similar struggle, and it hit me – sometimes, you have to prioritize the bare essentials. 

Now, the quiet is different. It’s not filled with the work my voice was doing, but I'm learning to find echoes of strength in the stillness.  It’s a reminder that resilience isn’t about constant progress, but about simply holding on.
