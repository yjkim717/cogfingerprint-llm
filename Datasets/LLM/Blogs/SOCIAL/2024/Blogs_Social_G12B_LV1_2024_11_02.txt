## Finding Strength in Connection: More Than Just a Fundraising Goal

It's a strange thing, sharing something so personal publicly. But here I am, navigating a stage 3 melanoma diagnosis, and also trying to raise awareness and funds for AIM at Melanoma. It feels… a lot.

Honestly, the diagnosis hit me hard. Fear, uncertainty – all the usual suspects. But what’s surprised me most has been the incredible outpouring of support. People I haven't spoken to in years reaching out, friends offering help, and even complete strangers sending encouraging messages.

It’s made me realize the power of connection. Fundraising for AIM at Melanoma isn't just about supporting vital research – though that’s hugely important. It’s also about building a community, a network of hope, and knowing you're not facing this alone. In 2024, with so much noise online, it's a powerful reminder that genuine human connection still matters most. It’s given me strength I didn't know I had, and I'm so grateful.
