## The Day My Commute Became a Novel

Okay, so yesterday was… something. Anyone else battling the M2/M7 around Rouse Hill? Seriously, it was apocalyptic. I’m talking standstill traffic for what felt like an eternity. Ended up being over two hours late for work! 

The absurdity of it all hit me when I realized I was going to miss *everything*. Luckily, a friend lives nearby and graciously offered their place to set up shop. It was bizarre, working surrounded by their cat and a pile of board games, but hey, I got work done! It really highlighted how much we rely on each other, doesn't it? And how technology lets us adapt – a lifeline when the city throws a curveball.



Hope today’s commute is kinder!
