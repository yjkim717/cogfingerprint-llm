Ever get a craving so specific it feels like a culinary ghost haunting your kitchen? That’s me, right now, in 2024. I keep dreaming of candied beef—a sweet, sticky, almost dessert-like version, like those addictive candied peanuts. It’s a wild recipe idea, born from a simple food craving. I’m gearing up for a little cooking experiment, hoping to finally satisfy this urge without a grocery store trip feeling like a wasteful gamble. Sometimes, the strangest cravings lead to the most memorable meals.
