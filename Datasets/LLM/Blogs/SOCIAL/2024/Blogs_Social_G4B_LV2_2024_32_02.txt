**That Creepy Robot Voice… Again.**

It’s 2024, and honestly, I’m starting to feel like I live in a low-budget spy movie. Last week, my phone lit up with a robotic voice – a Truist representative, supposedly – claiming an “account security issue.” It was so unsettling, so… automated. 

Suddenly, all those spam calls felt less random. It’s a weird feeling, questioning everything and wondering if you’re actually being targeted. Anyone else experiencing this unsettling trend? #fraud #accountsecurity #truist
