Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and fitting the 2024 context. I've focused on the core idea of eulogies acknowledging flaws while maintaining respect.

**The Unexpected Honesty in Goodbye**

It's a strange thing, isn't it? We build up these narratives around people, especially those we admire. Then, at a moment of farewell – a eulogy, a memorial – sometimes the script gets flipped. I was thinking about Barack Obama's words for John McCain recently, and how he spoke of McCain's stubbornness alongside his courage. 

Why do we allow, even *invite*, that vulnerability at a time meant for celebration? Maybe it's because true respect isn't about blind adoration. It's about acknowledging the whole person – the light and the shadow. It’s a reminder that even our heroes are, well, human. And perhaps, in that honesty, there’s a deeper kind of comfort. A more real kind of remembering.
