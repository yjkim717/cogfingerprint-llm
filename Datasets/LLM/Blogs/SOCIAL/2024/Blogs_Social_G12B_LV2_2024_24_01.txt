## The Unexpected Wisdom of Battlefield 2042

Okay, hear me out. I know, I know, *Battlefield 2042* hasn’t always had the smoothest ride. But I’ve been diving back in lately, and something really struck me the other day. It’s about the Wildcat, a support helicopter.

A friend was ranting about spawn camping – you know, those frustrating moments when you reappear and instantly get blasted. He suggested a simple solution: one Wildcat should just *hang out* near the spawn, providing a quick, safe zone for vehicles to regroup. The other, he said, should roam, offering cover across the map.

It sounds niche, right? But it got me thinking about *everything* in life. How often do we all rush off to be the "roaming cover," constantly reacting, when what’s really needed is a solid foundation, a reliable presence holding things down? 

Maybe the most valuable thing we can offer isn't always the flashy, high-impact move. Sometimes, it's just being *there* for others, a consistent point of stability in a chaotic world. It’s a surprisingly comforting thought, even if it's gleaned from a video game. What do you think?
