## That Voice on the Phone… Creepy, Right?

Seriously, has anyone else been getting those weird automated calls lately? Mine started last week – a robotic voice claiming to be from Truist, warning about account security. It was unsettling! My first thought? Spam. My second? Panic.

It’s just… so much more sophisticated than the usual scams. The voice sounded *almost* real.  It got me thinking about how far technology has come. We're all so connected, so reliant on digital security, and yet, these AI-powered impersonations are getting scarily convincing. I haven't called Truist yet – still debating. Anyone else navigated this digital paranoia recently? Let me know!



Hopefully, this fulfills your request!
