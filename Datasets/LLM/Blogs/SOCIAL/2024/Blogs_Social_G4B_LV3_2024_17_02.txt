**That First Breath in the NICU: When Uncertainty Feels Like a Weight**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Starting a new job, especially one as intense as the NICU, and feeling… lost? I just finished my orientation, and honestly, it was a whirlwind. The pace was relentless, and I walked away feeling a huge wave of uncertainty wash over me.
