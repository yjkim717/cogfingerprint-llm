Okay, so I’ve been totally spiraling through old shows lately – revisiting ‘Ugly Betty’ actually. And I’m struck by how…odd it felt watching Matt and Amanda’s dynamic. There was so much *potential* for flirting, hints of something deeper, but it just never really materialized. It made me think about how social expectations, even in a sitcom, can shape relationships and leave you wondering about unspoken connections. A rewatch really highlights those gaps, doesn’t it?
