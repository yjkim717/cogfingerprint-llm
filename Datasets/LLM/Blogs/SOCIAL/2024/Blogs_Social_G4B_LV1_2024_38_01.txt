**The Weight of a Promise (and a Really Weird Patron)**

Okay, so I’ve been wrestling with something lately, and it feels… oddly connected to this weird obsession I’ve had with obscure online communities. It started with a Discord server dedicated to tabletop RPG lore – specifically, this concept of "soul offerings."  Sounds dark, right?  Like something out of a grimdark fantasy. 

But the deeper I dug, the more it felt like a metaphor for the unspoken pressures of social media. We’re constantly offering pieces of ourselves – carefully curated photos, witty captions, declarations of feeling – to these platforms and, frankly, to each other. 

I stumbled across a recurring term, “Anthraxus,” linked to these rituals. It felt like a place where people were trying to bargain with something bigger, a ‘patron’ demanding a price for attention.  It made me think about the contracts we unknowingly sign when we build our online personas. 

I've been considering what kind of ‘cult’ we’re all participating in – a cult of likes, validation, and the desperate need to be seen.  It’s exhausting, honestly.  Like a Warlock bound to a demanding patron.  I'm trying to figure out how to renegotiate those terms, to reclaim a little more of my own soul – both online and off.  Anyone else feeling this pull?
