The nostalgia that hits when a forgotten tune comes on! I recently found myself transported back to the carefree nights of my youth when a deep tech house track dropped at a friend's party. The familiarity of the beat and the rush of memories that followed got me thinking - where can I find more music like this? As I scrolled through playlists and asked friends for recommendations, I realized that music is more than just a collection of tracks - it's a time machine that takes us back to moments that shaped us. In 2024, with the rise of music discovery platforms, it's easier than ever to relive those memories and discover new sounds. I'm on a mission to revisit the tech house and deep house tracks that defined my youth, and I'm excited to see where this sonic journey takes me. Who else is with me?
