## That Little Google Maps Hack & Life's Unexpected Turns

Isn't it funny how a simple Reddit post can spark a moment of reflection? I saw one recently about pre-selecting a route on Google Maps to bypass road closures. Seems small, right? But it got me thinking about life. We plan, we map things out, and then *bam* â€“ unexpected detours. Sometimes those closures are frustrating, but maybe they lead us to something even better than originally planned. A little nudge towards a different path. Anyone else feel that lately?
