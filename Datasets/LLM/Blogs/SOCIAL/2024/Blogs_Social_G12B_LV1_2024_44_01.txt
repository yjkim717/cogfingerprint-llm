## The Echo in the Room (and on the Stage?)

Something felt…off at the opera last night. The voices, usually soaring and raw, felt oddly polished, almost too present. It got me thinking about how much technology shapes our live experiences now. A Reddit thread I stumbled upon discussed the increasing prevalence of microphones in opera – are orchestras and singers routinely being amplified? 

It sparked a bigger question: is it about enhancing the art, or compensating for limitations? Maybe the beautiful, historic venue we were in just wasn’t acoustically ideal. It’s a fascinating, and slightly unsettling, evolution happening right before our eyes in 2024. What do you think?
