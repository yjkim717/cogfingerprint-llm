It’s 2024, and you’d think we’d have moved past some of the old-school pet care myths, but here I am, watching my stepdad ration our dog’s water like it’s a limited resource. His reasoning? Fewer accidents on the rug. But here’s the thing—not one of the trainers or vets I’ve spoken to recommends this. In fact, they stress how crucial proper hydration is, especially as summers get hotter.

It got me thinking: how often do we cling to traditions, even when they don’t serve us or our furry friends? It’s a small example of a bigger social pattern—resisting change because it feels easier than adapting. But real care means listening, learning, and sometimes letting go of what we’ve always done. After all, isn’t that what progress is all about?
