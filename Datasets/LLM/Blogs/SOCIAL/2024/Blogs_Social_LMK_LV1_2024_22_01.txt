As I stood in my new apartment's kitchen, I couldn't wait to cook my first meal. I decided on sweet water noodles, a comforting favorite. It hit me - I'm not just cooking for myself, I'm rebuilding my life. After being homeless, having a kitchen of my own is a luxury. This simple dish is more than just a meal, it's a milestone in my journey towards stability in 2024.
