## Lost in the Pages (and the App!)

Anyone else feel a littleâ€¦ let down by digital reading experiences sometimes? I was just using the Goodreads app, trying to track my progress on a hefty novel, and realized there's no way to mark a specific page number. Seriously? In 2024? It's a small thing, but it highlights a bigger frustration: when apps prioritize bells and whistles over genuinely useful features. Makes me miss the satisfying turn of a physical page!
