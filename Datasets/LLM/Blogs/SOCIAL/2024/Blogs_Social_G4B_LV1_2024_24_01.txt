**The Ghosts of Group Chats**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How social media feels less like connection and more like… echoes. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about how my online interactions bleed into my real-world feelings. I was grinding in Battlefield 2042 the other day, obsessing over setting up a perfect “spawn camping” spot with a Wildcat – creating that invisible no-fly zone for my team. It struck me – it’s the same impulse, really.

Protecting my teammates, building a secure space. But online, it’s often about validation, about proving I’m ‘good’ at something.  I realized I'd been chasing likes and comments, building a digital fortress, and neglecting genuine connection. It’s a frustrating cycle.  Maybe the best defense against feeling isolated isn't a strategically placed vehicle, but a conscious effort to reach out, to actually *see* the people around me.  Anyone else feeling this pull?
