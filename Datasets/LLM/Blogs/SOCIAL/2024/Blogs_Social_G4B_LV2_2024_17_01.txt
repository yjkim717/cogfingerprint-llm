Okay, here's a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 233 words:

**The Weight of a Shift: When a New Job Feels Like a Breakdown**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve been feeling…heavy. Not like the good kind of heavy, you know? Like the kind that settles in your bones after a really long shift. And honestly, it’s all tied to a new job. A new NICU, to be exact. 

I was so excited when I landed it – a chance to really grow, to dive into a specialty I’ve been passionate about. But the reality? It’s been…rough. I’m finding myself battling a surprising wave of burnout, and it’s not just from the intensity of the work (though that’s definitely a factor!). 

It started with whispers of a unit split, then a vague explanation from management that felt completely lacking in detail. It’s like they dropped me into the deep end without a life vest. The scheduling is chaotic, the support feels minimal, and I'm constantly feeling like I'm navigating a minefield of unanswered questions. 

I keep thinking about how much I value connection and transparency in a workplace, and this feels the opposite. It’s isolating, and it's chipping away at my confidence. 

I’m trying to remind myself that this is a new chapter, and it won’t always feel like this. But tonight, while scrolling through social media, seeing everyone’s perfectly curated happiness, it’s hard not to feel a little lost.  Anyone else ever feel like a new start can quickly become a struggle? Let's talk about it in the comments.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way – perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone further?
