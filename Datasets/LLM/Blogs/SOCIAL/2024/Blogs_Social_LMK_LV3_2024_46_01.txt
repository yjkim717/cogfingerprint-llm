"As I navigated Goodreads' mobile site in 2024, I felt a pang of frustration. Why can't I update my reading progress on-the-go? For an avid reader like me, tracking progress is a big part of the experience. The lack of this feature on their mobile site was a letdown. It's a simple functionality that would elevate the user interface and make book tracking seamless. I hope they consider this update soon."
