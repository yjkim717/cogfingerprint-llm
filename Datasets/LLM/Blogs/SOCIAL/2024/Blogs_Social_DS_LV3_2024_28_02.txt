It’s 2024, and I’m learning to navigate the tricky dance of social drinking. With a family history of addiction, every toast at a party feels weighted. I’ve started cutting back—swapping my usual drink for sparkling water, arriving fashionably late to skip the first round. It’s not about missing out; it’s about staying present for genuine laughs and connections, not just the buzz. Because the best memories aren’t blurred by a glass, but sharpened by the moments we share, fully aware and truly together.
