Anyone else ever feel that surge of anger when someone cuts you off? It’s a surprisingly common reaction, isn’t it? I was reading a Reddit thread the other day about a user who got windshield damage from road debris – a clear case of road rage, unfortunately.

It also hammered home the value of a dash cam.
