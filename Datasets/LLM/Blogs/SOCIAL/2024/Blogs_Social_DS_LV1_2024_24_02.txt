Remember when Twitter felt like a bustling digital town square? I do. Back in the early 2020s, it was where I’d go to catch breaking news, share a laugh over a viral meme, or dive into thoughtful discussions. It was messy, sure, but it felt alive.

Now, in 2024, logging on feels like wandering through a ghost town that’s been taken over by loudspeakers. The "Dead Internet Theory" doesn’t seem so far-fetched anymore. My feed is clogged with blue-checked accounts churning out rage-bait and recycled hot takes, all clearly designed to game the algorithm for a quick buck. It’s monetization-motivated content at its most transparent.

Worse are the shadows where the alt-right bots and AI-generated spam thrive, spewing racism and nonsense that makes genuine conversation impossible. The vibrant, chaotic human tapestry I loved has been replaced by a cynical, automated performance. Advertisers have fled, and so have most of my real-life friends.

I still pop in out of habit, but the magic is gone. It’s a stark reminder that when a platform prioritizes engagement at any cost over its human community, it’s not a decline—it’s a slow death.
