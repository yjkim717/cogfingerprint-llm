### Finding Your Stationary Wildcat

It’s 2024, and the pressure to be constantly “on the move” has never been higher. The hustle culture tells us to grind, pivot, and scale, 24/7. It’s exhausting.

I was thinking about this while playing a game with my nephew recently. He explained a strategy called “spawncamping,” where one player, the “Wildcat,” stays put to create a safe zone for the team. It struck me—this is what we’re missing.

We’re all trying to be the lone wolf covering the entire map, believing productivity means perpetual motion. But what if true strength lies in having a “stationary Wildcat” in our lives? That one non-negotiable—a morning walk, a weekly call with a parent, an hour with a book—that acts as our personal no-fly zone. It’s the safe, stable point that grounds us.

By protecting that quiet space, we don’t become stagnant. We become a reliable base for others and find the energy to be strategic and mobile everywhere else. Maybe the ultimate life hack isn't moving faster, but knowing what to keep beautifully, productively still.
