"Honoring the Whole Person: The Power of Authentic Eulogies. When we celebrate someone's life, we often focus on their achievements and virtues. However, acknowledging their flaws and imperfections can be a powerful way to truly honor their memory.

In doing so, we show that it's okay to be human, and that true honesty is the greatest tribute of all."
