**The Echo of a Stone – And the Strange Quiet of Social Media**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a physical thing – a kidney stone, in this case – can leave you feeling so…unmoored. I remember last year, the pain was a brutal, insistent reminder. The diagnosis was a relief, sure, but it was quickly followed by a disconcerting quiet.  Like a storm had passed, leaving a landscape of uncertainty. 

That’s how social media feels sometimes, I realize. Scrolling through everyone’s perfectly curated highlight reels, seeing achievements and adventures, and feeling this nagging question: “Where am *I* in all of this?” 

It’s a subtle echo of that initial disorientation – the lingering worry about a thing you can’t quite define, a place you can’t quite locate.  I’m learning to accept the recovery process, the slow rebuilding.  And maybe, just maybe, that applies to my online life too – to letting go of the need to *know* everything, and embracing the beautiful, messy quiet of simply being.
