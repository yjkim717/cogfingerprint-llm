Okay, here's a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 268 words:

**The Weight of “Should”**

Let’s be honest, scrolling through social media lately feels like wading through a sea of… expectations. And lately, a lot of those expectations are centered around one thing: babies. Cute baby pictures, glowing parent posts, and an almost overwhelming chorus of “When are *you* going to start a family?” 

I saw a really poignant thread on Reddit the other day – a young person just completely shutting down their parents’ relentless pressure to have kids. It resonated with me on a level I didn't quite expect. It wasn’t about being anti-family, or even anti-children. It was about a deep, unsettling feeling of being told *how* to live your life.

I’ve been feeling this myself, lately. My own parents have started dropping subtle (and not-so-subtle) hints about grandchildren. It’s layered with financial worries – the cost of raising a child is astronomical these days – and honestly, a pretty serious consideration of my career aspirations. I love what I do, and the thought of shifting gears to prioritize a family feels… daunting. 

There’s this really interesting generational difference at play, isn’t there? For so many of my parents’ generation, having children felt almost like a default setting. It was *expected*. Now, things are different. We’re navigating a world that’s telling us it’s perfectly okay to choose a different path. 

It’s exhausting trying to politely explain that my happiness and fulfillment aren't measured by a family size. It's a constant negotiation, a quiet battle against the weight of “should.” And sometimes, just sometimes, you need to hit pause and remember that *your* life, *your* choices, are the only ones that truly matter.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way? For example, would you like me to:

*   Add a specific anecdote?
*   Focus on a particular aspect (like the financial worries)?
