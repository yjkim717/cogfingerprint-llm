As I reflect on my journey, I'm reminded that resilience is not about being unbreakable, but about being brave enough to keep going. In 2024, many transgender individuals, including myself, face unimaginable challenges. For me, it was having to pause voice therapy after a house fire left me struggling to afford relocation. The housing crisis is real, and it's disheartening to see it affect our community's access to essential services like voice therapy. Yet, even in the midst of struggle, our resilience shines through, and I remain hopeful that we'll rise stronger.
