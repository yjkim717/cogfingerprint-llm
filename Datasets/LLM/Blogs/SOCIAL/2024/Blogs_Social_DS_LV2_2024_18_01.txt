It’s funny—in 2024, we’re all chasing liquidity, not just in crypto, but in life. I was reading about liquid staking on Sui, wondering if my staked SUI would hold its value, and it hit me: aren’t we all just trying to stay fluid in a world that keeps changing? Trusting systems, whether digital or human, feels like a leap. But maybe, like unstaking, it’s about believing things will balance out when we need them most.
