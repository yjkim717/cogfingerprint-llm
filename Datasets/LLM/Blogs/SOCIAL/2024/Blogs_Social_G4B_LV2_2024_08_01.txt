**The Sticky Situation & a Little Social Support**

Anyone else have those moments where you just want to hide? Last week, post-vet visit, my sweet Leo was covered in… well, let’s just say it wasn’t pretty. Cleaning the blood from his fur felt overwhelming. Scrolling through my feed, I saw so many amazing pet parents offering advice and encouragement – a virtual paw-shake of support! It’s amazing how a little online connection can make a tough situation feel a bit lighter. ❤️ #catcare #pethealth #socialsupport 2024
