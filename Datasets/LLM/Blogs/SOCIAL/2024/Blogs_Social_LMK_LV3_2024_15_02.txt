As I rummaged through my granddad's old coin jar in 2024, I stumbled upon a 1995 nickel that caught my eye. I wondered, is it a rare variant? Do all 1995 nickels have a mint mark? After digging into the world of numismatics, I discovered that 1995 nickels typically bear a 'D' or 'P' mint mark. But what about those without? I learned that certain anomalies can make a coin more valuable. My curiosity sparked a new hobby - coin collecting. Who knew a small coin could lead to a fascinating journey of discovery and connection to the past?
