### The Night the Understudies Stole the Show: A Lesson in Trusting the Ensemble

So, I almost didn’t go to the opera last Tuesday.

It was one of those weeks. The news cycle was its usual chaotic self, my to-do list was a beast, and the thought of sitting still for three hours felt like a monumental task. I’d bought the tickets for *Rigoletto* at Opera San Jose months ago, a gift to my future, more-cultured self. But present, tired me just wanted to curl up on the couch.

I’m so glad I went. And not just for the art, but for the lesson it delivered.

You see, when we got our programs, we saw the little asterisks. The leads for both Rigoletto and the Duke were out, replaced by their covers—the understudies. A tiny, cynical part of me deflated. We weren’t getting the “stars.”

How foolish that thought seems now.

From the moment the curtain rose on that traditional, opulent set, something magical happened. The stand-in baritone, who I’d never heard of, didn’t just sing Rigoletto; he *was* the tortured jester. His voice, a rich, aching instrument, filled the hall with a vulnerability that hit me right in the chest. And the young tenor playing the Duke? He wasn’t just a cad; he was a charismatic, dangerously charming force of nature, his stage presence so electric you couldn’t look away.

But here’s the real magic, the part that’s stuck with me all week. It wasn’t a one-man show. The entire cast—the supporting courtiers, the haunting chorus, the brilliant Gilda—they all lifted each other up. They listened, they reacted, they created a world so cohesive and alive that the pristine acoustics of the theater seemed to hum with their collective energy. It was a masterclass in ensemble.

Driving home, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. In our 2024 world, we’re so obsessed with the headliners—the celebrity CEOs, the viral influencers, the solo stars. We build our expectations and our disappointments around them. But that night at the opera was a powerful reminder that the most profound and moving experiences often come from the strength of the entire company.

The true stars aren't always the ones with their names in the biggest font. Sometimes, they’re the ones who step out of the shadows, ready to shine, supported by a cast that ensures the show isn’t just good, but transcendent. It was a beautiful, resonant lesson in looking beyond the marquee and trusting the power of the ensemble. It’s a lesson I’m trying to carry out of the theater and into my daily life.
