**The Diploma Dilemma: When ‘Should’ Meets ‘Want’**

Okay, real talk. Scrolling through LinkedIn this week felt… heavy. So many fresh engineering grads, same old rejection emails. I’m seeing a lot of folks, like me a few years back, wrestling with the “what now?” after graduation. 

I spent months chasing that dream job, stubbornly sticking to the plan – a fancy engineering degree, a coveted role. Then came the wall. It’s frustrating, right? Like, you’ve invested so much. 

Now, I’m seriously considering a technician position in the medical device field. It’s not what I envisioned, but it’s *practical*, and honestly, a little liberating.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best path isn’t the one we initially mapped out.  Anyone else feeling this pull between ‘should’ and ‘want’ in 2024?
