**The Quiet Rebellion of Sunlight**

There’s a strange feeling, isn’t there? Like a tiny, insistent rebellion within you when the sun suddenly bursts through the clouds. I’ve been noticing it lately – a deep, almost visceral aversion to bright light. It’s not just a preference for dimmer settings; it’s a genuine discomfort, a flicker of anxiety that flares up with the glare. 

It reminds me of those stories about light sensitivity, and how it can amplify everything. Lately, I’ve been grappling with a sense of melancholy, and oddly, the brightness just intensifies it. Maybe it’s a subtle reminder of how easily we can be overwhelmed by the world, by *everything*.  It’s a quiet rebellion, really – a need for a little shade.
