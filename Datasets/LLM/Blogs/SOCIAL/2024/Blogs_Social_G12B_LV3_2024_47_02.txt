## The Upgrade Dilemma: Horizon, My PS4 Pro, and the Pull of the PS5

Okay, fellow gamers, let's talk. I've sunk *serious* hours into Horizon Zero Dawn. Like, multiple playthroughs, different builds, the whole shebang. Aloy’s story just grabbed me, and I'm itching to dive into *Horizon Forbidden West*. But here's the thing: I'm staring down the classic upgrade question. 

Do I finally bite the bullet and splurge on a PS5? My PS4 Pro is still chugging along, and Forbidden West *does* run on it. But… the trailers! The graphics! The loading times! It’s a serious temptation.

I’m genuinely curious to hear from others who’ve played Forbidden West on both platforms. Is the visual leap *that* significant? Does the faster loading time genuinely impact the immersion? I’m trying to balance the budget realities of 2024 with the desire for the absolute best gaming experience. Tell me your thoughts – is the PS5 upgrade worth it for a Horizon fan like me?
