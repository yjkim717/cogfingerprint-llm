**The Algorithm Isn’t Helping My Heart**

Okay, real talk. 2024 feels… weird for dating, doesn’t it? We swipe, we match, we exchange carefully curated selfies, and then… nothing. I’ve been staring at my phone a *lot* lately, feeling this persistent ache of being repeatedly rejected, mostly through the dreaded “ghosting.” 

It’s not about the grand gestures or the perfect profile picture. It’s about a fundamental disconnect. I crave something *real*, a relationship built on genuine connection, not just a fleeting spark judged by an algorithm. 

Recently, I went on a few dates where it felt like people were just going through the motions – polite conversation, forced smiles, and then, poof! Vanished. It’s exhausting. It leaves you feeling emotionally raw, questioning if you’re doing something wrong, or if maybe, just maybe, I’m longing for something that’s becoming increasingly rare in this digital age. 

Anyone else feeling this frustrating push and pull between wanting connection and being met with… well, silence?

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the topic?
