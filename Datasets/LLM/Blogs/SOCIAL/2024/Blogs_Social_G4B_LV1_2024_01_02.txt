**Remember When Rocket League Felt *Good*?**

Anyone else feel like things have shifted a bit in the gaming world lately? I’ve been spending way too much time in Rocket League, and it’s got me thinking about community. Remember the early days, the genuine excitement around updates, the way Epic Games seemed to *listen*? 

It feels like we’ve lost some of that. I was reminded of a smaller game, “Ghost Ship,” that absolutely nailed community engagement – constant feedback loops, truly collaborative development.  It’s a little sad to see big studios sometimes forget that connection. Let’s hope Rocket League, and others, can rediscover that magic. What do you think?
