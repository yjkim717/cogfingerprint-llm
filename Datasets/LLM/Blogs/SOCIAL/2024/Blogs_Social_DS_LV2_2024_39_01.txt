It’s 2024, and my grow tent’s Inkbird humidity controller has me thinking about life’s little fluctuations. The fans kick on and off constantly, chasing every spike and dip—it’s exhausting just watching.

It reminds me of how we sometimes overreact to every small change in our mood or day, never letting things just settle. Maybe the solution isn’t more control, but a little patience and insulation—like that plexiglass panel I’ve been meaning to install. Sometimes, stability comes from buffering the noise, not fighting it.
