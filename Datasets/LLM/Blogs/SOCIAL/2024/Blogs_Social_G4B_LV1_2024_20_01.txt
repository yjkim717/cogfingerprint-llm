**The Soundtrack of My Sanity**

Okay, real talk. 2024 feels…loud. Not just the usual city hum, but a constant barrage of irritating sounds. It’s like my brain is perpetually on high alert, triggered by the clatter of keyboards in cafes, the insistent notifications on my phone – and honestly, even *my own* thoughts sometimes! I'm starting to feel that familiar burn-out creeping in, making it impossible to just…relax. I’m trying to build little pockets of quiet, but it’s a battle.  Anyone else fighting the soundscape lately?
