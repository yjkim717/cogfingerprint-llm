## The Lingering Question Mark (and a Whole Lot of Lemon Water)

It’s funny how some things just…stick with you. Last year, I went through a truly awful experience – a kidney stone. The pain was unlike anything I’d ever felt, a sharp, relentless ache that landed me in urgent care. They ran tests, gave me some medication, and sent me on my way with instructions to drink *tons* of water.

And I did. I practically lived on lemon water for weeks. I even looked into those "stone breaker" supplements everyone raves about online (though I ultimately decided against them). The initial agony subsided, thankfully, and I started to feel like myself again.

But here’s the thing: a year later, I still don’t *know* if I actually passed the stone. There’s been no recurrence of the pain, no definitive confirmation. It’s this low-level hum of uncertainty in the back of my mind. 

It’s made me think a lot about how we deal with lingering anxieties, especially in a world obsessed with instant answers. We Google everything, demand immediate results, and crave closure. But sometimes, life just doesn't offer that neat resolution. Maybe the stone is still somewhere, tiny and dormant. Or maybe it’s long gone. Either way, I'm choosing to focus on feeling good, staying hydrated, and accepting that some questions just remain unanswered. And yes, I'm still drinking my lemon water. Just in case.
