### The Ghost in the Machine

I was scrolling through my feed the other day—a mindless thumb exercise I barely register anymore—when it hit me. This doesn’t feel like my town square anymore. It feels like a ghost town with a few very loud, paid-off sheriffs.

It’s 2024, and the "dead internet theory" doesn’t feel so theoretical on here anymore. Under the new regime, the platform’s soul seems to have been auctioned off. My timeline, once a chaotic but genuine stream of friends’ dumb jokes and heated debates, is now clogged with an uncanny valley of content. It’s a bizarre mix of AI-generated sludge that says nothing with perfect grammar and the relentless self-promotion of blue-checked users who’ve paid for the privilege of a bigger megaphone.

I miss the mess. I miss the real, un-monetized human connection. The accidental poetry of a badly-taken photo, the solidarity in a shared, niche frustration. Now, the algorithm seems to reward the loudest, most controversial, or just the wealthiest voices. It’s not about community; it’s a marketplace of influence, and I’m not a participant anymore—I’m the product being sold. I find myself closing the app more often, longing for the digital campfire we seem to have left behind.
