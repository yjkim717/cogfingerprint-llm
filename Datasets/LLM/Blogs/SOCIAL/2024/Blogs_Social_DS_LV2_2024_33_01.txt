That heart-pounding moment in the parking lot today—tall bushes completely blocking my view of oncoming traffic—was a stark reminder of how much we rely on clear sightlines, both on the road and in life. It made me think: how often do we navigate our relationships with the same limited visibility, making decisions without seeing the full picture? In 2024’s fast-paced world, maybe we all need to slow down and ensure we have a clearer view before we merge into someone else’s path.
