## That Song... Does Anyone Remember?

Seriously, does *anyone* else have that one song stuck in their head? It was *everywhere* on Instagram last year – those short, snappy videos, always punctuated by this massive bass drop and a male vocal.

It makes you wonder what fleeting audio trend *we're* all ignoring right now.
