**The Weight of “Should” – And Why It’s Okay to Say No**

Okay, let’s be real – 2024 feels like a year of relentless “shoulds,” doesn’t it? Should we be buying a house? Should we be having kids? Should we be keeping up with the Joneses on social media? It’s exhausting. 

I’ve been wrestling with something lately, and it circles back to this really uncomfortable idea that’s been swirling around in our culture: that children are somehow *things* we’re meant to manage, to mold, to ‘prepare’ for the world.  It’s a huge responsibility, absolutely. But it’s also a responsibility that shouldn’t come with the assumption that we get to dictate every single aspect of a child’s life.

Recently, I saw a conversation online about being “childfree” and it sparked something within me. It’s not about rejecting responsibility, it’s about prioritizing autonomy – for *everyone*.  When we constantly try to control another person’s path, we’re actually robbing them of the chance to figure things out for themselves. 

I think we need to gently push back against this ingrained pressure.  Let’s start valuing independent thought and genuine self-discovery, for ourselves *and* for the next generation.  It’s a radical act, really, but one I think we desperately need.
