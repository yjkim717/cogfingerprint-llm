**The Weight of a Degree You’re Not Using**

It’s weird, isn’t it? You spend years chasing a degree, pouring your heart and soul into late-night study sessions, and finally… you’re doing something completely different. I’ve been feeling this acutely lately, seeing friends land dream jobs straight out of university, while I’m still happily (and honestly, a little resentfully) soldering wires as an engineering technician. 

I have a B.S., a tangible piece of proof of my potential, but it feels… muted. There’s a definite undercurrent of disappointment, a quiet regret for the career path I envisioned. The job applications keep getting rejected, and it’s not just about the skills – it’s about the *perception* of where I “should” be. 

It’s a tough feeling to navigate, this disconnect between what you thought you’d be doing and the reality.  I’m trying to find the value in the work, the satisfaction in the practical application, but right now, it’s a reminder that sometimes, life takes unexpected turns.  Anyone else feeling this push and pull?
