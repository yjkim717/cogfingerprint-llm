It’s 2024, and I’m scrolling through my feed, watching the internet collectively lose its mind over the latest *Stranger Things* teaser. Don’t get me wrong—I was there in the beginning, wrapped in the mystery of Season 1. But now? I feel like I’m watching a different show.

For me, the magic started to fade. The character arcs felt stretched, and new fan-favorites like Eddie Munson, while fun, couldn’t recapture that original spark. I see the hype building again, and I just don’t feel it. It’s like being at a party where everyone’s dancing to a song you’ve heard too many times.

Am I just nostalgic, or is something genuinely missing? Either way, it’s a strange feeling when the world is buzzing and you’re just… quietly unplugged. Anyone else?
