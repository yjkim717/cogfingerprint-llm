**Subway Struggles & the Weird World of Online Food Forums**

Okay, so 2024 is already proving to be… interesting. I was scrolling Reddit the other day and stumbled upon this really relatable thread. Someone was having a massive struggle with a Subway meatball sub – specifically, the tomato chunks in the sauce. Apparently, they have ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder), and even a tiny bit of unexpected texture sends them into a tailspin. It just struck a chord, reminding me how intensely personal food experiences can be.  It’s wild how easily shared anxieties can blossom into a whole online community.  Makes you think, doesn't it?
