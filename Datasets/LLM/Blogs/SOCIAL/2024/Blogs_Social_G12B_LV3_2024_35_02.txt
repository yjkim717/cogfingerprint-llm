## When Deception Became My Armor: A Baldur's Gate 3 Revelation

Okay, so I just finished a playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3 that genuinely shook me, and I need to share. I’m usually a chaotic good kind of player – big swords, flashy spells, you know the drill. But this time? I leaned *hard* into deception. 

I built a Shadowheart romance character, but not the usual manipulative cleric. This Shadowheart was a walking, talking fortress of steel, prioritizing defense above all else. Think layers of plate armor, constant buffs to AC, and a Trickery Domain cleric build focused on illusions and misdirection. 

It was… surprisingly fulfilling. It wasn’t about brute force; it was about outsmarting enemies, using their assumptions against them. Romancing Karlach while playing this deceptive, stoic Shadowheart felt incredibly complex, a dance of hidden intentions and gradual vulnerability. 

Honestly, it highlighted something about social interactions in general. We often present a polished, curated version of ourselves online, a kind of armor against judgment. This playthrough reminded me that sometimes, the most rewarding connections come from peeling back those layers, even when it feels risky. It's about finding strength, not in flashy displays, but in the quiet resilience of being authentically *you*, even if that "you" is a heavily armored, slightly deceptive cleric.
