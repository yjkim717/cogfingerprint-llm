As I scrolled through my social media feeds in 2024, I stumbled upon a Reddit post that caught my attention - a scathing critique of Epic Games, the company behind the popular gaming platform. The user was frustrated with the company's performance, citing a lack of engagement with their community. What struck me, though, was the user's suggestion that Epic Games take a page from Ghost Ship Games' playbook. The indie developers behind the hit game "Path of Exile" are known for their transparency and positive interactions with their community. The Reddit user argued that Epic Games could learn from Ghost Ship's approach to game development, which prioritizes community feedback and fosters a sense of collaboration. As a gamer who's spent countless hours watching gaming streams, I couldn't help but agree. By embracing a more community-driven approach, Epic Games could revitalize their image and create a more loyal following.
