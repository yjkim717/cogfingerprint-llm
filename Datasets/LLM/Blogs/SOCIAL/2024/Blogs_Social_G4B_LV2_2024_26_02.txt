**Tiny vs. Mighty: Navigating the First Meet**

Remember that feeling when a new person walks into your life? It’s similar when introducing dogs, especially when there’s a size difference! I was just reading about a reader worried about mixing a tiny chihuahua with a spirited schnauzer – a classic dynamic fueled by prey drive. 

It’s totally normal to feel anxious. Slow introductions, scent swapping, and creating safe zones are key.  Social media can be a great resource for tips, but ultimately, trust your gut and prioritize calm, positive interactions. ❤️ #dogadoption #dogsocial #newdogowner
