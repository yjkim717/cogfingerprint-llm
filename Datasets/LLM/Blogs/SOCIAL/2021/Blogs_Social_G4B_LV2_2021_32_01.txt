**The Scroll and the Silence**

Let’s be honest, scrolling through social media in 2021 feels… exhausting. Everyone’s highlight reel, the carefully curated joy – it can be a brutal reminder of what you *don’t* have. Lately, I’ve been feeling a really intense pull towards something completely different: silence.

It’s a weird feeling, right? Like actively *choosing* to step away from the constant connection. But honestly, it’s been building for a while, and it’s all centered around one very difficult family dynamic. 

I’ve been wrestling with the idea of going ‘no contact’ with my parents. You know, the kind you read about – the ones who thrive on drama, who twist your words, who leave you feeling constantly drained and, frankly, small. It's a feeling I’ve carried for years, a low-humming anxiety beneath the surface. 

Recently, it’s become almost unbearable. The constant criticism, the invalidation of my feelings… it’s triggering a lot of buried childhood trauma. It’s a painful realization that the people who were supposed to protect me were, in many ways, the source of my emotional distress. 

I know this isn’t a simple fix. And I’m not trying to paint a dramatic picture. But the thought of creating space, of protecting my own mental well-being, is starting to feel less like a selfish act and more like a necessary one. Maybe that silence, that deliberate disconnection, is exactly what I need to finally breathe.
