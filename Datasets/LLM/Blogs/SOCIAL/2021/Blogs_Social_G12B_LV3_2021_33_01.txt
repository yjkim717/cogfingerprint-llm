## The Irony of Road Rage (and a Little Bit of Karma?)

Anyone else feel like 2021 has been a masterclass in frustration? I was stuck in traffic the other day – the kind where you’re inching along, white-knuckled – when I witnessed something truly unbelievable. This driver, completely disregarding everyone, was weaving through lanes, illegally passing car after car. I even saw them blow past a police officer! You could practically *feel* the collective groan of everyone around us. 

And then? They got stuck. Right. There. In the same, agonizing traffic jam. It was a bizarre, almost comical moment of poetic justice. It just goes to show, doesn't it? Sometimes, the universe has a funny way of leveling the playing field. Maybe a reminder to us all to take a deep breath and just…be patient.
