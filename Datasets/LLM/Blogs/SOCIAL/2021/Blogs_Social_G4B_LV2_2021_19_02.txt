**The Quiet Frustration of Tech**

Remember those moments in 2021 when a perfectly good gadget just…didn't *quite* work? I had one of those with my Huion Kamvas 13 – beautiful display, fantastic for sketching, but a total headache with the driver on my Mac. It worked brilliantly on Windows, naturally, but the MacOS experience was a frustrating mess. 

I spent hours troubleshooting, feeling that familiar pang of annoyance when a new tech purchase doesn’t seamlessly fit into your life.  And now? It’s a returned product, a little symbol of that digital struggle. It’s weird, isn't it? How easily we get caught up in the *potential* of something, and how quickly that potential can turn into a quiet, frustrating disappointment.  Anyone else have a tech ghost story?
