## The Panic of a Missing Email (and a Very Important Etsy Shop!)

Okay, friends, let’s be honest: we’ve *all* been there, right? That moment of sheer panic when you realize you’ve deleted something crucial? I just lived it. My Etsy shop email vanished into the digital ether. Suddenly, I was locked out! Thankfully, Etsy’s customer support (eventually!) helped me recover it. A good reminder to back *everything* up, especially when your livelihood depends on it! #etsy #smallbusiness #techfails #accountrecovery
