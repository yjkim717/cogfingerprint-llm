**The Weight of “Trying Too Hard” Online**

Remember 2021? Scrolling felt… intense. Everyone seemed to be crafting these perfectly curated lives, especially online. I found myself getting caught up in comparing my “real” life to these hyper-edited versions, wondering if my attempts to be “social” were actually failing. It’s like the Kudayari technique – seemingly brilliant, but maybe requiring too much precise control. 

I realized then that genuine connection isn’t about flawless presentation, but simply *showing up* and being present.  Maybe DrStone’s science can teach us something about authenticity, too.
