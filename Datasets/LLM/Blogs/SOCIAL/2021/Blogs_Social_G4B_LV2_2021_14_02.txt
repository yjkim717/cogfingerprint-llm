**The Nighttime Howl and the Rise of the WFH Cat**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 was *weird*, right? Suddenly, everyone was working from home. And my little Leo, my ginger tabby, decided that was *his* cue to stage a nightly opera. It wasn’t a gentle purr; it was a full-blown, mournful howl that bounced off the walls and shattered any hope of a decent night’s sleep. 

It started subtly, a few whimpers at first. Then it escalated. I was completely consumed with trying to figure out *why*. Was he lonely? Bored? Was he just a dramatic cat?  I dove deep into “cat behavior” articles, desperately searching for answers. 

Honestly, it felt like a microcosm of the whole year. Everyone was stressed, everyone was adjusting, and my cat was just… expressing it.  I started taking him out for longer walks – “dog walking” felt a little silly for a cat, but it seemed to help.  

It’s funny, isn’t it?  We were all feeling a bit “pet distress” – the anxiety of a new way of life. And Leo, in his own furry way, was mirroring it all.  I realized that sometimes, the biggest help you can give a pet (and yourself!) is just a little extra attention, a bit of calm, and a reminder that even when things feel chaotic, you’re not alone.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way? For example, would you like me to:

*   Add a specific detail about Leo’s personality?
*   Adjust the tone further?
