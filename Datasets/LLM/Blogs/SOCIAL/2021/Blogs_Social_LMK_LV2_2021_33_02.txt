"Finding My Balance: The Fear of Forgetting to Live"

As I stepped into my early twenties, a lingering fear started to creep in - the fear of spending my life stuck in a never-ending cycle of work. I watched friends and family get caught up in the hustle, sacrificing relaxation and quality time with loved ones. The thought of burning out before I even got started was daunting. I realized that achieving a work-life balance wasn't just about managing time, but about prioritizing what truly matters. As I navigated the challenges of adulting in 2021, I began to understand that it's okay to slow down and take a step back. By doing so, I'm learning to create space for the things that bring me joy and connection. It's a journey, not a destination - one that I'm committed to, to ensure I don't forget to live.
