**Scrolling Through Inspiration (and a Little Bit of Doubt)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? 2021 felt like a constant stream of faces on screens, a relentless scroll through curated lives. I spent so much time looking *at* art online – incredible illustrations, breathtaking landscapes – and feeling a pang of, "How do *they* do that?" 

Then I stumbled upon Pete Beard’s YouTube channel. Seriously, it’s a goldmine for anyone starting out in illustration. He breaks down the styles of old masters, encourages artist study, and makes art history feel surprisingly approachable. It reminded me that inspiration isn’t about instant perfection, but about digging deep and learning from those who came before.
