**That Frustrating Loop – And Why It Resonates**

Remember those moments in 2021 when everything felt… stuck? Like you were endlessly circling a problem, desperately trying to find a way through, and just hitting a wall? I’ve been thinking a lot about that lately, sparked by revisiting *The Last of Us: The Forest*. 

Specifically, that gate-waiting sequence. It’s a brutal spike in difficulty, right? Suddenly, you’re starved for resources, and the game throws a massive obstacle in your path. It felt less like a challenge and more like… frustration. 

It’s weird, but that feeling of being trapped, of desperately needing something you can’t quite get – it mirrored a lot of the anxieties we all felt during that year.  It made me realize how often our social lives can feel like that gate, and how exhausting it can be to keep pushing, keep trying to find the ‘resource’ we need to move forward.
