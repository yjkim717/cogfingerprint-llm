## The Urgent Tick of the Clock (and My Slightly Panicked To-Do List)

Okay, real talk. 2021 has been… a lot. I think we can all agree on that. But beyond the global craziness, I've been wrestling with something a bit more personal lately: a creeping sense of urgency. Like the clock is ticking louder than ever.

It probably sounds ridiculous. I'm 22, fresh out of university, and finally "adulting" (whatever *that* means). I’ve got a decent job, a cute apartment, and a circle of friends I genuinely adore. On paper, everything looks pretty good.

But I find myself constantly thinking about *future me*. Future me, who’s probably even more stressed, buried under a mountain of responsibilities, and utterly exhausted. Future me who maybe hasn’t seen her friends in months, hasn’t read a book for pleasure in years, or even remembered what sunshine feels like.

It’s a weird anxiety, right? A fear of *becoming* something I don't want to be. I see everyone online, hustling, grinding, and posting about their "side hustles," and I feel this pressure to keep up. But what if chasing all that success means sacrificing the things that actually make life worthwhile? 

I took a few days off last month – my first real vacation since graduating – and it was a stark reminder. Just *breathing* and connecting with people I care about felt revolutionary. I need to find a way to build that balance *now*, before the ticking gets too loud. Because honestly, what’s the point of achieving everything if I’m too burnt out to enjoy it?
