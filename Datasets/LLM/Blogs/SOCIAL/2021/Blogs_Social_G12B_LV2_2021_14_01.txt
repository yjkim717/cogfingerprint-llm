Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided keywords and summary, aiming for a conversational, reflective, and relatable tone, set in 2021. I've tried to weave in a bit of the potential emotional complexity suggested by the "funeral" element.  I've included a suggested title and some potential image ideas at the end.

## When Pinterest Dreams Meet Real Life (and a Funeral)

Okay, confession time. I'm *that* person. The one who starts planning Halloween in, like, July. Pinterest boards overflowing with spooky glam, tutorials saved on repeat, a growing collection of face paints… it’s a full-blown obsession. This year, I was determined to nail a seriously witchy look. Think smoky eyes, dramatic contour, and a temporary tattoo – a crescent moon and stars – to really sell the ethereal vibe. I’d spent weeks researching long-lasting lipsticks that wouldn’t budge, even through pumpkin spice lattes and frantic costume adjustments.

I was *so* ready.

Then, life, as it often does, decided to throw a curveball. My grandmother passed away unexpectedly. Suddenly, Halloween makeup was the last thing on my mind. We had to coordinate travel, arrangements, and, of course, grieve. A family funeral felt miles away from my carefully curated spooky aesthetic.

And that’s where the temporary tattoo decided to stage a protest. It was *not* budging. Seriously, this thing was glued on. I tried everything – oil, exfoliation, even a little (gentle!) scrubbing. No luck. So, there I was, attending a solemn gathering with a stubbornly shimmering crescent moon peeking out from under my collar.

It felt… ridiculous. And then, strangely, it felt okay. It was a reminder that life isn’t a perfectly planned Pinterest board. It's messy, unpredictable, and sometimes a little absurd.  It was a tangible symbol of how joy and sorrow can exist side-by-side. 

This whole experience reminded me to breathe, to prioritize what truly matters (family, connection), and to maybe, *just maybe*, tone down the elaborate makeup plans a bit.  Maybe next year I'll just stick to a classic cat-eye. Or maybe I'll embrace the unexpected and rock the moon and stars, a little reminder that even in the midst of grief, there's still space for a little bit of magic.

**Potential Image Ideas:**

*   A photo of the author looking slightly melancholic but also with a small, wry smile, with the temporary tattoo subtly visible.
*   A close-up of the temporary tattoo itself, perhaps with a blurred background of funeral flowers.
*   A screenshot of a Pinterest board filled with Halloween makeup ideas (to illustrate the initial enthusiasm).
