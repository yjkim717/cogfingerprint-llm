## Lost in Translation (and Suds!)

So, I’ve been working alongside an amazing team at the restaurant, mostly folks from Hispanic backgrounds. Everything’s been great, lots of laughs, good vibes. But the other day, someone used the word “batitas” (or sometimes “baditas”) and I was totally lost! It’s a reminder that even in a diverse workplace, there's always more to learn about different cultures and the beautiful nuances of language. Anyone know what it means? Asking for a friend… and a little bit of clarification! #culture #learning #worklife
