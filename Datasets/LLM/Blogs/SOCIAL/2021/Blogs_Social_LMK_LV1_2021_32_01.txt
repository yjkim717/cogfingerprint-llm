**The Toxic Ties That Bind: My Journey to Low Contact**

As I sit here in 2021, reflecting on my relationship with my mother, I'm struck by the complexity of emotions that swirl within me. For years, I've struggled to reconcile the love I was taught to feel for her with the pain and trauma she's caused me. The truth is, my childhood was marred by emotional and physical abuse, neglect, and a deep-seated sense of invalidation. Growing up with a narcissistic parent is a unique kind of hell, where you're constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing when the next outburst will occur.

The memories still linger, etched into my psyche like scars. The belittling comments, the dismissive tone, the feeling of being invisible – it's a wonder I made it out of that household with my sanity intact. But the damage was done, and as I grew older, I began to realize the extent of the toxicity that had been festering in our relationship.

For a long time, I tried to maintain a connection with my mother, hoping that things would change, that she would somehow magically become the parent I needed. But the reality is, narcissistic parents rarely change, and the abuse continues until you take drastic measures. I've come to understand that my only recourse is to prioritize my own well-being, to protect myself from further harm.

The decision to go low contact wasn't easy, but it was necessary. It's been a journey of self-discovery, of learning to untangle my sense of identity from the toxic narrative my mother had created. It's not about being vindictive or cruel; it's about survival. By establishing boundaries and limiting our contact, I'm taking back control of my life, my emotions, and my narrative.

Estrangement is a heavy word, one that carries a stigma in our society. But for those of us who've endured the trauma of narcissistic parenting, it's sometimes the only way to heal. As I navigate this new chapter, I'm reminded that I'm not alone. There are countless others out there who've walked this path, and it's in their stories that I find solace. My journey to low contact is just the beginning – a step towards reclaiming my life, my voice, and my future.
