"Reel vs. Real: The Unrealistic NYC of TV Shows"

As a city dweller in 2021, I've grown accustomed to the chaos of navigating New York City's streets. But watching TV shows filmed here, I'm struck by how glamorized the transportation struggles are. Characters effortlessly hail cabs, breeze through subway stations, and avoid delays. Meanwhile, I spend my commute dodging crowds and apologizing for being late.

This disconnect between the show and reality got me thinking - why do TV shows get it so wrong? Is it a filmmaking choice to make the city seem more appealing? Or are they simply out of touch with the daily grind? Whatever the reason, it's jarring to see a city I love portrayed so unrealistically. By glossing over the tough parts, TV shows miss an opportunity to showcase the resilience and grit that makes NYC so unique. It's time for a more authentic representation of city life.
