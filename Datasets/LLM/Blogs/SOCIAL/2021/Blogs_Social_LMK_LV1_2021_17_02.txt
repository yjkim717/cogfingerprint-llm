"The Amusement Park Anxiety Attack: A Lesson in Self-Care. Last summer, my friends and I decided to spend a day at our local amusement park. As we waited in line for the biggest rollercoaster, I indulged in a giant funnel cake and sugary drinks. Big mistake. As I waited, my stomach started cramping, and I felt a wave of panic wash over me. It wasn't just the heat and dehydration; my emetophobia (fear of vomiting) kicked in, making my anxiety skyrocket. Suddenly, I was hit with a full-blown panic attack. The loud noises and crowded space didn't help. I quickly excused myself and found a quiet spot to collect myself. It was a tough reminder that my body has limits. I've been working on managing my emetophobia, and this experience taught me to prioritize my health, even on fun days out. Now, I make sure to stay hydrated and eat lighter meals, even when tempted by treats."
