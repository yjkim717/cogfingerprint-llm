## The Kangaroo and the Fence: When Your Life Gets… Unexpected

Okay, so I had a dream last night. A *really* weird dream. And it’s been bouncing around in my head all morning, prompting me to ponder something that feels surprisingly relevant to, well, everything right now. 

In the dream, I was gifted a kangaroo. Not a cute, cuddly baby kangaroo, mind you. This was a full-grown, muscular, and frankly, *grumpy* kangaroo. And it was… a gift. No explanation, just, "Here, have a kangaroo." 

Naturally, chaos ensued. This kangaroo was *determined* to escape. Every enclosure I built, every fence I reinforced, it seemed to find a way over, under, or straight *through* it. And once it was loose, it was wreaking havoc on the neighborhood. Picture this: a kangaroo boxing with Mr. Henderson’s prize-winning roses, leaping onto Mrs. Gable’s car, and generally causing a delightful (for me, apparently, because I wasn't scared in the dream!) pandemonium. 

I woke up feeling… puzzled, obviously. But also, strangely, connected to something. The dream felt like a bizarre metaphor for, I don’t know, *life* in 2021. 

Think about it. We’ve all been handed some unexpected "kangaroos" this year, haven't we? Things we never asked for, situations that feel utterly outside our control. The pandemic, of course, is the biggest one. But maybe it's a sudden career change, a relationship shift, or even just the sheer weight of the constant news cycle. 

And just like my dream kangaroo, these unexpected events find ways to break free and disrupt our carefully constructed routines. We build our fences – our defenses, our coping mechanisms – and they still manage to get through. We try to maintain a sense of normalcy, a feeling of control, but life throws a hopping, boxing kangaroo at us and says, "Surprise!"

The dream left me wondering: are we fighting the escapes, or learning to adapt to the chaos? Are we spending so much energy reinforcing the fences that we miss the humor, the absurdity, and maybe even a tiny bit of the unexpected joy that comes with a kangaroo running loose in the neighborhood? 

Maybe, just maybe, a little bit of chaos isn’t the worst thing. Maybe it's an invitation to loosen our grip, to find the laughter in the absurdity, and to accept that sometimes, life just gives you a kangaroo.



What unexpected "kangaroos" have you been dealing with lately? I'd love to hear about them in the comments.
