### The Tightrope of Caring: Loving Someone with BPD Without Losing Myself

I used to think empathy was a bottomless well. You just dig a little deeper, and there’s always more to give. That was before I met Alex.

Our friendship wasn’t a slow burn; it was a firework. Instant, brilliant, and all-consuming. For months, it was the most exhilarating connection I’d ever had. We’d talk for hours, our conversations weaving through philosophy, our deepest fears, and the absurdity of modern life. I felt seen in a way I never had before. But then, I started to notice the shifts. They were subtle at first—a text left on read for a day, a slightly colder tone that I’d blame on my own insecurity.

Then came the first major **splitting** episode.

I didn’t have the word for it then. I just knew that the person I’d spoken to the day before, who had told me I was their “favorite person,” had vanished. In their place was someone who looked at me with icy detachment, listing every way I’d failed them, every unintentional slight. The devaluation was absolute. I was no longer a cherished friend; I was a villain in a story I didn’t know I was starring in.

The whiplash left me reeling. My own **anxiety triggers**, usually reserved for work deadlines and social obligations, went into overdrive. My phone became a source of dread. A cheerful meme from Alex meant I was back in favor, and the relief was palpable. A period of silence sent me spiraling, scouring my memory for what I might have done wrong. I was on a rollercoaster I hadn’t chosen to ride, and my own mental stability was the price of the ticket.

The hardest part, the one that keeps me up at night, was the **self-harm**. It started with vague allusions to “not feeling anything,” then escalated to images sent in the dead of night—a desperate, graphic cry for help. Each one felt like a punch to the gut. My heart would hammer against my ribs, a frantic bird in a cage of bone. I’d stare at those pictures, my vision blurring, feeling a toxic cocktail of terror, helplessness, and a strange, unwelcome sense of responsibility.

This was the crucible. In my desire to be a good friend, I had forgotten to be a good custodian of myself. I was pouring from an empty cup, and the cracks were starting to show. I was so focused on managing Alex’s crises that I was creating my own.

I knew I needed **mental health support**, not just for Alex, but for *me*. I found a therapist who specialized in supporting people who care for those with personality disorders. In her calm, sunlit office, I learned the word “splitting.” I learned that it’s a defense mechanism, a way for someone with BPD to cope with the terrifying fear of abandonment by categorizing people as all-good or all-bad. It wasn’t about me, personally. It was about the illness.

More importantly, I learned about boundaries. And I had to learn that boundaries aren’t walls; they are the guardrails
