**The Year I Almost Ditched My Bullet Journal (and Why I Didn’t)**

Okay, real talk. 2021 felt *heavy*. Scrolling through Instagram, everyone seemed to have it all figured out – perfect routines, flawless planners, and effortlessly chic bullet journals. I bought one, full of hope, and promptly stared at a blank page for a week. It felt… overwhelming. 

I almost gave up. But then I realized, this wasn't about replicating someone else’s aesthetic. It was about *me*. Tiny, imperfect entries became a lifeline.  Just tracking a few habits, a single task – it built momentum.  It wasn't about perfection, just about showing up for myself, one little bullet at a time.
