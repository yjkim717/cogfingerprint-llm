**The Weight of a Plate (and a Panic)**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a seemingly normal thing – a big, delicious meal after a hot day – can suddenly feel like a monumental threat? Last summer, I had a really unsettling experience. I’d eaten a huge plate of pasta, it was scorching hot outside, and I hadn't been drinking enough water. Suddenly, this intense discomfort built up, a tightening in my stomach, and I felt this…panic rising. 

I was scrolling through forums, desperately searching for someone who understood. It turns out, I wasn't alone. So many people grapple with anxieties like emetophobia, linked to things like constipation and the fear of something going wrong. It was a stark reminder that social media, while connecting us, can also highlight our vulnerabilities.  It made me realize how important it is to acknowledge those feelings, and to be kind to ourselves when things get overwhelming.
