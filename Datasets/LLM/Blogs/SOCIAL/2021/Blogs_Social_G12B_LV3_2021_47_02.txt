>## The Scroll and the Stillness: When Social Media Mirrors Your Lost Direction

Okay, let's be honest. How many of us have spent a Tuesday evening mindlessly scrolling, feeling…empty? I know I have. Lately, I've been wrestling with this feeling of being adrift, like I'm supposed to be *doing* something, *going* somewhere, but I just can’t quite pinpoint what it is. It’s a quiet hum of uncertainty that follows me around, especially when I’m staring at my phone.

Social media, ironically, has only amplified it. Everyone else seems to be conquering mountains, launching businesses, or perfectly curating their lives into Instagram-worthy moments. And I'm here, feeling… stuck. 

It’s not that I’m not *trying*. I’ve read the self-improvement articles, listened to the podcasts, even attempted a bullet journal (that lasted about a week!). But the motivation feels fleeting, the direction blurry. It’s like I’m paddling furiously in a pool, but not actually getting anywhere.

2021 has been… a lot. We’ve all felt it. And maybe this feeling of being lost is just a natural consequence of navigating so much change. Maybe it's okay to not have all the answers right now. Maybe the purpose isn't some grand, sweeping declaration, but a series of small, intentional steps forward. 

I’m trying to shift my focus. Less comparison, more creation. Less scrolling, more *doing*. Even if it's just a tiny step - learning a new recipe, reaching out to a friend, or finally tackling that overflowing inbox. 

Anyone else feeling this? Let’s commiserate (and maybe share some tips!) in the comments. We're all figuring this out together, right?
