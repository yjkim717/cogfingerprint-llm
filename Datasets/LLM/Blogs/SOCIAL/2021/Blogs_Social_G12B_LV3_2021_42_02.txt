## The Quiet Spaces Between Sales

It’s funny, isn’t it? How grief can sneak up on you in the most unexpected places. This year, 2021 has felt…heavy. We’re all carrying something, I think. And sometimes, it’s not a grand tragedy that hits you, but a quiet absence.

We lost a regular at the market a few weeks ago. Mrs. Eleanor. She came every Tuesday, without fail, for the heirloom tomatoes and a chat. Nothing profound, just a few minutes of small talk – the weather, her grandkids, a funny bird she’d seen in her garden. 

But those minutes, those regular Tuesdays, they built something. A connection. A sense of community woven into the aisles of fresh produce. And suddenly, that space feels…empty.

It made me think about all the little connections we build, often without realizing it. The barista who remembers your order, the librarian who always recommends a good read, the friendly face at the corner store. These are the anchors in our lives, the quiet reminders that we’re not entirely alone.

Losing Mrs. Eleanor wasn't just losing a customer; it was losing a piece of that familiar rhythm, that sense of belonging. It’s a reminder to cherish those small, everyday moments and the people who fill them. Because sometimes, the most meaningful relationships are the ones we least expect.
