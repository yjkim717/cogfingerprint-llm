Of all the ways I imagined a dental emergency unfolding, I certainly never pictured a simple forkful of salad as the culprit. But there I was in 2021, in the middle of another quiet, work-from-home lunch, when I felt that unmistakable *crunch*. My heart sank. A front tooth I’d had repaired years ago was now chipped, a casualty of my own cutlery.

It’s funny how a tiny, broken piece of bonded ceramic can instantly unravel your confidence. I found myself self-consciously covering my mouth during video calls, my smile feeling like a liability. The immediate scramble for a dentist appointment was a lesson in pandemic-era patience, a reminder that even urgent care sometimes requires waiting.

But this small eating mishap became a surprisingly social moment. Confessing my "salad incident" to friends and colleagues sparked a flood of their own stories—hidden dental dramas, clumsy accidents, and shared anxieties. It was a raw, human reminder that we’re all just navigating our own fragile realities, one unassuming bite at a time. Sometimes, it takes a broken tooth to truly connect with the imperfect, relatable people around you.
