"As I sat in front of my computer, ready to dive into a creative project, I was reminded of the frustrating experience I had with my Huion Kamvas 13 and Thunderbolt extender. While it worked seamlessly on my Windows machine, my MacOS device refused to detect it. I was baffled. In 2021, with remote work on the rise, compatibility issues like this can be a major productivity killer. I'm not alone in this struggle - many creatives face similar challenges. Has anyone else out there had a similar experience? How did you overcome it?"
