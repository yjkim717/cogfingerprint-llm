**The Red Light and the Feeling of… Nothing**

Anyone else feel like 2021 was just *full* of moments that left you feeling a little… hollow? I had one last month that’s been sticking with me. I was stuck at a red light, watching a car barrel through a solid stop light, blatantly passing another vehicle. 

It wasn’t just the blatant disregard for the rules, it was the *silence* of it all. No police, no intervention – just this aggressive act and a wave of frustration washing over me. It felt like a tiny, almost insignificant, example of something bigger: a feeling that sometimes, we’re just not seen. 

It made me think about road rage, about police inaction, and how easily we can feel powerless when witnessing blatant disrespect.  It's a weird feeling, isn’t it? Like shouting into a void.  What small moments have left *you* feeling that way lately?

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way (e.g., change the focus, add a specific detail, adjust the word count)?
