**The Quiet That Almost Drove Me Mad (And How Music Saved Me)**

Okay, be honest – how many of you feel perpetually swamped by… everything? 2021 was *rough*, right? The constant scroll, the notifications, the pressure to be ‘on’ all the time. I was drowning in it. I felt like my brain was just a frantic hummingbird, bouncing from one thing to the next with zero actual focus.

Then, out of sheer desperation, I took a week off social media. Just…gone. And it was… unsettling. I felt strangely disconnected, like a piece of me was missing. But then, I started listening to music again – really *listening*. 

It was like a switch flipped. Suddenly, I was noticing the details I’d been completely missing: the way a simple piano chord could evoke a specific memory, the rhythm that grounded me in the present moment.  I rediscovered a deep appreciation for music, and it actually helped me feel *more* present in my work. 

It made me realize that sometimes, disconnecting from the noise of social isn’t about avoiding it entirely, but about creating space to reconnect with what truly matters – like the quiet inspiration that lies within us all.
