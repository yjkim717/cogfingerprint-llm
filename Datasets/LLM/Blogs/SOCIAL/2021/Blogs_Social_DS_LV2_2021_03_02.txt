Remember that weird sense of accomplishment in 2021, when a freshly cleaned dishwasher felt like a major life win? In a world that had shrunk to the four walls of our homes, my biggest rebellion was tackling the soap scum in the washing machine.

It started with a musty smell. I’d ignored the little maintenance tasks for so long, assuming everything was fine until it very clearly wasn't. So, I ran that empty hot cycle and fished a shocking amount of gunk from the trap. It was a small, almost silly act, but it felt profoundly symbolic.

It made me think about us. How often do we just keep running on full load, ignoring the buildup of little stresses until we feel sluggish and less effective? That year taught me the quiet power of preventative care—for our appliances, and more importantly, for ourselves. Sometimes, the most productive thing you can do is pause, clean out what’s weighing you down, and reset.
