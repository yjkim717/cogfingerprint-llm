## The Weight of Open Books (and the Pressure of Knowing)

Okay, so finals are looming, and this year’s a weird one – open-book exam for linear algebra, multidimensional ODEs, and even stochastics! Sounds great, right? Access to everything! But honestly, the anxiety is *real*. It’s not about *if* I can find the answer, it's about sifting through a mountain of notes under pressure. It feels like a test of recall and quick thinking, not just knowledge. Anyone else feeling the weight of all that potential staring back at them? Hoping I can pull it together!
