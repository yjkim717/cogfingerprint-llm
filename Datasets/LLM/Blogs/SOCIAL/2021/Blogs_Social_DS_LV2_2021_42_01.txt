Of all the sounds I’ve come to associate with my neighborhood over the years—the rustle of those grand, century-old oaks, the distant church bells on a Sunday morning—I never thought I’d be adding thumping bass and the roar of construction machinery to the list.

It started subtly. The old stone church, a quiet neighbor for decades, was sold. At first, we were hopeful. New life for an old building! But that hope quickly soured. The new owner converted it into an events venue. Suddenly, our serene evenings were punctuated by loud music and rowdy crowds. The peace we cherished was being parceled out for profit.

Then came the real blow. A notice arrived about a development plan. To make way for more parking, they intend to tear down those magnificent oaks. These aren't just trees; they're living history. They've shaded generations of families, witnessed countless quiet moments.

It feels like a piece of our community's soul is being chipped away, replaced by concrete and noise. In 2021, a year already so full of collective anxiety and loss, this local conflict hits harder. It’s a stark reminder that progress, when it dismisses both environment and community, isn't progress at all. It’s just loss, dressed up as development.
