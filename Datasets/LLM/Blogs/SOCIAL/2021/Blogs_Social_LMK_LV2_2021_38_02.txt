As I browsed online marketplaces in 2021, I stumbled upon a rare, unreleased toy for sale at a pawn shop, sparking curiosity. How did it end up there? I wondered, thinking of "Pawn Stars." Do pawn shops really sell stolen goods? I started pondering the fine line between treasure hunting and potential prototype theft. How do pawn shops handle such items, and what's their role in toy collecting? The more I thought about it, the more questions I had.
