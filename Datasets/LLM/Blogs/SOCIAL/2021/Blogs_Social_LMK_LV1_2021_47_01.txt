"As I scrolled through Instagram in 2021, I felt a pang of guilt seeing perfectly decorated bullet journals. I had just started mine, but consistency was a struggle. I'd miss a day or two, and then I'd fall behind. I reached out to fellow journalers for advice and was surprised by their honesty - they too had faced similar challenges. Their tips helped me establish a habit, and I slowly started to see the benefits of journaling. Now, my bullet journal is my go-to productivity tool, and I'm grateful for the community that helped me get there."
