It was one of those surreal 2021 moments that could only happen in VR gaming. I’d just loaded back into my underwater base, ready to continue my peaceful exploration, when my stomach dropped—my trusty Seamoth was gone. Just… vanished.

At first, I blamed a glitch. We’ve all been there, right? That digital heart-sink when something you’ve worked for just poofs due to a bug. I was already mentally drafting a frustrated post for the game’s subreddit.

But then I saw them: a pack of crabsnakes, lazily drifting near where I’d parked. The awful truth dawned. They hadn’t just been passing through; they’d dismantled my ride while I was “away.” It was a humbling reminder that even in a virtual world, you’re never truly disconnected. Your creations, your progress—it can all be upended by the ecosystem, digital or otherwise. It made me think about how fragile our own social constructs felt that year, how easily our own routines could be disrupted by unseen forces. A little glitch, or a pack of pixel predators, can change everything.
