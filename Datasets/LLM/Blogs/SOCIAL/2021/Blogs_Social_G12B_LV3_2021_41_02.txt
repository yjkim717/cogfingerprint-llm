## The Summer Blues Are Real (And They're Not About the Heat)

Okay, let's be honest. Summer isn't *always* sunshine and rainbows, is it? I saw a really relatable post on Reddit the other day that perfectly captured how I’ve been feeling, and I think a lot of us can probably relate. 

There’s this unspoken pressure, especially in 2021 with everyone eager to make up for lost time, to be perpetually joyful during summer. Instagram feeds are overflowing with beach days and smiling faces, and it can feel… isolating if you're not feeling it. 

For me, the heat itself adds another layer. The discomfort, the constant sweating – it just amplifies any underlying anxiety or sadness. It's hard to relax when you're actively battling the weather! 

And the worst part? When you *don't* seem to be having the "perfect summer," people just assume you’re being difficult. It’s frustrating to have your feelings dismissed because they don't fit the seasonal narrative. 

So, to anyone else feeling a little blue despite the sunshine – you're not alone. It’s okay to not be okay, even in July. Let’s normalize acknowledging that summer can be tough for some of us.
