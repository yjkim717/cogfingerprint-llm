**The Day My Salad Ruined My Smile (and My Weekend)**

Okay, you guys, I need to confess something embarrassing. It’s a full-blown TIFU moment from Reddit – and honestly, it’s still stinging a little. It was late August 2021, and I was determined to eat healthier. I’d just gotten a new, super-strong composite filling, and my dentist had practically sworn it would last forever. 

So, I’m happily munching on a massive, gorgeous salad – all fresh veggies and a ridiculously creamy dressing – when *it* happened. A tiny, rogue piece of romaine slipped, and I instinctively clamped down to stop it from going down the wrong way. 

Cue a sickening crack. 

Turns out, that beautiful, supposedly indestructible filling had shattered.  Suddenly, my healthy eating plan was overshadowed by a frantic Google search for “emergency dentists near me.”  Seriously, the internet is brutal sometimes. Let’s just say, salads and dental work don't always mix!

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different theme?
