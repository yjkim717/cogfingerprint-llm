There’s something about a teething puppy in 2021—a year that had us all craving comfort—that makes you forgive the tiny nibbles. My little guy has this hilarious habit: he’ll let out a big, dramatic yawn before gently gnawing on my arm, like he’s asking permission. It’s the cutest paradox—balancing that heart-melting moment with consistent training. I’m learning that patience isn’t about stifling his playful spirit, but guiding it. In a time when connection felt fragile, these small, repetitive rituals of care—redirecting a nibble, rewarding calm—quietly wove us together. Who knew puppy training could be such a gentle lesson in presence?
