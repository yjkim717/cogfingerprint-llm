**The Invisible Load: When Supporting Others Feels Like a Burden**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 felt like a year of juggling, didn’t it? Between the pandemic, shifting work dynamics, and just trying to keep our heads above water, the concept of “balance” felt more like a mythical unicorn than a realistic goal. 

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about something I witnessed recently, and it’s stuck with me. A friend of mine, let's call her Sarah, was absolutely brilliant at her job – consistently going above and beyond, taking on extra projects, and generally being a rockstar employee. Then, she announced she was going on maternity leave. 

Instead of the celebratory support she expected, she found herself facing something incredibly frustrating. Colleagues, needing coverage during her time off, were being generously compensated with extra days, even weeks, of leave. Sarah, meanwhile, felt like her dedication and hard work were being overlooked. It wasn’t about *wanting* time off, it was about feeling like her contributions weren’t valued, like her choice to prioritize her family was being unfairly penalized.

It really highlighted something bigger – this insidious layer of gender inequality that still exists, even in supposedly progressive workplaces. We talk a lot about work-life balance and family leave, but the reality is often far more complicated. 

It’s easy to assume that supporting others is just part of being a good colleague, a good friend, a good *person*. But it shouldn't come at the expense of your own career progression or feeling valued.  I think we need to shift the conversation away from just *giving* leave and towards recognizing and rewarding the vital support roles that people take on, regardless of their gender. 

What are your thoughts? Have you ever felt this way? Let’s chat in the comments.
