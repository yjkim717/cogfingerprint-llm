**The Endless Application Loop**

Okay, real talk. Applying for jobs as a student nurse felt… brutal in 2021. I was desperately chasing PCT roles, pinning my hopes on those clinical placements. I’d send out a hundred applications, get radio silence, or worse, a polite rejection. It was seriously draining. 

Honestly, the social aspect of it all was tough too. Seeing everyone else land amazing rotations and secure roles felt like a highlight reel, while I was stuck in this endless application loop. It’s easy to feel like you're failing when you’re not getting responses.  Anyone else feel this way?

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a post focused on a slightly different angle (e.g., the impact of clinicals on the job search)?
