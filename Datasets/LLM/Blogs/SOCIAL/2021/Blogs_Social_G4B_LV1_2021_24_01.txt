**Scrolling Through a Screen, Feeling…Something?**

Remember 2021?  It felt like everyone was *on* social media, yet simultaneously, utterly distant.  I spent so much time liking posts and commenting, convinced I was connecting, but honestly, it often felt like watching a highlight reel of other people's lives.

It was a quiet realization, but a powerful one.
