**The Shame of Silence: Asking for Help When It Feels Like the End of the World**

Okay, let’s be real. 2021 felt…heavy. There was a constant hum of anxiety, a pressure to *do* everything, *be* everything. And for a while, I was drowning in a secret. A secret about bulimia, about the relentless cycle of restriction and bingeing, about the way it was slowly chipping away at my life.

What’s really hard, and I think this is something a lot of people with eating disorders experience, is the sheer shame. It felt impossible to admit it, let alone ask for help. So, I kept it bottled up, pushing through, pretending everything was okay – even when it felt like the end of the world. 

Then, I had to take a job leave. It was terrifying to even *consider* it. The thought of explaining, of admitting I wasn’t “okay,” felt like exposing a gaping wound. But the truth is, I was collapsing. 

It was a tiny, shaky step, but it was a step. And it sparked a realization: seeking help isn't a sign of weakness; it’s a sign of strength. It’s acknowledging you’re not fighting this battle alone.  If you’re struggling, please, *please* know that you don't have to carry the weight by yourself.  There is support out there, and reaching out is always an option.
