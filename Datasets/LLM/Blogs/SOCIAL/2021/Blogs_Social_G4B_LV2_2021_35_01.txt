**The Brushstrokes of a Shield**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How we build these little defenses, these carefully constructed layers, especially when things feel like they’re crumbling around you. Last year, 2021, I found myself reaching for my makeup more and more. Not to put on a show, but to…well, to just *be*. 

I was battling a pretty heavy dose of depression, and the world felt overwhelming. The bright lights of social media, the constant pressure to “be okay” – it was suffocating. So, I’d apply a layer of foundation, a swipe of mascara, and suddenly, for a little while, I felt…contained. 

But then my family started noticing. They questioned how “bad” I *really* was, suggesting it was “just a phase.” It stung.
