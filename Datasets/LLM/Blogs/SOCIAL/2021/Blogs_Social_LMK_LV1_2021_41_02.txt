**The Uninvited Guest: Summer Anxiety**

As I watched the sun shine brightly outside my window in the summer of 2021, I couldn't help but feel a pang of anxiety. For many, summer is a time of joy and freedom, but for me, it's a season of self-doubt and unease. The pressure to be carefree and happy can be overwhelming, making me feel like I'm the only one who's not enjoying the sunshine. Social media doesn't help, with seemingly perfect bodies and vacations flooding my feeds. I struggle with body image issues, feeling like I don't measure up to the summer ideal. As the world around me celebrates the warmth and long days, I'm left to navigate my own feelings of inadequacy. It's a harsh reminder that mental health is just as important as physical health, and that it's okay to not be okay, even in the sunniest of seasons.
