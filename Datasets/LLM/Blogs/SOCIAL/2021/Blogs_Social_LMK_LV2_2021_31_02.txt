In 2021, I stumbled upon a Reddit post that made me appreciate the intricacies of American Sign Language (ASL). A user was struggling to understand a specific sign, detailing hand shapes and movements, including the role of the non-dominant hand. This sparked reflection on the beauty of ASL and the importance of community in learning and sharing sign language, highlighting the value of connection and understanding in our increasingly diverse world.
