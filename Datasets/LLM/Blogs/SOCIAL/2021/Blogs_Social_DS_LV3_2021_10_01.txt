### The Music Was On, But I Wasn't Really Listening

For years, my life had a soundtrack. Walking to work? Podcast in my ears. Doing dishes? A curated indie playlist. Trying to focus with my wonderfully scattered ADHD brain? Let’s add some lo-fi beats. Music was the constant background hum to my existence, a tool to fill the silence and, I thought, to help me concentrate.

But in the strange stillness of 2021, I hit a wall. The constant stream of sound wasn't helping me focus; it was just another form of noise. I felt creatively drained, like I was consuming art but never truly digesting it. On a whim, I decided to try something radical: I took a break. I took out my earbuds and walked to the park in silence.

At first, the quiet was unnerving. My brain, used to the stimulation, felt like a browser with too many tabs open. But then, something shifted. I started to hear the rhythm of my own footsteps, the melody of distant laughter, the intricate harmony of wind in the leaves. I was practicing *presence*, something I’d struggled with my whole life.

That evening, instead of putting music on as background filler, I sat on my couch, put on a single album I loved, and did nothing else. I just listened. *Actively*. I followed the bassline, I sat with the emotion in the singer’s voice, I noticed the spaces *between* the notes. It wasn't a passive experience; it was a conversation.

The result was surprising. By narrowing my intake—by choosing depth over breadth—I didn't feel my *inspiration* shrink. I felt it deepen. The frantic, scattered search for the next new thing was replaced by a rich, meaningful connection to the art right in front of me. My ADHD mind, which often jumps from one idea to the next, finally had a single, beautiful thread to follow.

I’m not saying I’ve abandoned playlists. But now, I make space for the silence that makes the music matter. I’ve learned that sometimes, to truly hear the world’s song, you first have to be brave enough to turn down the volume on your own.
