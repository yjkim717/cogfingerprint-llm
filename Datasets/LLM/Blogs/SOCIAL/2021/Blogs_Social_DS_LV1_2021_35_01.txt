**The Makeup Mask (2021)**

It’s a weird paradox, living inside a depressive episode in 2021. On my worst days, the thought of a shower feels like preparing for a marathon. Brushing my teeth? A monumental task. But sitting at my vanity and meticulously applying a full face of makeup? That, I could do.

It was my armor. With winged liner and contoured cheeks, I could almost convince myself I was okay. I could certainly convince everyone else during our weekly family Zooms. “You look great!” they’d say, and I’d die a little inside. Their compliments felt like accusations. If I looked put-together, how could I possibly be sick?

The anxiety set in—a new layer over the depression. Was I not appearing “sick enough” to deserve my medication or my therapist's time? I was performing wellness so well that my own performance was used as evidence against my pain. I’ve since learned that mental illness isn’t a monolith. Sometimes, the mask isn’t hiding health; it’s a desperate, glittery cry for it from someone drowning just beneath the surface.
