You know that moment when you witness something so clearly wrong, and yet nothing happens? I had one of those drives home last week.

Stuck behind a slow-moving truck on a winding road, we were all obeying the double yellow lines. Then, a black sedan just… went for it. It roared past the truck, then two other cars, and even a police cruiser coming the other way. My heart jumped. *Finally,* I thought, *this guy is getting a ticket.*

But the police car didn’t even flick on its lights. It just drove on.

It left me feeling strangely deflated. We all see the rules—the solid lines, the speed limits—as a social contract. We follow them for collective safety. But when someone brazenly breaks them in front of the very people tasked with enforcement, and faces zero consequences, what does that say? It chips away at that fragile trust. It whispers that the rules might only apply to some of us, some of the time. And in 2021, a year already filled with questions about fairness and accountability, that’s a disheartening message to receive on your evening commute.
