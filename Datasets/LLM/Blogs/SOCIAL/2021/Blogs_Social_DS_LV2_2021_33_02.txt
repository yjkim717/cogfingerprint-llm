### The Clock is Ticking, But What Are We Counting?

It hit me the other day, scrolling through LinkedIn. Another “hustle porn” post from a CEO, glorifying 5 AM starts and claiming sleep is a luxury. And my first thought wasn’t inspiration; it was a cold, sinking dread. Is this really the blueprint for my life?

I’m 21. I’m supposed to be hungry, ambitious, ready to conquer the world. And part of me is. But a louder part is terrified of the trade-off. The narrative we’ve been sold—that success means burning the candle at both ends—feels like a one-way ticket to burnout. I see my parents, who sacrificed so much for their careers, and I wonder about the birthday parties and quiet Tuesday nights they missed.

My fear isn’t of hard work. It’s of time scarcity. It’s the anxiety that if I pour everything into building a career in this uncertain post-2021 world, I’ll look up at 40 and realize I forgot to build a life. I want a career, yes, but I also want to be present for the people I love. I want to know my friends’ middle names and have the energy to enjoy a lazy Sunday.

Maybe the real ambition for our generation isn’t just climbing the ladder, but building a life where we don’t feel the clock ticking us toward a breakdown. Maybe balance isn’t a weakness, but the ultimate goal.
