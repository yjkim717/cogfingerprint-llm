As a third-year nursing student in 2021, I wondered if I was ready to apply for Patient Care Technician (PCT) jobs, despite lacking direct healthcare experience. I was still navigating nursing clinicals and building my skills. But I realized that taking on a PCT role could be a valuable stepping stone. It would not only give me hands-on experience but also demonstrate my commitment to the healthcare field. I decided to take the leap and apply, and it ended up being a great way to gain practical skills and confidence in my abilities.
