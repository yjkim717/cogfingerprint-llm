## Does Anyone Else Feel Like NYC on TV is a Total Lie?

Okay, I need to vent. I saw a post on Reddit the other day that hit *so* close to home. Someone was tearing apart how TV shows portray New York City – and they were right! It's always this breezy, effortless glide from apartment to cafe to meeting, with nary a subway delay or crowded sidewalk in sight. 

Seriously, where are the frantic dashes for the bus? The agonizing wait for an Uber during rush hour? The sheer *chaos* of navigating Times Square? 

Living in NYC is beautiful and vibrant, absolutely. But it's also a daily obstacle course. I just wish our favorite shows would show a little more realism. It would make the stories feel so much more… well, *real*. Am I alone in thinking this? Let me know in the comments!
