It’s 2021, and I’m deep in my BSN program—acing exams, thriving in clinicals, but hitting a wall with job applications. I thought my nursing student experience would make me a shoo-in for PCT roles, but so far, it’s been rejection after rejection. It’s humbling, honestly. I’m learning that even with strong grades, real-world healthcare doors don’t just swing open. But I’m not giving up; every “no” is pushing me to network harder and refine my approach. There’s a place for me in patient care—I just have to find it.
