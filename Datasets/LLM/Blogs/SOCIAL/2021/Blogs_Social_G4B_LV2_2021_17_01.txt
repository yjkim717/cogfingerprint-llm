**The Rejection Pile & the Quiet Hope**

Okay, real talk. 2021 felt like a year of endless applications, mostly for PCT jobs. As a nursing student, I was *desperate* to get into a hospital, to start learning. But the rejection emails… they piled up. It stung, honestly. Scrolling through LinkedIn, seeing everyone seemingly land their dream roles, felt pretty demoralizing. 

I started questioning everything. Was I not good enough? Was I applying wrong?  But then I’d remember why I was doing this – the desire to care, to help. It’s a quiet hope that keeps me going, reminding me that one “no” doesn't define the “yes” that’s waiting.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a different version focusing on a specific angle (like the impact of social media on job searching)?
