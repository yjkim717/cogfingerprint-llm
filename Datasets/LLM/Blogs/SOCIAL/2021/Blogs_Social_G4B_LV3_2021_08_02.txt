**The Weight of Unmet Expectations**

Remember those summer evenings in 2021? Trying to carve out a little peace amidst the chaos. I saw a spark of it – a fleeting moment of connection – but then… it would just dissolve. Lately, I’ve been noticing a rising tide of frustration, not just in myself, but observing it in others too. 

It’s that familiar feeling of *disgust* when you witness a blatant disregard for shared spaces, a quiet *neglect* of basic courtesy. I saw a family in a restaurant last month, completely absorbed in their phones, leaving a trail of crumbs and abandoned plates. It wasn't about them, really, but about the unspoken expectation that everyone else would clean up after them. 

It’s a subtle form of *disrespect*, isn't it? And it leaves a residue of sadness. We all crave a little kindness, a little consideration.  It made me think about the pressures we put on parents, and how easily those pressures can lead to… well, to things like a shockingly angry note left in a hotel room.  A stark reminder of the weight of unmet expectations.
