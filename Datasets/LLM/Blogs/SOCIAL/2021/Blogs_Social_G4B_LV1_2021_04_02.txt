**Finding Beauty in the Uncommon**

It’s weird, right? Scrolling through Instagram in 2021 and seeing this intense fascination with…vitiligo? I started thinking about how often we see people with visible differences reduced to a visual “problem,” and it felt wrong. I've been sketching, tentatively, trying to create characters *with* vitiligo – not *despite* it. It’s a delicate balance, honestly.  My goal isn’t to create “perfect” representations, but to explore beauty in the unexpected and hopefully, spark a little more thoughtful consideration.
