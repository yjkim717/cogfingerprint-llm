It’s wild—I was watching *Pawn Stars* the other day, and there it was: an unreleased Boba Fett prototype. My mind went straight to the rules. Pawn shops have to check for stolen goods, right? So how’d this one-of-a-kind piece slip through? It got me thinking about all the untold stories behind collectibles. In a world where everything’s tracked, some treasures still move in the shadows. Makes you wonder what else is out there, just waiting to surface.
