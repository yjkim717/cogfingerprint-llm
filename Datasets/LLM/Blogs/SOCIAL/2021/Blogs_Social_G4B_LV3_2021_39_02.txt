**Rosie’s Rumble: When Love Isn’t Enough**

It’s funny how quickly a seemingly perfect picture can crack. Last year, I was so proud of Rosie, my English Mastiff. She was gentle, loving, and adored our neighbor’s golden retriever, Gus. Then came the dog park. Suddenly, Rosie transformed. This sweet girl, who’d happily snuggle, became a whirlwind of anxious energy, barking and pulling at her lead whenever another dog approached. 

It felt… heartbreaking. I’d envisioned those sunny afternoons filled with happy tail wags, but instead, it was a stressful battle of wills. We’ve been working hard on socialization, cautiously introducing her to new dogs, but it’s a slow process. 

I realized it wasn’t about *not* liking other dogs, but about feeling overwhelmed. It’s a constant reminder that sometimes, even with the best intentions and a whole lot of love, our furry friends need us to understand their individual anxieties. It’s a journey, not a race, and learning to recognize those signals is everything.
