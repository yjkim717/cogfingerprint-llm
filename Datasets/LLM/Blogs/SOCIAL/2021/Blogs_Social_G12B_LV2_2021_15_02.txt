## The Gluten-Free Gauntlet: A Little Too Much Protocol?

Okay, let's be honest, 2021 has been *a lot*. Between everything else, navigating dietary restrictions has felt like a whole other level of complexity. I've seen it firsthand, and I'm sure many of you have too. It’s not just about the food itself; it’s about the anxiety, the vigilance, and sometimes, the slight awkwardness of it all.

Recently, a story popped up online about a student worker in a dining hall who was *really* committed to gluten-free protocols. Like, *really* committed. Apparently, they were meticulously cleaning surfaces, questioning every ingredient, and generally slowing things down for everyone, even those who just wanted a regular slice of pizza.

At first, I chuckled. A bit of playful dedication, right? But the more I thought about it, the more it got under my skin. It’s a reminder of how serious food allergies and sensitivities truly are. For some people, a tiny crumb of gluten can trigger a serious reaction. That’s not something to take lightly. And it's understandable why someone, especially someone responsible for food safety, would want to be extra cautious.

But then there’s the other side of the coin. The frustration of waiting in line, already stressed from a long day of classes or work, only to be met with a barrage of questions and a significantly delayed meal. It's easy to feel like you’re being penalized for something you didn’t do wrong.

It really highlights this weird tension we have these days – a desire for heightened safety and awareness colliding with the everyday realities of convenience and efficiency. It’s a problem that extends beyond dining halls, doesn't it? We’re all a little more anxious, a little more aware of potential risks, and sometimes that manifests in ways that can feel a bit…overwhelming.

I think it's a good reminder to practice empathy. To remember that behind every request, every question, there’s a story. And maybe, just maybe, a little bit of understanding can go a long way in making these interactions – whether in a dining hall or anywhere else – a little less stressful for everyone.  It's about finding that balance between protecting those who need it and respecting the needs of everyone else.

What are your thoughts? Have you ever experienced a situation where well-intentioned protocol felt a little *too* intense? Let me know in the comments!
