**The Quiet Shame of Scrolling**

2021 felt…loud. Not with noise, but with connection. I was *on* all the time – Instagram, Twitter, endless scrolling. And honestly? It was exhausting. I’d have these clear intentions – “Let’s reach out to Sarah!” or “I *should* start that project” – but then I’d get sucked into the highlight reel of everyone else’s lives. 

It felt like a massive executive dysfunction problem: the urge to initiate, followed by a paralyzing inability to actually *do* anything.  That quiet shame of knowing I was struggling, while appearing perfectly fine online? Yeah, that was a tough one to navigate.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most productive thing we can do is step *away* from the screen.
