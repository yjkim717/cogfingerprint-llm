## The Tightrope Walk: Friendship, BPD, and Holding Onto Myself

It's late. Like, *really* late. The kind of late where the house is quiet, the only sound is the hum of the refrigerator, and your brain finally decides to unpack everything it’s been shoving down all day. Tonight, it’s unpacking the weight of friendship. Specifically, the weight of being a friend to someone navigating Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD).

I won’t go into a clinical description of BPD. There are plenty of resources online that do that far better than I ever could. What I *will* talk about is the reality of it, the messy, complicated, and often exhausting reality, as experienced from the other side of the friendship.

My friend, let's call her Sarah, is incredible. Truly. She’s witty, creative, fiercely loyal, and has a laugh that can light up a room. But she also struggles.  She struggles with intense emotional swings, with a feeling of emptiness that she desperately tries to fill, and with a pattern of unstable relationships.  And sometimes, that struggle manifests in ways that are… difficult.

Over the past year (2021 has been *something*, hasn’t it?), I’ve found myself increasingly in the role of emotional first responder.  There have been late-night texts filled with raw pain, declarations of feeling utterly alone, and, heartbreakingly, episodes of self-harm. Each time, my instinct is to *fix* it. To offer reassurance, to tell her it will be okay, to absorb some of her pain. And I *do* try. I really do. I listen. I validate. I offer support.

But lately, I've started to feel… stretched. Thin. Like a rubber band pulled too tight. 

One of the biggest challenges has been what I understand to be "splitting." It’s a term I’ve learned about through research and understanding Sarah’s experiences, and it describes a shift in perception where someone sees people – or even themselves – as entirely good or entirely bad, with no shades of grey.  It's incredibly disorienting to be on the receiving end. One minute, I’m the best friend in the world, the only person who *gets* her. The next, I’m being accused of things I haven’t done, of being uncaring, of abandoning her. The accusations sting, even when I know, logically, that they're stemming from a place of intense distress and not from any real malice.

And that’s where the anxiety kicks in. My own anxiety. It's always been a part of me, a low-level hum in the background. But being in this kind of friendship has amplified it. I find myself constantly second-guessing my actions, wondering if I said the right thing, if I did enough, if I’m *good enough* as a friend. I replay conversations in my head, analyzing every word, every tone, searching
