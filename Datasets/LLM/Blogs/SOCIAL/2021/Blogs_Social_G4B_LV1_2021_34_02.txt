**The Quiet Aftermath**

It feels weird to write this, but last month, everything shifted. A car accident – thankfully, I walked away with just a few scrapes – but the aftershocks are still there. The biggest one? That lingering, unsettling feeling of disorientation. I lost consciousness for a few minutes, and when I came to, there was this weird, constant drip from my ear. 

It led to a battery of tests, including a head CT, and finally, a consultation with a neurology doctor. Turns out it was just fluid buildup, a really unsettling, jarring experience. It made me think about how fragile we are, and how even a seemingly minor event can trigger such a deep, internal shift.  Social media felt…different afterward.  More intense.  I started noticing how easily we project our own anxieties, and how important it is to actually *listen* to each other, not just react. 2021 was already a strange year, and this just added another layer.
