The vicious cycle of anxiety and bodily woes. I still recall the day I had a panic attack triggered by nothing more than a heavy meal and dehydration. As I sat on the toilet, cramping and diarrhea wreaking havoc on my body, my mind spiralled out of control. The fear of being sick, a constant companion for someone with emetophobia like myself, took over. Constipation may be a more common issue for some, but for me, it was the opposite - a frantic urge to go, and a body that wouldn't cooperate. Dehydration didn't help, and before I knew it, I was in the midst of a full-blown panic attack. It was 2021, and I was already struggling with anxiety; this was just another manifestation of it. As I reflect on that day, I'm reminded that sometimes, our bodies can be our own worst enemies - and that anxiety can be both the cause and effect of our physical woes.
