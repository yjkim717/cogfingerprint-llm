## The Algorithm Reminded Me of My Childhood

It’s funny how social media works, isn't it? Today, Spotify just threw me back to the early 2000s with a "Throwback Thursday" playlist featuring S.E.S. and BoA. Instantly, I was transported. Suddenly, I was 12 again, spending hours meticulously copying lyrics into a notebook and dreaming of sparkly stages. 

It's more than just the music, though. It’s the feeling. That era of Korean pop – H.O.T., g.o.d – it was just so hopeful and energetic. A genuine wave of nostalgia washed over me. Makes you wonder what future generations will look back on and feel this way about *our* music, doesn't it? A little bittersweet, really.
