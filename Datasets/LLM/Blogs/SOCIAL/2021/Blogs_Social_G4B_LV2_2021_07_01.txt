**The Scroll & The Void**

Remember 2021? Scrolling through social felt… endless. Beautiful photos, witty comments, everyone seemed to be *doing* something amazing. And me? I was staring at a blank screen, paralyzed by the thought of starting *anything* new. 

It felt like a lack of direction – a frustrating void where motivation used to be. I’d see someone researching a fascinating topic, and I’d just… stop. Where do you even *begin*? 

It took a conscious effort to step away from the highlight reel and just pick *one* tiny thing. It’s okay to not have all the answers, right?
