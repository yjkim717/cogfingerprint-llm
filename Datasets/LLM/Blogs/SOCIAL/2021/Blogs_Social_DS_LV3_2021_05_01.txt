It’s 2021, and I’m hunched over my laptop, trying to will my internet to cooperate. You know the feeling: the spinning wheel of doom, the pixelated video calls, that sinking dread when your screen freezes mid-sentence. I’ve got the fancy router, the high-speed plan, and I’ve even updated my ethernet drivers like some kind of IT whisperer. For a glorious hour, everything is fast—blissfully, silently fast. Then, it’s back to the digital molasses.

It’s become a strange social barometer. My friends’ voices cut out just as they’re sharing big news. Work colleagues politely ask, “Are you still there?” while I’m frantically resetting the modem. In a world more connected than ever, my own little portal to it keeps flickering. It’s a reminder of how fragile our digital threads are—and how much we rely on them to feel close, even when we’re apart.
