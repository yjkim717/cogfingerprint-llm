"I'm one of those people with a 'resting sad face.' People often ask if I'm okay or if something's wrong, simply because my neutral expression is misread as distress. It's 2021, and I'm used to it, but it still gets to me. I wonder, are we so conditioned to associate a relaxed face with negativity that we forget what neutrality looks like? I'm just being me, not sad, just... me."
