## The Frustrating Dance with My Internet

Seriously, does anyone else feel like their internet connection is playing a cruel joke? I'm paying for blazing-fast speeds – 600mbps! – but consistently getting a measly 30mbps. Router restarts offer a fleeting moment of hope, a speed surge that vanishes almost as quickly as it arrives. It's 2021, we should have better than this! It's a constant reminder that even with all the tech, sometimes things just… don’t work as they should.
