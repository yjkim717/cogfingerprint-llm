"Bringing home my 8-week-old kitten, Luna, was a whirlwind experience in 2021. As I settled into our new routine, I noticed she was struggling with constipation and seemed nervous around me. I turned to social media for advice, joining online forums and connecting with fellow kitten owners. Their tips on dietary changes and gentle handling helped ease Luna's discomfort and calm her nerves. It was a relief to find support and guidance during those early days, and I'm grateful for the online community that helped me give Luna a happy, healthy start."
