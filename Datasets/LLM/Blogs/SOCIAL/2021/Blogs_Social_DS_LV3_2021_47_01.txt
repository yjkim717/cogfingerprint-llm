It’s 2021, and my bullet journal lies open, intimidatingly blank. I’m told it’s the ultimate tool for organization, a place for tasks and habits. But where do I even start? The struggle is real. I stare at the empty pages, feeling the pressure to create a perfect system. Then I remember: this isn't for an audience. It's for me. So I scribble one small task. Then another. The habit begins not with a grand plan, but with a single, messy, honest mark. And that’s enough.
