**The Weirdest Period Feeling I’ve Ever Had**

Okay, so 2021 was… a lot. Navigating everything as an FTM (transgender man) felt like a constant puzzle. Lately, I’ve been getting these phantom cramps – sharp, insistent pains with absolutely no bleeding. It’s completely baffling, and honestly, a little unsettling.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post focusing on a slightly different angle (e.g., the anxiety around this experience)?
