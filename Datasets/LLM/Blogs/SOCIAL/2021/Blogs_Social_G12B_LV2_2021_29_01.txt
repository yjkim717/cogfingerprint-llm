Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided summary and instructions, aiming for a reflective and relatable tone within a 2021 context.  I've focused on the emotional weight and accessibility issues.  I've also included a suggested title.

**Title: The Weight of Grief and the Gray Areas of Enjoyment**

It's hard to admit this, but I've been wrestling with *Berserk* lately. Not because the story itself is failing to grip me – far from it. It's… complicated. Kentaro Miura’s passing hit me, and so many others, incredibly hard. The sheer artistry and dedication he poured into that world is staggering, and mourning his loss has made truly *enjoying* the series a strange, bittersweet experience.

Then there's the frustrating reality of accessing it. Streaming services are patchy, and honestly, the legal options feel limited. I know supporting creators is important, but navigating the landscape feels… murky. It’s a weird guilt, wanting to immerse myself in something so profoundly linked to a loss, while also feeling uneasy about how I'm doing it. I’m sure I'm not alone in grappling with these feelings in a world where accessing art often feels like a battle.
