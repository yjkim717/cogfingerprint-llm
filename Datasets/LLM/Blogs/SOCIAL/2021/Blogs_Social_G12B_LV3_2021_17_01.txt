## The PCT Pursuit: Feeling Stuck (and a Little Lost)

Okay, real talk. As a third-year BSN student in 2021, I’m facing a hurdle I didn’t quite anticipate: landing a PCT role. I know, I know, it’s a fantastic stepping stone, a way to get hands-on experience before fully diving into nursing. But the applications… they're piling up, and the rejections are starting to sting. 

It's frustrating! I'm pouring over application tips, highlighting every "essential skill," but it feels like something's missing. Maybe it's the lack of prior healthcare experience? Or am I just not selling myself well enough? 

Anyone else navigating this tricky job search feeling a bit lost? I’d love to hear your advice and connect with fellow student nurses – we’re all in this together! #studentnurse #pct #healthcarejobs
