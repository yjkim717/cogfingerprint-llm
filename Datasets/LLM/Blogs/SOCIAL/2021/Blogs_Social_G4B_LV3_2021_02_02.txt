**The Sudden Vanishing Act**

Remember those moments in 2021 when everything just… disappeared? Not in a dramatic, existential way, but a frustrating, glitchy kind of way. It reminded me of that *Subnautica* player I read about – that feeling of losing something precious, a Seamoth swallowed by the vastness of the game. 

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a digital world can trigger those primal anxieties about loss.  I felt it then, scrolling through social media, seeing perfectly curated lives and feeling a weird pang of… something. Like a connection was severed, a shared experience gone. 

Maybe it’s just the internet, but those sudden disappearances – both in games and online – force you to confront the fragile nature of connection and the importance of truly *seeing* each other.
