### The Email I Never Sent (And The Lesson It Taught Me)

So, there I was in the spring of 2021, staring at my student portal. The little box next to “Sociology 301” didn’t say “A” or “B.” It said “I.” Incomplete.

My stomach dropped. An “I” feels worse than an F. An F is a clean, if brutal, break. An “I” is a purgatory of your own making, a constant, nagging reminder of unfinished business. And the worst part? I felt utterly powerless.

Here’s the story. The entire semester, I’d been the model student. I’d attended every Zoom lecture (my camera dutifully on), aced the midterm, and contributed to the breakout room discussions. All that stood between me and my degree was the final paper. I poured my soul into it, researching late into the night, crafting what I thought was a compelling argument about digital community building during the lockdowns.

I submitted it with a sense of pride. Then, silence.

Weeks went by. The grade wasn’t posted. I emailed my professor. Then I emailed again. Crickets. It was like my 20-page paper had vanished into a digital black hole. Finally, two days before final grades were due, a grade appeared. A 58%. And the only feedback was a single, cryptic comment: “Does not adequately address the core themes.”

I was furious. My first instinct was to fire off a scorching email. I drafted it, my fingers flying across the keyboard. I pointed out my perfect attendance, my previous high marks, the sheer unprofessionalism of the radio silence. I demanded a re-grade. It was a masterpiece of righteous indignation.

But I didn’t hit send.

I took a walk instead, mask on, just pacing my neighborhood. In that quiet space, my anger started to morph into something else: perspective. My professor wasn’t a villain in a movie. She was a human being navigating the same impossible year I was—a year of endless screen time, blurred boundaries, and collective burnout. Was she overwhelmed? Probably. Was her feedback unhelpful? Absolutely. But my initial reaction, to meet silence with fury, wouldn’t have fixed anything.

The next day, I sent a different email. It was calm and factual. I stated that I had not received any feedback to learn from and respectfully requested a chance to revise the paper based on specific guidance. I attached my original submission for reference.

It worked. She apologized for the delay, admitted she’d been swamped, and gave me the detailed notes I needed. I revised the paper, the “I” became an “A,” and I passed the course.

The social lesson wasn’t about grades or papers. It was about the space between stimulus and response. In a world that often feels like it’s running on a short fuse, the most powerful tool we have is a pause. My unsent angry email was a reaction. The one I actually sent was a response. And in 2021, a year that tested everyone’s patience, learning that difference felt more valuable than any grade on a transcript.
