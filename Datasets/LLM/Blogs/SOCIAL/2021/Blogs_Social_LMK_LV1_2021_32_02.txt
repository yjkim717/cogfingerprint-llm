"Spreading My Wings, Not Leaving Mom Behind"

As I packed my bags to move to a new city in 2021, a mix of emotions swirled inside me. Excitement for this new chapter battled with guilt over leaving my mom behind. She's always been my rock, and the thought of being miles apart made me anxious about her reaction. When I finally broke the news, her disappointment was palpable. I reassured her that regular visits and video calls would keep us close, but she still gave me the guilt trip, saying I'd be "too busy" to stay in touch. I understood her concerns, but I also knew that this move was a necessary step towards independence. As I settled into my new life, I realized that being apart didn't mean drifting apart. In fact, our long-distance relationship has brought us closer, with a newfound appreciation for the time we share.
