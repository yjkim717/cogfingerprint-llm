Remember that frantic text I sent my mentor in early 2021, my screen glowing with anxiety at 2 AM? I was paralyzed, trying to map out my next career move in a world that felt like it had been turned upside down. His reply wasn't the detailed roadmap I craved. Instead, he wrote: "You already have the map. You're just afraid to trust your own compass."

It hit me. For months, I'd been seeking external validation, treating every life decision like a complex equation needing an expert's solve. But he was right. All that noise—the self-judgment, the endless pros and cons lists—was just static drowning out my own inner voice. The best advice I ever received was the quiet realization that the most qualified person to navigate my life is, and always has been, me. The answers weren't out there; they were in here, waiting for me to stop and listen.
