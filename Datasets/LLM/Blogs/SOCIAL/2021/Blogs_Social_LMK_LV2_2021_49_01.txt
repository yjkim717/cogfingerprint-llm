As I binge-watched 90 Day Fianc√© in 2021, I couldn't help but wonder: is TLC showcasing reality TV or manufacturing drama? A Reddit user's concerns about toxic portrayals resonated with me. Are we, as viewers, complicit in perpetuating negativity, or are we simply entertained? The line between reality and reality TV is blurred.
