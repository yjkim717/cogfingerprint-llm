## The Heat, the Worry, and Why I Avoid Brunch

Okay, so today was… a lot. It started with the heat. Seriously, July in [Your City/Region] is brutal. I was out running errands, and by the time I got home, my stomach was just churning. It’s that weird feeling, you know? Like everything’s sluggish and…off.

I’m pretty sure I’m a little dehydrated, which definitely doesn’t help. And then the worrying started. You know that spiral? The one where a little discomfort becomes “Oh god, is this the start of a panic attack?” or “Am I going to be sick?” Yeah, *that* one. 

It’s ridiculous, I know. Especially because I’ve been working so hard on managing my anxiety and that whole emetophobia thing. But the physical sensations just trigger everything. Even something as simple as a bit of cramping can send me into overdrive. 

My friend invited me to brunch tomorrow. Normally, I’d be all in. But honestly, the thought of a crowded restaurant, all that food… it’s just too much right now. Self-care, right? Maybe I’ll just order takeout and watch a movie. Anyone else relate to days like this?
