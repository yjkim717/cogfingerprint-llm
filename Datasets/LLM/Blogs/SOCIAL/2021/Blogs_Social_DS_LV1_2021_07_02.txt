You know that moment when a friend trusts you enough to ask for advice on something permanent? My buddy recently wanted a nose piercingâ€”not just any, but the delicate golden horseshoe style. It was 2021, and with tattoo shops everywhere, I insisted we find an APP certified piercer in St. Catharines. It reminded me how social bonds grow when we guide each other toward safe, artistic choices. Because real friendship means caring about the details that matter.
