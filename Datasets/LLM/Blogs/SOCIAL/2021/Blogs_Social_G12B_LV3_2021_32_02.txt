## The Weight of "But What About Me?" (And Learning to Fly Anyway)

Okay, real talk. I turned 24 this year, and it feels like a *lot* has changed. I finally did it – I packed up my life and moved across the country. It was a huge, scary, exhilarating step towards figuring out who I want to be, independent of everything I’ve always known. 

But here's the thing: it hasn't been all sunshine and new city exploration. There’s this persistent ache of guilt, a constant hum of "but what about me?" from my mom. It's the subtle digs, the dramatic sighs, the way she makes me feel like I’m abandoning her. 

It's tough, you know? Adulting is hard enough without navigating complicated family emotions. I'm trying to set boundaries, to explain that this isn’t about *her*, it's about *me* finally spreading my wings. But it’s a process. A messy, tearful, and occasionally frustrating process.

Anyone else ever feel like flying while simultaneously being tethered by guilt? Let's commiserate (and share survival tips!) in the comments. It’s 2021 – we deserve to chase our dreams, even if it's a little complicated.
