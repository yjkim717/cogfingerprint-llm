## The Electric Car Conundrum: Comfort and the Used Car Hunt

Okay, so I’m officially in the market for an electric vehicle. Exciting, right? But the used car world is… a journey. I’m seriously torn between a Nissan Leaf and a Chevy Bolt. Both are great options, but I’m finding myself obsessing over something surprisingly specific: the seats in the Bolt.

I test drove one last week, and while the tech was solid, the seats just didn't feel *right*. As someone who spends a lot of time on the road, comfort is a big deal. It’s 2021, and we’re all spending even more time at home, so the few trips I *do* make need to be enjoyable. 

It's funny how a seemingly small detail like seat comfort can derail a whole buying decision, isn’t it? Anyone else ever had a similar experience with a CPO car? Let me know!
