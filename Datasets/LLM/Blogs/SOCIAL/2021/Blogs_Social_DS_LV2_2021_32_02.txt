The boxes are taped shut, my car is half-packed, and my phone just buzzed with another text from Mom. It’s 2021, and at 24, I’m finally moving out of state. This should feel like freedom, the start of my own story. Instead, a heavy blanket of guilt settles over me.

Every conversation lately is a minefield of sighs and “I’ll just miss you so much” comments. It’s not anger, but a quiet, persistent emotional pull that makes me question my choice. Am I being selfish for wanting independence? Is my growth coming at the cost of her happiness?

I’m learning that becoming an adult isn’t just about logistics; it’s about untangling your dreams from the weight of family expectations. This move is for me, even if it’s the hardest decision I’ve ever had to own.
