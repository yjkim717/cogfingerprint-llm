## The Weight of Leaving Home (and Mom's Feelings)

It's officially been three months since I packed up my life and drove across state lines. A new job, a new city, a fresh start – everything I’d dreamed of. And yet, a quiet hum of… something… has been following me. It’s not homesickness, not really. It's the echo of my mom’s voice.

She’s been… processing. Let’s put it that way. Lots of calls filled with subtly pointed questions about whether I miss her cooking, if I'm *really* happy, and the occasional, "I just worry about you, you know? Your father and I don't have you close anymore." 

It’s exhausting. I get it, she’s sad. Letting go is hard. But it feels like her sadness is somehow becoming *my* responsibility. Like I need to soothe her, reassure her, and essentially apologize for pursuing my own happiness.

Honestly, it's been a crash course in understanding family dynamics and the tricky dance of adulthood. It's 2021, and I’m 24. I’m allowed to build a life that doesn't perfectly align with anyone else’s expectations, right? Still figuring that out, one slightly guilt-ridden phone call at a time. Anyone else been here?
