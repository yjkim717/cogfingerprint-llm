It’s 2021, and I’m officially in my “bare minimum” era. Lately, my attendance is optional, and online assignments feel like distant chores. I’m not depressed—just tired, you know? The burnout is real, and academic laziness has become my survival mode. I keep telling myself it’s a phase, but skipping classes feels like reclaiming a little control. Anyone else just going through the motions, trying to keep their head above water? Sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is admit you’re running on fumes and give yourself grace.
