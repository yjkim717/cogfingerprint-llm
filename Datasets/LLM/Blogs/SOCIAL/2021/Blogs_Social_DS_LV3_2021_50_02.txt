It’s 2021, and we’re all craving connection after so much time apart. I remember finally gathering with friends for a movie night, debating whether to commit to a three-hour epic. We chose one, and as the credits rolled, I realized it wasn’t just about the film—it was about sharing that uninterrupted time together. In a world of endless scrolling, these long, immersive stories brought us back to each other, reminding us that some of the best moments are the ones we experience fully, side by side.
