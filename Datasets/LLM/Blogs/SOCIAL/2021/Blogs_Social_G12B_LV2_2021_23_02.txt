## The Cone of Uncertainty (and Kitten Anxiety!)

Anyone else feel like 2021 has been a constant stream of "should I/shouldn't I" decisions? Lately, I've been wrestling with one in particular: my newly neutered kitten, Leo.

Scrolling through Reddit, I found someone asking the same thing! It’s comforting to know I'm not alone in this micro-worry. It’s a reminder that even small pet parenting choices can spark big debates, and that’s okay. We're all just trying to do what's best, right?
