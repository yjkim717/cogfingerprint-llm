Navigating my fibromyalgia pain in 2021 has been a real journey. My current anti-inflammatories just aren’t cutting it, and I’m worried about long-term side effects like liver damage. It’s tough advocating for yourself, but I’ve scheduled a consultation with my doctor to discuss stronger options. It’s a vulnerable but necessary step toward better pain management and reclaiming my life.
