**The Day a Hot Dog Almost Broke Me (Summer 2021)**

It was one of those brutally hot afternoons in the summer of '21. To beat the heat, I made what felt like a brilliant decision: a giant, greasy hot dog for lunch. Big mistake.

A few hours later, the familiar dread started. My stomach felt like a tangled knot, and the usual constipation and dehydration from the heat made everything worse. My brain, wired with emetophobia, immediately went into red alert. *This is it,* it screamed, *you’re getting sick.*

The panic attack hit fast—racing heart, tunnel vision, the whole awful script. I was trapped, convinced I was on the verge of a stomach bug, even though logic said it was just the heat and a bad food choice. It’s a lonely, terrifying feeling when your own body feels like the enemy. It’s a reminder that the most ordinary summer day can become a battlefield when you’re fighting an invisible fear.
