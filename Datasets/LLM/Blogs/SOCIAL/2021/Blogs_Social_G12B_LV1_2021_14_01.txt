## When Halloween Spirit Met Reality (and a Funeral)

Okay, so, I’m *that* person. You know, the one who starts thinking about Halloween in, like, July. I live for the spooky season. The makeup, the costumes, the general atmosphere of delightfully creepy fun… it's my happy place. This year, 2021, I was determined to level up my Halloween game. I’d been watching tutorials for months – elaborate face paint, intricate details, the whole nine yards.

I got *really* into temporary tattoos too. Like, really. I ordered a sheet with a bunch of gothic, spiderweb-y designs, thinking they'd be the perfect finishing touch for a particularly dramatic look. And the lipstick? Don't even get me started. I found this *amazing* long-lasting, intensely pigmented shade – a deep, vampy burgundy – that promised to stay put through anything. Perfect for a spooky queen, right?

Except… life had other plans.

Last week, my grandmother passed away. It was sudden, unexpected, and incredibly sad. Of course, the focus immediately shifted to family, arrangements, and grieving. And that's when I realized I’d possibly made a monumental error in judgment.

See, in my Halloween enthusiasm, I’d applied the temporary tattoo *days* before the funeral. Like, really adhered it well, thinking I'd be doing a photoshoot later. And that lipstick? It *did* stay put. Through tissues, hugs, and a lot of quiet tears, that burgundy stain remained stubbornly in place.

I looked… well, I looked like I was attending a funeral while simultaneously preparing for a gothic rave. It was mortifying. My cousin kept trying to subtly wipe my face, bless her heart.

It was a good reminder that sometimes, our passions and our carefully curated online personas need to take a backseat. Grief doesn’t care about spooky aesthetics or perfectly blended eyeshadow. It’s about being present, being supportive, and showing up as your authentic self – even if that self is slightly lipstick-stained and adorned with unexpected spiderwebs.  I definitely learned a lesson about timing and priorities.  Halloween will wait. Family never does.
