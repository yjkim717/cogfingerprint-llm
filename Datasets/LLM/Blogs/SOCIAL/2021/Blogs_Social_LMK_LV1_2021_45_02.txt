"I was thrilled to update my Apple Watch to 7.2 in 2021, but my excitement was short-lived. My battery life plummeted! After some digging, I discovered that the handwashing detection feature, which uses the gyroscope, was the culprit. I disabled it and voil√†! My battery life is back to normal. I'm now more mindful of the trade-offs between features and battery life. Has anyone else experienced this?"
