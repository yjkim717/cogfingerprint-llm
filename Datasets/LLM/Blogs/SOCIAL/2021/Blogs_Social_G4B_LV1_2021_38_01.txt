**Dim the Lights, Look Closer**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we scroll past the details? 2021 felt like a year of frantic, bright screens – endless notifications, curated outrage. I’ve been trying to push back against that, lately. It started with a random YouTube rabbit hole: Bo Burnham’s *Inside*. 

Specifically, the way he used lighting. It wasn't just about shadows; it felt like a deliberate, almost claustrophobic layering of color, pulling you *inside* the performance. It made me think about my own little obsession with grow lamps – trying to create a tiny, controlled ecosystem.  Maybe it’s a silly parallel, but both are about finding a contained space, a way to observe something closely, and ultimately, a quiet reflection.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a particular aspect or adjusting the length?
