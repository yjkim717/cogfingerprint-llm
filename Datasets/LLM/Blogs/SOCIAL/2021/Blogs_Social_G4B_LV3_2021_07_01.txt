**Drowning in Connections: Why Social Feels Overwhelming in 2021**

Remember 2021? Scrolling felt… intense. It wasn’t just *seeing* everyone’s highlight reel; it was the sheer volume of it all. I found myself paralyzed, wanting to *learn* more about everything – social justice, sustainable living, even just cool new recipes – but utterly overwhelmed by where to even begin. 

It felt like research, didn't it? Trying to figure out which voices to trust, which movements to support. Honestly, I just wanted to *start* somewhere, but the constant stream of information was a massive motivation killer.  It’s a feeling I think a lot of us experienced – a need to connect, coupled with a desperate need for a little breathing room.
