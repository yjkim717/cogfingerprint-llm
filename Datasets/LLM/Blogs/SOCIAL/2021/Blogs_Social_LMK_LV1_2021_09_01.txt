As I pondered my next ride in 2021, I found myself torn between a used Nissan Leaf and a Bolt EV. Both electric vehicles caught my attention, but I had to consider a few key factors. Depreciation was a major concern - would I be able to sell it down the line without losing too much value? I also thought about the daily commute and how comfortable I'd be in either car. The Bolt's seats seemed more supportive, but the Leaf had a more spacious interior. Ultimately, I wanted a certified pre-owned vehicle to ensure peace of mind.
