Okay, here’s a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 106 words:

**The Price of “Smart”**

Remember when “smart” meant actually *thinking*? Lately, it feels like we’re chasing convenience, layering tech onto everything. I was reading about this Reddit thread – someone found that Apple Watch’s handwashing detection was a battery-sucking monster! It just… highlighted something. 

We’re so eager to be “connected,” we’re sacrificing things we didn’t even realize we valued.  Like, is a notification *really* worth a noticeably shorter battery life?  It makes you think, doesn't it?  Maybe a little disconnection is a good thing.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a post focusing on a different aspect of the original summary?
