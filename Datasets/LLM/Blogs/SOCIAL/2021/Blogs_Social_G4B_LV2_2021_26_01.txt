**Little Nips, Big Love**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 felt like a year of constant connection, right? Scrolling through Instagram, seeing everyone’s “perfect” lives… it could get a little overwhelming. But then, my own little chaos ball, Pip, started exhibiting a very relatable habit. He’s a teething puppy, and apparently, “cute dog behavior” also includes enthusiastic, little nips! 

It’s a funny reminder that behind the filters and carefully posed photos, real life is messy and full of adorable, slightly frustrating moments. I’m focusing on positive reinforcement – lots of praise and redirection – and honestly, it’s a lovely grounding force. What tiny, unexpected joys have you found lately? #puppylove #reallife #socialmediabalance

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post focused on a different aspect of social media in 2021?
