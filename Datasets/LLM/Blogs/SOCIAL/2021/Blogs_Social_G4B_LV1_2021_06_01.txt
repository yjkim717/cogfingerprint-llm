**The Night I Dreamed of a Very Determined Roo**

Okay, so 2021 was… a lot, right? Between the pandemic fallout and everything feeling a little unstable, I’ve been having some seriously weird dreams lately. And last night’s was *particularly* memorable. 

I was in this vast, empty space, and there it was – a kangaroo. Not a cute, cuddly one, mind you. This thing was radiating pure, unadulterated annoyance. It was stalking me, bouncing with this unsettling intensity. Suddenly, I realized I was desperately trying to build a ridiculously elaborate security system to keep it contained. 

Think laser grids, motion sensors, reinforced fences – the whole nine yards. It felt so frantic, so driven by this need to *protect* myself.  

It struck me as a really strange metaphor, I think.  Like, we’re all building these walls and systems – social media, carefully curated online personas, even just rigid routines – to feel safe and secure. But sometimes, that need for containment can be just as exhausting and, honestly, a little lonely. 

Maybe the dream was telling me to loosen up the fences a bit?  Just a thought.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a particular aspect or adjusting the length?
