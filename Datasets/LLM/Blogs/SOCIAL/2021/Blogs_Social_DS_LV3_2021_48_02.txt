The other day, I found myself scrolling through yet another real estate listing—a sleek, modern condo with gleaming countertops and a view of… well, another building. It was beautiful, but the price tag made my heart sink. It’s 2021, and here I am, like so many others, caught in this endless loop of searching for a place to call home in the city without breaking the bank.

I remember chatting with a friend over coffee last week. She just moved to a suburb an hour outside the city. "It’s affordable," she said, "but my *commute*…" She didn’t need to finish the sentence. The exhaustion in her eyes said it all. Two hours of her day, gone, just so she could afford a roof over her head. Meanwhile, I walk past half-empty luxury condos downtown, their prices soaring while the rest of us are pushed further to the edges.

There’s a strange irony in all of this. We’re told that *urban* living is where life happens—the culture, the connections, the opportunities. Yet, the very *housing* meant to support that life feels like it’s designed for someone else. Developers keep building up, but not for us. It’s as if the city is slowly pricing out its own heartbeat.

It’s more than just a numbers game; it’s a social disconnect. We’re craving communities where we can thrive, not just survive. But when *affordability* feels like a distant dream, it chips away at that sense of belonging. In a year already filled with so much uncertainty, the search for home has become one of the most personal and frustrating challenges. And I can’t help but wonder: when did the dream of city living become so out of reach?
