It’s 2021, and I’m a first-time kitten owner, scrolling through pet forums at 2 a.m. My new 8-week-old fluffball eats and drinks like a champ, but hasn’t pooped since she got here. My nerves are shot. I tried a gentle stomach massage—something I saw online—and waited. Nothing. Then, just as I was drafting a panicked post in a cat-lover group, a tiny rustle from the litter box. Relief washed over me. Sometimes, the internet’s advice works, but patience is the real hero.
