## Finding Sunshine in a Stack: My Oat & Banana Pancake Ritual

2021, right? It's been… a lot. Some days, just getting out of bed felt like a victory. I found myself craving simple things, small pockets of joy to break through the noise. That’s when I stumbled upon this ridiculously easy oat and banana pancake recipe. Seriously, it’s just mashed banana and oats!

It's become more than just breakfast now. The quiet rhythm of mashing the banana, the gentle sizzle in the pan… it’s a little ritual, a moment of calm. And honestly, a warm, fluffy stack topped with berries feels like a tiny, delicious win. It’s a reminder that even when things feel overwhelming, a little self-care – and a good pancake – can make a difference. What’s *your* little sunshine moment?
