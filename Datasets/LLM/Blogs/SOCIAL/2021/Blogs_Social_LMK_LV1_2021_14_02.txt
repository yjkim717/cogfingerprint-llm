The joys of working from home - or rather, the joys of not working from home. As I settled back into my office routine in 2021, I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt every time I left my cat behind. You see, during the pandemic, my work-from-home schedule had allowed for plenty of quality time with my feline friend, including long walks on the leash (yes, you read that right!). But as I returned to the office, I noticed a drastic change in my cat's behavior. As soon as I walked out the door, the howling began. It was heartbreaking to leave her in such distress. I realized that the reduced attention and exercise had triggered her separation anxiety. To ease her crying, I started leaving the TV on, and even tried distracting her with puzzle toys filled with treats. It's been a journey, but I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us.
