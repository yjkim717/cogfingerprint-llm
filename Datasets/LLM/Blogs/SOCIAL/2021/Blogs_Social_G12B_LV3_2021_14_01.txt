## The Face Paint, the Tattoo, and the Things We Miss

October always hits me like a wave. Not just the crisp air and pumpkin spice everything (though, let's be honest, I *am* a sucker for pumpkin spice), but this intense feeling of…performance. It’s the pressure to *do* Halloween right. To craft the most impressive, most Instagrammable costume. 

This year, I went full throttle. We’re talking hours of intricately layered face paint, a dramatic smoky eye, and a whole backstory about being a spectral Victorian botanist. I was *so* proud. The photos were getting likes, the comments were rolling in – the whole social media validation loop was firing on all cylinders. I felt…seen.

Then, the little things started to unravel.

First, the temporary tattoo I’d enthusiastically slapped on as a final flourish refused to budge. Seriously, who makes a temporary tattoo that lasts *this* long? It was supposed to be a delicate vine, but after three days, it looked more like a stubborn, leafy rash. I spent a solid hour scrubbing at it, feeling increasingly ridiculous.

And then, the call came. My aunt, the one I hadn't seen in years, the one who always smelled like lavender and cinnamon, had passed away. There was a funeral, a week away, and I’d completely, utterly forgotten about it. Lost in the whirlwind of Halloween preparations, of chasing that fleeting online buzz, I'd missed a vital connection.

It was a stark reminder. How easily we get caught up in the performative aspects of life, especially online. We curate these perfect, vibrant versions of ourselves, chasing likes and comments, while the quieter, more meaningful things slip through the cracks. 

The tattoo finally faded, thankfully. But the feeling of missing out, of prioritizing the superficial over the real, that’s lingered. Maybe this Halloween, and moving forward, I'll focus less on the elaborate exterior and more on the connections that truly matter. Less face paint, more presence. Less chasing likes, more showing up.
