As I pondered my next ride in 2021, I found myself torn between two eco-friendly options: the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt EV. Both were calling my name, but I had to weigh the pros and cons. I considered factors like price, depreciation, and comfort. Buying used was a smart move, but which one would be the best fit? As I dug deeper, I realized that this decision wasn't just about the car - it was about joining a community that values sustainability. Which EV would I choose, and what would it say about me?
