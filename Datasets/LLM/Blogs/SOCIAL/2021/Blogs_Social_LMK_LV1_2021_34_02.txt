"I'm still shaken thinking about that day in March 2021 when my world went dark - literally. After a nasty car accident, I lost consciousness, and my heart sank. As a 19-year-old, I was terrified about the potential long-term effects of a head injury. The diagnosis? A concussion. My neurology doctor reassured me that with rest and care, I'd be okay. But it got me thinking - how many of us take our brains for granted until something like this happens? It's a wake-up call to prioritize our mental health and be more mindful of the risks we take every day on the road."
