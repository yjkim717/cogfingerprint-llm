## The Hunt for the Perfect Fennec

Okay, so I'm diving back into Rocket League after a *long* hiatus. Immediately, I'm craving a Fennec. But here's the thing â€“ there are seemingly a million paint versions! Anyone out there know if there's a noticeable difference between, say, the 2018 and 2019 versions visually? Just trying to avoid spending credits on something identical to what I had before! Help a returning player out!
