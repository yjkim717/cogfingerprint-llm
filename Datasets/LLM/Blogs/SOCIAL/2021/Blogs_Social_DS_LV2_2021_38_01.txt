It’s funny how a single blue glow can mean so many things. Watching Bo Burnham’s *Inside* in 2021, I was struck by that cool, sterile lighting—so many of us saw our phone screens reflected in it, a constant companion in our isolated year. But then I thought about grow lamps.

What if, in that lonely room, Bo wasn’t just bathed in the light of a screen, but under the very thing that helps something flourish in the dark? Maybe we were, too. All those months inside, we were quietly, stubbornly, putting down roots. We weren't just scrolling; we were growing in ways we couldn't yet see. Sometimes, the light that feels the most artificial is the one helping you become more real.
