"Driving through the Coastal Bend, I've often found myself pondering the accuracy of the city limit signs that dot our highways. As I pass through towns like Corpus Christi, I'm greeted by signs proclaiming the population figures that supposedly represent the number of residents within the city limits. But, as I recently discovered, these numbers are woefully outdated.

Take, for instance, the city limit sign on Highway 358 as you enter Corpus Christi from the west. It proudly proclaims that the city is home to just over 277,000 people. But, according to the 2020 census data, the actual population is closer to 285,000. That's an 8,000-person discrepancy! It's not just Corpus Christi, either - I've noticed similar outdated signs in other Coastal Bend towns.

The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is responsible for maintaining these signs, but it seems they're not prioritizing updates. I've reached out to TxDOT to ask about their process for updating these signs, and they told me that they're typically updated after a new census is released. But, here we are, in 2021, and we're still seeing numbers from the 2000 or 2010 census.

It's not just a matter of vanity; accurate population numbers have real-world implications. They inform decisions about infrastructure, funding, and resource allocation. So, what's the holdup? It's time for TxDOT to get with the times and update these signs to reflect the real numbers. Until then, I'll just have to keep wondering what other outdated information is lurking out there."
