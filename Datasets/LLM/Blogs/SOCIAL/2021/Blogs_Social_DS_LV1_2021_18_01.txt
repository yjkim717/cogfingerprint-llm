It’s 2021, and I’m the new dishwasher at a bustling restaurant. My Hispanic coworkers keep calling me “batitas”—I thought it was an insult. Turns out, it’s a friendly term for “little slippers,” meaning I’m always hustling. Just a small word, but it taught me how cultural slang can build bridges instead of walls.
