It’s wild to think that in 2021, my little TikTok corner dedicated to Naruto’s most obscure characters actually took off. I started it on a whim, tired of seeing the same Sasuke and Naruto edits everywhere. What began as me rambling about side characters like Shino or Tenten turned into this amazing community effort. People in the comments started suggesting even deeper cuts—anyone remember the Crystal Style user from the Land of Rivers? I sure didn’t, until a follower asked!

It’s been a reminder that on social media, you don’t need a massive following to find your people. You just need a shared, nerdy passion and the willingness to dive into the details together.
