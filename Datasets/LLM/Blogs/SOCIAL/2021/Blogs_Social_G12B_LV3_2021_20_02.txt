## The Art of Just... Getting By (and the Guilt That Comes With It)

Okay, I need to confess something. College in 2021, especially with online learning being the norm, has led me down a weird path. I’ve been… minimizing effort. Intentionally. And shockingly, it's working. I’m passing. I'm getting decent grades. But the guilt? That's a whole other story.

It started with feeling completely burnt out. Staring at a screen for hours just wasn't clicking. So, I started streamlining. Focusing on the bare minimum. It's a strange feeling, knowing you're not pushing yourself, not truly *learning*, yet still managing to scrape by. Is this laziness? Procrastination taken to a new level? Maybe. Or maybe it's a coping mechanism in a year that's asked a lot of us. Anyone else feeling this weird disconnect?
