## Those Little Signs and the Stories They Miss

It’s a silly thing, really, but it’s been bugging me for a while. Driving around the Coastal Bend lately, I keep noticing those city limit signs – you know, the ones proudly proclaiming the population of Corpus Christi, Rockport, Aransas Pass. And… they’re just *off*. Seriously off.

I started thinking about it last week on the way to Mustang Island. The sign for Gregory, population 11,000, felt… optimistic. I remember visiting there as a kid and it felt a lot smaller than that. It got me wondering, how often *do* they update these things? And what does it even mean when they don't?

I know TXDOT is probably swamped, and the Census data takes time to process, but it’s a small detail that speaks to a bigger issue. We’re constantly chasing the present, striving for accuracy in our data, yet these little relics of the past linger, whispering outdated stories. It’s a visual reminder that even the things we consider permanent – like a number on a sign – can quickly become obsolete.

It feels like a metaphor for so much, doesn't it? Holding onto old beliefs, outdated assumptions… maybe we all need to take a look around and check our own "city limit signs" every now and then. See if the numbers still reflect the reality we're living in.
