Of course, here is a reflective blog post from 2021:

Remember that weirdly specific hobby I dove into last year? Trying to 3D print custom cases for my old Game Boy games. It was a mess of digital calipers and late-night Blender tutorials.

But in 2021, I finally get it. It wasn't really about the plastic. It was about control. Stuck inside, I was digitally rebuilding my childhood, piece by piece, exactly how I wanted it. That tiny, tangible project was my anchor. It was my way of saying that even when the world feels chaotic, I can still create my own little, organized corner of it. Funny how a custom GBA case can feel so much like self-care.
