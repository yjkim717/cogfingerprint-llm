The gentle rustle of those century-old oak leaves used to be the soundtrack to my evenings. It was a soft, whispering conversation between the neighborhood and itself, a lullaby that had soothed generations. I’d sit on my porch in 2021, watching the dappled sunlight fade, thinking this little pocket of the world was immune to the frantic pace of everything else. We knew each other here. We knew the trees.

Then the old church sold. The new owner was a man with a vision, he said. First, the hymns were replaced by a pounding bass line that vibrated through our floorboards on Saturday nights. The stained-glass windows now glowed with neon. We adjusted, with grumbles and earplugs, telling ourselves that a nightclub was at least a living thing, a different kind of community, even if it wasn't ours.

But this new plan? This is a different kind of heartbreak.

He wants to cut the oaks down. For a parking lot.

I stood there yesterday, my hand on the rough, gnarled bark of the oldest one. I tried to picture this space as flat, gray, and empty, smelling of asphalt and car exhaust instead of damp earth and life. It felt like a betrayal. These trees witnessed our children learn to ride bikes, provided shade for summer lemonade stands, and stood as silent, steady guardians through every season.

Now, the constant noise from the club feels like a taunt. It’s the sound of progress that only values profit, that sees a living legacy as an inconvenience. I feel a profound helplessness. How do you argue with a spreadsheet that shows more parking spaces equate to more revenue? How do you quantify the value of a century of shade, of roots that run as deep as our history here?

The chainsaws are scheduled for next week. And it feels like they’re not just cutting down trees; they’re cutting out the soul of this place, and I don’t know if we can ever get it back.
