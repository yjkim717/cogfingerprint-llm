It’s 2021, and my bullet journal is staring back at me, blank and intimidating. I started it hoping to organize my life—tasks, mood trackers, maybe even build some better habits. But where do I even begin? I’m realizing it’s not just about neat layouts; it’s about showing up, imperfectly. So here’s to messy first entries and forgiving myself for the skipped days. Maybe the real habit I’m forming is simply being present with my own thoughts, one page at a time.
