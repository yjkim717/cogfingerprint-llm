**Scrolling & Soul Food**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 felt like a *lot* of scrolling. Between the pandemic, everything feeling perpetually uncertain, and just…life, I found myself lost in a highlight reel of everyone else’s “perfect” lives. It was exhausting. 

I started noticing a weird disconnect. I’d be mindlessly scrolling through Instagram, seeing picture-perfect oat pancakes (seriously, who has time for that level of breakfast prep?), and feeling a pang of something I couldn’t quite name. It wasn't envy, exactly, but a quiet sadness.

Then, I remembered this super simple banana pancake recipe – the kind you can throw together when you’re short on time and feeling a bit blah. It’s about taking the time to nourish yourself, really.  Like prepping those pancakes for a busy week, finding small moments of ease. 

It made me realize I needed to curate my own feed, not just consume everyone else’s.  Maybe we all need a little more oat pancake energy for our souls.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps focus on a different angle?
