### The Face I Almost Wore to a Funeral

It was the day after Halloween, 2021, and I was staring at my reflection in a panic. A faint, ghostly cobweb was still etched on my cheek, and my lips were stained a stubborn, gothic black. The remnants of my "Vampire Queen" persona were refusing to leave. And in a few hours, I had to be at my great-aunt’s funeral.

The irony wasn’t lost on me. The night before, I had been laughing with friends over Zoom, our little pandemic-era Halloween party. I’d meticulously applied those temporary tattoos, proud of my spooky masterpiece. Now, in the harsh morning light, it felt like a costume I couldn’t take off. I scrubbed until my skin was raw, a frantic ritual that felt completely at odds with the somber, respectful day ahead.

Sitting in the car later, my face finally clean but feeling tender and exposed, I had a weird moment of clarity. I opened a speech-to-text app on my phone and just started talking, trying to capture the feeling.

*"Note to self,"* I dictated, my voice still a little shaky. *"The line between who we are for fun and who we need to be for real life is sometimes just a layer of cheap makeup. And sometimes, it’s a lot harder to remove."*

The past two years had been a masterclass in shifting identities—from professional on a video call to homeschool teacher to isolated individual, and back again. We’ve all been wearing different "faces," adapting to survive a strange world. My Halloween makeup was just a more literal, and stubborn, version of that.

At the funeral, listening to stories about my aunt’s life—her consistency, her kindness, her unwavering self—I realized something. The goal isn't to scrub away all the different parts of ourselves. It’s to integrate them. The person who loves silly Halloween makeup can also be the person who offers a steady shoulder to cry on. Our strength isn't in having one perfect face for every occasion, but in having a real, multifaceted heart beneath it all. Even if it’s temporarily stained black.
