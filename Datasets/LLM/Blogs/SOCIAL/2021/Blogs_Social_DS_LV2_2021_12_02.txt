It’s 2021, and I’m a first-time kitten owner, nervously watching my new 8-week-old furball. She’s eating, drinking, playing—but no poop in the litter box. My anxiety skyrockets; did I mess up already? I try a gentle stomach massage, hoping for the best. It hits me: this tiny creature’s well-being is now my world. The relief when she finally goes is indescribable. It’s a raw reminder that love often looks a lot like worry, and sometimes, the smallest moments bond us the most.
