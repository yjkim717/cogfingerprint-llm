The Unspoken Struggle: Finding Courage in Vulnerability. 

As I navigated my demanding job in 2021, I couldn't shake off the weight of my secret: a lingering eating disorder that had taken a toll on my mental health. The fear of being judged or seen as weak held me back from opening up to my employer about my struggles. I worried that requesting time off for treatment would disappoint my team and burden my family. But as I struggled to maintain a fragile work-life balance, I realized that hiding my truth was taking a greater toll. It wasn't until I found the courage to be vulnerable that I began to heal. By sharing my story, I'm hoping to inspire others to do the same, breaking the silence around mental health and eating disorders. It's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help.
