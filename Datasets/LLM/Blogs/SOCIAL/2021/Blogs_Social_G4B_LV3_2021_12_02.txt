**The Quietest Days**

Remember 2021? Everything felt like a rush, right? Scrolling, liking, posting – the social feed was a constant hum. But lately, I’ve noticed something different. My niece just got a kitten, a tiny ball of fluff, and her new owner is completely stressed because it hasn’t pooped after a day! 

It's funny, isn't it? We’re so used to instant validation, to seeing everyone’s highlight reel. But sometimes, the quietest days – the ones without a flurry of likes – are the most important. It’s a gentle reminder that connection isn’t always about broadcasting; sometimes it’s about simply *being* present.
