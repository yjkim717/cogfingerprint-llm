The breaking point came last Tuesday, sitting in my car, unable to turn the key. For years, I’d carried my family’s trauma like a familiar, heavy coat. But in 2021, the isolation made it suffocating. I finally called a counselor. It wasn’t a magic cure, but it was a start—a quiet rebellion against the sadness telling me to retreat. Healing isn’t a straight line, but a series of small, brave choices to move forward, even when every part of you wants to go back.
