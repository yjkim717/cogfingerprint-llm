## The Silence That Sank My Semester

Okay, let's be real. College. It’s supposed to be this incredible journey of self-discovery, intellectual growth, and, you know, *graduating*. But sometimes, it feels less like a triumphant climb and more like navigating a maze blindfolded. And sometimes, the biggest obstacles aren’t pop quizzes or impossible readings – they’re the quiet, unexpected ones.

I’m still processing it, honestly. It was the end of Fall 2021, and I was staring at a screen displaying an "Incomplete" for my Intro to Sociology class. An Incomplete. Not a failing grade, not quite. But a giant, blinking question mark hanging over my entire semester.

It sounds dramatic, I know. But the story behind it is… well, it’s a story about the power of feedback, and the crushing weight of silence.

I genuinely *liked* that class. The material was fascinating – exploring social structures, inequality, the way we all interact and influence each other. I was engaged, I participated in discussions, and I thought I was doing pretty well. My quizzes were solid, my initial essays were decent. I felt like I was getting it.

But then… nothing.

No comments on my essays. No feedback on my participation. Just… silence. Weeks went by. I’d check Canvas obsessively, hoping for a little nudge, a little encouragement, *anything* to tell me I was on the right track. Crickets.

I tried emailing the professor. A polite, “Just checking in on my progress and wondering if there’s anything I can do to improve.”  A canned response about office hours I couldn’t make due to my work schedule. Another email. Another generic reply.

It wasn’t about wanting praise, you know? It was about wanting to *know*. To know if I was understanding the concepts correctly. To know if I was approaching the assignments in the way he intended. To know if I was even *seen*.

The frustration built. It wasn’t just about the class anymore. It was about feeling invisible. Like my efforts were falling into a void. I started second-guessing everything. Was I even trying hard enough? Was I just not “getting” it? The self-doubt crept in, insidious and relentless.

And then came the final project – a research paper. I poured hours into it, researching, writing, revising. I was determined to finish strong. But without any guidance, without any indication of what he was looking for, I felt like I was shooting in the dark.

The result? A paper I wasn’t proud of. A paper that, ultimately, wasn’t good enough. And the Incomplete.

Looking back, I realize it wasn’t just about the grade. It was about the lack of connection. The absence of that vital human element in education. We talk a lot about accessibility in online learning, about
