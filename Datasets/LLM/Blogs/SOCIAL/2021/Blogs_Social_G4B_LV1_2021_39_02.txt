**Rosie’s Bark: A Lesson in Dog Park Socialization**

Okay, so 2021 was a *year* for learning, wasn’t it? And for me, it was a big one when it came to understanding my English Mastiff, Rosie. We’d been going to the local dog park a few times a week, and I was so excited for her to socialize. But then, things started to get a little… complicated. 

Rosie would totally chill with one dog, like they were best buds. But the *second* another dog approached, she’d erupt into this incredibly loud, aggressive bark. It was heartbreaking to watch. 

It really made me think about socialization – it's not just about letting your dog *be* around other dogs, it’s about managing their reactions. We started taking things slower, focusing on positive reinforcement, and honestly, it’s slowly helping. It’s a reminder that every dog is different, and patience is key!

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect (e.g., a particular training technique)?
