**The Glare in the Mirror**

Anyone else feel like 2021 was… a lot? Between the pandemic and everything else, stress levels were through the roof, and I think that manifested in some pretty frustrating ways on the road. I had a genuinely unsettling experience last month – a driver completely ignoring a police officer, weaving through lanes, and just generally being a menace. It wasn’t just the traffic jam it caused, but the sheer disrespect radiating from the driver’s window. 

It really got me thinking about road rage, and how easily it can be a symptom of deeper frustration. We're all carrying so much, and sometimes that pressure boils over into aggressive behavior.  I realized I’d been mirroring a little of that myself – snapping at a cashier, getting irritated with slow drivers. 

Looking back, it felt like I was taking it out on everyone else, a way to momentarily feel in control when my own life felt chaotic. It’s a reminder that acknowledging our own anger, and choosing a more respectful response, can actually make a difference – not just for the other driver, but for ourselves too.  What about you? Have you ever felt that tension building behind the wheel?
