## The Tiny Worry and a Whole Lot of Love

Bringing a new kitten home is pure joy, right? Well, it’s also a little nerve-wracking! My little eight-week-old hasn't done *the deed* yet since yesterday, and I'm officially spiraling. He’s eating, drinking, and purring like a champ, but that first poop felt like a major milestone. Hoping it’s just kitten nerves – a little overwhelmed by the new surroundings, you know? Sending good vibes (and maybe a little extra reassurance) his way!
