**Is Hyoga’s Kudayari Just… Weird?**

Okay, so I’ve been completely obsessed with *Dr. Stone* lately, and this whole “kudayari” thing with Hyoga is *seriously* throwing me for a loop. It’s not just a cool power – it’s this incredibly complex, almost theoretical system.  Like, does it *actually* make sense?  I spent way too long staring at scientific formulas trying to figure it out. 

It’s funny, right? We’re all scrolling through Reddit, arguing about the most minor details, but sometimes the coolest ideas are the ones that don’t quite fit.  Anyone else feeling this? #DrStone #Kudayari #SciFiDebate 2021
