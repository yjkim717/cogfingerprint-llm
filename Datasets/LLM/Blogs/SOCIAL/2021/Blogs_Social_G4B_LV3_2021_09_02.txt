**The Numbers Don’t Lie (Do They?)**

I was driving through a small town in Texas last fall – 2021, to be exact – and it struck me in a really odd way. I saw a street sign proudly proclaiming the population as being… significantly lower than I’d expect. It felt…wrong. 

It’s a small thing, I know, but it sparked a weird feeling of frustration. We’re so reliant on statistics, on numbers to understand our world, yet they can feel so incredibly *outdated*. Like they’re clinging to a past that no longer reflects the present. 

I started thinking about how often we accept these figures at face value – population counts, economic reports, even demographic trends. But are they really telling us the whole story?  It’s easy to get caught up in the data, but sometimes, a simple observation, a feeling in a place, reminds you that reality is often far more complex and vibrant than any spreadsheet can capture.  Has anyone else noticed this disconnect?
