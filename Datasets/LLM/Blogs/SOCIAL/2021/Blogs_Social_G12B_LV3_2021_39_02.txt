## The Dog Park Dilemma: When Friendly Isn't Enough

Anyone who’s spent time at a dog park knows it’s a mixed bag. A joyful explosion of wagging tails and zoomies, sure, but also… potential for awkwardness. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with that awkwardness myself. My English Mastiff, Winston, is a gentle giant at home – cuddly, playful, and perfectly content sharing my space with our family dog. But the dog park? A different story.

He gets *intense*. Lots of barking, a stiff posture, and a clear message: "Back off!" It’s frustrating because he's not being *aggressive*, per se, just…overly assertive. It's made me really think about socialization. Is it just about exposure? Or is it about understanding individual dog personalities and respecting those boundaries, even in a supposedly “social” environment? It’s a work in progress, that's for sure.
