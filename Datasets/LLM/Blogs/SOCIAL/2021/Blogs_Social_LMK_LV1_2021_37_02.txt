As a huge Star Wars fan, I've often found myself daydreaming about a live-action Darth Bane trilogy. The character's complexity and intriguing backstory make him a fascinating subject for a film. If I'm being completely honest, I've already cast the entire movie in my head. For the role of Darth Bane, I think Michael Fassbender would be perfect - he has the intensity and brooding presence to bring the character to life. I'd cast Emma Stone as Zannah, Bane's apprentice, as she has proven her acting chops in a variety of roles. The trilogy would be a dark and gripping exploration of the Star Wars universe, delving into the ancient history of the Sith. With the right cast and direction, I believe a Darth Bane trilogy could be a game-changer for the franchise. What do you think - would you watch it?
