**The Weight of a Finished Chapter**

Okay, real talk. 2021 felt… heavy.  I’d been a *massive* Berserk fan since high school – Kentaro Miura's world of Guts and Griffith was just *everything*. Then, the news hit.  It felt like the rug had been pulled out from under a whole universe. 

I tried to re-watch the series, but it was… impossible.  Not because the animation was bad (it wasn't!), but because I felt this crushing guilt. Like I was intruding on a story unfinished, a conversation abruptly cut short. Scrolling through Reddit threads about theories and fan art felt almost disrespectful. 

It’s weird, right?  Loving something so intensely and then being paralyzed by the knowledge of its creator’s absence. It forced me to confront how much we invest in art and the strange, lingering sadness that can come with a completed chapter.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps explore a slightly different angle?
