**The Day I Became a Martyr for Gluten-Free**

Okay, let me tell you about a truly bizarre Tuesday back in 2021. I was working at the university dining hall, and we had a pretty strict protocol for gluten-free orders. It seemed simple enough – flag the bread, wait for a designated server, and then… well, then the wait would just *start*. 

It wasn’t malicious, not really. Just… incredibly inefficient. People were getting genuinely frustrated, especially those with celiac disease, who needed their food quickly. And the weirdest part? We were following the protocol *exactly*. Every single step. 

I started to feel this prickly sensation of irony. We were prioritizing procedure over people. It was like we were performing ‘malicious compliance’ – going through the motions, but completely missing the point.  I remember watching a student, visibly stressed, tapping his foot, and thinking, “This isn’t about the bread; it’s about feeling seen and cared for.” 

It made me realize how easily we can get trapped in systems, convinced that following rules *is* the right thing to do, even when it’s creating unnecessary problems.  It was a tiny, frustrating moment, but it highlighted a larger truth: sometimes, the most human thing to do is to look beyond the protocol and actually *help* someone.  What little absurdities have you encountered like this lately?
