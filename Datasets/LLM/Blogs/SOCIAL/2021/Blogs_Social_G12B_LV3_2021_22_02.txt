's response:## The Weight of What We Leave Behind

It’s 2021, and “sustainability” is everywhere. We’re talking about reusable straws, electric cars, and ethical fashion. But sometimes, I think we’re missing a bigger picture. A really *big* picture. 

Lately, I’ve been wrestling with the idea of nuclear energy. It’s touted as a clean alternative to fossil fuels, and in many ways, it is. But what about the waste? Those spent fuel rods… they’re incredibly radioactive and need to be stored safely for *thousands* of years.

We’re essentially creating a problem for future generations. Our kids, our grandkids, *their* grandkids – they'll be the ones dealing with the long-term storage and potential risks. Is that truly responsible? 

It's not about being anti-nuclear; it's about asking ourselves if we're truly being sustainable if we're just pushing a monumental environmental burden down the line. Shouldn't "sustainable" mean considering the impact on *all* generations, not just ours? It’s a heavy thought, and one I think deserves more of our attention. What do you think?
