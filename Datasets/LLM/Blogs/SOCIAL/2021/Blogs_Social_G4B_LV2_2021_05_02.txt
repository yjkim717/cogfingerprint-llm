**The Weight of a Single Reload**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve been feeling… overloaded. It's weird, right? Like, not in a crisis kind of way, but a constant, low-level hum of pressure. It started with *The Last of Us* – specifically, a ridiculously brutal section in *The Forest*. 

I was stuck, completely surrounded by infected waves, and every single action felt like a calculated risk. Resource management was insane; I was constantly scavenging for bandages, ammo, and anything to slow those relentless hordes. And reloading? Forget about it. It was a frustrating, repetitive loop. 

It made me think about how much of our online lives feel like that now. Scrolling through perfectly curated feeds, comparing our highlight reels to everyone else's, feeling the need to *do* something, *be* something, *look* a certain way. 

Sometimes, I just want to hit the reset button – like pausing the game and taking a deep breath.  It’s okay to not be constantly optimizing, to acknowledge the difficulty, and to just… exist.  Anyone else feeling this lately?
