Honestly, 2021 was the year of the bare minimum for me. With classes still mostly online, it was just too easy to skip the Zoom lectures and scrape by on auto-pilot. I’d rush through assignments at the last minute, my motivation completely gone. The weird part? I was still passing. It makes you wonder—are we really learning, or just becoming experts at gaming a tired system? Sometimes I think the most valuable lesson was realizing how disconnected I’d become.
