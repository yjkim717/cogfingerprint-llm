**The Red Light and the Reckless Rush**

Okay, so 2021 was… a year. Lots of changes, lots of anxiety, and honestly, a surprising amount of road rage simmering beneath the surface. Last week, something happened that really stuck with me. I was waiting at a red light – a solid stop light, mind you – when I saw a car practically *launch* into the passing lane. 

And then, a cop was right there, waving his lights. The car just… ignored him. It was a terrifyingly fast pass, a blatant disregard for the rules and, frankly, for human life. It made me think about how easily we all get caught up in our own urgency, how we sometimes forget that the road isn’t just *ours*.  It’s a shared space, and a little respect goes a long way.  Anyone else have a similar experience lately?

Would you like me to tweak this in any way – perhaps adjust the tone, add a specific detail, or focus on a different aspect of the story?
