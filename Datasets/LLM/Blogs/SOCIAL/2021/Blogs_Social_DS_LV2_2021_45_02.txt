Remember that frantic week in 2021 when our Apple Watches suddenly died by lunch? Turns out, WatchOS 7.2 was so eager to praise our 20-second scrubs, it drained batteries keeping watch. I had to disable the handwashing detection, a strangely symbolic act. In our hyper-hygienic world, I was choosing connection over constant sanitization. My watchâ€™s longer life now reminds me to sometimes just live, not just cleanse. A small, personal rebellion against the times.
