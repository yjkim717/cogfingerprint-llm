**The Ghost of a Halloween Promise**

It’s funny how the internet can warp time, isn’t it? I was completely lost in the vortex of 2021 Halloween makeup – elaborate, ambitious, the whole nine yards. I’d committed *hard*, spending weeks perfecting a decaying Victorian bride look, layering on latex and painstakingly sculpting shadows. I was chasing this intense, dramatic aesthetic, convinced it was the peak of creative expression.

Then, a call. A frantic, choked-up voice. My grandmother… it was sudden. The details are still blurry, a panicked rush to the hospital. And that’s when it hit me – I was wearing my elaborate Halloween makeup. Not just a little bit of it, but *the whole thing*. 

It felt like a cruel joke, a ghostly echo of a celebration turned into a stark reminder of a life cut short. The commitment to the look, so carefully constructed, now felt like a heavy, embarrassing regret.  It wasn't about the makeup anymore; it was about a missed connection, a moment lost in the pursuit of a fleeting online trend. 

It’s a strange thing, how social pressures can pull us into corners, and how sometimes, the most meaningful moments aren't found in a perfectly curated feed, but in the quiet, heartbreaking reality of our lives.
