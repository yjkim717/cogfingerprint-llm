As I navigated college life in 2021, I found myself succumbing to the ease of online classes. I'd skip lectures and binge-watch them later, feeling a wave of laziness wash over me. Procrastination became my norm, and minimal effort my mantra. But as I coasted through the semester, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was settling for mediocrity. Was I truly learning, or just going through the motions? I'm not alone in this struggle - have you found yourself caught in the same cycle of procrastination and minimal effort?
