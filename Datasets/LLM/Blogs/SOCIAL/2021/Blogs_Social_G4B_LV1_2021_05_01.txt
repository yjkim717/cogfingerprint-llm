**Scrolling Through the Static**

Remember 2021? It felt…loud. Social media was *everywhere*, a constant hum of perfectly curated lives and urgent opinions. I spent way too much time scrolling, feeling this weird pressure to keep up, to respond, to *be* something online. 

I’d catch myself comparing my messy reality to everyone else’s highlight reel, and honestly, it just left me feeling drained. There was this constant need for validation – a like, a comment, a share. It felt less like connection and more like a competition. 

Looking back, I realize I was letting the noise dictate my mood. It took a conscious effort to step away, to actually *look* at the world around me. It’s a lesson I'm still learning, but 2021 was the year I started questioning the static.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
