It’s 2021, and I’m hunched over my Kamvas 13, chasing that perfect digital line. My MacBook? Giving me the silent treatment—no driver detection, just a blank screen. But my old Windows laptop? It recognized the tablet instantly through that janky Thunderbolt extender.

It’s funny how tech mirrors life sometimes. We expect seamless connections, but often it’s the unexpected pairings—the underdog setups—that pull through. That little Windows machine, gathering dust, became my creative lifeline. A reminder that sometimes, the solution isn’t about having the shiniest gear, but finding what truly works with you.
