## Those Signs Just Don’t Lie, Do They? (And What They Say About Corpus Christi)

Okay, I need to vent for a minute. Anyone else driving around Corpus Christi and feeling like the population signs are… a little optimistic? Like, seriously, when was the last time those numbers were actually updated? 

I was stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic on Leopard Street the other day – a *Saturday* afternoon, mind you – and it hit me. This isn't the Corpus Christi I remember from even five years ago. We’re growing. Fast. And it's not just me noticing. My friends, my family, even the barista at my favorite coffee shop are all saying the same thing.

We’re seeing new developments popping up everywhere, more families moving in, and the sheer volume of cars on the road is just… intense. Yet, I still see those signs proudly proclaiming a population that feels significantly lower than what I’m experiencing every single day.

It’s not about complaining, really. It’s more about a feeling of disconnect. It’s a reminder that sometimes, official numbers just don't quite catch up with reality. I wonder if the last census truly reflected the boom we’ve been experiencing, especially here in 2021. 

Maybe it’s a silly thing to dwell on, but it’s a tangible sign of a city in flux. A city evolving. And while I love the energy and vibrancy that comes with growth, I hope our infrastructure – and those population signs – can keep pace. Because right now, the traffic is definitely telling a different story.



What do you think? Are you noticing the changes in Corpus Christi too?
