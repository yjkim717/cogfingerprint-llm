The latest update to Rocket League has left a sour taste in my mouth. As a casual player, I loved the freedom to leave a match without penalty. But Psyonix has taken that away, and I couldn't be more disappointed. The removal of the "leave match" option in casual mode has created a breeding ground for toxic behavior. Players are now more likely to harass their teammates for not conceding, and it's getting out of hand. I've seen matches devolve into chaos, with teammates berating each other over a simple game. It's not just about the game anymore; it's about player psychology. We're punishing people for not wanting to concede, and it's promoting a culture of negativity. As someone who's spent countless hours playing Rocket League, it's disheartening to see the community suffer. I hope Psyonix rethinks their decision and brings back the flexibility we once had.
