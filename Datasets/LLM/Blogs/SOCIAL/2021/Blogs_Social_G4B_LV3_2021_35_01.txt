**The Echo in the Likes**

Remember 2021? Scrolling through Instagram felt… exhausting. Everyone seemed to be living this perfectly curated life – vacations, flawless outfits, beaming smiles. And for a while, I found myself caught in a really unsettling loop. I was battling a pretty heavy dose of depression and anxiety, and it felt like every post was a little jab at my own struggles. 

I started questioning everything. Was I *really* failing if my life didn’t look like everyone else’s online? Was my depression even “real” if I couldn’t project an image of happiness? The pressure from my family, coupled with this relentless social comparison, chipped away at my self-perception. 

It took a serious conversation with a friend to realize that authenticity isn’t about perfection; it’s about honesty.  It’s okay to not be okay, and those little moments of vulnerability – sharing a struggle, admitting you're having a bad day – they’re actually *powerful*.  Let’s ditch the echo in the likes and start being real with ourselves and each other.
