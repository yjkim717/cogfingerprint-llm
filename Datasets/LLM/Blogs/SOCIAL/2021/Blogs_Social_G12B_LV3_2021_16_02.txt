>## The Weight of Unspoken Things

It’s funny, isn’t it? How much progress you can make in mental health. How many tools you learn, how many coping mechanisms you build. I’d been feeling really solid, genuinely *good*, for a while. Then, a family secret surfaced. One of those things that had been buried deep, shielded by silence for years.

Suddenly, the ground felt shaky again. That familiar dread, that tightness in my chest… it was a stark reminder of the ongoing work trauma demands. It’s not a linear journey, is it? It’s more like climbing a mountain with unexpected avalanches. 

I'm navigating this wave now, leaning on the support systems I've cultivated – therapy, journaling, connecting with loved ones. It’s a raw, vulnerable space, but also a reminder that healing isn't about erasing the past, it's about learning to carry the weight with grace and resilience. And knowing you're not alone in carrying it. #mentalhealth #familysecrets #coping #trauma
