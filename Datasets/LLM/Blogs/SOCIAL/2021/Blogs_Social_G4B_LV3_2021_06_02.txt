**The Printer of My Sanity (2021)**

Let’s be honest, 2021 felt like a year of minor, maddening battles. And nothing embodied that quite like my printer. A simple error message, a flashing light – it triggered a surprising surge of frustration and, yeah, a little anger. I spent hours troubleshooting, convinced it was sentient and deliberately mocking me. It’s funny how something so small can feel like a personal failing, a reminder of our dependence on technology.  Sometimes, you just need to step away and breathe.
