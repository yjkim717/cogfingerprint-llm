It’s 2021, and I’m scrolling through grocery delivery options—something that became a lifeline during the pandemic. It got me thinking about those on reality TV shows like *My 600-lb Life*, navigating judgment just to shop for food. Why didn’t delivery ease their struggle? Maybe the answer lies in exploitation: the show profits from their pain, not their privacy. It’s a stark reminder that behind the drama, real people are living this reality, and our convenience shouldn’t blind us to their humanity.
