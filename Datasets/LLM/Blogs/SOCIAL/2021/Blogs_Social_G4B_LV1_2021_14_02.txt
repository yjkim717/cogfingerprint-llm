**Is My Cat Basically Screaming at the Door? (And How I’m Trying to Cope)**

Okay, so 2021 was… a lot, right? Between the pandemic and everything else, I was officially stressed. And my sweet little Luna was picking up on it. Suddenly, she’s *obsessed* with the front door, letting out these heartbreaking cries and howls whenever I leave for work. 

It’s seriously heartbreaking. I’ve been diving deep into cat behavior – turns out, it’s a surprisingly common thing called separation anxiety. I’m trying everything: puzzle feeders to keep her busy, extra-long walks (she *loves* a good sniff), and definitely a healthy dose of cat treats as positive reinforcement. 

Honestly, social media has been a lifeline. Seeing other cat parents share their experiences with noise sensitivity has been so validating.  It's a slow process, but I’m determined to help Luna feel more secure. Any tips from fellow anxious kitties out there? #catlife #separationanxiety #catbehavior #pandemiccat

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or changing the tone?
