## The Unexpected Cost of Mindless TV

Okay, so I have to share something slightly embarrassing, and definitely a good reminder to *actually* pay attention sometimes. It happened last week, and I'm still kind of reeling.

It was a Tuesday night, you know, that post-work slump where you just want to collapse on the couch. I was making a salad – a virtuous attempt at healthy eating after a week of takeout – and decided to zone out with some reality TV. I'm not even going to pretend I was engaged; my brain was basically on autopilot.

Next thing I know, *crunch*. A horrible, sickening crunch.

My immediate reaction was pure, unadulterated panic. I spat everything out, and there it was: a mangled fork tine, and a distinct feeling of…wrongness in my front tooth. 

See, a couple of years back, I chipped one of my front teeth. I got it fixed with a bonded ceramic restoration – it looked amazing, honestly, you'd never know! But apparently, that beautiful ceramic wasn't quite as invincible as I thought. This time, the fork had managed to crack it again.

So, here I am, in 2021, scheduling an emergency dentist appointment. It’s just… frustrating.  It’s a reminder that even small moments of inattention can have a real, and slightly expensive, consequence. And it’s definitely making me think twice about multitasking while eating.  Anyone else ever had a spectacularly silly accident like this?  I feel like I need to hear I'm not alone in my clumsiness! #oops #dentist #lifehacks #mindfulness #2021struggles
