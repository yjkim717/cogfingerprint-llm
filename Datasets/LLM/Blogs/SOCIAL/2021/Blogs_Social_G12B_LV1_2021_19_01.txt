## Lost in the Lines: Rediscovering Illustration's Golden Age

Okay, confession time: I've been down a rabbit hole lately. A really good one. It started with a fleeting memory of vintage magazine ads, those incredibly detailed illustrations that just *pulled* you in. Then I stumbled across Pete Beard's YouTube channel. Seriously, if you're even remotely interested in art history, particularly the evolution of illustration and its surprising connection to advertising, check it out. 

His "Illustration and Advertising" video was a revelation. It made me realize how much we've lost in the age of digital design, and sparked a renewed appreciation for the skill and artistry of those old masters. It's a welcome escape from the endless scroll of 2021!
