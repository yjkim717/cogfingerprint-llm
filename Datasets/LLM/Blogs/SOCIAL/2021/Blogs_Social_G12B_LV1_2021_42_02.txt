>## The Quiet Hum of Routine, and When It Stops

It's funny, isn't it, how much you can miss a routine? Especially in 2021, a year defined by disruption, I've found myself clinging to the small, predictable things even more. Like the gentle rhythm of our little neighborhood market.

We’re not a fancy place. Just a corner store, really, stocked with essentials and a slightly chaotic lotto board that always seems to draw a crowd. But it's the *people* that make it. And recently, one of those people is missing.

Mr. Henderson. He came in every Tuesday and Friday, without fail, for his newspaper and a small bag of Werther's Originals. We’d chat about the weather, the local sports team – nothing profound. Just…presence. A familiar face.

Then, suddenly, he wasn't there. I later learned he'd had a knee replacement, a serious operation. It sounds silly, but his absence left this weird void. It’s a reminder that even the most seemingly insignificant connections can create a quiet hum in your life, and when that hum stops, you feel it more than you expect. I hope he's recovering well and gets back to his Werther's and the newspaper soon. We miss him.
