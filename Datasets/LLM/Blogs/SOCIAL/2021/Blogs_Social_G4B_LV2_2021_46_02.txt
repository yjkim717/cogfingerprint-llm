**The Weight of Scrolling**

Okay, let’s be honest. 2021 felt…heavy. Not in a dramatic, ‘end-of-the-world’ kind of way, but a persistent, low-humming exhaustion. I found myself staring at my phone, not *doing* anything, just scrolling. And with every perfectly curated post, every outrageously opinionated comment, I felt this creeping sense of *world-weariness*. 

It’s weird, right? Like, I knew it wasn't *real*, that everyone online was presenting an edited version of themselves. But the sheer volume of it – the constant striving for validation, the relentless comparison – it started to feel like a physical weight. 

I’ve been reading about “mental fatigue,” and it really hit home. It’s not just about being tired after a long day; it’s this draining feeling of being perpetually stimulated, constantly absorbing other people's anxieties and dramas.  

There’s a dark undercurrent to so much of internet culture, isn’t there? And I think, for some of us, it can feel incredibly isolating.  I started noticing a strange urge, a quiet whisper suggesting that maybe, just maybe, stepping away was the only way to truly breathe. 

It’s a struggle, of course. But recognizing that feeling – that heavy weight of scrolling – felt like the first step toward finding a little space for myself.
