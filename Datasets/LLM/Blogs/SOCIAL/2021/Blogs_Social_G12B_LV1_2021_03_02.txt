## The Unexpected Lesson From My Dishwasher

Okay, confession time: I’ve been neglecting my appliances. Specifically, my washing machine and dishwasher. It sounds silly, right? We obsess over self-care, meal prepping, and decluttering our homes, but sometimes the things *doing* the cleaning get left behind.

It started with a weird smell coming from the dishwasher. A quick Google search led me down a rabbit hole of cleaning traps and battling soap scum. It was surprisingly… therapeutic? Like, I was tackling a small, contained problem, a tangible mess I could *fix*.

And it got me thinking. We spend so much energy perfecting our online personas, curating the perfect image. But what about the behind-the-scenes stuff? The messy emotions, the neglected routines, the things we avoid facing? 

Just like regularly cleaning out a dishwasher prevents buildup, maybe a little honest reflection and consistent maintenance of our mental and emotional "appliances" could prevent bigger issues down the line. 2021 has been… a lot. Maybe it’s time we all give our inner workings a good scrub.
