The butterflies were back. After what felt like a lifetime of lockdowns and screens, the simple act of sitting across from someone new felt wildly exhilarating. It was 2021, and we were still a little shy, a little rusty, navigating this old-new world of in-person connection.

Our conversation flowed easier than I’d dared hope, punctuated by laughter that didn’t lag through a speaker. And then, as we said our goodbyes under the dim streetlights, it happened. A kiss. Not a grand, cinematic moment, but a soft, hesitant one that held a universe of unspoken hope. It was a quiet promise, a shared acknowledgment that despite everything, we were still here, capable of this fragile, beautiful feeling. Walking away, my heart didn’t just flutter—it soared. For the first time in a long time, the future felt not just uncertain, but wonderfully, thrillingly open.
