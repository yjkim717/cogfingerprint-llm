Looking back on 2021, I remember scrolling through endless advice—everyone suddenly an expert on living my life. A mentor told me to take a corporate job for security, while friends pushed passion projects. I felt paralyzed by their conflicting opinions.

Then I realized: nobody wakes up in my skin or lies awake with my anxieties. That promotion everyone cheered for? It would have drained me. The "risky" freelance path I chose instead? It brought creative fulfillment I’d never known.

Your intuition isn’t just a whisper—it’s your inner compass, calibrated by your unique struggles and dreams. Trust it. You’re the one who’ll live with the consequences, not the commentators.
