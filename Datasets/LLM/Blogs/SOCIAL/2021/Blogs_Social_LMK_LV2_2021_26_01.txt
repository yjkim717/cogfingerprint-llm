"Watching my puppy navigate teething was a wild ride in 2021. Those adorable nips quickly turned into painful bites, but I knew it was just a phase. As I guided my furry friend towards gentler behavior, I was met with a sea of slobbery kisses and snuggles. The journey taught me patience and the value of cherishing those 'puppy moments' before they grow up. Now, I'm left with cherished memories of my little ball of fluff's antics, and a deeper appreciation for the journey of dog training and the joy it brings."
