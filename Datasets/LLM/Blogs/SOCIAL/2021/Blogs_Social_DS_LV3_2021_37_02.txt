There’s something magical about how a single fan’s idea can ripple through a community. I stumbled across a post recently where someone had dream-cast a live-action *Star Wars* trilogy for Darth Bane. It wasn't just a list of names; it was a passionate vision, complete with character actor pairings that felt surprisingly perfect.

In 2021, when so much of our interaction was still digital, this kind of shared imagination felt more vital than ever. It wasn't about a studio greenlighting a project; it was about us, as fans, building it together in our minds. We were co-creators, debating and connecting over a fictional universe that feels like a second home. It reminded me that the stories we love aren't just consumed—they're lived, debated, and endlessly reimagined in the spaces between us. That shared dream is its own powerful force.
