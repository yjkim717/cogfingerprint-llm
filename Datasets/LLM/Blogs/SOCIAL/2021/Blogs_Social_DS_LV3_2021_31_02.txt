It’s 2021, and I’m scrolling through Reddit when I see it: a post asking about an ASL sign, describing the non-dominant hand’s role and the specific handshape. Suddenly, I’m not just a spectator. I’m part of a conversation, a shared quest for understanding. It hits me—this is what learning looks like now. Not in a silent room, but in these vibrant, digital spaces where strangers help each other find the right sign, one detail at a time.
