## The PCT Leap: A Nursing Student’s Dilemma (and a Little Social Media Boost!)

Okay, real talk. Third year of my BSN program is *intense*. Like, seriously, sleep is a distant memory. But I’m also staring down the barrel of graduation and the whole “finding a job” thing.  I'm realizing I'm a little light on practical patient care experience beyond skills labs. 

So, I started looking into Patient Care Technician (PCT) roles. It feels like a great stepping stone, right? But the job descriptions… they make me feel like I need a decade of experience!  I posted a little about my worries on Instagram – a quick story asking if anyone else felt the same about bridging the gap between school and the real world.

The response was *amazing*. So many other nursing students (and even a few seasoned nurses!) chimed in with encouragement and tips. Turns out, highlighting transferable skills and emphasizing my eagerness to learn goes a long way.  It’s wild how a simple social media post can feel like a lifeline! Now I'm feeling a bit more confident about applying. Wish me luck! #nursingschool #pct #healthcare #jobsearch #2021struggles
