The metronome’s steady click was my only companion in those long hours of practice leading up to the first concert since before the pandemic. It was 2021, and the return to a live audience felt monumental.

I was tackling “Emperata,” a piece with a tricky Dixieland section. In the moment, adrenaline took over. I played fast, I played loud—I was a runaway train of misplaced confidence. The final note hung in the air, followed by a beat of silence. Then, our director slowly removed his glasses, pinched the bridge of his nose, and let out a sigh we all felt in our souls.

That single, silent reaction taught me more than any lecture ever could. It wasn't about perfection; it was about listening. My trusty metronome wasn't just keeping time; it was teaching me restraint and the power of playing together, a lesson that resonated far beyond the music.
