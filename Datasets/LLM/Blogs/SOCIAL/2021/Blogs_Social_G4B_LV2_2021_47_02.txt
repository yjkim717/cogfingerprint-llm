**Scrolling Through a Void**

Okay, be honest – how many of you spent 2021 staring at your phone, feeling… nothing? Like you were just *watching* life happen instead of actually *living* it? I definitely did. 

There were weeks, honestly, where I felt completely adrift. Like I was scrolling through a highlight reel of everyone else’s ‘amazing’ lives on social media, and simultaneously battling this creeping feeling that *my* future was just… blurry. The ‘self-improvement’ industry was shouting at me, but all I felt was a deep, unsettling lack of direction. 

It wasn’t about grand ambitions, more like a quiet panic – future anxiety, I guess you’d call it. Overthinking every single decision, convinced I was wasting time, paralyzed by the pressure to *do* something.  

I realized I wasn't alone in this.  It’s easy to get lost in the noise, to feel stuck in a loop of comparison and worry.  Maybe the first step to moving forward isn't chasing some perfect future, but just… noticing the quiet spaces within ourselves.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a particular aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
