### The Makeup That Wouldn't Quit: A Lesson in Priorities

So, there I was at 11 PM on a random Tuesday in October 2021, scrubbing my face raw over the bathroom sink. A single, stubborn crescent moon temporary tattoo—a relic from my over-enthusiastic Halloween test-run—glared back at me from my cheek. It was holding on for dear life, a stark, glittery contrast to the smeared, vampiric red lipstick that also refused to budge. Tomorrow wasn't another spooky party; it was my grandmother’s funeral.

In that steamy, desperate moment, surrounded by pots of coconut oil and half a bag of makeup wipes, I had a weirdly profound realization. I’m a makeup enthusiast. For me, it’s a form of art and self-expression. That crescent moon was a fun, creative experiment. But in the context of the next day, it was entirely, utterly inappropriate. It was a costume piece clinging to a day that demanded authenticity and respect.

It made me think about the "masks" we all wear, especially after the socially-distanced, Zoom-heavy years we’ve had. We have our professional mask for work calls, our "I'm-holding-it-together" mask for the grocery store, and our curated, filtered mask for social media. My literal makeup had become a metaphor for all of it. It was a fun facade that was now actively working against the genuine human connection and raw emotion that a funeral necessitates.

The frantic scrubbing wasn’t just about removing pigment and glue; it was about stripping back to my most vulnerable, unadorned self. I needed to show up for my family not as the girl with the cool Halloween makeup, but simply as a grieving granddaughter.

I finally got it all off, my skin left pink and tender. The next day, my face was bare, my emotions were not. And it felt right. The experience was a stark reminder that while our creative expressions and social personas are a beautiful part of who we are, there are moments in life that demand we show up with nothing to hide behind. Sometimes, the most powerful statement you can make is with a clean, honest face, ready to share the weight of a moment with the people you love.
