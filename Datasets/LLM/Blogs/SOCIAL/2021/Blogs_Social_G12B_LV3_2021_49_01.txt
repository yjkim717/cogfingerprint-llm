## The 90 Day Fiancé Effect & Why I'm Currently Sorting Socks

Okay, real talk. Anyone else endlessly fascinated (and slightly horrified) by *90 Day Fiancé*? Lately, I’ve been noticing a *pattern* – a concerning number of relationships that just…feel off. Like, major red flag territory. It's making me think about how we consume reality TV and the narratives we accept. Right now, I'm knee-deep in laundry, sorting socks, and pondering if we're all a little too comfortable watching these dynamics unfold. Anyone else feeling this?
