## The Worry Spiral & My Tiny Blue Pill

So, I finally caved and talked to my doctor about my anxiety. He prescribed a low dose of Xanax, which feels…weird. Honestly, I'm already spiraling about the side effects. I keep seeing all these forums talking about weight gain. It’s ridiculous, I know, especially when I’ve battled disordered eating in the past. Just trying to navigate this, and hoping to find some real-life stories from anyone else who's been there. Send good vibes (and maybe some helpful info!).
