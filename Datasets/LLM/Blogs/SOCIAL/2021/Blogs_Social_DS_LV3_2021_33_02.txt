The other day, I was scrolling through my camera roll—endless screenshots of work schedules, grocery lists, and video call snapshots. Then I landed on a photo from my last real vacation, back in 2019. Two years ago. My smile was wide, my shoulders weren’t hunched, and I wasn’t thinking about deadlines.

It hit me then, a cold little knot in my stomach. What have I been doing?

Since 2020 blurred into 2021, it feels like life has been put on hold, replaced by an endless cycle of work. Wake up, log on, power through, log off, repeat. The days blend, the weeks merge, and the years… well, they just disappear. I’m scared. Not of hard work, but of the quiet dread that one day I’ll look back and see a life measured in completed tasks and sent emails, not in laughter with friends or sunsets watched without a screen in hand.

We’ve traded connection for productivity, mistaking busyness for purpose. But time is the one thing we can’t get back. I don’t want my legacy to be a perfectly organized inbox. I want it to be a life fully, messily, and beautifully lived. It’s time to reclaim it.
