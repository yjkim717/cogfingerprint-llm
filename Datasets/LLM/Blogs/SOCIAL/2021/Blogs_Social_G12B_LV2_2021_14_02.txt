## The Doorway Drama & the Unexpected Gift of WFH

Remember back in 2021 when the world shifted? Suddenly, my living room became my office, my commute was a ten-foot walk, and my cat, Jasper, decided my return from *literally* just stepping out the door was a monumental crisis?

It started subtly. A plaintive meow when I left for the office. Then, escalated to full-blown howling, a dramatic, operatic performance that could rival any Broadway star. It was heartbreaking, honestly. I felt guilty, like I was abandoning him. My partner would hear the commotion while I was still in meetings and send sympathetic texts. "He misses you already!"

It took a while to realize what was *really* happening. Jasper wasn't just sad I was gone; he was confused. For years, my comings and goings were predictable. Out all day, back in the evening. But now? I’d disappear for a few hours, then reappear! It was messing with his feline logic.

We started experimenting. Distraction techniques – feather wands, puzzle toys, strategically placed catnip – helped, but only marginally. Then, I realized the key wasn't just *stopping* the howling, but redirecting his attention. Now, when I head out, I make a big fuss over him *before* I leave. A long petting session, a special treat. And when I return? A calm greeting, a gentle playtime, and ignoring the initial dramatic cries.

It's been a learning curve, this whole working-from-home thing. But amidst the Zoom calls and the endless to-do lists, Jasper’s doorway drama has been a surprisingly poignant reminder to be present, to acknowledge the little disruptions, and to appreciate the unexpected connections that bloom when life throws you a curveball (or, in Jasper’s case, a sudden departure and return).
