There’s a quiet rhythm to running a neighborhood market—the familiar faces, the brief chats, the unspoken trust. For years, Mr. Evans came in every Tuesday and Friday, always for the same loaf of bread and a small bunch of daisies. We knew he’d lost his wife a while back; the flowers were for her.

When he didn’t show up last week, a strange unease settled over the store. Then we heard—he’d passed suddenly. It’s funny how grief can hollow out a space you didn’t even realize was so full. Customers who’d never spoken to each other began sharing stories in the aisles. Someone left a card by the register, and it slowly filled with handwritten notes.

In 2021, when so much felt disconnected, his absence reminded us how deeply we’re woven into each other’s lives. It wasn’t just about selling bread and flowers. It was about showing up, being seen, and holding a little piece of someone’s world.
