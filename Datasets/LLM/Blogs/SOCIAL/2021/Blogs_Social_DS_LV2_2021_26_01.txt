It’s 2021, and I’m working from home, trying to teach my puppy not to chew everything in sight. We’ve practiced bite inhibition, redirected with toys, but there’s this one quirk I secretly love. Every time he’s about to gently nibble my arm during his teething phase, he lets out this tiny, dramatic yawn first—like he’s mustering up all his self-control.

In a year when human connection felt scarce, his soft, mindful nibbles became our little ritual. It’s a reminder that even in training, there’s room for tenderness. Who knew puppy antics could feel so profoundly social?
