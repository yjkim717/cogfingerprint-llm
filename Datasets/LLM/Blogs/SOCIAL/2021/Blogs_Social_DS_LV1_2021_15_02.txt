### The Day I Declared War on Trendy Toast

So, there I was in the fall of 2021, a semester into my gig at the university dining hall. We were all still navigating that weird post-lockdown haze, and the “Deli Corner” was my kingdom. It was also my personal hell during the noon rush.

The big new rule that year was a strict Gluten-Free Protocol. For students with Celiac disease, this was a lifesaver. Cross-contamination from a crumb-covered knife could literally land them in the hospital. The protocol was simple: upon any gluten-free request, we had to ditch our current gloves, wash our hands thoroughly at the little sink right there, and put on fresh gloves. It took about 45 seconds. For someone with a real medical need, that 45 seconds is a small price to pay for safety.

But then came the others. Let’s call them the “Gluten-Averse.” You know the type. They’d roll up, chatting on their AirPods about their new wellness influencer, and casually ask for their turkey sandwich on gluten-free bread “for the bloat.” They’d then watch a single crumb from the regular wheat bread touch the lettuce and say, “Ew, never mind,” and flounce off, leaving me with a half-made sandwich and a time-sucking cleanup. Meanwhile, the line would grow, and I’d see Sarah—the student with the actual Celiac diagnosis—anxiously shifting her weight at the back, knowing her safe lunch was getting further away.

I hit my breaking point one Tuesday. A guy in a beanie ordered a gluten-free bagel. I launched into the protocol: gloves off, wash hands, new gloves. As I reached for the sterile, packaged GF bagel, he stopped me. “Oh, actually, can you toast it in the same toaster as the regular ones? It gives it a better crunch.”

That was it. The sheer, privileged ignorance. He was playing with a dietary requirement like it was a fun menu option, completely oblivious to the danger he was asking for.

So, I embraced the rules. I became a master of malicious compliance.

The next time a Gluten-Averse student requested their trend-of-the-day sandwich, I didn’t just comply; I performed. “GLUTEN-FREE REQUEST!” I’d announce cheerfully. I’d make a slow, deliberate show of removing my gloves, tossing them with a *snap*. I’d scrub my hands like a surgeon prepping for a heart transplant, counting slowly to twenty in my head. I’d dry each finger meticulously. Then, the fresh gloves would come on with another satisfying *snap*.

The line would stall. People would sigh. I’d just smile. “Safety first!”

For Sarah, I’d have a pre-prepped, truly safe sandwich ready under the counter, a little nod our secret. For the others, I gave them exactly what they asked for, wrapped in all the bureaucratic red tape they inspired. I wasn’t refusing service; I was following the protocol to its absolute letter, forcing them to feel the weight of the precaution they were so flippantly invoking.

In the end, I wasn’t just making sandwiches. I was making a point. In a world full of performative choices, sometimes the most powerful statement is to simply, and painstakingly, give people exactly what they say they want.
