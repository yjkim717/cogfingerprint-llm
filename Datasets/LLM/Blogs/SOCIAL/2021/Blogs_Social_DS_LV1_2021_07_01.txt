It’s 2021, and I’m scrolling through endless feeds, feeling stuck. I want to learn something new—maybe coding or history—but where do I even begin? The sheer volume of online resources is overwhelming, and my motivation keeps fading. Then, I remember a friend’s advice: just pick one small topic and dive in. So I did. I started with a single YouTube tutorial, then a free online course. Slowly, the fog lifted. Sometimes, the first step isn’t about having all the answers—it’s about trusting yourself to find them along the way.
