## The Digital Roadblock & Why It Felt Personal

It’s funny how technology can throw a wrench in your day, right? Last week, I was wrestling with my Huion Kamvas 13 – a fantastic little drawing tablet. I’d invested in a Thunderbolt extender, hoping to tidy up my desk setup, but macOS decided to play hard to get. The tablet just…vanished.

Frustrating, to say the least. It worked perfectly fine on my Windows machine, which only amplified the annoyance. It felt oddly personal, like my Mac was deliberately gatekeeping my creative flow.

It got me thinking about how we often project feelings onto these inanimate objects. We get invested in our tech, rely on it, and then when it fails, it feels like a rejection. 2021 has been a year of digital dependence, and these little hiccups remind us that even the most sophisticated tech is still…well, tech.  A little troubleshooting, a new Huion cable, and it's all working now, but the feeling lingered – a reminder to breathe and remember it's just a machine.



Hopefully, this captures the desired tone and context!
