The Frustrating Fun of Subnautica Glitches

As I dove back into Subnautica in 2021, I was thrilled to explore the underwater world in VR. But, my excitement was short-lived. While cruising along in my trusty Seamoth vehicle, it suddenly vanished into thin air. I was left staring at the empty ocean floor, wondering what just happened. Was it a glitch? Did I accidentally delete it? The uncertainty was infuriating.

As I dug deeper, I discovered I wasn't alone. Many players had experienced similar issues, sparking a lively discussion about the cause. Some blamed it on VR compatibility issues, while others pointed to a rogue mod. Whatever the reason, it was clear that even the most immersive gameplay can be disrupted by a single glitch. Still, it's a reminder that sometimes, it's the unexpected moments that make gaming so memorable â€“ and spark a sense of community among players.
