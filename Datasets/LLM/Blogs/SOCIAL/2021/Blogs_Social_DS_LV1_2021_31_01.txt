After over a year of digital small talk and awkward video dates, I finally met someone in person. The rules were loosening in 2021, and the nerves were real. We walked through the park, the conversation flowing easier than any Zoom call.

And then it happened. As we said goodnight, he leaned in. That first kiss after so much isolation… it wasn’t just a kiss. It was a release. A tiny, defiant act of normalcy that sent a flock of butterflies swirling in my stomach—a feeling I’d almost forgotten existed.

It was more than just a romantic moment; it was a jolt of pure, human connection. It felt like coming up for air. Now, I’m just hoping for a second date, and maybe, a few more of those butterflies.
