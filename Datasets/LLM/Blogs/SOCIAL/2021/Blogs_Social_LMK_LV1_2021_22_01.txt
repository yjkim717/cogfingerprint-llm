"Living with fibromyalgia in 2021 has been a rollercoaster. After years of managing chronic pain with anti-inflammatory meds, I hit a roadblock - liver issues forced me to reevaluate. Now, I'm on the hunt for stronger pain management options. It's isolating, but I'm not alone. I'm reaching out to others who understand, sharing our stories to raise awareness and find new paths to relief. Together, we can break the silence around chronic pain."
