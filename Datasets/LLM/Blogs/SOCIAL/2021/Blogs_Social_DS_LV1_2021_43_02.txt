It’s 2021, and I’m at the park watching a service dog play fetch during a break. It hits me—these incredible animals aren’t just working; they’re living beings who need joy, too. Their handlers make sure they get that precious "off-duty" time to just be dogs. It’s a quiet reminder that behind every role we see, there’s a life deserving of care and freedom.
