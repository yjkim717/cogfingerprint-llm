It’s 2021, and I’m watching a weight-loss reality show, a YouTube binge that’s got me thinking. These brave folks face judgmental stares in grocery aisles, all while I’m tapping my phone for delivery without a second thought. Why not them? The social stigma around food choices is real, and it’s heartbreaking. We’ve normalized convenience for some, yet shame still dictates shopping behavior for others. Maybe it’s time we rethink not just how we shop, but why we judge.
