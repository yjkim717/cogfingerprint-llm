"The Silence Experiment: How Ditching Music for Two Weeks Changed My Perspective"

As a sound engineer and producer, I'm no stranger to music. It's my livelihood, my passion, and often, my constant companion. In 2021, I found myself wondering: what would happen if I took a break from it? So, I embarked on a two-week experiment - abstaining from music altogether. No listening, no producing, no humming along to tunes in the shower. The result was surprising.

At first, it felt like a part of me was missing. I'd catch myself reaching for my headphones or mindlessly scrolling through music streaming platforms. But as the days went by, I started to notice a shift. I was more present in my daily activities. I'd savor my coffee, enjoy the sounds of nature, and engage more deeply with the people around me. It was as if my senses had been heightened, and I was rediscovering the world around me.

When I finally returned to listening to music, it was like experiencing it for the first time. I appreciated the nuances, the layers, and the emotions it evoked. It was no longer just background noise; it was a meaningful experience. This experiment taught me that, as someone with ADHD, my brain often craves stimulation. By taking a break from music, I was forced to cultivate mindfulness and engage with the world in a more intentional way. Now, I'm more thoughtful about when and how I listen to music, and it's become a more enriching part of my life. Who knew silence could be so loud?
