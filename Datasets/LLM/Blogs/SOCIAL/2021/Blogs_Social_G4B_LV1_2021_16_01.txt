**The Dreaded “Incomplete” – and Why It Feels Like More Than Just a Grade**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 was *rough* for a lot of us. Between the pandemic, the constant news cycle, and just generally feeling… off, navigating college felt like a particularly uphill battle. And I had a mini-crisis this semester that I needed to unpack.

It started with Professor Davies’ Intro to Sociology class. The assignments were interesting, the material was dense, but the *communication*? Nonexistent. Deadlines were announced with little warning, feedback was sparse, and when I *did* reach out with a question about an assignment, I got… crickets. 

Then came the dreaded email: “Incomplete.” Not a failing grade, but not a passing one either. Just… incomplete. It felt like a slap in the face. I was already struggling to keep up, and this felt like a brick wall. 

It wasn’t just about the grade, you know? It was the feeling of being completely unseen. Like my effort, my questions, my confusion – it wasn’t registering. I started dreading going to office hours, convinced I’d just be met with more silence. 

Honestly, it made me think about how much we rely on these little interactions with professors – they’re supposed to be mentors, guides. When that connection is broken, it seriously impacts your experience.  I ended up talking to the academic advisor, and we worked something out, but it definitely highlighted the importance of clear communication and feeling valued as a student.  What about you guys? Have you ever experienced something similar?
