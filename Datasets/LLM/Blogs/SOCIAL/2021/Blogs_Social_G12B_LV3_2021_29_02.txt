## When Anime Makes You Question Everything (and Physics!)

Okay, confession time: I’ve been *really* into *Dr. Stone* lately. It's just so clever! But it got me thinking – how much of this Stone World revival is actually…possible? Specifically, I was down a Reddit rabbit hole about the Kudayari, Senku's giant, gunpowder-powered axe. 

Seriously, could you *really* build something like that with just basic physics and scavenging? The thought experiment is fascinating. It’s a fun reminder that even in a fictional world, the underlying principles of science still apply, and it makes me appreciate the ingenuity humans possess, even when facing seemingly impossible odds. Anyone else ever get lost in that kind of nerdy pondering?
