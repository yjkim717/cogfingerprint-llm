As I sat surrounded by online courses and to-do lists in 2021, I realized I was stuck. I yearned to learn new skills and expand my knowledge, but lacked direction. The abundance of resources only added to my frustration. I wondered, how can one stay motivated to learn without a clear plan? Through trial and error, I discovered that self-education isn't just about accumulating resources, but about cultivating a mindset that fosters productivity. By focusing on my goals and breaking them down into achievable steps, I finally found my stride and started making progress.
