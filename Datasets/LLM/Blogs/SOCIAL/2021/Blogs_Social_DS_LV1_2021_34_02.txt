It was just a fender bender in 2021, or so we thought. My girlfriend bumped her head, blacked out for a moment, but seemed okay. The ER did a CT scan; it was clear. We were sent home with instructions to rest.

But then I noticed itâ€”a clear fluid trickling from her ear. A quick search online sent a chill down my spine. That wasn't normal. It felt like the system had failed us. The "all-clear" from the scan felt hollow against this tangible, worrying symptom.

We pushed for a neurology consult. It was a fight, advocating in a crowded hospital when you're just a scared partner. It taught me a hard lesson: you have to be the loudest voice for your loved one's health, even when you're told not to worry. Trust, but verify. Always.
