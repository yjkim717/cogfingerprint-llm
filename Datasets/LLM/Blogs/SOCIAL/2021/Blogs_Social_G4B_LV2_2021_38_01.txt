**The Glow of Screens & the Pull of Soil**

Remember 2021? It felt like everyone was perpetually bathed in the blue light of a screen. Scrolling, consuming, reacting – a constant hum of social media. I was right there with them, feeling that familiar pull. 

Then, I started getting into gardening. Seriously, like *really* into it. And it made me think about Bo Burnham’s *Inside*. That incredible use of lighting – especially those grow lamps – felt strangely parallel. 

It struck me as a visual representation of something vital: the desire for growth, for something real beyond the digital echo chamber.  Both the flickering screen and the steady glow of a grow lamp represent a need for light, for nourishment, for *something* to take root. 

Maybe we all just crave a little bit of that tangible, grounding light, right?
