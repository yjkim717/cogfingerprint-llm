There’s something quietly rebellious about reclaiming slow, intentional mornings in a world that never seems to stop moving. Back in 2021, when life felt like a constant scroll through a highlight reel, I started a small ritual: making oat banana pancakes.

It began out of necessity—a desperate grab for a quick, low-calorie breakfast that didn’t taste like sacrifice. I’d mash a ripe banana, stir in some oats, and in minutes, have a warm stack ready. But what started as meal prep became a pocket of peace. I’d make a double batch, freezing half for busy days, and suddenly, my mornings had a gentle anchor.

Those simple pancakes became more than food; they were a reminder that taking care of myself didn’t have to be complicated. In a time of digital noise and endless to-do lists, this tiny act of nourishment felt like a quiet protest—a choice to fuel my body and savor a moment just for me. It’s funny how the smallest rituals can hold the most meaning.
