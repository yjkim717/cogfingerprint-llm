## The Unspoken Consequences of Maternity Leave: A Call for Workplace Fairness

As I sat in my office, surrounded by the familiar hum of computers and the chatter of colleagues, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of resentment. It wasn't that I didn't love my job or appreciate the hardworking individuals around me. It was just that, as I watched my pregnant colleague prepare to embark on her maternity leave, I couldn't shake off the feeling that our workplace's maternity leave policies were, in fact, unfair.

In 2021, it's astounding that we're still debating the merits of maternity leave. On the surface, it seems like a progressive and supportive policy â€“ giving new mothers time to care for their newborns and recover from childbirth. But, as with many well-intentioned policies, there's a more nuanced reality. The burden of maternity leave often falls disproportionately on colleagues like me, who are left to pick up the slack while our pregnant colleagues are out.

The issue isn't just about the extra workload; it's about the lack of consideration for those of us who don't have children or aren't planning to. The assumption is that everyone will simply absorb the extra responsibilities, without any thought to the impact on our own work-life balance. It's a glaring example of how our workplace policies often prioritize family planning over fairness and equality.

As I watched my colleague prepare for motherhood, I couldn't help but wonder: where's the support for those of us who aren't on the same family planning trajectory? The reality is that not everyone wants to have children, and that's okay. But when we create policies that cater primarily to those who do, we inadvertently create a two-tiered system. It's a system where some colleagues are seen as more valuable or more deserving of support simply because of their family status.

The truth is, work-life balance is a concern for everyone, regardless of their family situation. We all have different needs and priorities, and it's time our workplace policies reflected that. It's not just about being fair to those taking maternity leave; it's about being fair to everyone.

As I look around my office, I see colleagues who are struggling to balance their work and personal lives, regardless of their family status. It's time we start having a more nuanced conversation about what it means to be supportive and fair in the workplace. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and equitable environment that values everyone, not just those with families. Only then can we truly say we're promoting gender equality and workplace fairness.
