As I binge-watched 90 Day Fianc√© on TLC in 2021, I couldn't help but wonder: what's real and what's scripted? The show's over-the-top characters and manufactured drama left me questioning the authenticity of reality TV. Are we watching real relationships unfold or a toxic narrative crafted for entertainment?
