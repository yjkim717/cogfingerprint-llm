## That Time I Got Lost in ASL and Felt Really, Really Dumb

Okay, so last week I was chatting with a friend who’s fluent in ASL, and she was telling me about a sign she’d learned. It was this really interesting combo – one hand just… stayed still, flat. The other was doing this little dance, starting as an open-five and morphing into an 'S'. I was completely blank. 

I kept asking, "What does it *mean*?" trying to guess. My friend just smiled patiently. Turns out, I was way off. It was a sign for "navigate." The awkwardness was real! It really highlighted how much I still have to learn, and how much communication goes beyond just words. It was a good reminder to be humble and keep asking questions.
