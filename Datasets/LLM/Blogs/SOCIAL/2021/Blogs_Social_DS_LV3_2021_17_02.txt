It was one of those sweltering August afternoons in 2021 when my digestive system decided to stage a full-blown rebellion. I’d just finished a heavy barbecue meal at a friend’s outdoor gathering, foolishly ignoring both the heat and my thirst. At first, it was just uncomfortable bloating and cramping, but then the panic set in—my old nemesis, emetophobia, whispering worst-case scenarios in my ear.

As I sat there trying to breathe through the waves of nausea, I realized how isolating digestive anxiety can feel in social settings. Everyone else was laughing and connecting while I was mentally calculating my exit route. The constipation and dehydration weren't just physical discomforts; they became triggers that transported me back to every past moment of digestive distress.

What got me through was admitting my struggle to a close friend who stayed with me in the shaded corner of the yard. That small act of vulnerability—of saying "I'm not okay right now"—transformed my panic into connection. Sometimes the most social moments happen not in the center of the party, but in the quiet spaces where we allow ourselves to be fully human.
