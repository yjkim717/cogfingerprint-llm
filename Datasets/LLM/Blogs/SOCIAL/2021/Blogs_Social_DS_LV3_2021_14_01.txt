Of all the cosmic pranks the universe could have pulled, it had to be this one. It was October 30th, 2021, and I was buzzing with that pre-Halloween energy, ready to test-drive my “Celestial Sorceress” look. The centerpiece was a gorgeous, intricate temporary tattoo—a delicate crescent moon right on my cheekbone. To complete the vibe, I slicked on a new liquid lipstick the color of deep wine, a shade called “Eternal Night.” The name, I would soon learn, was a promise it intended to keep.

My phone buzzed just as I was admiring my handiwork in the selfie camera. The news was a gut punch. A beloved great-aunt had passed, and her funeral was scheduled for the next morning. My Halloween glamour evaporated, replaced by a cold dread. I had to get this stuff off. Immediately.

What followed was a frantic, late-night ritual that felt like a bizarre, personal exorcism. The **removal struggle** was real. The **temporary tattoo**, supposedly water-soluble, clung to my skin with the tenacity of a real one. Scrubbing with soap and water just smeared the silver ink. I moved on to makeup remover, then olive oil, each attempt leaving a grey, ghostly smudge where a crisp moon had been.

But the lipstick, oh, the **lipstick**. “Eternal Night” was its own beast. It refused to budge. I looked like I’d been drinking merlot straight from the bottle, a stark, purple stain that screamed “party” in a world that had just gone quiet. I scrubbed until my lips were raw and stinging, a frantic, tearful figure in the bathroom mirror at 1 AM. In that moment of panic, the absurdity of it all hit me. Here I was, in my pajamas, engaged in a losing battle against the very **Halloween makeup** I’d been so excited about, all because life had abruptly shifted from celebration to **funeral**.

I finally gave up, the faint, shadowy outline of the moon and the stubborn lip stain my new companions. Lying in bed, I realized this wasn’t just about makeup. It was a stark, smudgy lesson in life’s unpredictable timing. We make plans, we pick our costumes and our colors, but life has its own schedule. Showing up to that funeral the next day, with my imperfect, slightly raw face, felt more authentic than any flawless makeup ever could. It was a quiet testament to the messy, unscripted reality of being human. Sometimes, you just have to go with the smudge.
