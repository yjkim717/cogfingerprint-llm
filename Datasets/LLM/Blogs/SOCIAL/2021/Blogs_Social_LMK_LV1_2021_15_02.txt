**The Unintended Consequences of Doing the Right Thing: A Dining Hall Dilemma**

As I look back on my time working in a college dining hall in 2021, I'm reminded of the complexities of catering to diverse dietary needs. One particular issue that still resonates with me is the tension surrounding gluten-free options. As someone who took pride in following protocol to the letter, I inadvertently became a part of the problem.

To minimize cross-contamination, our dining hall implemented strict guidelines for preparing gluten-free meals. We labeled utensils and equipment, cleaned surfaces thoroughly, and even designated specific areas for gluten-free food preparation. On the surface, it seemed like we were doing everything right. However, this diligence sparked frustration among some customers who had chosen a gluten-free diet for non-medical reasons.

These individuals often expressed disappointment and even outrage when they discovered that their gluten-free meals were being prepared with such care. Some perceived our adherence to protocol as an overreaction, arguing that it was unnecessary for non-medical gluten-free diets. They felt that we were being overly cautious, and that our efforts were an affront to their personal choices.

At the time, I was taken aback by their reactions. I had assumed that following protocol would be universally appreciated, especially in a shared dining space where cross-contamination was a legitimate concern. But as I listened to their concerns, I began to understand that the issue was more nuanced.

For some, a gluten-free diet was a lifestyle choice, not a medical necessity. They didn't require the same level of protection as those with celiac disease or severe gluten intolerance. Our strict protocols, while well-intentioned, had inadvertently created a sense of "malicious compliance" â€“ where our efforts to do the right thing were perceived as excessive or even antagonistic.

Reflecting on this experience, I realize that there's a delicate balance between catering to diverse needs and respecting individual choices. As a society, we're becoming increasingly aware of the importance of accommodating different dietary requirements. However, this awareness must be accompanied by a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding these choices.

In hindsight, I wish we had taken a more nuanced approach, one that considered the varied motivations behind gluten-free diets. By doing so, we might have avoided inadvertently alienating some customers and created a more inclusive dining environment for everyone.
