## Diving Deep into Party Planning (and Social Media!)

My little one's obsessed with the Octonauts, so naturally, we're throwing a "Ring of Fire" themed party! It’s been a surprisingly deep dive into Pinterest and Instagram for inspiration. Seeing other parents' creative setups is amazing, but also… a little overwhelming! It’s a fun reminder that social media can be a fantastic resource, but sometimes you just need to unplug and focus on the joy of celebrating. Tiki torches, here we come!
