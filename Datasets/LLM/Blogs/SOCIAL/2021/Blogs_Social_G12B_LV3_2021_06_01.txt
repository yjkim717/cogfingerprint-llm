## When Your Dreams Start Meddling with Your Neighborly Relations

Okay, so I had a *weird* dream last night. Like, seriously bizarre. Picture this: I woke up to find a kangaroo – a full-grown, grumpy kangaroo – somehow in my backyard. Not like, a cute, zoo-escapee kind of kangaroo. This one was actively *hostile*. 

It started small, you know? Just hopping around, munching on my prize-winning roses. Annoying, sure, but manageable. But then it started testing the fence, trying to break through. And that’s when the neighbors got involved. 

Apparently, my kangaroo was also harassing *their* pet chihuahua, Princess Fluffybutt the Third (yes, really). Cue the shouting, the frantic phone calls, the passive-aggressive fence-gazing. My dream self was desperately trying to contain this marsupial menace while simultaneously apologizing to Mrs. Henderson next door, who was *not* amused by the kangaroo’s near-miss with Princess Fluffybutt.

It escalated, obviously. It always does in dreams. There was a chase, a lot of yelling, and a truly surreal moment involving a garden gnome and a very angry kangaroo. 

I woke up feeling completely bewildered. But it got me thinking. How often do our anxieties, our frustrations, our little neighborhood squabbles, bubble up into these absurd, symbolic scenarios?  2021 has been… a lot, right? We're all navigating so much – social distancing, political divides, just the general weirdness of the world. Maybe my dream kangaroo was just a stand-in for all the things we feel powerless to control, the unexpected disruptions to our carefully constructed routines and relationships. 

Anyone else been having dreams that feel like a particularly chaotic Zoom meeting? Let me know in the comments – I need to know I'm not alone in this!
