**The Little Interruptions**

Remember those little moments that just… derailed 2021? Like when my niece would burst into a video call, mid-important Zoom meeting, with a completely unprompted, enthusiastic rendition of “Baby Shark”? It was undeniably cute, but also supremely frustrating! It felt like a tiny, adorable interruption to the carefully constructed digital world we’d built. 

It made me think about how we all crave connection, and sometimes, those spontaneous moments – like a puppy’s teething nibble – remind us of the messy, beautiful chaos of real life.  Were they a nuisance? Absolutely. But looking back, they were a tiny dose of joy in a complicated year.
