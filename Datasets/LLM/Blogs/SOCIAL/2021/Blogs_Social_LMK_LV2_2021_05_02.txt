"When Gaming Frustration Takes Over: Reflecting on The Last of Us' Grounded Mode"

I'll be the first to admit it - I'm a sucker for a good survival game. The thrill of scavenging for resources, the rush of adrenaline when faced with a horde of infected, and the satisfaction of overcoming a tough challenge are all part of the experience I crave. So, when I decided to play The Last of Us on Grounded mode in 2021, I was excited to test my skills.

At first, the gameplay was exhilarating. The tension was palpable, and every decision felt crucial to survival. But as I progressed, I hit a wall - a sudden difficulty spike that left me frustrated and stumped. Resource management, which was once a fun challenge, became a tedious chore. I found myself replaying the same section multiple times, dying from the same encounter, and feeling like I was getting nowhere.

As I slammed my controller down in frustration, I couldn't help but wonder - was it just me, or was Grounded mode too harsh? Was I just not good enough, or was the game designed to be this punishing? It made me think about how we respond to frustration in gaming, and how it can sometimes bring out strong emotions in us.
