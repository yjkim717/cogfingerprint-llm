The metronome sat on my music stand, its steady click a constant reminder of everything I’d practiced for our first concert since 2019. The air backstage was thick with a nervous energy I’d almost forgotten. When we launched into "Emperata Overture," that energy took over. My fingers flew, the tempo racing ahead of our poor band director’s frantic conducting.

But then came the Dixieland piece. Something clicked. It wasn’t about rigid precision anymore; it was about feeling the collective swing, the shared joy of making music together after so much isolation. We weren't just playing notes; we were finally reconnecting. It was messy, it was human, and in that moment, it was absolutely perfect.
