## That Moment Everything Shifts

It's funny how quickly life can feel... precarious. Last week was a blur of worry and frantic phone calls. My friend, Sarah, was in a car accident. Nothing major, thankfully – a fender bender really – but she lost consciousness for a few seconds and, to top it off, some clear fluid started leaking from her ear.

The immediate rush to the emergency room was terrifying. The wait felt like an eternity. They ran a CT scan, which, according to the neurologist, came back “clear.” But that didn't quite erase the anxiety. Clear doesn’t always mean *okay*, right? 

It’s made me think a lot about how fragile we are. How one moment you're scrolling through Instagram, catching up on TikTok trends (2021 life!), and the next, everything’s upended. It really highlighted the importance of being there for the people you care about, offering a listening ear and just…showing up. Sarah's doing okay now, thankfully, but it was a stark reminder to appreciate every single day.
