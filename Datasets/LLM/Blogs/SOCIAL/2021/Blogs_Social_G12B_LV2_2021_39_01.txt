## The Night the Metronome Stuttered (and What I Learned)

Okay, so remember back in 2021? We were *all* a little shaky, a little off-kilter, navigating a world that felt like it was constantly shifting. That feeling mirrored pretty perfectly the high school concert we had that fall. 

We’d been working on this piece, “Emperata Overture,” for months. It was ambitious, powerful, and *fast*. Our band director, Mr. Harrison, was a stickler for precision. He drilled us relentlessly with the metronome, demanding a unified pulse.

The night of the concert, though? It all kind of…unraveled. Nerves got the better of some of us, and the tempo started to wander. It felt like the entire band was fighting against itself. The moment felt… chaotic. 

It wasn't a disaster, but it wasn’t the performance we’d envisioned. Afterwards, Mr. Harrison didn’t yell. He simply said, “Music isn't just about hitting the notes, it’s about trusting the pace, trusting the practice.” It stuck with me. It wasn't just about music; it was about life. Sometimes, you just have to find your rhythm and *stick* to it, even when things get a little shaky.
