**Is This… Me? A Late-Night Scroll Revelation**

Okay, real talk. It’s 2021, and I’ve been staring at my phone more than I care to admit. Scrolling through perfectly curated feeds, feeling this weird little pang of…comparison? It hit me last night, a full-blown, “Am I just…doing the bare minimum?” kind of moment. 

I’m battling a serious case of “college life” procrastination – a comfy blanket of minimal effort that’s slowly suffocating my motivation. It’s not laziness, exactly, more like a deep-seated questioning of *why* I’m even trying sometimes.  Like, is this all there is? 

Anyone else feel this pull, this quiet struggle to actually *engage* with life, instead of just observing it through a screen?  Let’s be honest, it’s a messy, real feeling.  #collegelife #studentstruggles #reflection
