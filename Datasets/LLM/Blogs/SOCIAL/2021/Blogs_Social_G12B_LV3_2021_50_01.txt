## Who *Really* Runs the Show Now? (And Why I'm Obsessed with Hawkeye)

Okay, so I’ve been deep down the Hawkeye fandom rabbit hole, and a Reddit post really struck a chord. People are genuinely wondering if this series is about Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) or Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld)! All those set photos featuring Kate… it’s got everyone buzzing.

It’s fascinating, isn’t it? How narratives shift, legacies pass on. It feels like 2021, a year where we've all been grappling with change and seeing established things evolve.  Are we watching Clint hand the torch? Or is Kate forging her *own* Hawkeye story? I'm excited to find out, and it’s making me think about what it means to step into a legend’s shoes.
