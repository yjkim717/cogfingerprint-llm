**The Weight of Silence (and a Really Bad Spreadsheet)**

Okay, real talk. 2021 felt…heavy. Not in a dramatic, ‘end-of-the-world’ kind of way, but a persistent, dull ache in my chest that had nothing to do with the weather. I’d been battling bulimia for a while, a secret I’d carefully constructed a fortress around. It wasn’t a conscious thing, not at first. Just a way to manage, to feel *something* when everything felt overwhelmingly numb.

Then it started to bleed into everything. My work – I’m a data analyst, ironically – became a source of intense anxiety. Spreadsheets felt like a personal attack, and the pressure to perform was crushing. I was constantly exhausted, snapping at colleagues, and generally just…off. 

It reached a point where I knew I needed to step away. The thought of explaining it, of admitting I was struggling with my mental health and a serious eating disorder, was paralyzing. The idea of taking a job leave felt terrifying – admitting weakness. 

So, I started drafting an email. A polite, vague request for time off, citing “personal circumstances.” It felt like a lie, a tiny, shameful one. Ultimately, I took the leave, and started researching treatment options. It was a messy, scary process, but taking that first step felt like shedding a small piece of the weight I’d been carrying for so long.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect, or aiming for a different tone?
