## The Streaming Struggle is Real (and Frustrating!)

Okay, seriously, has anyone else been battling internet gremlins lately? I’m trying to stream some live music – a much-needed escape in 2021 – and it's been a disaster. Constant buffering, dropped packets… I’m seeing T3 timeouts pop up everywhere! Seven percent packet loss? Unacceptable! It feels like my connection is actively fighting against me. Hoping my provider can sort this out soon, because virtual concerts deserve better than this.
