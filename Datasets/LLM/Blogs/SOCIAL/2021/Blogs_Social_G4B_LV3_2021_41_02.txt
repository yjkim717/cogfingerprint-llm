**The Summer Shame**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2021 felt… exhausting. And summer, for me, was particularly brutal. It’s supposed to be this golden time of endless possibilities, right? Sunshine, beaches, carefree days. But for me, it just amplified everything. 

There was this constant pressure to *look* happy – to post those perfect Instagram shots, to radiate an effortless joy that felt completely manufactured. It triggered this awful anxiety, a little voice whispering that I was failing if I admitted I wasn't feeling it. 

I found myself fiercely guarding my vulnerability, terrified of being judged for not fitting into the summer narrative.  It was so frustrating, this feeling of needing to perform happiness.  I realized I wasn't alone in this, though. So many of us just crave genuine connection, not a flawless facade.  Maybe, just maybe, it’s okay to feel the shadows alongside the sunshine.
