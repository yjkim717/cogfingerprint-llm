## Thinking About Representation: Skin, Art, and Responsibility

Something's been on my mind lately. I’ve been sketching characters for a new project, and one of them has vitiligo. It’s a detail I really want to get right, not just aesthetically, but *responsibly*.  It's 2021, and we’re finally having more honest conversations about representation in media. I don’t want to fall into the trap of tokenism or, worse, reducing someone’s lived experience to a visual quirk.

I'm actively seeking feedback. How do we depict differences – be they physical, cultural, or anything else – with nuance and respect? Because beauty comes in *every* form, and I want to celebrate that authentically. What are your thoughts? Let’s chat in the comments!
