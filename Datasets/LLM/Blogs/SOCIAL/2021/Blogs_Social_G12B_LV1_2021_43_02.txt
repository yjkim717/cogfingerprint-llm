>## The Quiet Strength Beside Me

It's 2021, and I’ve been spending a lot of time observing my service dog, Finn. He’s my anchor, providing mobility assistance and a sense of calm I can’t quite put into words. Lately, I’ve been struck by something simple: he's still a *dog*. 

While he's diligently bracing, guiding, and alerting, he also wags his tail, nudges my hand for pets, and occasionally lets out a contented sigh. It makes me wonder, how does he balance this incredible focus with the need for doggy decompression? Does he build up a “dog energy” debt? Watching him, I realize his strength isn't just about physical support, but about the constant, quiet resilience of being both helper and happy companion.
