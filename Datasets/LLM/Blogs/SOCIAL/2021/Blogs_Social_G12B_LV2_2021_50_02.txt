**Title: The Marathon Movie & Our Shorter Attention Spans**

Remember when a long movie felt…epic? Lately, I've been thinking about films pushing past the 2.5-hour mark, especially those that *also* rack up huge box office numbers – like *Ford v Ferrari* did a few years back. It’s fascinating, isn't it?

In 2021, with endless scrolling and notifications buzzing constantly, can we *really* commit to a three-hour cinematic experience? It feels like our attention spans are shrinking.  We're conditioned for quick hits, for instant gratification. Yet, these longer films, these immersive worlds, still draw crowds. 

Maybe it's a craving for something deeper, a desire to disconnect from the digital noise, even for a little while. Or perhaps, we’re just willing to invest in a story we *really* believe in. What do *you* think? Are you up for a cinematic marathon, or do you prefer your entertainment in bite-sized pieces?
