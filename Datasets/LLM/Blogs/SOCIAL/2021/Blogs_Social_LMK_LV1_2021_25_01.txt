"As I sat surrounded by my retro gaming collection in 2021, I had an epiphany - why not breathe new life into my old GBA, GBC, and GB games? I started experimenting with Gamecube cases, thinking they could be repurposed into custom cases for my beloved handhelds. With Blender, a free 3D editing software, I began designing and tweaking the cases to fit my needs. It's been a fun journey, merging nostalgia with creativity. Who knew preserving gaming memories could be so social, inspiring others to get crafty with their own retro gaming collections?"
