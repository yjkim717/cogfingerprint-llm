The bell above the market door jingles differently now. It’s been a week since Mrs. Gable’s usual Tuesday visit, and the quiet in her absence is a heavy, tangible thing.

In 2021, when so many of our interactions were reduced to screens and transactions, our little neighborhood market became an anchor. Mrs. Gable wasn't just a customer; she was the person who always asked about my son’s science project, whose eyes crinkled when she laughed. We shared a small, consistent slice of life.

Her passing has left a profound void, a stark reminder that these daily, seemingly minor connections are the very fabric of our community. It’s in these small exchanges—the asking, the remembering, the showing up—that we build something real. We weren't just selling groceries; we were tending to the human spirit. And I never realized how much I relied on her light until it was gone.
