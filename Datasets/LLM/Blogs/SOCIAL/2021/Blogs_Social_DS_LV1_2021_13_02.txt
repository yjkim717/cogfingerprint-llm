### My Plant-Based Pantry Adventure

Navigating the grocery aisles in 2021, my mission was clear: find satisfying vegetarian staples. I’d heard great things about Lightlife, so I decided to build my weekly menu around their products. I grabbed the savory tempeh for stir-fries, the hearty grounds for taco night, and some surprisingly delicious meatballs and breakfast sausage patties (I made a note to skip their other sausage links and bacon). It’s amazing how these simple swaps have made my kitchen feel so much more creative and vibrant.
