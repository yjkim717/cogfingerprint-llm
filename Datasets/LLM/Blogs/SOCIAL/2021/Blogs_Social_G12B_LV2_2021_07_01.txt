Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions and the provided summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable, and conversational tone, set in 2021.  I've focused on the social aspect, drawing some inspiration from the "lack of motivation/engagement" angle.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: The Echo Chamber & the Quiet Spark**

Remember back in 2021, when we were all *really* online? Scrolling felt like a full-time job. I realized something unsettling: my feed was just… echoing. Same opinions, same jokes, the same curated version of everyone’s lives. It was comfortable, sure, but increasingly, it felt like it was dimming my own spark.

I started noticing a strange apathy creeping in. Not just towards big goals, but even towards things I *used* to enjoy. I think it was the constant validation loop, the lack of genuine challenge.  It's easy to get lulled into a feeling of knowing-it-all when everyone around you seems to agree.

Stepping away – even for a few hours – made a difference. Suddenly, I remembered the joy of *discovering* something new, of wrestling with an idea, instead of just nodding along. It was a reminder that true engagement comes from pushing beyond the echo. Anyone else felt this?
