Remember those late-night fanfiction rabbit holes in 2021? I was hunting for a story where James used Polyjuice to be Remus on patrol with Lily. It’s funny—we weren’t just reading; we were building connections, sharing theories, and feeling less alone in our obsessions. That search for a forgotten fic? It was really about finding our people in the digital pages.
