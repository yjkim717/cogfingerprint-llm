's response:## The Concede Button and My Rocket League Rage

Okay, so I need to vent. Anyone else playing Rocket League noticing a serious shift in the vibe lately? They swapped out the "Vote to Forfeit" button for "Vote to Concede" in a recent update, and honestly, it's making casual matches *way* more toxic.

I get the logic – conceding feels more decisive, right? But instead of a quick, respectful exit when a game's clearly lost, now you've got salty players berating teammates who dare suggest it. It's supposed to be casual! A place to learn and goof around. Now it’s just an arena for frustrated keyboard warriors. 

It’s a small change, sure, but it’s amplified a problem already simmering in online gaming. Makes you wonder how these little design choices impact player psychology, doesn’t it? Just my two cents. Anyone else feeling the burn?
