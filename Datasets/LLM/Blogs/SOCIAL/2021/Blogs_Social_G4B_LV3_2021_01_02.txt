**The Sudden Silence in Rocket League**

Remember when Rocket League was just… fun? A chaotic, joyful mess of cars and goals? I spent a good chunk of 2021 lost in those casual matches, laughing with friends, even when we were losing spectacularly. But this recent update felt different. Removing the option to just *leave* a game? It felt like a punch to the gut. 

It’s more than just frustration, though. It’s a little unsettling how quickly these changes can breed toxicity. When you can’t gracefully bow out, the pressure mounts, and the good vibes vanish. It makes you wonder if we’re losing sight of what truly makes a game enjoyable – connection, not competition.
