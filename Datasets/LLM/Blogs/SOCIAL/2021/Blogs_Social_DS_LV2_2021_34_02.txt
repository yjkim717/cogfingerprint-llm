The beige walls of the ER felt like they were closing in. The doctor had just called her concussion “mild,” but my girlfriend was pale, her words slightly slurred. She’d lost consciousness in the crash.

I felt a knot of doubt tighten in my chest. Is "mild" just a word they use when they don't have all the answers? I’d spent 2021 learning to trust science, but in that moment, my gut screamed louder than any medical degree. I asked for the neurology consult, my voice trembling.

It’s a terrifying lesson in love and advocacy. Sometimes, being a partner means being the one who speaks up when the person you love can’t find the words. You become their voice, their shield, even when you’re shaking.
