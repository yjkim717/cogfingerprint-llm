## Trapped in the Arena: When Games Stop Being Fun

Anyone else feeling a little…stuck lately? Not just in the general 2021 vibe, but in video games? I’ve been playing Rocket League to unwind after work, and a recent update has really soured the experience. They took away the vote to concede. Seriously.

Before, if you were stuck with a teammate actively throwing, or just a complete toxic player ruining the match, you could vote to end it early. Now? You’re forced to grind through, absorbing the negativity and feeling utterly powerless.

It's more than just losing. It’s the feeling of being trapped.  It's messing with the whole flow of casual play.  I'm learning the game less, too – who wants to experiment when you're just bracing for abuse?  It feels like they prioritized some warped sense of “competitive integrity” over player wellbeing. 

I get wanting to encourage perseverance, but there's a difference between learning to overcome challenges and enduring needless toxicity.  Anyone else share this frustration?  Maybe I'm just venting, but I miss that option to just…escape.
