As I navigated the grocery store aisles in 2021, my plant-based lifestyle led me to discover innovative products like Lightlife's grounds, meatballs, and tempeh. I was drawn to these convenient, veggie-packed options that fit my vegetarian diet. Experimenting with tempeh recipes and vegan meals, I found it easier than ever to stick to my dietary choices while exploring new flavors. It was liberating to see so many options available, making my vegan journey feel more inclusive than ever.
