"As a hotel housekeeper, I've seen it all - or so I thought. Recently, I encountered a room that left me speechless. A family's mess was more than just clutter; it was a reflection of their disregard for others. The parents seemed to have abandoned all sense of responsibility, leaving their kids to run wild. Toys, trash, and broken items littered the floor, while the bathroom looked like a war zone. What struck me most was the intentional destruction - it was as if they had deliberately set out to trash the room. As I cleaned up the chaos, I couldn't help but wonder: what are we teaching our children? In 2021, it's disheartening to see families prioritizing convenience over consideration for others. Let's take a step back and reflect on our behavior - not just in hotels, but at home too."
