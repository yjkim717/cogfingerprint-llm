**Lost in Translation: Naruto & the Power of the Unexpected**

Okay, so 2021 was *weird*, right? Scrolling through TikTok felt like a constant barrage of the same trends. But then I stumbled across this creator obsessed with Naruto – specifically, the *side characters*. Seriously, who else remembers little Shino’s weird insect obsession? 

It got me thinking about how easily we overlook these fascinating figures. This TikToker was building a whole community around them, and actively asking for suggestions. It’s a brilliant reminder that social media can be a fantastic way to bring forgotten stories to light, and that sometimes, the most interesting narratives are hidden just off the main path.
