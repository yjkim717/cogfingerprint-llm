## The Little Blue Dot and My Rising Anxiety

Anyone else find themselves *way* too invested in tracking packages these days? I’m currently locked in a low-grade anxiety spiral thanks to my AirTags delivery and UPS’s live map. It was supposed to be here yesterday! Seeing that little blue dot inching along, then…stopping…is surprisingly stressful. It’s just a package, I know, but in 2021, it feels like a tiny window into a world of delayed everything. Anyone else relate?
