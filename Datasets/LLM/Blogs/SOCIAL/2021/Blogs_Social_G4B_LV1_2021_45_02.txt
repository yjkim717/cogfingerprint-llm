**My Apple Watch & the Curious Case of the Washing Hands**

Okay, so I’ve been glued to my Apple Watch this year – tracking steps, notifications, the whole shebang. But recently, I stumbled upon a really weird Reddit thread. Apparently, the watch’s “handwashing detection” feature is a battery hog! Seriously, it was draining my battery *faster* than I could finish a podcast. 

I was skeptical, but desperate for a little more juice.  I turned it off, and wow – a noticeable difference. It made me think about how much we rely on these little gadgets to monitor us, and sometimes, a little digital privacy is worth a bit of battery life.  Anyone else experience this?
