**The Hum of Anxiety and a Kind Word**

Okay, so 2021 was… a lot. After a year of mostly virtual everything, getting back to in-person stuff felt huge. That’s why the fall concert with the junior band was such a big deal for me. I was *so* nervous. Seriously, my hands were shaking so badly I almost missed my cue. 

I was playing the clarinet, and I swear I was staring at my metronome like it was judging me. Then, Mr. Harrison, our band director, caught my eye. He gave me this tiny, almost imperceptible nod – a little “you’ve got this” – and it completely shifted something. 

It wasn’t about the emperata grass (we were playing a piece with a really cool percussion section!), it was about feeling connected, about trusting the music and, surprisingly, trusting the people around me. It was a simple moment, but it reminded me that sometimes, all you need is a kind word to quiet the noise.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the story?
