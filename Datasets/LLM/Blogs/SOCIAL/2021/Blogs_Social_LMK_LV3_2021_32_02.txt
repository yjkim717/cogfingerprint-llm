As I packed my bags to start a new chapter in a different city, I couldn't shake off the guilt that lingered within me. My mom's anxious eyes and worried words still echoed in my mind - "Will we lose touch?" "Will you be okay on your own?" I understood her concerns, but I also knew that this move was a necessary step towards my independence. Growing up, our close-knit family had sometimes felt suffocating, and I yearned for the freedom to forge my own path. As I navigated this bittersweet transition in 2021, I realized that my journey wasn't just about leaving home, but about finding a balance between staying connected to my loved ones and embracing my own identity. It was a delicate dance, but one that I was determined to master, even if it meant having tough conversations and setting boundaries along the way.
