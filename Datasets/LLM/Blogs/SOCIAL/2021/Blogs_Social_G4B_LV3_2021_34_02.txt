**The Weight of “What If?”**

Remember those endless scrolling sessions in 2021? We were all trying to build perfect online personas, chasing validation with every like and comment. But sometimes, that digital world felt…heavy. I found myself wrestling with a strange kind of anxiety – a constant “what if?” 

It started after a minor fender bender. A brief loss of consciousness, a jarring reminder of fragility. Suddenly, the usual social chatter felt distant. I was consumed by worry about a potential head injury, a feeling of profound uncertainty. 

It made me realize how easily we can get caught up in projecting an image, forgetting to truly connect with ourselves and seek genuine support when we need it.  It’s okay to prioritize your well-being, even if it means stepping back from the feed for a bit.
