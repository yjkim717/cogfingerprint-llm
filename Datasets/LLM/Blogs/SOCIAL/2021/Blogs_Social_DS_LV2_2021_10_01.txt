### The Silence Between the Notes: What I Learned From a Two-Week Music Detox

It’s 2021, and my headphones were practically a medical device. Walking, working, cooking, even showering—my life had a constant, curated soundtrack. As someone in the music industry, I told myself it was “research.” But my ADHD brain was using it as a constant drip-feed of stimulation, a way to buffer me from the world.

Then, I hit a wall. My creativity felt thin, my focus was shot. On a whim, I decided to try something radical: two weeks with no passive music. No playlists in the grocery store, no podcasts on my walk, no lo-fi beats while answering emails. Just silence.

The first few days were… loud. Not with sound, but with the chaotic buzz of my own thoughts. I felt every impatient moment in a queue, every dull stretch of a walk. My mind, so used to being entertained, threw a tantrum.

But around day five, a shift happened. The silence began to feel less like an absence and more like a space. I started noticing things—the rhythm of my own footsteps, the intricate melody of birdsong, the simple hum of the city. I was more present in conversations because I wasn’t already half-listening to the next song in my queue.

The most profound change, however, was how I returned to music. When the two weeks were up, I didn’t just press play on a random mix. I put on a single album, sat on my couch, and did nothing else. I was *actively listening*. I heard layers I’d never noticed, felt the emotional arc of the songs in a way I hadn't since I was a teenager. It was no longer background noise; it was an event.

This little experiment didn’t cure my ADHD, but it taught me a powerful lesson about mindfulness. In a world that encourages constant consumption, sometimes the most creative act is to create a little space. To find the music not just in the notes, but in the quiet moments in between.
