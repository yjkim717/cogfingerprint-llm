It’s funny—after years of swearing by my Mac, I finally built my first PC in 2021. I went with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and an RX 560, nothing flashy, but it felt like mine. My old G502 mouse and SteelSeries headset, once Mac accessories, found a new purpose.

Switching wasn’t just about specs; it was a leap into a world where I could tinker, upgrade, and connect with a whole community online. Sharing my build on forums, I realized how many others were on similar journeys. It’s more than a machine—it’s a shared experience, a little window into how we grow and learn together, one component at a time.
