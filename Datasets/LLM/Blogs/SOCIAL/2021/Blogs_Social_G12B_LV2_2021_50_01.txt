Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone and staying within the ~75 word limit, with a 2021 context:

## Passing the Bow: Who *is* Hawkeye Now?

Okay, so I've been totally lost in the *Hawkeye* series! It’s wild seeing Clint Barton mentor Kate Bishop. It got me thinking – how often do we see legacy characters really take the reins? It’s more than just a changing of the guard; it’s about finding a new heart for a familiar story. Anyone else feeling this shift in the Marvel universe?



Hope this fits what you were looking for! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
