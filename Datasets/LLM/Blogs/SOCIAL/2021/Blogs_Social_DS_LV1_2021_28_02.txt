### My First Real PC: More Than Just Specs

It’s 2021, and after a year of feeling more disconnected than ever, I finally pulled the trigger. My new PC isn’t a top-tier monster, but it’s mine: a Ryzen 5 3600 humming on a B450 board, paired with my trusty old RX 560.

The real magic happened when I powered on my secondhand AOC G2 monitor. Suddenly, video calls with friends weren’t just tiny boxes on a laptop screen; they were vibrant, shared windows. Hopping into games, my G502 mouse in hand, became our new digital park—a place to laugh and connect. This machine, a collection of parts, has unexpectedly become my most vital social tool, rebuilding the casual togetherness I’d been missing.
