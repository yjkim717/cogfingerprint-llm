**The Strange Silence of the Wi-Fi**

Remember 2021? We were *all* online. Zoom calls, endless scrolling, desperate attempts to find a decent signal while working from home – it felt like the entire world lived within our screens.  I was constantly battling my own little tech frustrations, actually.  Like that time my internet was crawling, despite having a shiny new router and a premium plan. It was maddening. 

It felt like a metaphor, honestly. I’d be connecting with friends, laughing at memes, but there was this underlying…silence. A disconnect.  It made me think about how easily we can mistake *being* online for actually *being* present. 

Sometimes, the best connection isn’t through a cable or a Wi-Fi signal.  Maybe it’s about putting down the phone and really listening, or stepping away from the screen to just...be.  Anyone else feel like they needed a digital detox sometimes?

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different length?
