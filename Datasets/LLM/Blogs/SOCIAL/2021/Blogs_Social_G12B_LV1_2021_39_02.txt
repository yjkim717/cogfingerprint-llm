## The Dog Park Dilemma & Rosie's Slow Progress

Okay, so I'm officially admitting defeat (for now) on the dog park front. We got Rosie, our English Mastiff, about six months ago, and I was *so* excited to finally take her to a dog park. Visions of happy, romping dogs and a well-socialized Rosie danced in my head. Reality? Not quite.

Rosie’s a sweetheart with *our* dog, a bouncy terrier mix. They’re practically glued together. But introduce her to a gaggle of other dogs, and she freezes. Like, full-on statue mode. Then, usually, a slow, anxious retreat. It’s heartbreaking to watch.

We've tried a few visits, keeping her on a long leash, just observing. Some dogs ignore her, which is good, but others… well, let's just say their enthusiastic greetings aren’t exactly calming for a gentle giant like Rosie. 

I'm realizing dog parks aren't a one-size-fits-all solution.  It's clear Rosie needs a much slower, more controlled socialization plan. Maybe smaller groups, or even just one-on-one introductions.  It's frustrating, for sure, but her comfort is the priority. This whole experience is a good reminder that every dog learns at their own pace, especially a big, sensitive one like Rosie. Wish us luck!
