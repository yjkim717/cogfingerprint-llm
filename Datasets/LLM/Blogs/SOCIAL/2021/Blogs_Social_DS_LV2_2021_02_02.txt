### The Day My Seamoth Vanished

So, there I was in 2021, deep in a VR session of Subnautica, utterly absorbed. My trusty Seamoth—my underwater golf cart and mobile safe space—was my pride and joy. I parked it near some ominous-looking writhing weeds, went to scan a fragment, and turned around to… nothing. Just empty, blue, terrifying water.

My first instinct? Blame the game. “Classic Subnautica glitch,” I muttered, a familiar frustration bubbling up. It’s easy to point fingers at the code, at some faceless bug. It’s the digital equivalent of kicking a vending machine.

But then I saw it. A haunting, sinuous shadow retreating into the kelp. A Crabsnake. The truth hit me harder than a Reaper Leviathan’s charge. It wasn’t a glitch. It was the ecosystem. The game world had simply… reacted.

It was a weirdly profound gaming moment. It made me reflect on how often we blame abstract “glitches” in our own lives—systems, fate, bad luck—when sometimes, the cause is a tangible, if unexpected, consequence of our own actions. I parked in a snake’s living room. I learned a hard, wet lesson about respect.
