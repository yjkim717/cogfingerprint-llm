"Rediscovering Music: A Journey of Intentional Listening"

As I reflect on my relationship with music in 2021, I'm reminded of the significant role it plays in shaping my productivity, focus, and creativity. For years, music has been the constant companion to my daily tasks, from working out to working on projects. However, I began to wonder: was I truly listening to music, or was it just background noise? To explore this, I embarked on a two-week experiment - I stopped listening to music passively.

The results were striking. By being more intentional with my music listening, I found that I was more focused on the tasks at hand. Without the constant distraction of background melodies, I was able to dive deeper into my work, and my mindfulness increased. I also started to appreciate music on a different level; I listened to albums from start to finish, savoring each note and lyric. This newfound appreciation led to more meaningful music experiences, and I discovered artists and genres I had previously overlooked.

As a sound engineer, this experiment also influenced my own music creations. While I had always drawn inspiration from a wide range of sources, I noticed that my scope of inspiration had narrowed. I was no longer influenced by everything I heard; instead, I was more discerning, and the music I created became more authentic. My journey of intentional listening taught me that sometimes, it's necessary to step back and reevaluate our habits. By doing so, we can cultivate a deeper connection with the things that matter to us, like music.
