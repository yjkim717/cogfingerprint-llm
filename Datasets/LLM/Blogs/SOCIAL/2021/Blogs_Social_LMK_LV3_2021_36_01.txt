Revisiting the Marauders' era through fanfiction is a nostalgic trip. I'm on the hunt for an old Harry Potter story from Fanfiction.net that captured James and Remus' bond. As I scour the archives, I'm reminded of how fandoms bring people together. In 2021, it's amazing to see how fanfiction continues to be a creative outlet, allowing fans to reimagine and share their love for beloved characters, fostering a sense of community.
