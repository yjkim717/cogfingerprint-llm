Looking back at 2021, when connection felt so fragile, I decided to use my camera to bridge the gap. I offered free portraits in the Katy area, not just to build my portfolio, but to capture the resilience and quiet hope in my neighbors' eyes. It was a powerful reminder that we build community one genuine moment at a time.
