## Will We Look Back and Cringe?

It's 2021, and social media is… well, it's *everything*, right? We scroll, we post, we compare. But lately, I’ve been having this nagging feeling. A little voice whispering, "Will we look back on this someday and cringe?" 

I think about how our grandparents viewed smoking – once cool, now universally recognized as damaging. Could social media be heading for a similar shift in perception? The constant highlight reels, the pressure to project a perfect image, the negativity… it all takes a toll on mental health. 

Maybe in the future, we'll see these platforms not as essential connections, but as a chapter of history we’re glad to have moved past. A time when we prioritized genuine connection over curated online personas. Food for thought, right?
