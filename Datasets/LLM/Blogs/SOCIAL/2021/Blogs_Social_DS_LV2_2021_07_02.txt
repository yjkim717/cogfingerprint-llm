Remember back in 2021, when we were all tentatively stepping back into the world? My friend decided a nose piercing was her symbol of renewal. It felt like more than just a sparkly stud; it was a shared act of reclaiming our personal space and style after so much isolation. Helping her find an APP-certified piercer in St. Catharines wasn't just a favorâ€”it was part of the journey back to ourselves, one small, golden horseshoe at a time.
