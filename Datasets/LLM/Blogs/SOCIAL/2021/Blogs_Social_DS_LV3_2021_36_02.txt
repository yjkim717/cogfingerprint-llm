You know what pulls me right out of a New York City TV show in 2021? The magical, traffic-free cross-town cab ride. As someone who’s spent the last year cautiously re-entering the world, the commute has become a central character in my own life story.

I remember one Tuesday, heading from Brooklyn to the Upper East Side for a long-awaited coffee with a friend. The show in my head had me gliding seamlessly underground. Reality? A stalled F train, a frantic above-ground scramble for a Citi Bike, and arriving 40 minutes late, flustered and apologizing.

Our commutes are packed with these tiny, frustrating dramas—the unexpected delays, the crowded platforms, the sheer logistical grit. That’s the real, unglamorous connective tissue of city life. When TV glosses over this universal struggle, it misses a chance to truly reflect our shared, relatable experience. The journey is half the story.
