As an artist in 2021, I’m exploring how to depict characters with vitiligo in my work. It’s a delicate balance—I want to celebrate their unique aesthetic without reducing them to a trend or offending those who live with it. My goal is to create art that feels authentic and respectful, honoring real experiences while sparking meaningful conversations about beauty and representation.
