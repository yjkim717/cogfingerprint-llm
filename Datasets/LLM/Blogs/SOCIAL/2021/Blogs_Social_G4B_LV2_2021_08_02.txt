Okay, here's a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 235 words, set in 2021:

**The Stain That Just Wouldn't Budge (And a Tiny Dose of Rage)**

Okay, let me tell you about something that happened to me last summer. I was a hotel housekeeper at a pretty busy resort – you know, the kind where families cram in for a week-long vacation. And honestly, I was *exhausted*. Not just from the physical labor, but from the… well, the chaos. 

I’m not going to lie, there were days I just wanted to scream. I’d walk into a room, meticulously cleaned just an hour before, and it would look like a small-scale hurricane had ripped through it. Crumpled snacks, sticky juice spills, toys *everywhere* – and the worst part? It was almost always left by parents and kids who seemed utterly oblivious to the effort it took to keep things presentable.

Last month, I found something particularly unsettling. Hidden under a pile of blankets in a kids’ room, was a half-eaten crayon and a note scrawled in crayon: “Don’t clean!” It wasn’t the mess itself that hit me, but the *tone* of it. It felt…toxic. Like a little kid had internalized a sense of entitlement and a lack of respect. 

It made me think about parenting, about the pressure we put on each other to be perfect, and how sometimes, that pressure just gets passed down, creating a cycle of frustration.  It’s a tiny thing, a crayon and a note, but it really stuck with me.  Has anyone else experienced something similar? Let’s talk about it.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a particular aspect (like the “toxic parenting” element)?
