## The Scroll and the Sigh: Navigating Fibro & Feeling Seen

It's 2021, and my feed is *full* of wellness trends. But honestly, sometimes I just need real talk. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with fibromyalgia pain, and the constant low-grade ache can be…a lot. I'm trying to explore medication options with my doctor, but I also have a history of liver sensitivity, so it’s a careful dance. It’s frustrating feeling like you have to be a medical researcher alongside a patient.  Scrolling through forums, I've realized so many of us are in the same boat, just seeking understanding and a little less pain. It's comforting, knowing I'm not alone in this search.



Hopefully, this meets your request! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
