As a third-year BSN student in 2021, I found myself wondering how to land a PCT job despite lacking direct healthcare experience. With a strong GPA and solid work history, I felt confident, but the lack of healthcare background made me uncertain. I began to seek advice from peers and professionals, and soon discovered that highlighting transferable skills, tailoring my resume, and being open to entry-level positions were key. By sharing my journey, I hope to help fellow nursing students navigate the challenge of breaking into healthcare with little to no prior experience.
