### The Great Commute Compromise

I remember sitting in my tiny apartment in early 2021, the four walls feeling like they were closing in. The "work-from-home" dream had started to feel more like a trap, and I was desperate for a change. A place of my own. A condo.

So, like any sane person, I started browsing listings. My heart would leap at a beautiful, modern one-bedroom… and then plummet when I saw the price. It was the same story, over and over. Anything in my city’s vibrant, walkable neighborhoods—the places with the coffee shops and parks that had kept me sane during lockdown—was astronomically out of reach.

Then, my real estate app, ever the "helpful" optimist, started showing me "Great Value!" alerts. I’d click, and there they were: spacious, beautiful, and genuinely affordable condos. The catch? They were in distant suburban towns I’d only ever heard of in traffic reports.

It felt like the universe was offering me a cruel choice: my financial future or my daily life. Did I want to own a home, or did I want to have a life outside of it? A 90-minute commute, one-way, was the price of admission for affordability. After a year where time itself felt so precious, the idea of willingly giving up three hours of it every day to sit in a car felt like a special kind of madness.

This isn’t just a personal frustration; it’s a social one. We’re creating cities where teachers, baristas, and artists—the people who give a community its soul—can’t afford to live in them. We’re forced to choose between being house-poor in the city or time-poor in the suburbs. In 2021, more than ever, that just feels like a broken system.
