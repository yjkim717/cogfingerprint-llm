**The Weight of Unfinished Stories**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How something you loved so deeply can suddenly become… painful? Last year, I was completely obsessed with *Berserk*. Kentaro Miura’s world, Guts’ struggles, the sheer artistry – it consumed me. Then, the news hit. And everything shifted. 

I tried to go back, to lose myself in the familiar darkness, but it was impossible. Every panel, every line of dialogue, felt tainted with a profound sadness. It wasn't just grief for the artist; it was a strange, unsettling guilt. Like I was intruding on a story that was abruptly cut short, a conversation left unfinished. 

I think a lot of us felt this way after the announcement. A shared sense of loss, of wondering what *could* have been.  It made me think about how we connect with art – it’s not just entertainment, it’s a relationship. And sometimes, those relationships end in ways that leave you carrying a little bit of their weight.

Would you like me to refine this further, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
