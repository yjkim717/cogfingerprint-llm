As I watched the latest episode of My600lbLife, I couldn't help but wonder: why do some individuals on the show rush through grocery shopping when they could order online? In 2021, with the pandemic still looming, it made me think about the social stigma surrounding obesity. Is it a fear of being judged or pitied in public? Or is it a desire to maintain some sense of normalcy? Whatever the reason, it's clear that grocery shopping can be a daunting task for those struggling with their weight, and it's worth considering the emotional toll it takes.
