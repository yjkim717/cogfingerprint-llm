### The Unseen Toll of a Messy Room

I’ve seen it all in my years as a hotel housekeeper. Spilled juice, sand in the sheets—it comes with the territory of hospitality. But last week, I unlocked a room that stopped me in my tracks.

It wasn't just messy; it was a statement. Food was smeared on the walls, furniture was knocked over, and right there, in the middle of the floor, were dirty diapers. But the worst part was the message, scrawled in what I hope was lipstick on the mirror: "You clean this."

My first reaction was a hot flash of anger. Who treats another person’s workspace—their livelihood—with such blatant disrespect? But as I stood there, the anger cooled into a heavy sadness. In a world still reeling in 2021, where we’re all craving a little more kindness and understanding, this felt like a deliberate act of dehumanization.

It’s a stark reminder that behind every "service" role is a person. We’re the invisible workforce that makes your escape possible. A simple "thank you" or just not going out of your way to make our day harder… that’s the real luxury, and it costs nothing at all.
