It’s 2021, and my TikTok feed is a sea of Naruto runs and Rasengan clips. But I’ve been craving something deeper—something beyond the usual heroes. So, I started digging into the series’ dusty corners, unearthing characters like Iruka-sensei and the underrated Shino.

It hit me then: we’re all a bit like these sub-characters, aren’t we? Not always in the spotlight, but full of untold stories. Sharing their journeys felt like connecting with strangers who also see themselves in the background. In a year when we were all searching for connection, these forgotten ninjas became my bridge to a community that gets it. Funny how a little character research can turn into something so meaningful.
