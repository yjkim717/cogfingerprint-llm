The Mask I Wear: Uncovering the Intersection of Makeup and Mental Health

As I sit in front of the mirror, applying my daily layer of makeup, I'm reminded of the contradictions that come with living with depression and anxiety. To the outside world, my perfectly contoured face and bold lip color scream "I've got it all together!" But the truth is, some days it's a struggle to get out of bed. I've often been told that my self-care habits - like my morning makeup routine - contradict the severity of my mental health struggles. People assume that because I take care of my appearance, I must be "fine." But the reality is, those small acts of self-care are often what get me through the darkest days. In 2021, it's time to break the stigma surrounding mental health and acknowledge that it's okay to not be okay, even with a full face of makeup. By sharing my story, I hope to show that mental health is complex, and that it's time to stop judging a book by its cover.
