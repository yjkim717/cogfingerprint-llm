It’s been months since Kentaro Miura’s passing, and I still can’t bring myself to watch *Berserk*. My watchlist is right there, but every time I hover over it, a wave of guilt washes over me.

It’s not just about finding the time or motivation; it feels strangely final. Starting the anime now means truly accepting that there will be no more of his story, no new chapters born from his incredible vision. The fandom’s collective grief is palpable online, and in a way, not watching has been my own quiet tribute—a delay of that painful acknowledgment.

Maybe one day I’ll be ready. But for now, the screen stays dark, and that’s okay. I think he’d understand.
