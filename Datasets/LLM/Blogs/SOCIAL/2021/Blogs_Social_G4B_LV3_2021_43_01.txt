**The Invisible Load**

It’s funny how much of what we carry around isn’t visible to anyone else. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about the quiet, unspoken pressures in our relationships, and it really crystallized when my wife, Sarah, came back from a fantastic – and much-deserved – maternity leave. 

Honestly, the relief on her face was incredible, but it was quickly followed by this subtle shift. Suddenly, she was juggling everything with a focused intensity I hadn’t seen before. It struck me – and it’s something I’ve noticed more and more in my own social circles – that the ‘reward system’ in our society often feels wildly uneven. 

Sarah’s generous maternity leave was fantastic, of course. But it meant a massive shift in household responsibilities, and I realized I hadn't truly *seen* the extra workload she was taking on. It felt like a quiet inequity, a silent expectation that she’d seamlessly absorb the change. 

We’re talking about burnout, aren’t we? The slow, insidious kind that creeps up when you feel unseen and undervalued. It made me think about how we talk about "workload" – it’s rarely a shared conversation. 

It’s 2021, and we *know* better. We know that supporting each other, especially during big life changes like parenthood, requires a conscious effort. Let’s start shining a light on these invisible loads, acknowledging the contributions everyone makes, and building systems that actually recognize and value them.  What’s one small way you can do that this week?
