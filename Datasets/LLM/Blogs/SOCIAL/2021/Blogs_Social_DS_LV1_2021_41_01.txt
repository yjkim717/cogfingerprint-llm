### The Pancake That Saved My Sanity

Remember 2021? We were all still glued to our screens, trying to figure out this new hybrid life. My social life had become a series of pixelated happy hours, and I was desperately missing those lazy weekend brunches with friends. The kind with real laughter and a stack of warm pancakes.

One Sunday, feeling the weight of the isolation, I decided to bake for just myself. I mashed a banana, mixed in some oats, and made a single, simple batch of pancakes. On a whim, I froze the leftovers.

That small act of "meal prep" became a tiny revolution. On a rushed Tuesday morning between back-to-back Zoom calls, I could pop a frozen pancake in the toaster. In two minutes, I had a warm, wholesome breakfast. More than that, I had a small moment of care—for my body, with the clear nutrition I was giving it, and for my spirit.

It was a powerful reminder that in a world that felt so disconnected, the simplest acts of nurturing ourselves—knowing what we’re eating, giving ourselves a warm, easy meal—can be the very things that keep us grounded and connected to a feeling of normalcy. Sometimes, community starts with caring for the one person right in front of you.
