### The Map is Blank and That's Okay

I had a moment in late 2021, sitting at my kitchen table, where I just… stopped. My to-do list was full, my calendar was booked, but I felt completely empty. I was going through the motions—work, social media, the occasional socially-distanced hangout—but it all felt like a series of tasks, not a life. The big question "What am I *actually* doing with my life?" was a constant, low hum in the back of my mind.

I was stuck on a hamster wheel, running just to stay in place, terrified of looking up and realizing I had no idea where the wheel was even headed. The future felt like a blank map, and I was too afraid to draw the first line in case I chose the wrong direction.

The turning point wasn't a lightning bolt of passion. It was a quiet decision to stop looking for one giant purpose. Instead, I started paying attention to the small things that made me feel a flicker of energy. A five-minute conversation that left me energized. A small project that made me lose track of time. I started collecting these moments like clues.

I’m learning that direction isn’t something you find fully formed. You build it, one small, intentional choice at a time. The map is still mostly blank, and that’s okay. Now, I see it not as a void, but as a space of possibility.
