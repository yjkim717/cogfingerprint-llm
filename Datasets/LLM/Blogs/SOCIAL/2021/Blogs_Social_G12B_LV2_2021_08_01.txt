Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for that relatable, reflective tone and fitting within the 2021 timeframe.

## Is My Face Just…Melancholy?

Okay, serious question: does anyone else realize they have a default facial expression that just screams "slightly disappointed"? I only recently clocked that I might have a "resting sad face." Like, I’m genuinely relaxed, just scrolling through Instagram (as one does in 2021), and my face looks…downcast. 

It’s a little unsettling! I wonder if people assume I’m constantly judging them. Maybe I need a permanent smile-training course? Or just, you know, actively think happy thoughts. Anyone else battling a perpetually gloomy visage? Let’s commiserate!




Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
