**That First Rush**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 felt… strange, right? Like we were all trying to figure out how to *do* social again after a long, quiet pause. I had a mini-moment of that last month, actually, tied to a really bizarre memory.

I was at my high school's fall concert – my *first* concert in, like, forever. Seriously, it had been ages. The band director, Mr. Henderson, was practically vibrating with nervous energy. And me? I was a mess. It was a total blur of flashing lights and a thousand faces, but honestly, the biggest thing was the feeling – that overwhelming rush of sound and energy. I even remember thinking, “lingling40hrs” – a ridiculous, panicked thought about all the practice. 

It wasn't perfect, but it was *mine*. A tiny, beautiful reminder that sometimes, just showing up is enough.
