As I scrolled through my social media feed in 2021, I couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt. Everyone seemed to be starting their day with a nutritious breakfast, and I was over here grabbing a quick coffee on-the-go. But then I stumbled upon a simple recipe for oat banana pancakes that changed everything. Not only were they delicious, but they were also low in calories and packed with fiber. I started making a batch every Sunday and portioning them out for the week ahead - a game-changer for meal prep. As I shared my newfound love on social media, I was inspired by the community that followed. Friends and family began to share their own healthy breakfast hacks, and soon we were all motivating each other to start the day on a healthier note. It's amazing how a simple recipe can bring people together and spark a positive change.
