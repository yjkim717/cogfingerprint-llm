"The Gluten-Free Enforcer: When Health Meets Frustration"

As I stood in line at the university dining hall in the fall of 2021, I couldn't help but notice the student worker behind the counter scrutinizing every dish that passed through. She was on a mission to enforce the gluten-free protocol to the letter, and it was clear that she took her job very seriously. While I understood the importance of accommodating students with gluten intolerance or celiac disease, I began to feel a growing sense of frustration as I watched her interact with customers.

It started with a young woman who had carefully selected a salad, only to be told that the utensils used to prepare it might have come into contact with gluten. The student worker was adamant that she couldn't guarantee the dish was gluten-free, and the customer was sent away, looking disappointed. I watched as this scenario played out multiple times, with the student worker becoming increasingly rigid in her enforcement.

As I reflected on what I was witnessing, I realized that this wasn't just about gluten-free diets; it was about the motivations behind them. Some customers were choosing gluten-free options because they had a medical necessity, while others were simply following the latest health trend. The student worker, however, seemed to be treating everyone the same, without regard for their individual circumstances.

I couldn't help but wonder if this "malicious compliance" was really serving anyone's best interests. Was the student worker truly helping students with gluten intolerance, or was she simply creating a culture of fear and frustration around food? As I left the dining hall, I couldn't shake the feeling that we need to find a balance between accommodating dietary needs and respecting individual choices. Perhaps it's time for a more nuanced approach, one that takes into account the diverse motivations and needs of our campus community. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and compassionate environment, where everyone feels welcome and supported.
