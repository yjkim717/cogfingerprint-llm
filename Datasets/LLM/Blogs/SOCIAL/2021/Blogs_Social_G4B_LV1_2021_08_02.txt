**The Weight of Sticky Fingers and Lego**

Okay, real talk. I’ve been doing some thinking lately, and it’s circling back to a really strange experience I had a few months ago working as a housekeeper at The Grandview Hotel. I’d worked in hospitality for years, seen a *lot* of things, but this… this was different.

It started with a family – a mom, a dad, and two kids, a boy and a girl, around six and eight. They were lovely enough, polite, but the room? It was a disaster. Not just a little messy – a full-blown archaeological dig of discarded Cheerios, half-built Lego castles, and what I swear was a dried-out marker explosion. 

Honestly, I felt a surge of frustration I hadn’t anticipated. It wasn't about the work, it was about the *expectation* that I should just… clean it up. Like, seriously? These were parents, responsible for their kids, yet the room was a testament to chaos. 

I started wondering about the pressure we put on ourselves to maintain a perfect facade, especially when it comes to family life. As a society, we seem to expect families to be effortlessly charming and tidy, while simultaneously judging them when they aren’t. It felt a little unfair. Maybe a little empathy for the sticky fingers and the building blocks is in order. 

What about you? Have you ever encountered a situation that made you pause and think about expectations?
