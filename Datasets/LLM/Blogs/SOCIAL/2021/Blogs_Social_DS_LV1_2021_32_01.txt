### The Hardest Peace I’ve Ever Made

It’s 2021, and the world is having a collective conversation about boundaries. We’re setting them with work, with social plans, and with energy drainers. But for me, the most monumental boundary I’ve ever drawn isn’t with a job or a flaky friend. It’s with the two people who are supposed to be my safe harbor: my parents.

I’ve decided to go no contact.

Just typing that feels like a seismic event. There’s a cultural script we’re all handed: family is everything. You forgive. You forget. You show up for holidays and smile through the gritted teeth. For years, I followed that script, playing the part of the dutiful child returning to a home that felt less like a sanctuary and more like a minefield.

The problem was, our household wasn’t built on love; it was built on a foundation of eggshells. A childhood punctuated not by scraped knees and laughter, but by walking on those eggshells, trying to predict and placate a narcissistic parent’s moods. A compliment could be withdrawn in an instant, replaced by a cutting remark designed to keep me small. My achievements were their trophies; my failures, my solitary shame. It was a constant, low-grade emotional static—a toxicity so normalized I didn’t even have a word for it until I moved out and realized other people’s families didn’t operate on a currency of guilt and manipulation.

The decision to finally step away wasn’t born from one explosive fight. It was the quiet, crushing weight of a thousand memories. It was the realization, during a global pandemic that forced us all to slow down, that my own mental health was buckling under the strain of trying to earn a love that was always conditional.

This isn’t an act of vengeance. It’s an act of survival. It’s me finally choosing the scared kid I was over the parents who couldn’t see past their own reflections. It’s the hardest peace I’ve ever had to make—a peace that looks, from the outside, like a war. But for the first time, the silence in my own life isn’t tense or fearful. It’s just… quiet. And in that quiet, I’m finally learning what it means to heal.
