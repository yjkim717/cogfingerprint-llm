**The Quiet Buzz of a Service Dog’s Energy**

It’s funny, isn’t it? As a wheelchair user with Gus, my golden retriever service dog, I spend so much time focused on *my* needs – the ramps, the accessible restrooms, the rest. But lately, I've been noticing something else: Gus’s energy. He’s a whirlwind of happy tail wags and insistent nudges, especially when we’re out. 

It’s a reminder that he needs social interaction too, and that my rest shouldn't mean ignoring his.  It’s a delicate balance, really, but a rewarding one. 2021 has taught me that caring for someone means caring for *them* completely.

Would you like me to refine this further, or perhaps explore a slightly different angle?
