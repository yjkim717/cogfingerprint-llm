It’s 2021, and I’m thinking about how we used to gather for those epic, long movies like *Ford v Ferrari* or *Avengers: Endgame*. In a time when streaming shortened our attention spans, those films brought us together in dark theaters, sharing a collective experience. It wasn’t just about the runtime or box office numbers—it was about connection. Now, as we slowly re-emerge, I wonder: will we still make time for stories that demand our full presence, or have we lost that shared magic?
