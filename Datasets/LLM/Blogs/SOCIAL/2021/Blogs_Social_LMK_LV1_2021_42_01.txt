As I stood in my front yard this weekend, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread wash over me. My neighbor, who's been trying to get approval to open a night club, just got the green light to cut down not one, not two, but several 100-year-old trees on his property to build a massive parking lot. I'm not opposed to progress, but this feels like a slap in the face to our quiet neighborhood. The noise, the traffic, the disruption to our community - it's all going to be amplified with this new development. I've lived in this neighborhood for 10 years and have loved watching families grow and children play in the front yards. The thought of it being overrun with club-goers is heartbreaking. Can't we find a balance between growth and preservation? It's 2021, and you'd think we'd be getting smarter about preserving our community's character, not sacrificing it for a quick buck.
