### That Time My Subconscious Gave Me a Pet Kangaroo

I had the weirdest dream last night. You know the kind—the one that feels so vivid you’re still trying to shake it off hours after your coffee. In it, I was somehow strong-armed into adopting a pet. Not a cute golden retriever or a aloof cat, but a full-grown, aggressively territorial kangaroo.

Let’s call him Kevin. Kevin was a nightmare. He had a look in his eye that said he’d rather box than cuddle, and he made it his mission to redecorate my backyard with his powerful hind legs. The chaos quickly spilled over the fence. Mailboxes were flattened, carefully curated flower beds were pulverized, and the sound of my neighbors’ exasperated sighs became the soundtrack to my life.

My 2021-brain, still fresh with the memory of staying in and trying to control the uncontrollable, went into full-on fortress mode. I dreamed up an elaborate security system worthy of a spy movie. Motion sensors, cameras feeding to my phone, and a sleek, modern electric fence were installed in a desperate attempt to contain the chaos I’d inadvertently unleashed.

It was a perfect, and utterly futile, metaphor for modern life. We build these intricate systems—both literal and emotional—to feel secure. We set boundaries, curate our social media feeds, and try to manage our public persona, hoping to keep the messy, unpredictable parts of life at bay.

But Kevin didn’t care about my electric fence. He just hopped right over it, causing a fresh wave of neighborhood drama. And that’s when I woke up, my heart pounding, with the crystal-clear realization my dream was serving me.

We can spend so much energy on the fences. We install high-tech security to protect our property and build emotional walls to protect our peace. But sometimes, the real source of the chaos isn’t an external threat; it’s the “kangaroo” we’ve voluntarily let into our lives. That toxic habit, the draining commitment, the anxiety we try to box in instead of addressing.

The dream wasn’t about a kangaroo; it was a reminder that no security system, no matter how advanced, can compensate for the things we choose to tolerate. Sometimes, peace doesn’t come from building a higher fence, but from having the courage to ask, "Why did I adopt this kangaroo in the first place?" and, more importantly, to finally let it go.
