Remember those late 2021 lockdown nights, endlessly scrolling for that perfect fanfic? I was hunting for a story where James used Polyjuice to protect Remus’s secret from Lily. It was more than a plot; it was about the lengths we go to shield those we love. That desperate search for connection in fiction… it mirrored our own isolated reality, didn’t it? We all just wanted a good story to get lost in.
