## The Joy of Bringing Retro Games Back to Life (and 3D Modeling!)

There's something so satisfying about breathing new life into old passions, isn't there? Lately, I've been diving deep into a project that's scratching a serious retro itch: designing custom cases for my Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and GBA games. I'm drawing inspiration from designs like the GameCube and PSP â€“ a little modern flair for classic consoles! It's been a steep learning curve with Blender, but the potential to create something truly unique is incredibly exciting. Anyone else ever tackled a project like this?
