The cardboard boxes are stacked by the door, a silent testament to the decision I’ve made. At 24, moving out of state for a new job feels like the natural next step for my independence. But then my phone lights up. It’s my mom.

Her voice is thin, laced with a fear I know all too well. “I just worry I’ll never see you,” she says, and the familiar weight of guilt settles in my chest. It’s 2021, and the world is slowly reopening, yet the distance feels more immense than ever.

I’m torn between the thrill of my own future and the anchor of my family’s expectations. Pursuing personal growth shouldn’t feel like an act of abandonment. I’m learning that building my own life isn’t a rejection of where I came from—it’s just the next chapter, even if it’s one I have to write miles away from home.
