"As I navigated college life in 2021, I couldn't help but feel like I was coasting through. With online classes, it was easy to skip lectures and procrastinate on assignments. I'd often find myself wondering, 'Am I the only one doing the bare minimum?' It seemed like everyone else had it together, but as I connected with friends on social media, I realized I wasn't alone. Many were also struggling with laziness and minimal effort. It was a relief to know I wasn't the only one putting in just enough to get by."
