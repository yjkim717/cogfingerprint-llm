The Uninviting Sunshine: How Summer Fuels My Anxiety. For many, summer is a time of joy and freedom. But for me, the warmer months bring a sense of dread. As the pressure to be carefree and happy intensifies, my anxiety spikes. Social media feeds overflow with images of perfect beach bodies and sun-kissed selfies, fueling my self-consciousness. I feel like I'm constantly comparing my behind-the-scenes moments to others' highlight reels. Seasonal depression may be more commonly associated with winter, but for some of us, summer can be just as challenging. The expectation to be social, to attend gatherings, and to look a certain way can be overwhelming. As I navigate these feelings, I've come to realize that I'm not alone. By acknowledging the darker side of summer, I hope to create a more honest and supportive conversation around mental health.
