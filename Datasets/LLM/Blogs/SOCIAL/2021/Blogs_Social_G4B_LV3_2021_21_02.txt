**The Quiet Rebellion of Listening to *You***

Remember 2021? It felt like everyone was shouting advice – about work, about relationships, about *everything*. And honestly, a lot of it felt…loud. I found myself nodding along, trying to absorb it all, but a little voice inside kept whispering, “Wait a minute…” 

It’s easy to let other people’s anxieties dictate your own, to judge your experience based on their story. But this year, I started pushing back.  It wasn't about dismissing others, but about cultivating a deeper self-awareness. Recognizing that my path, my judgment, my feelings – they’re uniquely mine.  

Trusting that quiet voice, that internal compass, felt like a small act of rebellion. And you know what? It brought a surprising amount of peace.
