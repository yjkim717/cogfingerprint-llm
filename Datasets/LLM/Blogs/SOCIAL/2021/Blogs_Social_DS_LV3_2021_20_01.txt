There’s something about the soulful beats and heartfelt lyrics of 90s and early 2000s Korean music that just wraps around you like a warm blanket. In 2021, as we navigated another year of distance and screens, these nostalgic tunes became my social lifeline—reminding me of simpler times, shared mixtapes, and friendships forged over favorite SM Entertainment ballads. They didn’t just sound good; they rekindled connection, one heartfelt melody at a time.
