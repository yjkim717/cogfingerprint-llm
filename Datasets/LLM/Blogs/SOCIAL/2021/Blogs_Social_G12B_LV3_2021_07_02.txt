## The Hunt for Trust: Piercings and the Online Search

It’s wild how reliant we’ve become on online communities, isn’t it? Just last week, I was deep in a Reddit thread, searching for reliable piercers in St. Catharines, Ontario. Seems a few places I’d trusted had closed, and navigating recommendations felt…intense. Everyone's chasing that APP certification, that reassurance of safety and skill. It really highlighted how much we put our trust in strangers online, hoping their experiences guide us to something good. It's a 2021 reality – finding your tribe, even for something as personal as body modification!
