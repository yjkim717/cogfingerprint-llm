"Getting Lost in the Naruto Fandom on TikTok (2021)" 

As I scrolled through TikTok in 2021, I stumbled upon a sea of Naruto content that reignited my childhood passion for the anime. Creators were bringing lesser-known characters to life with captivating videos, sharing uncommon facts that I had never known before. I found myself wondering, what other hidden gems were out there? I turned to the community for suggestions, and soon, my feed was filled with unique character analyses and behind-the-scenes insights. It was amazing to see how a fandom could come together and share their love for Naruto in such a creative way.
