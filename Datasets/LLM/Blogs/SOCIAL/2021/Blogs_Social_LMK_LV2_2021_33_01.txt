"When Danger Meets Inaction: A Frustrating Drive in 2021"

I'll never forget the drive home from work last week. I was cruising along, following the speed limit, when a car whizzed past me on double yellows, leaving me shaken. The audacity! Not only was this driver speeding, but they were also making illegal passes, putting their life and mine at risk. What made matters worse was when I saw a police car a few miles down the road. I expected them to flag down the reckless driver, but instead, they just sat there, sipping their coffee. I was taken aback - where was the accountability? As I drove away, I couldn't help but wonder how many other drivers had experienced similar close calls. It's encounters like these that make me appreciate cautious driving and question the lack of enforcement on our roads.
