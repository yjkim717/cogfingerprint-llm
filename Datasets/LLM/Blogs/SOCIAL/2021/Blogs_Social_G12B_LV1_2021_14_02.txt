## The Evening Howl and the Echo of a Changed Routine

It's 7:15 PM. The light is fading, and I’m settling down with a cup of tea when I hear it – that mournful, drawn-out howl emanating from the hallway. It's Pip, my cat, and he’s staging a full-blown protest at the front door.

It's become a nightly ritual, really. Ever since we drastically cut back on his evening walks last year (thanks, pandemic!), things haven't been the same. We used to have a good hour of exploring the neighborhood, chasing leaves, and generally getting his zoomies out. Now, with everything being so… unpredictable, those walks are a rarity.

Honestly, I feel guilty. I know he misses them. It’s not just about the exercise; it’s about the routine, the stimulation, the feeling of connection to the outside world. He’s essentially telling me, in his own cat-like way, that he feels a bit… lost.

I’ve been trying different things – interactive toys, extra playtime, even just sitting and talking to him. Sometimes it works, sometimes he just stares at the door with an expression that says, "You *know* what I want."

It's a small thing, a cat howling at a door, but it’s a tangible reminder of how much our lives have shifted. How much even our pets feel the ripple effects of change. And it’s a reminder that sometimes, the simplest things – a consistent routine, a little bit of connection – can make all the difference. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to try dangling a feather toy. Wish me luck!
