Remember those early pandemic days when we all craved a little escape? For me, that was hopping into a casual match of Rocket League. It was my digital chill-out room—a low-pressure space where I could mess up a save, laugh it off, and just enjoy the game.

But the 2021 update changed everything. By removing the simple "vote to forfeit" option and introducing stricter penalties for leaving, they stripped away that casual feeling. Suddenly, a quick, fun match could turn into a five-minute prison sentence. I remember being trapped with a teammate who spent the entire game typing toxic insults instead of playing. There was no graceful exit, no mutual agreement to just call it. We were forced to play out the clock, the digital equivalent of a bad, awkward party you can’t leave.

It felt like the developers punished the entire community for a few bad apples, sacrificing the very essence of what made the casual mode a refuge. Sometimes, the freedom to walk away is what keeps an environment healthy.
