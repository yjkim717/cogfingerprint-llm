### The Sound of Our Neighborhood Changing

I was sitting on my porch last night, trying to enjoy the quiet of a 2021 evening, when the thumping bass started up again from the old Gracepoint Church. It’s not a church anymore, of course. It’s being turned into an event space, and the noise is just the beginning.

What really got me, though, was the notice we all received last week. To make room for a larger parking lot, they’re planning to remove the line of century-old oak trees that have stood as silent, gentle guardians along the property line for longer than anyone can remember.

It feels like a perfect storm of modern conflict: zoning laws being stretched, the push for property development at all costs, and a complete disregard for what makes a neighborhood a home. It’s not just about noise pollution or even the loss of beautiful, ancient trees. It’s about the erosion of our shared space, of history, and of quiet dignity.

Those trees witnessed generations. Soon, they’ll be replaced by asphalt and the glare of headlights. It makes me wonder, in our rush to build what’s new, what essential pieces of our collective soul we are paving over.
