### The Real Enemy Was My Own Ambition

I finally did it. In the weird, limbo-like summer of 2021, I decided to tackle the ultimate challenge in *The Last of Us Part II*: the Grounded mode. No HUD, barely any supplies, enemies that can smell your fear. I thought I was prepared. I was wrong.

Everything came to a head in the Forest, at that damn gate. My ammo was a ghost of what I needed, and the air grew thick with the acidic mist of Shamblers. In that moment, my usual "run-and-gun" strategy evaporated. I was forced to slow down, to think, to use the environment. It was brutal, but it was also a strange kind of meditation.

It made me reflect on how we handle scarcity in our own lives. We’re so used to abundance, to having a "supply" of social energy, patience, and plans. But the last year and a half has been a global lesson in supply management. We’ve all had to adapt, to use what we have more creatively, and sometimes, to just survive the wave.

Beating that section, after countless tries, wasn't about triumph. It was a quiet lesson in resilience. Sometimes, the biggest growth happens when you’re stripped of your usual tools and have to rely on sheer, stubborn persistence—both in games, and in life.
