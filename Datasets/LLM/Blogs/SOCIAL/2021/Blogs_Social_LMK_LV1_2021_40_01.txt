As I scrolled through my social media feed in 2021, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disconnection. Everyone around me seemed to be living their best lives - traveling to exotic destinations, landing dream jobs, and celebrating milestones with loved ones. Meanwhile, I was stuck at home, feeling stuck in my own life.

It dawned on me that I was comparing my behind-the-scenes moments to everyone else's highlight reels. The constant stream of curated perfection was taking a toll on my mental health. I felt like I wasn't measuring up, like I was somehow failing.

As I took a step back from social media, I began to see things in a different light. I realized that everyone's journey is unique, and that comparisons are unfair to myself and others. I started to focus on my own goals and progress, rather than measuring myself against others.

It's funny how a simple step back can give you a new perspective. I'm not saying I've quit social media cold turkey, but I've become more mindful of my usage. I'm trying to use it to connect with others, rather than compare myself to them. It's a work in progress, but I'm feeling more grounded and less like I'm living in a world that's not my own.
