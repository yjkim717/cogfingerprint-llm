### The Map is Blank and That's Okay

I’ve been staring at a blank page for an hour. Not this one—the metaphorical one titled “My Future.” It’s 2021, and after the collective whirlwind we’ve all been through, my old five-year plan feels like a relic from another lifetime. The path I was on seems to have just… faded away.

I keep asking myself the big, daunting questions: What’s my real purpose? What am I actually working toward? Most days, it feels like I’m just going through the motions, ticking off tasks without any real destination in mind. There’s this nagging feeling of being stuck, like I’m running on a treadmill—putting in the effort but not getting anywhere new.

But here’s the small, quiet thought that’s been keeping me sane lately. Maybe the goal right now isn’t to find the one perfect path. Maybe it’s about gathering materials.

I’ve started treating this uncertain phase not as a failure of planning, but as a season of collection. I’m reading a book outside my usual genre, saying ‘yes’ to a coffee with someone new, learning a silly skill just for the fun of it. These aren’t grand steps on a career ladder; they’re just interesting stones I’m picking up and putting in my pocket.

I don’t know what I’m building yet, and that’s still terrifying. But I’m trusting that when the fog does finally lift, I’ll have a pocketful of new, unexpected pieces to start with. And perhaps that’s enough for now.
