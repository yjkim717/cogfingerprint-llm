Okay, 90 Day Fiancé season nine… seriously, what *is* going on? I’ve been completely glued to it, and honestly, it’s a rollercoaster of cringe. Watching Andrew and Stephanie’s dynamic felt so… toxic. It’s wild how much drama plays out on that show, and how easily people seem to tolerate really unhealthy relationships.  It made me think about how much we scroll and consume these narratives, sometimes without really questioning the red flags. 2021 was definitely a year for intense online observation!
