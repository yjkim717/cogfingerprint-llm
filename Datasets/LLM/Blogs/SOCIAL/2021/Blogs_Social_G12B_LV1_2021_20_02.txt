## The Allure of Endless Scroll

Remember 2021? It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? For me, it was peak… well, let’s just say *minimal* effort in college. I’d tell myself I was “researching” when I was lost in TikTok rabbit holes. A paper due on Thursday? No problem, I'd think, I'll start it… Sunday night. 

It wasn't that I was actively *trying* to fail. It was more like a slow drift. The ease of online assignments, combined with the constant stream of content vying for my attention, created this weird inertia. I'd chase the easiest A possible, the assignments with the least required effort. 

Looking back, it’s embarrassing. I traded genuine learning for fleeting dopamine hits. Social media promised instant gratification, and college, with its delayed rewards, felt like a chore. It's a lesson I'm still unpacking, realizing that sometimes the biggest obstacle isn’t the workload, but the siren song of endless scroll.



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
