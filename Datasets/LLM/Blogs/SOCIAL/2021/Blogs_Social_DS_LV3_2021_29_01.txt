It’s 2021, and I still haven’t finished the original *Berserk* anime. Every time I click play, this heavy feeling settles in—a mix of admiration and guilt. Kentaro Miura’s sudden death hit me harder than I expected. Here was this brilliant creator, and I’d taken his work for granted, always telling myself, "I’ll get to it someday."

Now, watching Guts struggle feels different. It’s like I’m mourning not just a story, but the person behind it. I feel guilty for not appreciating Miura’s masterpiece while he was still with us. And moving on to other shows? Impossible. How can I, when this one demands to be felt so deeply?

Maybe you’ve been there too—that one piece of art you can’t consume without a pang of sadness. It’s a reminder to cherish the creators who move us, while we still can.
