Looking back on 2021, I remember feeling like I was on a strange expedition—one where we were all trying to build something meaningful without our usual tools. It reminded me of those gaming scenarios where you’re dropped into a new world, stripped of your ship, and have to rely on trading posts and makeshift recipes just to survive.

That year, stripped of familiar social connections, we became resourceful. We traded virtual coffee chats for real support, refined our communication, and built new "geobays" of community in our neighborhoods. It was tough, but it taught me that even without our old comforts, we can still craft something resilient together. Sometimes, starting from scratch reveals strengths we never knew we had.
