As we juggle our busy lives in 2021, it's easy to overlook the behind-the-scenes heroes of our daily routines: our washing machines and dishwashers. But neglecting these appliances can lead to a buildup of soap scum, bacteria, and grime. I've learned the hard way that regular maintenance is key to keeping them running efficiently. One simple trick is to run an empty load with a cleaning fluid to clear out any debris. It's also essential to check and clean the filters and traps regularly to prevent clogs. For instance, my friend swears by running a hot water cycle with vinegar to remove any lingering detergent residue. By sharing our tips and tricks, we can help each other keep our homes running smoothly and sustainably. So, let's make a pact to give our appliances some TLC â€“ our planet (and our dirty laundry) will thank us!
