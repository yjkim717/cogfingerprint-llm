Of all the ways I imagined 2021 going, sitting in a dentist’s chair wasn’t on my top ten list. But there I was, staring at the ceiling while my dentist tutted over my front tooth. The culprit? A fork. A simple, everyday fork, hiding in a seemingly innocent kale salad.

It happened during one of those long, isolated lunches that had become the norm. I was scrolling, not looking, and chomped down with a force that sent a sickening crunch through my jaw. My heart sank. This wasn't just any tooth; it was the one I’d had bonded years ago after a clumsy fall. It felt like a cruel joke—a repeat performance of my own clumsiness, this time with a dining utensil as the co-star.

But this accident made me reflect on more than just my dental health. In a year where human connection felt fragile, my little ceramic tooth became a weird metaphor. We’re all a bit bonded and repaired these days, aren’t we? A little more fragile than we let on, holding ourselves together after the various "accidents" of the last eighteen months—the isolation, the loss, the constant uncertainty.

Sitting in that chair, I realized being "fixed" isn't a one-time event. It’s an ongoing process. We chip, we break, and we have the courage to get mended again. My dentist’s appointment wasn't just about restoring a tooth; it was a quiet, personal reminder of our collective resilience. We’re all out here, carefully navigating our forks, hoping for a clean bite, but learning how to heal when we don’t. And there’s a strange comfort in that shared, human experience.
