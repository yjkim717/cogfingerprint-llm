**Feeling Lost in 2021: How I Found My Way Again**

As I sat in front of my laptop, scrolling through my social media feeds in the summer of 2021, I couldn't help but feel a sense of emptiness. Everyone around me seemed to be thriving - sharing their achievements, traveling to exotic destinations, and crushing their goals. Meanwhile, I was stuck in a rut, feeling lost and uncertain about my own future. It was as if I was drifting through life without a clear direction or purpose.

I remember feeling envious of those who seemed to know exactly what they were doing. Their confidence and motivation were palpable, even through a screen. But as I continued to scroll, I started to notice something - everyone has their own struggles. Behind the curated highlight reels, people were sharing their own stories of struggle and perseverance.

This realization was a turning point for me. I began to reflect on my own values and passions, and slowly started to reconnect with what truly mattered to me. I started setting small, achievable goals, and celebrating my tiny wins along the way. It wasn't easy, but with time, I started to feel a sense of direction and motivation that I hadn't felt in months. If you're feeling lost like I was, know that you're not alone. Take a step back, breathe, and trust that you'll find your way again.
