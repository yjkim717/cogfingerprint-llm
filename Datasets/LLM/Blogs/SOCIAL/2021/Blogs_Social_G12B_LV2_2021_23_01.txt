Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided summary and instructions. I've aimed for a conversational, reflective tone and kept it within the ~80 word limit, setting it in a 2021 context.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: Echoes of a Body I'm Leaving Behind**

It’s weird, right? My period officially stopped ten months ago, a huge milestone on my FTM journey. But sometimes… I still get these phantom cramps. Not the full-blown, debilitating kind, just… echoes. A dull ache, a familiar tightening. It’s a strange reminder of a body I'm actively transitioning away from, a little ghost of what used to be. Anyone else experience this? Cycle tracking apps feel a little pointless now, honestly!



**Notes on this draft:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "It’s weird, right?" and "Anyone else experience this?" to create a more relatable feel.
*   **Reflective:** The post focuses on the *feeling* and experience rather than just stating the fact of the cramps.
*   **Storytelling:** It briefly narrates the author's journey and connects the cramps to that larger narrative.
*   **Keywords Incorporated:** The keywords are naturally woven into the text.
*   **2021 Context:** The mention of cycle tracking apps feels relevant to the increased awareness and use of those tools around that time.



I hope this is a good starting point! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or further refinements.
