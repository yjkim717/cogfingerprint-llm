"As I watched Bo Burnham's 'Inside' in 2021, I was struck by the intentional use of lighting - it wasn't just about visibility, but about setting the tone. This got me thinking about my own gardening hobby. Just like Burnham's strategic lighting, I use a grow lamp to nurture my plants, manipulating light to coax them into bloom. It's a reminder that, just as light can shape our surroundings, it can also influence our moods and emotions. 'Inside' is a powerful exploration of this interplay between light, space, and self."
