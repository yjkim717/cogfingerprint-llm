That sweltering day at the amusement park in 2021 was supposed to be pure fun. But as the sun beat down, my stomach started to cramp, a tight, anxious knot. I’d been so worried about dehydration I barely drank anything, and now… nothing was moving.

The panic hit me like a wave in the crowded line for the rollercoaster. My heart hammered against my ribs. This was it. The dreaded feeling I’d spent years trying to outrun with my emetophobia was closing in. I could feel every pair of eyes on me, judging the pale, shaky girl about to lose it.

I had to get out. Pushing past smiling families, I found a quiet bench, head between my knees, focusing on my breath. It was just a panic attack, not the catastrophe I feared. It’s in these moments I’m reminded how my mind can turn a simple stomach ache into a full-blown emergency, a lonely battle fought in a crowd.
