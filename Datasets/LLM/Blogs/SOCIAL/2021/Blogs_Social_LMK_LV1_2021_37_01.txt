"As a Halo fan, I often think about the untold stories within the franchise. If a novelization combining Halo 2 and 3 were to exist, should it include the plot of Halo 3: ODST? In 2021, with the franchise's rich history, I believe incorporating the Helljumpers' tale would add depth to the narrative, enriching the overall story."
