>## The Lipstick and the Longing: Why My Makeup Matters (Even When Everything Else Feels Like a Failure)

Okay, let's be real. Depression isn't a neat, predictable thing. It doesn’t always look like lying in bed all day, though some days it absolutely *does*. Sometimes, it manifests in the weirdest, most contradictory ways. Lately, mine has been showing up in the form of elaborate makeup routines.

I know, right? While I'm skipping meals, letting laundry pile up, and generally feeling like a colossal failure, I’ll spend an hour contouring and highlighting. My family doesn’t *get* it. “You look so nice,” they’ll say, followed by a hesitant, "But are you… okay?" The question hangs in the air, laced with a judgment I feel deep in my bones. 

It's a performance, I guess. A desperate attempt to hold onto *something*. To feel like I'm still *me*, the person I used to be, the one who took pride in her appearance. Maybe it's a way of proving I'm still here, still fighting, even when the fight feels impossible. 

The internal conflict is exhausting. Am I faking it? Am I being deceptive? But this isn't about deceiving anyone. It’s about a tiny act of self-care, a small pocket of control in a world that feels utterly chaotic. It’s about finding a little validation in a perfectly blended eyeshadow, even if everything else is falling apart. And honestly, right now, that's enough.
