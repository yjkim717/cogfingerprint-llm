As I scroll through my social media feed in 2021, I'm suddenly transported back to the vibrant world of 90s K-pop. The nostalgic beats of SM Entertainment legends like H.O.T, S.E.S, and BoA flood my mind, evoking a warm, fuzzy feeling. I find myself reminiscing about the carefree days of my youth, when K-pop first captured my heart. Those iconic tunes still inspire me today, and I'm on a mission to rediscover the classics that sparked my love for Korean music.
