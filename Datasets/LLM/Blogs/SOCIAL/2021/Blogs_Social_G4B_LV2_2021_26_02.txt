**The Quiet Hum of Judgment**

Okay, real talk. 2021 felt… complicated, didn’t it? Like everyone was trying to figure out a new normal, and I was just trying to figure out my own backyard. Lately, that backyard has been feeling a little too small, and a lot too… scrutinized.

It started with the neighbors. Perfectly nice people, on the surface. But their questions about Gus – my goofy, slightly neurotic rescue dog – kept escalating. "When are you *finally* going to neuter him?" "He’s such a rambunctious boy!" It wasn’t outright hostility, but this constant, low-level judgment was starting to wear me down. 

Honestly, it hit me hard. It wasn’t just about Gus. It was about feeling like my family, my choices, my *pet parenting* style was being constantly evaluated. I started to question if I was doing enough, if I was a “good” owner. 

I’m realizing now that it’s exhausting to feel like you’re perpetually under a microscope, especially when you’re just trying to create a loving home. It sparked a bigger feeling – a deep social discomfort. It made me think about how easily we can slip into judging others, and how much that small act can chip away at your own peace. 

Anyone else feel this way lately?
