## The Unseen Workout: Thinking About Service Dog Energy

It’s something that struck me the other day – seeing a service dog patiently by its handler’s side. We admire their focus, their dedication… but I started wondering, *how* do they get their energy out? These incredible dogs are often with wheelchair-bound or disabled individuals all day, offering vital mobility assistance. 

It made me appreciate the unseen work that goes into ensuring these amazing animals are happy and healthy.  Are there secret walks? Games of fetch during breaks? It's a reminder that even the most devoted companions need to stretch their legs and sniff the world! Anyone else ever pondered the daily routine of a service dog? 



Hope this is a good starting point! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
