That first week with our 8-week-old kitten, Mochi, was a rollercoaster. He ate, drank, and playedâ€”but no poop in the litter box. My new-parent nerves were in overdrive. Was it the stress of a new home? After a gentle stomach massage and some quiet reassurance, the breakthrough came. It hit me in 2021, isolated and anxious myself, that we were both just learning to feel safe. Sometimes the smallest creatures remind us that patience and gentle care can ease the biggest worries.
