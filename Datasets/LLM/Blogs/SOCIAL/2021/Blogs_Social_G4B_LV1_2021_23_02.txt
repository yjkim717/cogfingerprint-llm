**Cone Drama & Kitten Feelings**

Okay, so last month, little Leo – my nephew’s new kitten – needed his neuter. It was quick, but the “cone of shame” was a *struggle*. He was so frustrated, batting at it, trying to escape. It made me think about how much we sometimes push our pets to adjust to new things. Was I being patient enough? It’s easy to get caught up in the ‘should’s’ of pet care, but really, it’s about understanding their feelings too. ❤️ #kittenlife #petadvice #2021memories

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different style of post?
