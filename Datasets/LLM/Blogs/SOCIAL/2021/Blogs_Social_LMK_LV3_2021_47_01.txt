As I flipped through my bullet journal in 2021, I realized that establishing a consistent writing habit was tougher than I thought. I was excited to get organized and boost my productivity, but the blank pages stared back at me, intimidating. I struggled to make journaling a daily habit. However, with persistence and flexibility, I started to make progress. I learned to be kind to myself on off days and celebrate small wins. Now, my bullet journal is a reflection of my journey, a tool that helps me stay focused and mindful.
