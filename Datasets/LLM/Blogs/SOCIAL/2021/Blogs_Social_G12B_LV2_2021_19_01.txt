## Lost in the Lines, Found on YouTube

Okay, confession time: I’ve been *really* diving deep into illustration history lately. It started with a random Pinterest rabbit hole, and somehow led me to this incredible YouTube channel by Pete Beard. Seriously, if you're even remotely interested in art, check it out. 

It’s fascinating to see how different styles evolved, and how much advertising has shaped illustration over the years. It's a reminder that even the most modern techniques build on a rich foundation. Plus, it's a welcome escape from the endless scroll! Anyone else finding unexpected inspiration online these days?
