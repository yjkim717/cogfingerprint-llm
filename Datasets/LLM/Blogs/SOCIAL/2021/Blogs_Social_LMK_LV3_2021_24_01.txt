As I navigated my linear algebra course in 2021, I realized that an open-book exam wasn't just about having the right study materials, but also about knowing where to find them. I discovered that a combination of online resources, textbook supplements, and study groups helped me stay on top of college exam prep. By sharing our favorite mathematics resources, my peers and I were able to support each other in mastering the subject.
