>Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the provided keywords and summary, written in a conversational tone and aiming for a ~228 word count, with a 2021 context.  I've focused on the internal struggle and the bravery of seeking help, while subtly alluding to the challenges of navigating work/life balance during a difficult time.

## The Algorithm Can't Fix This. (And That's Okay.)

It's been… a rough few weeks. I’m not going to get into graphic detail, because honestly, the less I focus on the specifics of it all, the better. Let’s just say my relationship with food, a relationship I thought I'd largely wrestled into submission, decided to rear its ugly head again. Relapse. The word feels heavy, you know? Like a lead weight settling in your chest.

Social media has been… complicated. On one hand, seeing everyone else’s seemingly perfect lives – the travel, the promotions, the flawlessly plated meals – just amplifies the feeling of being *off*. Like I’m failing at adulthood. On the other hand, I've found some incredible support online, communities of people who *get* it. It’s a strange duality. 

I'm at a point where I need to prioritize something more important than deadlines and spreadsheets. I’m actually considering asking for some time off work. The thought terrifies me. It feels like admitting defeat, like I’m letting everyone down. But my therapist, bless her, keeps reminding me that healing isn’t a weakness; it’s a necessity. 

2021 has been a year of realizing that sometimes, the most radical act is simply taking care of yourself. The algorithm can't offer the support I need. It can’t offer therapy, or a safe space to process. It can’t offer me the grace I need right now.  So, I’m taking a deep breath, and figuring out how to ask for what I need. Wish me luck.

**Notes on why I made these choices:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "you know?", "bless her," and a more casual vocabulary.
*   **Storytelling:** I focused on the personal experience and internal struggle rather than just listing facts about eating disorders.
*   **2021 Context:** The mention of social media and its perceived "perfection" is very relevant to that time period, as was the general increase in awareness of mental health needs.
*   **Subtlety:** I alluded to the "b/p" aspect without being explicit, respecting the sensitive nature of the topic.
*   **Focus on Agency:** I emphasized the author's decision-making process and taking control of their healing.
