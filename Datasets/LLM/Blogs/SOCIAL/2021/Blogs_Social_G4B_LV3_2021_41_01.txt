**Finding Comfort in Simple Things (and Pancakes!)**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of needing to just *pause*. Between the pandemic and everything else, carving out little pockets of peace felt crucial. I started experimenting with really simple things – like whipping up a batch of oat pancakes with a frozen banana. 

It’s funny, right? A ridiculously easy recipe, but it became this little ritual. A way to slow down and actually *taste* my breakfast, instead of just inhaling it on the way out the door.  

It made me think about social connection too. Sometimes, the most meaningful moments aren't grand gestures, but the quiet shared enjoyment of something basic.  A quick text to a friend, a shared laugh over a warm pancake… those small, healthy connections felt more vital than ever. 

Maybe it’s just me, but finding joy in the simple things – a good recipe, a friendly face – is what kept me grounded that year. What small comforts have you discovered lately?
