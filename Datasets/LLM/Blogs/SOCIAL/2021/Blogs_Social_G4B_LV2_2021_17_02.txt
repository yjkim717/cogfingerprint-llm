**The Weight of a Smile**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we all curate these little performances for social media. Perfect lighting, filtered photos, captions designed to elicit a certain reaction. But honestly, lately, I’ve been feeling a surprising amount of pressure to *look* happy, even when… well, when I wasn’t. 

I remember last summer, feeling completely overwhelmed after a huge family gathering. A mix of too much food, too much sun, and just a general feeling of being *on*. It culminated in a full-blown panic attack and a seriously uncomfortable digestive episode.  

Sharing that vulnerability on Reddit felt… terrifying. But also, strangely freeing. It reminded me that it’s okay to not be okay, and that those carefully constructed online smiles often hide a whole lot of messy, real feelings. 

Let's be real – 2021 was a year of learning to prioritize my own well-being, even if it meant logging off for a while.  How are you doing with that this week?

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a different aspect of the original summary?
