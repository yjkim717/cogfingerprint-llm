## The Unexpected Drain: When Tech Gets Too Helpful

Okay, so I'm a sucker for new features. When watchOS 7.2 dropped, I was *all* about the handwashing detection. Felt good to get a little nudge to scrub longer, right? Turns out, my Apple Watch 4 didn't think so. My battery life plummeted! Seriously, I was charging it twice a day.

After some frantic Googling, I stumbled upon a forum thread â€“ apparently, lots of folks were experiencing the same thing. Disabling the handwashing feature? Problem solved. It's a little reminder that even the best intentions (and clever tech) can sometimes have unintended consequences. Anyone else have a similar experience with a new feature draining their battery?
