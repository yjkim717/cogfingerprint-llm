**The Weight of Unspoken Things**

Okay, so 2021 was… a lot.  I spent most of the year feeling like I was wading through mud, honestly. It wasn't a dramatic, cinematic kind of depression, just a persistent, heavy grayness. And then, a family secret surfaced – something that suddenly shifted everything. 

I was terrified of a full-blown mental breakdown, so I finally started seeing a counselor. It felt weirdly vulnerable, admitting I needed help. But talking it through, slowly unpacking years of unspoken history, has been… transformative. 

Social media felt particularly overwhelming sometimes – everyone’s highlight reel versus my quiet struggle. It made me realize I needed to prioritize my own well-being.  It’s a slow process, but learning to cope and being honest about what I’m going through? That’s a win.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
