## The Crayon Note That Broke Me (and Why We Need to Talk About Respect)

Okay, deep breath. I need to get this off my chest. I’m a hotel housekeeper, and I’ve seen a *lot* in this job. Spilled drinks, forgotten toys, the occasional rogue suitcase… you name it. You learn to roll with it. It's part of the deal. But what I dealt with last week? That was different. That was… jarring.

A family checked out, leaving a room that looked like a small hurricane had ripped through it. Not just a bit messy. Deliberately, aggressively messy. Food smeared on the walls, towels strewn everywhere, furniture overturned. And the worst part? A crayon drawing taped to the mirror. It wasn't a cute kid's doodle. It was a single, stark sentence: "We were here."

Honestly, I almost walked out. I felt this overwhelming wave of exhaustion, not just physical, but emotional. It wasn’t just the extra hour of cleaning; it was the blatant disregard for someone else’s time and effort. It felt like a direct message saying, "Your work doesn't matter."

It got me thinking about respect. We talk a lot about kindness online, about being mindful of others. But how often do we extend that same consideration to the people who *literally* keep the world running? The housekeepers, the delivery drivers, the service staff? 

This wasn’t about a messy family enjoying their vacation. This was about a lack of basic human decency. And seeing that crayon note, that casual declaration of disregard, just… broke something in me. I hope sharing this can spark a conversation, even a small one, about treating everyone with the respect they deserve. Because we're all just trying to do our jobs, and we all deserve to feel valued.
