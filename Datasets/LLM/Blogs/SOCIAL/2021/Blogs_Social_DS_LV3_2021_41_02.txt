The summer of 2021 was supposed to be a season of reconnection, but for me, it felt like a pressure cooker. As the temperatures rose, so did my anxiety. Every backyard barbecue and family gathering came with an unspoken checklist: look happy, be sociable, and don’t let anyone see you sweat—literally or emotionally.

I found myself increasingly self-conscious, dreading the small talk with relatives who’d ask, “So, what have you been up to?” as if a global pause in life was just a vacation. The expectation to perform summer—to be carefree and sun-kissed—clashed violently with the heaviness I carried inside.

It’s exhausting, pretending the heat doesn’t make your skin crawl or that you’re not counting down the minutes until you can retreat to the quiet of your own space. This summer, I’m learning that it’s okay to feel the weight of the season and to grant myself permission to just be, not perform.
