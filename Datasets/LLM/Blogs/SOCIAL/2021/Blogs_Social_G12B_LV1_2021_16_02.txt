## The Weight of Unspoken Things

It's funny, isn't it, how life can just…shift? Like the ground disappears from under your feet. That’s kind of how the last few weeks have felt. A family secret, something buried deep and long, finally surfaced. It wasn’t a dramatic explosion, more like a slow, quiet leak that’s steadily eroded the foundation of how I understood my family.

Honestly, the fallout has been tougher than I anticipated. I've been battling this creeping sense of…disconnection, a low-grade anxiety that clings to me. The old coping mechanisms – late-night scrolling, burying myself in work – weren’t cutting it this time. I felt myself teetering, close to slipping back into a place I’d worked so hard to leave.

So, I did something I’d been putting off: I started counseling. It feels strange to admit, a little vulnerable, but also…relieving. Talking it through, just *talking*, has already felt lighter than carrying it all alone. 2021 has been a year of unexpected revelations for so many, and I'm learning that seeking support isn't weakness, it's strength.
