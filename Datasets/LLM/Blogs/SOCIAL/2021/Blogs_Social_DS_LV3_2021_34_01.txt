It’s 2021, and I’m still staring at my to-do list, paralyzed. My ADHD medication helps quiet the noise, but bridging the gap between intention and action? That’s the real battle. I’ve broken projects into tiny, manageable steps—I know all the productivity hacks. Yet, here I am, caught in the familiar grip of executive dysfunction, scrolling instead of starting.

It’s not a lack of motivation; it’s a frustrating disconnect where my brain and my goals feel like separate islands. If you’ve ever felt this chasm between wanting to do something and actually doing it, you’re not alone. The struggle is real, and it’s deeply personal.
