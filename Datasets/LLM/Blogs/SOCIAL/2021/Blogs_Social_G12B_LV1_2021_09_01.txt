## The Electric Crossroads: More Than Just Miles Per Charge

So, I’m finally seriously considering going electric. It feels like everyone’s buzzing about it, and honestly, the gas prices lately have been… alarming. I've been deep-diving into used options, specifically the Nissan Leaf and the Bolt EV. It's a surprisingly rabbit hole! 

Beyond the range and charging infrastructure (which *is* improving!), I'm really focused on the practical stuff. My daily commute isn’t huge, but I spend a *lot* of time in the car. Seat comfort is a huge deal. And, let's be real, depreciation is a scary factor when buying used – you don't want to lose a ton of value quickly.

It’s funny how a simple decision like switching to an electric car has become such a layered thought process. It's not just about saving money on gas; it's about long-term value, personal comfort, and feeling like I'm doing *something* for the planet. Still weighing my options!
