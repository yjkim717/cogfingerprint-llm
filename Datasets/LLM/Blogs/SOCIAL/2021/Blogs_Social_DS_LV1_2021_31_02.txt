During the height of 2021’s remote world, I found myself in a virtual ASL workshop. I kept fumbling my non-dominant hand, feeling clumsy and exposed. But the instructor’s patience, and the group’s shared, silent encouragement in the chat, reminded me that communication isn't about perfection. It's about the willingness to try, to be vulnerable together. That small, supportive square on my screen taught me more about connection than any flawless performance ever could.
