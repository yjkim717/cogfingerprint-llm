"Watching my teething puppy learn not to bite was a hilarious adventure in 2021. As I navigated the challenges of dog training, I discovered that my little furball was developing quirky habits that stole my heart. From gnawing on shoes to adorable 'puppy cuddles,' their antics kept me laughing. As I reflected on their growth, I realized that their journey mirrored our own - learning to navigate the world, one bite (or nuzzle) at a time. Embracing their silly habits, I found joy in the simple moments of pet parenthood."
