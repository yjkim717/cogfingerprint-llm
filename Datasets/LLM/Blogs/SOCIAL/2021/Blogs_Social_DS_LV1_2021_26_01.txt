It’s 2021, and I’m working from home with my teething puppy nearby. Between video calls, he’ll let out this big, dramatic yawn before softly nibbling my arm—his way of saying, “I’m here, and I need something to chew.” It’s in these quiet moments I realize how much bite inhibition training mirrors our own need for gentle communication. We’re all learning to temper our impulses, to express ourselves without leaving marks. Funny how a puppy reminds you that softness is a strength, especially when the world feels so bitey.
