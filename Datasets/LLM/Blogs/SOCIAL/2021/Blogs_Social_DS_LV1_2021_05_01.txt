It’s 2021, and I’m starting to think my Wi-Fi has a personal vendetta against me. I upgraded to a top-tier ISP plan, bought a shiny new router, and even memorized the sacred ritual of unplugging, counting to ten, and plugging it back in. Still, my Zoom calls freeze at the worst possible moments, and streaming feels like I’m back on dial-up.

I’ve run more internet speed tests than I care to admit, each time hoping for that magic number my provider promised. I’ve scoured forums, updated drivers, and glared at the Ethernet cable like it might confess its sins. But the slowness persists, a stubborn ghost in the machine.

It’s funny—this tiny, invisible struggle has reshaped my social life. Movie nights with friends now come with a pre-show of buffering anxiety. Virtual hangouts hinge on whether my connection decides to cooperate. In a year when so much of our connection to the world is digital, a sluggish link can feel like a social barrier. Maybe the real upgrade I need isn’t more speed, but a little more patience—and the humility to admit that sometimes, you just have to laugh when the screen spins.
