## The Glitter and the Grief: A Quiet Reflection on Parenthood and Respect

It's 2021, and we’re all supposedly more aware. More empathetic. More *mindful*. Yet, sometimes, I see things that just… shake that belief. I work as a housekeeper at a mid-range hotel, and generally, it's a pretty decent job. I get to work independently, the pay is okay, and I take pride in making a space feel fresh and inviting. 

But last week… last week was something else.

Room 312. I walked in expecting the usual – a few stray hairs, maybe a forgotten toothbrush. What I found was… chaos. Toys scattered, food smeared on the walls, ripped towels, and glitter. Everywhere. Glitter. Like someone had opened a bag and just *released* it. 

It wasn't just messy. It felt *deliberately* messy. Like a small rebellion against order. And honestly? It made me sad. 

I’m not anti-kids. Not at all. I have nieces and nephews I adore. But this wasn't the joyful mess of childhood. This felt like a statement. A disregard for the space and the people who work to keep it clean. 

It got me thinking about the unspoken expectations around parenting. We celebrate the 'beautiful chaos' of family life, but sometimes, I wonder if we forget the responsibility that comes with it. The responsibility to teach respect, to leave things as you find them, even – *especially* – when you're travelling. 

It's a small thing, I know. A messy hotel room. But it’s a window into a larger issue, and it left me feeling a little disheartened, covered in glitter, and wondering if we’re really as mindful as we think we are.
