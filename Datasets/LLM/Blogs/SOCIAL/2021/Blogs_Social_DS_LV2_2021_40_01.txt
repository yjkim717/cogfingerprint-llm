### The Email I Was Too Scared to Send

My new work laptop glowed, the cursor blinking mockingly in the empty email draft. The subject line was easy: "Request for Medical Leave." The body was the hard part.

How do you explain to a company that just took a chance on you that you need to step away? My eating disorder felt like a shameful secret I’d carried for years, a constant hum of anxiety beneath the surface of my "together" new-hire facade. In 2021, we talk a big game about mental health, but actually asking for the time to heal? That felt like admitting failure.

My finger hovered over the delete key. I imagined the disappointment, the whispers. But then I thought about the alternative—another year of just surviving, not living. I took a shaky breath and started typing, not with an apology, but with a truth: "To be the dedicated employee I want to be, I first need to prioritize my health."

Hitting "send" was terrifying. But it was also the first real step I’d taken in my own recovery, a quiet choice to stop fearing what others thought and start fighting for myself.
