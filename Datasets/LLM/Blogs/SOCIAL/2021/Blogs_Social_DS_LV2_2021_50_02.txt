Remember those endless 2021 Zoom calls? We were all craving connection, yet felt so isolated. It makes me think of those epic, long movies like *Ford v Ferrari* that still drew massive crowds. We sought out those shared experiences, even from our couches. It wasn’t just about the runtime; it was about feeling part of a collective story. In a world pulling us apart, a great film—or a simple, honest conversation—could still bring us together.
