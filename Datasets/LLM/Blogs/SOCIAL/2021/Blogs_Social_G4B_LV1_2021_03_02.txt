**Scrolling Through Life: A 2021 Reflection**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of observing more than actually *doing*. I spent so much time scrolling – Instagram, Twitter, even just endless news feeds. It’s easy to get lost in the highlight reels of everyone else’s lives, right? 

I realized I was neglecting the little maintenance things – like cleaning out my digital spaces and taking a genuine pause. Just like a washing machine needs emptying and a dishwasher needs proper cleaning to keep running smoothly, my online world needed attention. 

It wasn't about drastically changing everything, just a conscious effort to be more mindful about what I was consuming and how it was impacting me.  Maybe a little digital decluttering is what we all need sometimes.  What about you?
