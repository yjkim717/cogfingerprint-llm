"As we strive for inclusivity in art, let's consider representation of vitiligo. Should we create characters with this condition, and if so, how can we do so sensitively? In 2021, it's crucial that our creative expressions not only captivate, but also respect and reflect the diversity of our global community. By balancing aesthetic appeal with thoughtful representation, we can raise awareness and promote empathy, fostering a more compassionate and understanding society, one artwork at a time."
