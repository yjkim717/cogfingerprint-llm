It’s 2021, and I’m deep into my EV hunt—torn between a used Nissan Leaf and a CPO Chevy Bolt. The numbers make sense, especially with that steep depreciation working in my favor. But here’s the thing: I sat in a Bolt last week, and those seats… oof. My back is still telling the story.

So I’m turning to you all—what’s the real-world scoop? Is the Bolt’s seat comfort a dealbreaker, or am I just overthinking it? Your advice means everything right now.
