### The Debt We Can't See

I was reading about a proposed deep geological repository the other day—a fancy term for burying our nuclear waste deep underground. The engineering is mind-blowing; they’re designing these casks to last for millennia.

But it got me thinking less about the science and more about the message. We’re essentially creating a perfect, sealed problem and handing it to our great-great-grandchildren. We get the clean energy from the power plants now, and they get the permanent responsibility. It feels like the ultimate "I.O.U." with no return address.

In 2021, we're already grappling with the social and environmental debts of previous generations. It’s a strange ethical corner we’re painting ourselves into: advocating for more nuclear power to solve our current climate crisis, while simultaneously creating a legacy of latent risk. Are we being responsible stewards, or are we just better at hiding our mess than our ancestors were? It’s a conversation we need to have, out in the open, before the ground is sealed for good.
