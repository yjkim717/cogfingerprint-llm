As a new kitten owner in 2021, I was worried when my 8-week-old furball didn't poop for a day. I soon realized that constipation and anxiety can go hand-in-hand for pets adjusting to new surroundings. To ease my kitten's discomfort, I ensured they stayed hydrated, exercised regularly, and had a balanced diet. By prioritizing their overall well-being, I helped reduce their stress and encouraged healthy habits. With patience and proper care, my little companion settled in, and so did their bowel movements â€“ a relief for both of us.
