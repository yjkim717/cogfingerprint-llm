The Amusement Park Anxiety Attack: A Wake-Up Call for My Mental Health. 

I still recall the day my world came crashing down at the amusement park in the summer of 2021. What was supposed to be a fun-filled day with friends turned into a nightmare after a heavy meal and dehydration caught up with me. As I waited in line for a rollercoaster, I felt a familiar knot in my stomach - a symptom of my emetophobia, or fear of vomiting. Suddenly, my anxiety spiked, and I was hit with a panic attack. The gastrointestinal symptoms that followed were unbearable, including severe constipation. It was a wake-up call, forcing me to confront my anxiety head-on. That day, I realized that my mental health was closely tied to my physical well-being. I've since made a conscious effort to prioritize self-care, staying hydrated and managing my anxiety to prevent such episodes. It was a tough lesson, but one that has significantly improved my overall quality of life.
