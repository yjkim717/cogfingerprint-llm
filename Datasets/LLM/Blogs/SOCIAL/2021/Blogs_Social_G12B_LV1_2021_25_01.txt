## The Unexpected Joy of Tangible Nostalgia

It's weird, isn't it? How much we live online these days. Scrolling, liking, sharing… it’s become the default. But lately, I’ve been craving something… real. Something I can *hold*.

That’s why I'm diving headfirst into a project that feels delightfully retro: custom game cases. Specifically, for my old GBA, GBC, and GameCube games. Remember the satisfying *click* of those cartridges sliding into the console? The artwork on the cases?

I'm messing around with Blender, trying to design some cool, personalized shells. It’s a surprisingly relaxing process, a welcome break from the constant digital noise.  I'm even thinking of sharing progress on Instagram – maybe others feel this pull towards tangible nostalgia too?  It's a small thing, but finding joy in creating something physical feels… grounding.  Anyone else rediscovering the charm of the offline world? Let me know!
