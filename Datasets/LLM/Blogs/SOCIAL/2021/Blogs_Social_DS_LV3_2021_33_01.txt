You know that feeling when you spot a cop in your rearview mirror? My heart did a little tap dance last Tuesday on my commute home. Suddenly, I was the world’s most conscientious driver, my eyes glued to the speedometer, my foot feather-light on the gas.

The posted limit was 45, and by golly, I was doing 44. But the line of cars stacking up behind me had other ideas. I could feel the collective impatience thickening the air. Then it happened. A beat-up sedan roared past me, crossing a solid set of **double yellow** lines in a blatantly **illegal** pass, right under the nose of the **traffic cop** on my tail.

I held my breath, waiting for the flashing lights. For the justice! But… nothing. The cop just continued trailing me, a silent sentinel, as the other car sped off into the distance.

It was a stark 2021 reminder that the rules of the road are often as unpredictable as the people on it. We try to do the right thing, but the enforcement isn't always consistent, leaving you to wonder what the point was in the first place.
