## The Unseen Load: Asking for Space When You're Falling

Okay, real talk. Things haven't been easy lately. I’m sharing this because, well, honestly, the curated perfection we see online can be so isolating. It’s hard to feel like you’re *allowed* to be struggling when everyone else seems to be thriving.

I'm navigating a relapse with my eating disorder. It’s a beast, this thing, and it has a way of creeping back in when you least expect it. The shame is immense. The guilt, even more so. I feel like I’m letting everyone down – my friends, my family, my colleagues. 

And the pressure! Especially in 2021, with the world still reeling, there's this unspoken expectation to just *keep going*. To be productive, to be positive, to be *okay*. But I’m not okay. Not right now.

So, I’m facing a tough decision: asking for a leave of absence from work to focus on treatment and, frankly, just *me*. The thought terrifies me. What will people think? Will I be seen as weak? Will it impact my career? 

But then I remember the countless hours spent hiding, restricting, battling this internal war. And I realize, prioritizing my mental health isn’t a weakness. It’s a necessity. It’s an act of self-preservation.

This isn't easy to share, but I hope it resonates with someone out there who's feeling similarly overwhelmed. You are not alone. And sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is ask for space to heal.
