There’s something deeply satisfying about giving old things new life—especially when it comes to my retro game collection. Back in 2021, I found myself diving into the world of custom game cases for my beloved GB, GBC, and GBA cartridges. I’d always hated how they just sat in drawers, forgotten. So, armed with Blender and a pile of spare GameCube and PSP cases, I started tinkering.

It wasn’t just about aesthetics; it was about preserving memories. Each cart slot modification felt like stitching together pieces of my childhood. And honestly, seeing those custom cases lined up on my shelf brought back the same joy I felt unwrapping a new game years ago. Who knew a little 3D editing could feel so personal?
