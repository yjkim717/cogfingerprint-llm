As I sat down to sketch my latest character, I couldn't help but wonder: should I include vitiligo in their design? I wanted to represent this condition authentically, but I was hesitant, fearing I might inadvertently offend those who live with it. I turned to social media, asking for feedback from the vitiligo community. The response was overwhelming, and it sparked a crucial conversation about representation, aesthetic, and respect in art.
