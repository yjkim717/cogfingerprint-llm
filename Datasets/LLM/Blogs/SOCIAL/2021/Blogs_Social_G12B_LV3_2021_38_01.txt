## The Hum of Growth: Bo Burnham, Grow Lamps, and Finding Light in the Dark

Okay, so I’ve been down a *serious* Bo Burnham rabbit hole lately, specifically rewatching "Inside." And something clicked with me this time around that I hadn't noticed before. It's the grow lamps. Remember those? Especially in "FaceTime with my Mom"? 

I've also recently gotten into gardening – a pandemic-era hobby if there ever was one. It's surprisingly meditative, watching tiny seeds push through the soil. And suddenly, seeing those harsh, utilitarian grow lamps in Burnham’s performance felt less about the isolation, and more about *growth*. Like, even in the darkest, most confined spaces, you can cultivate something. A weird, beautiful, slightly unsettling thing. It's a reminder that even when things feel stagnant, there’s potential for change, for reaching for the light. Anyone else feeling this lately?
