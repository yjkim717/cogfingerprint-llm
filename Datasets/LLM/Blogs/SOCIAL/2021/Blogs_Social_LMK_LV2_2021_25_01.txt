As I sit here surrounded by retro gaming goodies, I'm reminded of the countless hours spent playing on my old GBA. Now, I'm on a mission to give my beloved games a fresh new look. I'm repurposing GameCube cases to create custom sleeves for my GB, GBC, and GBA cartridges using 3D editing software like Blender. It's a labor of love, and I'm excited to share my journey with fellow retro gaming enthusiasts. Who else is nostalgic for the good old days of gaming?
