**The Weight of "Just Be Independent"**

Okay, real talk. 2021 felt like everyone was trying to “level up,” and for me, that meant finally figuring out how to move out. It sounded amazing in theory – freedom, my own space… but then my mom started dropping hints about how much she’d miss me. And then the gentle (read: not-so-gentle) guilt trips began. 

Suddenly, my independence felt less like a victory and more like a failure. It’s weird, right? Like I was letting her down. I started questioning everything – was this a normal part of growing up and leaving the nest? Was I being overly sensitive? 

Honestly, it was a surprisingly emotional process. It highlighted a deeper issue in our family dynamics – a need for reassurance that maybe wasn’t being met. Moving out shouldn’t feel like a betrayal, should it?

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the summary?
