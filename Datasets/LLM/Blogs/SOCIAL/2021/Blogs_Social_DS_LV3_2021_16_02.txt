The year 2021 was supposed to be about moving forward, but a whispered family secret pulled me back into the past. Suddenly, the coping mechanisms I’d built felt fragile. My first counseling session was terrifying—admitting I wasn’t okay felt like failure. But in that safe space, I learned that healing isn’t a straight line. Some days I feel strong; others, I fight the pull of old habits. The work is hard, but untangling this pain is the only way to keep from regressing, to finally find solid ground.
