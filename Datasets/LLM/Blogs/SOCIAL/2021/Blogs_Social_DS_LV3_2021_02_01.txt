It’s 2021, and I’m deep into the latest No Man’s Sky expedition, feeling that familiar mix of awe and frustration. My ship is stranded light-years away, and I’m low on everything—fuel, supplies, hope. Then I stumble upon this unassuming trading post, a beacon in the void.

Suddenly, the game shifts. I’m bartering for rare resources, learning refiner recipes that feel like secret alchemy. It’s not just about survival anymore; it’s about connection. In a year when real-life interactions were scarce, this digital outpost became my social hub—trading tips with fellow travelers, sharing discoveries, turning scarcity into solidarity. Who knew a virtual trading post could remind me how much we thrive when we help each other?
