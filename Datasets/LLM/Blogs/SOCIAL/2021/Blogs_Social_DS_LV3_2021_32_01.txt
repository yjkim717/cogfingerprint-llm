It’s strange how the people who are supposed to love you the most can sometimes be the source of your deepest pain. For years, I carried the weight of my family’s expectations, their criticisms, and a constant, low-grade hum of stress that followed me everywhere. It was 2021, and the world was slowly trying to piece itself back together, but my own foundation felt more fractured than ever.

Growing up, I thought the emotional whiplash—the sudden coldness after a moment of warmth, the guilt trips disguised as concern—was just part of family life. I didn’t have a word for it then, but now I know it was emotional neglect, peppered with manipulation that left me questioning my own reality. The holidays, the phone calls, the obligatory visits… each one felt like walking through a minefield. I’d spend days mentally preparing, and even longer recovering from the exhaustion.

The breaking point came during a video call that was supposed to be cheerful. My mother’s voice was laced with that familiar, subtle toxicity as she commented on my life choices, and my father, as usual, was just… absent, even while on screen. It hit me then: I was pouring energy into a relationship that only drained me, hoping for a "normal" family dynamic that would never exist.

So, I made the hardest, yet most necessary, decision of my life: I went no contact.

It wasn’t an act of rebellion, but one of survival. The first few weeks were filled with guilt and a strange silence where the anxiety used to live. But slowly, that silence became peace. For the first time, I could breathe without waiting for the next critique or emotional landmine. I started rebuilding my sense of self, free from the narrative they had written for me.

Choosing to step away from abuse—whether overt or subtle—isn’t about hatred; it’s about choosing yourself. It’s about trading constant stress for the chance at a calm, authentic life. And in that quiet space, I’ve found something I always yearned for: the beginnings of my own peace.
