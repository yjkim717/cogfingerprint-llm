"Unpacking the Symbolism of Light in Bo Burnham's 'Inside' (2021)

As I watched Bo Burnham's 'Inside' during the pandemic, I couldn't help but notice the deliberate use of lighting throughout the special. One element that stood out was the grow lamp - a seemingly mundane object that took on a deeper significance. Burnham's decision to feature this unusual light source may be more than just a quirky aesthetic choice. To me, it symbolizes personal growth and transformation. Just as a grow lamp nurtures plants in the absence of natural light, Burnham's character is forced to confront his inner self in the isolation of his home. The grow lamp becomes a powerful metaphor for the ways in which we're all trying to grow and thrive, even in the darkest of times. It's a poignant reminder that, with the right 'lighting', we can cultivate inner strength and emerge stronger."
