## The Tiny Terror and My Own Jitters

Bringing home a kitten is supposed to be all sunshine and fluffy cuddles, right? Well, mine, a ridiculously cute eight-week-old ball of fur, has thrown a *tiny* wrench in that idyllic picture. He hasn't pooped yet. Seriously. 

It's probably just nerves, the vet assured me – a common thing with new arrivals. But honestly? His little digestive standstill has mirrored my own anxieties perfectly. 2021 has been a year of adjustments, of navigating the unknown. And suddenly, I’m worrying about a kitten’s bowel movements! It’s a comforting, albeit slightly bizarre, reminder that we’re all just adjusting, one tiny step (or…poop) at a time.

**Notes on Choices:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Seriously," and "Well, mine..." to create a more casual feel.
*   **Reflective:** I tied the kitten's experience to the broader feeling of adjustment and anxiety prevalent in 2021.
*   **Relatable:** Many people can connect with the feeling of unexpected worries and the slightly absurd anxieties that come with new responsibilities.
*   **Storytelling:** It starts with a specific, relatable problem and then expands to a broader reflection.
*   **Word Count:** Roughly 110 words.



Let me know if you'd like any adjustments or a different approach!
