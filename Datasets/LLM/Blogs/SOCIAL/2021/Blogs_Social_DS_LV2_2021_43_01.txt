Of course. Here is a reflective blog post written from the perspective of the wife in the summary.

### The Unseen Shift: When My Desk Became the Office Anchor

It’s 8:03 PM. The office is silent except for the hum of the server room and the frantic clicking of my mouse. I’m covering for Sarah, again. Sarah, who is at home, probably exhausted but blissfully cuddling her newborn. Sarah, who is on a protected, paid maternity leave.

And me? I’m just… here.

My husband calls it the “childfree penalty,” and honestly, he’s not wrong. He sees me come home drained, my own projects pushed to the back burner in favor of keeping Sarah’s accounts from imploding. He’s the one who first put a name to the hollow feeling in my stomach: it’s not about Sarah. I’m genuinely happy for her. It’s about a system that feels fundamentally lopsided.

Let’s be clear. I believe in maternity leave. I voted for politicians who support it, I champion the FMLA. Supporting new parents isn’t just a nice-to-have; it’s a must-have for a civilized society.

But what about supporting the rest of us?

The issue isn’t the leave itself; it’s the invisible, unpaid overtime that becomes the burden of those of us without children. It’s the assumption that because I don’t have a soccer game to rush to, my time is less valuable. That my evening yoga class or my quiet dinner with my husband is a flexible, cancellable commodity. This “all-hands-on-deck” mentality only ever seems to deploy the hands that aren’t changing diapers.

I’ve become the office anchor, holding down the fort while my colleagues sail off on the legally protected, paid leave that I help subsidize with my own unpaid labor. And what do I get? A “Thanks, you’re a lifesaver!” and the silent expectation that I’ll do it all again in six months when another announcement email hits our inbox.

This isn’t a war between parents and the childfree. This is a conversation about workplace fairness. If we, as a company, value family, then we must value *all* families—including the one I’ve built with my husband. That means fair compensation for extra work, or better yet, hiring temporary cover so no one’s personal life becomes collateral damage.

True fairness means creating a structure where we can all support each other without someone silently drowning. Because right now, this anchor is starting to feel awfully heavy.
