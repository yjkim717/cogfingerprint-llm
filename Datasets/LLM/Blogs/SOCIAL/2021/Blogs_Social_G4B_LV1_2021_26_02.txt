**The Quiet Shame of the Sidewalk Stare**

Okay, so 2021 was… a lot, right? Between the pandemic and everything else, I was just trying to carve out a little bit of normalcy. That meant taking Finn, our goofy golden retriever, for walks. Simple, right? Wrong. 

We live on a pretty quiet street, and I’d started noticing this pattern. Every. Single. Walk. A neighbor – usually a couple, always with a polite, but pointed, question about Finn’s neuter status. And then the little comments about his “enthusiastic” walks. Like, seriously? 

It started to feel… heavy. Like I was being subtly judged for being a dog owner. I’m not saying everyone *means* to be hurtful, but the constant questioning felt like a quiet shame. It made me want to pull Finn close and just hide. 

I realize now that it’s probably just small-town curiosity, but it really got to me. It’s a weird reminder that even in the most outwardly friendly communities, there can be an undercurrent of judgment, and it’s something we all have to navigate.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
