## The Unexpected Lesson From "My 600lb Life"

Okay, so I know it sounds random, but I’ve been thinking a lot about "My 600lb Life" lately. Specifically, why, in the midst of a 2021 pandemic where grocery delivery was practically a lifeline, do so few of the individuals on the show seem to utilize it? 

It’s not just about the logistics, right? It feels like there's a deeper layer there – a reluctance to accept help, a comfort in routine, or maybe even a feeling of shame. It’s made me reflect on how we all build these invisible walls around ourselves, and how sometimes, the simplest solutions are the hardest to embrace. It’s a strange, but surprisingly poignant, observation from a reality show.
