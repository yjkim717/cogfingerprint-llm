You know, it’s funny—back in 2021, when so many of us were still stuck at home, I found myself diving deep into Star Wars fan forums. One post in particular caught my eye: a fan’s dream casting for a live-action Darth Bane trilogy. They’d mapped out every role with such passion, imagining actors who could bring that dark, ancient Sith lore to life.

It got me thinking about how we connect through stories, even when we’re physically apart. In a year defined by distance, these shared universes—whether on screen or in books—became our common ground. We weren’t just fans casting characters; we were building community, finding comfort in collective imagination.

That’s the real power of fandom, isn’t it? It reminds us that, no matter how isolated we feel, our dreams and creativity can still bring us together.
