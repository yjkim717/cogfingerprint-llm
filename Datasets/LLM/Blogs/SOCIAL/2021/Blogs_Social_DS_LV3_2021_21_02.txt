It’s 2021, and I’m sitting across from my mentor, nervously explaining a big life decision I’d made. I was so anxious, waiting for her judgment. Instead, she smiled and said, “You know your life better than anyone.”

That simple advice was a turning point. I realized I’d been outsourcing my confidence, seeking validation for choices only I could truly navigate. My circumstances, my values—they were unique. Trusting my own judgment wasn’t about having all the answers; it was about trusting myself to find them.

Now, when uncertainty creeps in, I remember that conversation. It’s empowering to realize the best guide for your life has been with you all along.
