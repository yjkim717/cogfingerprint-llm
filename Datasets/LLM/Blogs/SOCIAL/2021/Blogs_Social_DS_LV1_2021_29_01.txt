It’s been a few months since Kentaro Miura’s passing, and I still haven’t watched *Berserk*. I feel this weird, quiet guilt about it.

When the news broke in May, my social feeds were flooded with tributes—fan art, favorite panels, stories of how Guts’ struggle resonated. I wanted to join that collective mourning, to understand the legacy everyone was celebrating. But every time I thought about starting the anime, I just… couldn’t. It felt like a chore. The only way to access it easily was through sketchy pirate sites, which just added another layer of unease.

It’s strange, this pressure to participate in digital grief. I wish I could honestly say I’ve experienced the masterpiece everyone is praising. Maybe someday. But for now, my silence feels like the most honest tribute I can give.
