It’s late, 2021, and I’m scrolling again. The blue light of my phone feels like the only constant in a world that’s perpetually on fire. I’m not just tired; I’m world-weary. It’s a specific kind of exhaustion that seeps into your bones, a low hum of despair that’s become my default setting.

It started with the big stuff, of course. The relentless news cycle, the climate anxiety, the pandemic’s endless tail. But lately, it’s the small, daily digital abrasions that are grinding me down. The performative outrage on Twitter, the curated perfection on Instagram, the endless, empty debates in comment sections. It all feels so loud and so meaningless at the same time. I find myself clicking through stories, my thumb moving on autopilot, absorbing a thousand micro-dramas that aren’t mine, for hours, until my brain feels like static.

And in that static, the darker thoughts sometimes find a foothold. It’s not a plan, not even a true desire, but a quiet, terrifying whisper: *What if I just… stopped?* What if I could opt out of this entire frantic, overwhelming performance? The thought is a release valve for the pressure, a fantasy of ultimate quiet. It scares me, but I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t there, a shadow in the corner of my screen.

I’m not writing this for sympathy. I think I’m writing it to see if anyone else feels this way—truly feels it, beneath the memes and the relatable “I want to cease existing” tweets that we use to sand the edges off our genuine pain. We’ve turned our deepest struggles into internet culture, a shared language of despair that somehow makes it feel more isolating.

What I’m truly longing for isn’t viral fame or a perfectly crafted online persona. It’s stability. A quiet morning where my first thought isn’t to check my notifications. A conversation that doesn’t feel like it’s being staged for an audience. A sense that my life is happening *here*, in this room, with this breath, and not out there in the chaotic, soul-sucking ether. I think that’s the real fight right now: pulling our consciousness back from the digital brink and remembering what it feels like to just be a person, quietly, un-optimized, and alive.
