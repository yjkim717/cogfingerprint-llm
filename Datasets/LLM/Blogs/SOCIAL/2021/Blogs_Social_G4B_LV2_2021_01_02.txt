**The Rocket League Rumble & Why We Need a Break**

Okay, real talk. Remember 2021? It felt like everyone was glued to their screens, and I was definitely spending way too much time in Rocket League. I loved the chaotic fun, the satisfying goals – it was a genuinely *casual* game. 

But then came that update. Suddenly, you were trapped! No easy way out, no quick escape if a match turned into a shouting match. It felt… aggressive. And honestly, it brought out the worst in some players. Toxic chat, frustration spilling over – it completely killed the chill. 

It made me think about how much online spaces can impact our mood, and how important it is to recognize when a game, or a community, isn't serving us anymore. Sometimes, stepping away is the biggest win of all.
