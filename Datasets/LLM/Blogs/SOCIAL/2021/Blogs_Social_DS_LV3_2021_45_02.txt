It was late 2021, and my Apple Watch battery was suddenly draining by lunchtime. I’d updated to watchOS 7.2, and the new handwashing feature was the culprit—its microphone and sensors constantly listening for the sound of running water. Turning it off felt like a small rebellion against being overly monitored, even for a good cause. My watch’s battery life was restored, but it made me pause and reflect on our constant trade-off between convenience and privacy.
