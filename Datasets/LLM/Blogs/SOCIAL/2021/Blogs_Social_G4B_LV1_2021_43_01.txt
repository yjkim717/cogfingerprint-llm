**The Invisible Weight: Why Maternity Leave Still Feels Like a Battle**

Okay, let’s be real. 2021. We’re *supposed* to be moving forward, right? Yet, I’ve been wrestling with something that feels incredibly frustrating and, frankly, a little heartbreaking: the way maternity leave is treated – or *not* treated – in the workplace. 

I recently saw a post on LinkedIn about a friend who’d just returned from maternity leave and was immediately thrown back into a frantic, overwhelming workload. It hit me hard. It's not a new thing, is it? The unspoken expectation that stepping away for nine months – a *huge* life event – somehow diminishes your value.

I remember feeling that pressure myself. The worry about my career stalling, the guilt about taking time away, and the stark realization that my colleagues without kids weren’t facing the same barrage of questions and a presumed drop in performance. 

It’s not about entitlement; it’s about fairness. Shouldn't a family leave policy be genuinely supportive, offering compensation and acknowledging the massive shift in someone’s life?  We talk about gender equality, but how can we truly achieve it if we’re still penalizing women for starting families? 

Let's start having honest conversations about this.  It’s time to move beyond lip service and build a system that actually supports *all* employees, regardless of their family status.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
