As an artist, my sketchbook has always been my safe space. But when I drew my first character with vitiligo last week, hesitation crept in. Was this representation or appropriation? In 2021, awareness feels more crucial than ever—yet so does respect. I don’t want to offend; I want to honor. So I’m asking you: how can art celebrate conditions like vitiligo without reducing them to mere aesthetics? Your stories could guide my hand.
