**The City Dream vs. The Reality Check**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 felt like everyone was chasing the city dream. Shiny condos, trendy restaurants, walkable streets… it was *the* place to be. But I’ve been feeling a serious twinge of frustration lately, and it’s all about affordability. 

I was scrolling through listings last month, desperately searching for a condo in downtown, and it was like wading through a digital desert. Beautiful spaces, huge price tags – completely out of reach. Meanwhile, I saw listings popping up in smaller towns just a short drive away, offering similar square footage for a fraction of the cost. 

It’s not about wanting a McMansion, it's about a decent place to live in a vibrant city!  It feels like the city is pricing itself out of reality, leaving a lot of people stuck renting in places they don’t *want* to be.  Anyone else feeling this tug-of-war between aspiration and, well, actual financial sanity?  Let's talk about it.
