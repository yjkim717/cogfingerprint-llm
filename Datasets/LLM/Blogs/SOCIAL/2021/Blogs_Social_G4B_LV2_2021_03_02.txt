**The Quiet Hum of Connection**

Remember 2021? It felt… strange, didn’t it? So much of our lives happened through screens – Zoom calls, endless scrolling, and a constant stream of updates we didn’t always *want* to see. I found myself oddly preoccupied with social media, almost obsessively checking for notifications. 

It wasn't about the likes, honestly. It was this low-level anxiety, this feeling of needing to know *everything* happening in everyone’s lives. Like a washing machine constantly churning, trying to clean up a mess of information. 

But then, I started intentionally stepping back. I focused on the quiet hum of connection – a real phone call with a friend, a handwritten card, a walk in the park without my phone.  It was a reminder that true connection isn’t about broadcasting; it’s about *being* present.  And sometimes, the best maintenance for your soul is disconnecting from the noise.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a post focused on a slightly different angle?
