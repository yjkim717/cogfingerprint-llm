"Fandom Casting Dreams: Bringing Darth Bane to Life

As I binge-watched the latest Star Wars content in 2021, I couldn't help but think about the rich lore that exists beyond the screens. The Darth Bane trilogy, a series of books that explores the origins of the Sith, has always fascinated me. What if it were adapted into a live-action film trilogy? The possibilities are endless. 

I've been daydreaming about my dream cast for such a project. Who would bring the iconic characters to life? I'd cast Michael Fassbender as Darth Bane - his intense gaze and brooding presence would be perfect for the role. The cast would need to be just as captivating for the other characters. Casting is a fun exercise that lets fans engage with the story in new ways. What are your dream casting choices for a hypothetical Darth Bane trilogy?"
