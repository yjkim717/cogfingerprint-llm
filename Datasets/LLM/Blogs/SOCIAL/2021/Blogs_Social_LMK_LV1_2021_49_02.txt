As I binge-watched My600lbLife during the pandemic, a thought struck me - why don't these individuals use online grocery ordering? In 2021, with COVID-19 cases surging, it seemed like a convenient solution. But as I reflected on their struggles, I realized it's not that simple. For many, grocery shopping is a necessary outing that provides a sense of normalcy. Their shopping behavior is often tied to their daily routines and emotional coping mechanisms. Online ordering might not be the answer; it's a complex issue that requires a deeper understanding of their lives and struggles.
