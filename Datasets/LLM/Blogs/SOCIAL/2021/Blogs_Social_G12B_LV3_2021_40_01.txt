## The Weight of Appearances (and the Real Weight I'm Carrying)

Okay, let’s be real for a minute. Social media, right? It’s a carefully curated highlight reel. Everyone’s vacations are perfect, their careers are thriving, and their avocado toast is *always* Instagram-worthy. And for a long time, I felt this immense pressure to keep up. To portray this image of success, of having it all together. 

But behind the filtered selfies and celebratory posts, I’ve been battling something for years – an eating disorder, specifically bulimia. It’s been a long, exhausting fight, and honestly, it’s been taking a serious toll on my mental health. 

This year, 2021, feels like a turning point. I’ve realized that continuing to push myself, to prioritize appearances over my wellbeing, is unsustainable. I'm at a point where I need to prioritize *me*. I'm seriously considering requesting some time off work, or even a reduced schedule, to focus on getting back into treatment. 

The thought fills me with guilt. Will my colleagues think I’m not dedicated? Will I be seen as failing? The fear of shattering the facade I’ve so carefully constructed is paralyzing. But I know deep down that pretending everything is fine isn't a solution. It’s just adding more weight to an already heavy burden.

This isn't about weakness. It's about strength. It’s about choosing my mental health, choosing recovery, and choosing to be honest, even when it’s scary. It’s a journey, and I’m hoping to find others who’ve walked a similar path. Because sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is admit you need help.
