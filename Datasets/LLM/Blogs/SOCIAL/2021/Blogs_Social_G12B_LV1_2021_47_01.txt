>## The Scroll & The Spiral: Finding Balance in 2021

Okay, real talk. Remember when everyone was obsessed with bullet journaling? I jumped on the bandwagon last year, envisioning a beautifully organized life overflowing with perfectly penned tasks and inspiring quotes. Reality? It was…a struggle. 

I’d buy gorgeous pens, meticulously plan layouts, and then…nothing. The journal would sit, taunting me with its pristine pages. It felt like *another* task to add to my already overflowing to-do list. 

Then I realized, I was trying too hard. I shifted focus. Now, it’s less about perfect spreads and more about just *showing up*. A few lines about my day, a quick gratitude list, even just a doodle. It’s a messy, imperfect reflection, but it’s *mine*, and honestly, that's enough. And in the chaos of 2021, sometimes “enough” is a victory.
