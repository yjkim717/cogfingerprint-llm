**Rosie and the Puzzle of the Park**

It’s funny how quickly a seemingly good thing can turn into a worry, isn’t it? Last year, I was so excited for Rosie, my English Mastiff, to finally experience dog parks. I pictured her, a gentle giant, making new friends and happily sniffing butts. But the reality was…well, a little different. 

She'd tolerate other dogs, even sometimes seem curious, but the moment things got a little too close, she’d snap. Aggression at the park, baffling! It felt like a cruel twist – she was *okay* with them, just not *comfortable*. 

It made me realize how complex dog socialization truly is. It’s not just about quantity of exposure, but quality, too. I started focusing on short, positive interactions, and slowly, Rosie started to relax. It was a reminder that sometimes, the biggest challenges reveal the most about our furry friends.
