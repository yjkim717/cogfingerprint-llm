The soft bristles of my makeup brush have become my morning meditation. Each stroke is a small act of control in a world that often feels chaotic. But here’s the painful paradox: the very thing that grounds me is what my family uses to dismiss my depression.

“How can you be so unwell if you can still do a full face of makeup?” my mother asked recently, her voice laced with skepticism rather than concern. That question now echoes in my mind, feeding a new kind of anxiety. I find myself hesitating before picking up my favorite palette, a silent war waging inside. Should I stop? Should I let the dark circles and pale skin show, just to appear more “believable”? Would neglecting this one thing that brings me a flicker of joy finally earn me the validation and help I desperately need?

It’s a heartbreaking choice no one should have to make—between a small, personal comfort and being taken seriously in your suffering. My makeup isn’t a mask hiding my pain; sometimes, it’s the only reason I can even look in the mirror.
