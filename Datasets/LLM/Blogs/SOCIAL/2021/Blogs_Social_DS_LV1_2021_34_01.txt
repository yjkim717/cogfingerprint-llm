It’s 2021, and I’m sitting on my bedroom floor, surrounded by half-packed boxes. My Adderall is working—I’m focused, just not on moving. My brain’s stuck in task paralysis mode, screaming, "Where do you even start?" I’ve read all the motivational tips, but my ADHD executive dysfunction laughs in the face of logic.

So I did something radical: I texted a friend. "Hey, can you just sit here while I pack?" No help needed, just presence. And you know what? It worked. Sometimes the best hack isn’t a strategy, but a person—reminding you that you’re not in this alone.
