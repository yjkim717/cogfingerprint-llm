## The "What If?" That Keeps Me Up at Night (and Halo)

Okay, hear me out. Lately, I've been replaying *Halo 2* and *Halo 3*, and something just clicked. Wouldn’t it be incredible to experience the whole arc – from the Covenant invasion on Earth through the Flood on Installation 04 – as one cohesive novel? Imagine a single, sprawling narrative weaving in *Halo 3: ODST*’s heartbreaking story. 

It's a silly thought, I know, but it highlights how much we crave connected experiences. We’re constantly chasing that feeling of immersion, aren't we? What stories are *you* wishing were told differently?
