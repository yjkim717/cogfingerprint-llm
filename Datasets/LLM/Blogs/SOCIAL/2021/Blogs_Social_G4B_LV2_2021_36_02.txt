**Concrete Jungles and Screen Dreams**

Okay, real talk: how many times have you watched a show set in New York City and just… sighed? Like, a *big* sigh? I’ve been feeling this lately, especially with all the recent Gossip Girl reboots. It’s not that the actors are amazing or the storylines are bad – it’s just… the traffic. Seriously, the *traffic*. 

It’s a constant, low-humming frustration of city life, and yet, so many shows just gloss right over it. They’ll show rooftop parties and designer clothes, but a yellow cab perpetually stuck in gridlock? Nope. 

Living in NYC in 2021, you become intimately familiar with the chaos. It’s part of the charm, honestly, but it’s also a reality. I crave more authentic portrayals – a little grit, a little honking, a little honest reflection of how we actually *move* through this incredible, frustrating, beautiful city. 

What shows have you noticed this with?
