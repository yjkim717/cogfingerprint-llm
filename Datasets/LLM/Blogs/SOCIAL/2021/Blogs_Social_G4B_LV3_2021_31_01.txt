**That First Date Glow – It’s Real, Seriously**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 felt like a year of just… existing, didn’t it? Scrolling, Zoom calls, and a serious longing for genuine connection. Then, last month, I went on a first date. And honestly? It felt…different.  

It wasn’t fireworks, not in the cliché sense. It was just…comfortable.  Laughing at silly things, actually *listening* to each other, and a shared hope that maybe, just maybe, this could be something more.  

I’d been single for ages, and the idea of romance felt a little distant. But that date sparked this unexpected rush of excitement – a feeling of possibility I hadn’t realized I’d been missing. It's a quiet happiness, a hopeful little ember glowing in my chest.  It reminded me that sometimes, the best things arrive when you least expect them, and that a simple, good date can really shift your perspective.  Anyone else feeling this after their own recent dates?
