### The Midnight Serenade I Never Asked For

It’s 2:17 AM, and the silence of my 2021 apartment is shattered by a sound that’s equal parts mournful and demanding. It’s my cat, Luna, holding a solo concert at my bedroom door. This is our new normal.

For over a year, my home office was her kingdom. Our days were punctuated by lunchtime wand toy sessions and sun-puddle breaks. But as the world slowly reopened and I returned to the office, our rhythm broke. The long, leisurely cat walks that used to tire her out became rushed weekend events.

I thought she’d just sleep more. Instead, she’s storing up all her unused energy for a midnight protest. That plaintive howl isn’t just noise; it’s a cry for the connection we lost. She’s not trying to annoy me—she’s confused. Her favorite human is suddenly gone for hours, and the familiar routine that made her feel secure has vanished.

It’s a stark reminder that the "return to normal" isn't just a human adjustment. Our pets felt the shift, too. So tonight, instead of shushing her, I open the door. It’s not about giving in, but about finding a new rhythm, together.
