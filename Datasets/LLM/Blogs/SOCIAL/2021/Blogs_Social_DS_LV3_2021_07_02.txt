Looking back on my move from St. Catharines in 2021, I still remember the hunt for the perfect nose piercing. After a couple of bad experiences at local tattoo shops, I became determined to find a true professional. It wasn't just about the jewelry; it was about trust and safety. I learned to specifically seek out APP-certified piercers—it’s a standard that means everything. Your body is your home; you should only let the most qualified professionals make permanent changes to it.
