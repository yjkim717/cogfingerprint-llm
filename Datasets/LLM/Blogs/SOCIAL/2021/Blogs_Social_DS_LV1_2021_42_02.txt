The drive-thru speaker crackled to life, but it wasn't his voice. That’s when I knew.

For three years, Carlos was part of the rhythm of my 2021 shifts at the neighborhood market. Every Tuesday, he’d pull up, order the same coffee, and check his numbers on the lotto board. We’d chat about his grandkids or the relentless news cycle. He was a fixture, a friendly constant in a world that still felt shaky.

When my manager quietly told me he’d passed, the "VOID" stamp on his usual ticket felt heavier than ever. It’s a strange grief, mourning a customer. They aren't family, but these familiar faces weave themselves into the fabric of our daily lives. We build tiny, significant connections in the most mundane places. His absence is a quiet reminder of how these small interactions—these micro-communities—truly shape our days and leave a void when they’re gone.
