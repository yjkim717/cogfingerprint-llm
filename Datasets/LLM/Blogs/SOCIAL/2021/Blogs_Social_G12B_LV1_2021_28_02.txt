## The Glow of a New Screen (and a Little Bit of Imposter Syndrome)

Remember that feeling of finally conquering something you thought was way out of reach? That's been my week. I finally built my own PC! It's been a goal for ages, fuelled by endless YouTube videos and late-night forum rabbit holes. I went with an AMD Ryzen 5 3600 and an RX 560 – nothing crazy, but enough to run most games.

Honestly, the whole process was a rollercoaster. There were moments of sheer panic (“Did I plug *that* in?!”), followed by bursts of triumphant “Yes! It works!”. Now, staring at the screen, it’s… surreal. It’s *mine*. 

But then the imposter syndrome creeps in. Everyone online seems to have liquid cooling and RGB everything. Still, it's a start. And I’m enjoying the satisfying click of my new SteelSeries G502 mouse. Baby steps, right?
