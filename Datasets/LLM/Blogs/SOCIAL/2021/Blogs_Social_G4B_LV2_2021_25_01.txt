**The Quiet Obsession of Pixel Dust**

It’s funny, isn’t it? In 2021, with everyone glued to their phones, I found myself completely lost in the nostalgia of old Game Boys. Specifically, designing custom cases. It started as a simple “what if?” – could I build a sleek, modern case for my childhood games? 

I dove into 3D modeling, obsessed with finding the perfect balance between protection and a little bit of geeky flair. It reminded me of the early days of online forums, that quiet, hopeful space where people shared passions.  There’s something deeply satisfying about creating something tangible from a digital idea, a little piece of pixelated history.  Maybe it’s a reaction to the constant, overwhelming noise of social media – a need for a focused, personal project.  Who knew a little Game Boy could lead me here?
