>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided summary and instructions. I've aimed for a conversational, reflective, and relatable tone, keeping the 2021 context in mind (social media saturation, etc.).  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: The Scroll Hole & The To-Do List: A Constant Tug-of-War**

Okay, real talk. Anyone else feel like their brain is constantly battling itself? I do. Like, *constantly*. I'm medicated for ADHD, which helps… sometimes. But there’s still this persistent inertia, this feeling of just… being stuck. 

It's weird, right? I *want* to do things. I have a list, a perfectly curated list of goals and chores. Yet, somehow, I end up lost in the endless scroll of Instagram, comparing my behind-the-scenes to everyone else's highlight reel. 

2021 has been a year of feeling that disconnect even more acutely. Seeing everyone *seemingly* thriving online while I’m wrestling with the simplest tasks… it’s a lot. I'm trying to be kinder to myself, to acknowledge the struggle, and maybe, *just maybe*, put the phone down and tackle one tiny thing. Anyone else in this boat with me?

**Notes on this draft and potential expansions:**

*   **Relatability:** I tried to use language ("real talk," "anyone else") to foster connection.
*   **Honest struggle:** The post doesn't shy away from the fact that medication isn't a magic bullet.
*   **Social Media Context:**  The reference to Instagram and the comparison aspect grounds the post in the 2021 timeframe and a common experience.
*   **Call to action (small):** Suggesting tackling "one tiny thing" is a realistic and achievable goal.
*   **Further Development:** This could be expanded upon by discussing specific strategies the author has tried (or wants to try) to combat procrastination and social media distraction. You could also delve deeper into the emotional impact of comparing oneself to others online.
