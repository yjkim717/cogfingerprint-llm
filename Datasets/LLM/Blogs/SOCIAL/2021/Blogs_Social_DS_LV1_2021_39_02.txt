### The Park Bench Dilemma

It’s 2021, and after a year of lockdowns, the local dog park feels more like a social hub than ever. I see all these pups tumbling around, and I can’t help but feel a pang of… envy? Guilt?

My mastiff, Gus, is a gentle giant at home with our other dog. But here, on this bench, he’s a 150-pound statue of tension. His tail is tucked, a low rumble building in his chest as a happy-go-lucky Labrador bounces past. It’s not aggression born of dominance, but of pure, unadulterated fear.

I’ve realized that forcing him into this chaotic “social” scene is the opposite of helpful. True socialization isn’t just about exposure; it’s about positive, controlled experiences. So, we’re stepping back. Our new plan involves quiet walks at a distance and rewarding calm behavior. The goal isn’t to have the most popular dog at the park, but a confident and secure one, even if that means our social life looks a little different from the bench.
