Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and a 2021 context. I've included a suggested title and a couple of ideas for images you could use.  After the post, I've added some notes on why I made the choices I did.

**Title: The Lipstick and the Low Days**

It’s 2021, and we're all supposedly experts in self-care, right? Face masks, bubble baths, digital detoxes… I *want* to be that person. I really do. But sometimes, getting out of bed feels like climbing Everest. I’ve been navigating depression for a while now, and some days, just breathing feels like a victory.

So, why, on those days, do I sometimes find myself reaching for my makeup bag? It feels…conflicted. Like I should be prioritizing therapy or a nap, not painstakingly applying eyeliner. And then there's the added layer of my family's well-meaning (but frustrating) comments. “Why bother? You don’t *look* like you feel well.”

It’s not about putting on a facade, I think. It's a tiny act of control. A small way to feel…presentable, even when everything else feels chaotic. It’s a little ritual, a flicker of normalcy in a world that sometimes feels overwhelmingly gray. Maybe it *is* a form of self-care, even if it doesn't look like the curated Instagram version. Maybe it’s just okay to find joy in lipstick, even on a low day.

**Notes on Choices & Rationale:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "right?", "I want to be...", and "I think" to create a more personal and approachable feel, as if talking to a friend.
*   **Relatability:** I focused on the internal conflict and the common experience of feeling pressure from family, aiming to resonate with readers who might be facing similar struggles.
*   **Storytelling:**  I structured the post around a specific scenario (reaching for makeup) to draw the reader in and provide a concrete example of the author's feelings.
*   **2021 Context:** I subtly referenced the trends around self-care and social media ("curated Instagram version") to ground the post in the current year.
*   **Focus on Mental Health:** While mentioning makeup, the core of the post stays centered on the author’s experience with depression and the complexities of self-care during mental health struggles.
*   **Open-Endedness:** The conclusion isn’t prescriptive – it acknowledges the validity of finding small joys, even if they don’t fit the conventional definition of self-care.
