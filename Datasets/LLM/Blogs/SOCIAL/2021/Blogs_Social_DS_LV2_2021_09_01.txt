It’s 2021, and I’m deep in the EV rabbit hole, torn between a used Nissan Leaf and a Chevy Bolt. The numbers make sense—depreciation on CPO models is a steal—but my test drive left me wondering. Those Bolt seats just didn’t feel right after 20 minutes. Am I overthinking comfort for the sake of savings? I’d love to hear your thoughts, because honestly, this decision feels bigger than just specs and price tags. What’s your experience been like?
