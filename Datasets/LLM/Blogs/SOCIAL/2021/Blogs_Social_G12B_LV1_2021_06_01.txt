## When a Roo Landed in My Backyard (and My Life Got Weird)

Okay, so you know how 2021 has been… a *lot*. We've all been grappling with uncertainty, anxieties about the future, and a general feeling of "what is even happening?" Well, my personal “what is happening?” arrived in the form of a kangaroo. Seriously.

It started innocently enough. My Aunt Mildred, bless her eccentric heart, decided she was “rehoming” a kangaroo. Apparently, her attempt at a small petting zoo wasn't going as planned. And, for reasons I still can't fully comprehend, she decided I, a city-adjacent suburbanite with a meticulously planned herb garden, was the ideal recipient.

I tried to explain. I really did. "Aunt Mildred," I said, "I have a mortgage, a cat, and a crippling fear of heights. A kangaroo does *not* fit into that equation." But she was insistent, and honestly, the pleading in her eyes was hard to resist. 

So, Reginald (yes, she named him Reginald) arrived. And within 24 hours, he'd not only escaped my backyard, but he’d also decided my neighbor, Mrs. Henderson’s, prize-winning roses were a personal buffet. 

Chaos ensued. Picture this: me, chasing a six-foot-tall marsupial through the cul-de-sac, while Mrs. Henderson yelled about her hybrid tea roses and the neighborhood watch group started a frantic WhatsApp thread. I even ended up frantically trying to rig up an electric fence (don't judge – desperation does things to a person) while simultaneously fielding concerned calls from my sister, who thought I’d finally lost it completely.

It was ridiculous. Utterly, undeniably ridiculous. 

But amidst the absurdity, something shifted. My neighbors, initially annoyed, started helping. Mr. Davies, the retired engineer, offered advice on the fence. Sarah from across the street brought out carrots (apparently, kangaroos are partial to them). We were all united in this bizarre, shared experience. 

Reginald eventually made his way to a wildlife sanctuary (thank goodness), and my backyard is now kangaroo-free. But the whole ordeal reminded me that even in a year defined by isolation and fear, human connection can emerge from the most unexpected places – even a rogue kangaroo. And sometimes, all you can do is laugh, embrace the chaos, and hope your neighbors still talk to you.

Anyone else's 2021 involve unexpected wildlife?  Let me know in the comments!
