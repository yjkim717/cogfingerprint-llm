**The Scroll & The Sigh**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 was *the* year of social. TikTok was exploding, Instagram was still king, and Twitter felt like a constant, slightly chaotic argument. I spent way too much time scrolling, honestly. Like, *way* too much. 

I remember feeling this weird pressure, this need to document everything, to curate this perfect version of my life online. I’d spend an hour staging a photo of my coffee, meticulously filtering it, and then posting it with some vague, inspirational caption. It felt… exhausting. 

Then, I started noticing something. I was comparing myself to everyone else’s highlight reels.  Suddenly, my own life – the messy bits, the quiet days, the things I *didn’t* post – felt inadequate. It was like I was chasing a ghost of a feeling, a feeling of being "enough" based on likes and comments.

I took a step back. A big one. I significantly cut down my time on those platforms.  It wasn’t about quitting social media entirely – it was about reclaiming my attention and realizing that my worth wasn’t defined by a follower count. It was a quiet rebellion, a little sigh of relief amidst the endless scroll.  And honestly, it felt strangely liberating.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
