It was a crisp autumn morning in 2021 when I first noticed the shift in Bruno, my gentle giant of a mastiff. At home, he’s all wagging tail and slobbery kisses with our other dog, but the moment we step into the local dog park, something changes. His shoulders tense, his bark deepens, and that friendly glint in his eyes hardens into unease.

I used to think socialization was just about exposure—more visits, more sniffing, more play. But Bruno’s anxiety around unfamiliar dogs taught me it’s deeper than that. Aggression isn’t always about dominance; sometimes, it’s a plea for space, for understanding.

We’ve since stepped back from crowded parks, focusing instead on calm, controlled introductions. Training isn’t about “fixing” him—it’s about listening. Because even the biggest hearts can feel small in a world that moves too fast.
