As a third-year BSN student in 2021, I recall wondering how to land a PCT job with little healthcare experience. I realized that many nursing students share this struggle. To increase my chances, I focused on highlighting transferable skills, such as communication and empathy, and emphasized my eagerness to learn. I also tailored my resume and cover letter to each job, showcasing my nursing program's relevance. By being proactive and confident, I eventually secured a PCT role, gaining invaluable experience that shaped my nursing career.
