### The Summer I Stopped Faking It

Everyone’s Instagram feed in 2021 was a cascade of rooftop parties and beach trips, a collective sigh of relief after being cooped up. But for me? The pressure to be perpetually "on" and happy was overwhelming.

I’ve always hated summer. It’s not just the oppressive heat; it’s the weight of social expectation. The unspoken rule that you must be having fun, that you must feel confident in clothes that leave little to the imagination. When I’d confess my summer anxiety, I’d often get a confused, “But it’s summer!” as if sunshine could magically cure a bad mental health day.

This year, I’m giving myself permission to opt out. If I want to read a book in the air conditioning instead of going to a crowded barbecue, that’s okay. My worth isn’t measured by my tan lines or my social calendar. It’s a small rebellion, but finally embracing my truth feels more freeing than any summer vacation ever could.
