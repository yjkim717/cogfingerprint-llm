**The Weight of What We Leave Behind**

It’s funny how easily we get caught up in the *now*, isn’t it? 2021 felt like a sprint – a desperate scramble to adapt, to connect, to just… *be* after everything that’s happened. But lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about what we’re building – and what we’re leaving behind. 

I was reading about the push for more nuclear energy, and it hit me with a strange force. It felt like we’re repeating a pattern. We’re so focused on immediate solutions, on powering our lives, that we’re dodging a really tough question: what happens to the waste? 

It’s a responsibility we owe to future generations, a cornerstone of sustainability. Ignoring that, acting recklessly – it’s not just shortsighted, it's a little heartbreaking.  Like building a magnificent castle on sand, hoping someone else will clean up the mess.  

Don't you think?  Let’s start asking ourselves harder questions about the legacy we’re creating, before it’s too late.
