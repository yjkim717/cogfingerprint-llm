Of course, here is a reflective blog post based on your summary.

Remember 2021? Lockdown had us all seeking comfort in familiar things. For me, that was replaying *The Last of Us Part II* on its hardest "Grounded" mode. I thought I knew struggle. Then I hit the forest chapter.

Suddenly, I was cornered. Two shamblers—bloated, acid-spewing nightmares—lumbered towards me. My ammo counter was a cruel joke: three bullets, one health kit. My heart hammered in the quiet before the storm. Every resource felt precious, every mistake fatal.

In that moment, it wasn't just a game. It was a perfect, frustrating metaphor for that year. We were all running on empty, facing wave after wave of unexpected challenges with dwindling personal reserves. That desperate scramble for one more bullet felt like searching for one more ounce of patience or hope.

Somehow, I made it through. Beating that section felt less like a victory and more like a lesson in resilience. It reminded me that we’re all just doing our best with what we have left in the tank, and sometimes, that’s enough.
