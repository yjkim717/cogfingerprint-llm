## The Algorithm and My Gut: Why I'm Trusting Myself More Now

Remember back in 2021 when everything felt… amplified? Social media was a constant hum of opinions, life hacks, and “perfect” routines. I got sucked in, desperately seeking answers to, well, everything. Career doubts, relationship anxieties, even what the *best* way to water my succulents was!

I’d spend hours scrolling, absorbing advice from influencers and self-proclaimed gurus. It felt good to *try* implementing it, but often… it just didn't click.  I realized I was chasing someone else’s version of "right."

Lately, I’ve been leaning into my own gut.  My messy, imperfect, *lived* experiences.  It's not about ignoring advice entirely, but filtering it through my own lens.  Turns out, I already knew a lot of the answers. Sometimes, the best guidance comes from simply listening to yourself.




Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
