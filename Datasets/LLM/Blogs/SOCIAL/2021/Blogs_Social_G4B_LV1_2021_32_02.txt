**The Weight of a Packed Box**

Okay, so 2021 felt like a year of big shifts, right? For me, it meant finally packing up and moving across the country – a dream I’d been chasing for ages. But the excitement quickly got tangled with something… heavier. My mom, bless her heart, took it *really* hard. Overreactions, a lot of guilt-tripping, and honestly, a weird strain on our relationship. 

I started feeling this awful, persistent guilt, like I was abandoning her. It’s so strange, because I genuinely believe this move was right for *me*. Seeing her upset just amplified the pressure. It made me question everything.  I realized I needed to set boundaries, not out of anger, but out of self-respect.  It’s a messy process, navigating family expectations when you’re forging your own path.  Anyone else feel this tug-of-war?
