The perils of eating a healthy salad! Who knew that a casual lunch on a busy afternoon in 2021 could turn into a costly trip to the dentist? I'm still kicking myself for not being more careful. It all started when I decided to indulge in a fresh mix of greens, veggies, and fruits, topped with a protein-packed chicken. As I was twirling my fork, I felt a sudden crunch - not from the crispy veggies, but from my tooth. I had chipped the dental bonding that had been done on my front tooth a few years ago.

Panic set in as I quickly grabbed my phone and texted my dentist, hoping they could fit me in ASAP. To my relief, they got back to me within minutes, and we scheduled a repair appointment for the next day. As I sat in the chair, I couldn't help but think about how quickly things can go wrong. One minute I'm enjoying a healthy meal, the next I'm dealing with a damaged tooth.

The experience was a good reminder of the importance of taking care of our teeth - and being mindful of our eating habits. A simple trip to the dentist can be a hassle, but it's a small price to pay for a healthy, happy smile. I'm just glad I caught it early, and my dentist was able to fix the bonding in no time. Now, I'll be sure to eat my salads with a little more caution - and a side of caution, not just croutons.
