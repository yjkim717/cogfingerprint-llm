>## The Weight of Enjoyment: Berserk, Grief, and Feeling Like a Fan Failure

It's weird, isn't it? How something as seemingly simple as enjoying a piece of art can become tangled up in a web of emotions? Lately, I’ve been wrestling with that feeling, specifically when it comes to *Berserk*. Kentaro Miura’s passing hit the manga community – and frankly, the wider world of creative expression – incredibly hard. 

And now, trying to dive back into the series feels…complicated. There's a strange guilt, a sense that enjoying Guts's journey somehow disrespects the immense loss we’ve all felt. It’s like, should I even *be* finding pleasure in something he poured his heart and soul into, knowing he’s no longer here to see it appreciated?

I know it's illogical. Miura dedicated his life to *Berserk*, and I suspect he’d want fans to continue experiencing it. But the weight of that legacy, coupled with the grief, makes it a challenging, albeit profoundly meaningful, experience. It's a reminder that art lives on, but the artist… that's irreplaceable.
