**Scrolling Through a Feeling**

Remember 2021? It felt… intense, didn’t it? Like everyone was shouting into the void, desperately trying to be seen. I spent way too much time scrolling, comparing my messy reality to the curated highlight reels of others.  Instagram felt less like connection and more like a competition for likes. 

I started noticing a weird feeling – this low-level anxiety that came with every post, every comment. It wasn't about what people *said*, but the pressure to *react*.  I realized I was letting other people’s opinions dictate my mood. 

So, I did a little digital detox. It wasn’t dramatic, just a conscious choice to log off more and actually *look* around. Turns out, real life was pretty good, and a little less noisy.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
