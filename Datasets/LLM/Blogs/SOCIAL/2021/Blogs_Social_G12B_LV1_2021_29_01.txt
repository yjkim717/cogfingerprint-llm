## The Weight of Enjoyment: Berserk and a Strange Kind of Grief

It's been a weird few months, hasn't it? Ever since Kentaro Miura passed away, something feels…off with enjoying the things he created. Specifically, *Berserk*. I'd been following the manga for years, completely captivated by the world and Guts' journey. Then, suddenly, it felt wrong to dive back in.

There’s a strange guilt layered over every panel. Like I'm somehow disrespecting his legacy by finding pleasure in something he poured his heart and soul into. I know it's illogical. He’d probably want people to continue appreciating his work. But the joy just isn’t quite there.

It’s extended beyond *Berserk*, too. I find myself hesitant to get invested in anything new. It’s like the world feels a little dimmer, and the idea of getting excited about a new show or book just feels… inappropriate? Maybe it’s just me processing grief in a uniquely nerdy way. Anyone else feeling a similar kind of hesitant enjoyment these days? It’s a strange social phenomenon, I think – mourning not just the artist, but the potential for future creations.
