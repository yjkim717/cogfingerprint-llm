**The Echo Chamber Effect**

Remember last year when I was freaking out about my job search? Everyone – and I mean *everyone* – had “amazing” advice. “Just network harder!” “Update your LinkedIn!” It was a relentless barrage. Honestly, it was overwhelming. 

I realized then that while well-intentioned, a lot of that advice wasn’t actually *mine*. It was shaped by *their* experiences, *their* successes.  I needed to step back and ask myself: does this actually fit *my* situation? 

It’s easy to get lost in the echo chamber of other people's opinions.  Finding your own path, with a little self-trust, is way more powerful.  Anyone else feel this way?
