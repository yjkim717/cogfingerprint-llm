**Summer’s a Lot, Isn't It?**

Okay, real talk. 2021 summer felt…heavy. Like, I *should* have been posting about beach days and perfectly curated picnics, but honestly, a lot of it was just me battling a weird anxiety. It’s that summer thing, right? Everyone’s “living their best life” and you’re just…overwhelmed. 

There was this constant feeling of self-consciousness, like I was being judged on how ‘summer-y’ I was being.  I started needing to vent to my best friend just to feel like I wasn't completely alone in feeling this pressure. It wasn’t about anything specific, just the general expectation of fun and happiness.  It felt exhausting.  I’m glad it’s over, but it’s a reminder that sometimes, the most authentic thing you can do is just *be*.
