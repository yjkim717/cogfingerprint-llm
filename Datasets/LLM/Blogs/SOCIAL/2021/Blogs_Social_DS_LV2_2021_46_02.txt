### The Scroll of Sighs: On Being Digitally Drained

I closed my laptop with a soft click, a sound that felt far too gentle for the cacophony it had just contained. The screen went black, and for a moment, so did my brain. Not with peace, but with a static hum of pure, undiluted exhaustion. It’s 2021, and I think I’ve forgotten how to be just tired. This is something else—a world-weariness that seeps through the Wi-Fi signal.

It starts personally, of course. The laundry pile that’s become a permanent linen installation. The sourdough starter I guiltily poured down the drain. But then you open a tab, and it avalanches. It’s not just my to-do list; it’s the climate report, the political headline, the 47th hot take on the latest "thing" I’m already too late to understand. My personal anxieties hold hands with global ones, forming a circle that just spins faster and faster.

And in the middle of it all, there’s the internet—our collective, frantic, and often cruel town square. I used to find genuine connection here. Now, I find myself doomscrolling, a passive spectator to a circus of outrage and performance. Every notification feels like a fresh demand on a bank account I’ve long since overdrawn. I’ll think, "Maybe I’ll learn guitar," or "I should start that book," but the energy to begin feels like trying to push a car uphill. The potential for joy is there, but the spark to ignite it is drowned out by the digital noise.

I’m not just worried about my own burnout; I’m anxious for the future we’re building in this hyper-connected, chronically online state. What does it mean for us, as people, when our primary shared experience is one of collective mental exhaustion?

So, I’m trying a new ritual. After that laptop closes, I don’t immediately reach for my phone. I just sit. I listen to the actual, physical silence. I stare out the window at a tree that doesn’t care about trending topics. It’s a small rebellion. It’s me, quietly declaring that my attention—my soul, really—is worth more than the endless scroll. Maybe you feel it too. If you do, know you’re not alone in the noise. And maybe, just maybe, we can learn to log off, and truly rest, together.
