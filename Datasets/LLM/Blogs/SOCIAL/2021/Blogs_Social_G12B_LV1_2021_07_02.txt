## The Disappearing Act of Good Piercers (and a Quest for Safe Ink)

It's weird how quickly things can change, isn't it? Just last year, I was happily recommending Golden Horseshoe in St. Catharines for anyone looking for a quality piercing. Then, poof, they were gone. A lot of us in the local body modification community were left scrambling. 

I saw a thread pop up on Reddit the other day â€“ someone desperately seeking a reputable, *certified* piercer around the Golden Horseshoe. It hit home. It highlights this growing anxiety about finding skilled professionals, especially when established studios vanish. Makes you appreciate the ones who are still out there, and reinforces the importance of doing your research! Anybody have some reliable recommendations? Let's share the knowledge!
