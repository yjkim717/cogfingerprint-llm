## Little Nips & Big Lessons

It’s funny, isn’t it, how the smallest things can teach us the biggest lessons? We got our puppy, Leo, a few months back, and the teething phase has been…an experience. He’s got this adorable habit of gently nibbling on everything – hands, ankles, the sofa. At first, I was frustrated, but then I realized: he's exploring, learning his world.

Just like us, right? We're all navigating new landscapes, sometimes nipping a little too hard, needing a gentle redirection. It’s a reminder that growth isn’t always smooth, and a little patience – and positive reinforcement – goes a long way. Leo's teaching me that, and honestly, it’s a lesson worth remembering in 2021, when everything feels like a new, slightly nibbly, territory.
