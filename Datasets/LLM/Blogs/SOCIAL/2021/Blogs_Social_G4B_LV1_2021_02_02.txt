Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the Subnautica summary, aiming for a conversational tone and around 155 words, set in 2021:

**The Disconnect**

Anyone else feel…watched online lately? It’s weird, right? I was scrolling through Instagram last week, meticulously crafting the *perfect* post about my new pottery class – all warm lighting, a beautifully glazed mug, the whole nine yards. Then, a comment. Not a nice one. Just…a blunt critique about the mug’s “lack of originality.” 

It felt like a Seamoth vanishing – suddenly gone, leaving a void where a little validation had been. I spent ages trying to explain my process, trying to defend my work, but it just spiraled. It reminded me of that Subnautica glitch, that feeling of something fundamentally wrong, like the game just *stopped* working. 

Maybe we’re all just searching for a safe parking spot online, desperate to avoid the crabsnakes of the internet.  I’m trying to remember how to build my own sense of worth, outside of someone else’s opinion.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a different aspect or aiming for a slightly different length?
