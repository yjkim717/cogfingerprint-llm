>## My Face is Apparently a Mood

Okay, so I just had a *moment*. A friend gently pointed out – and I say gently, but the laughter was undeniable – that I seem to have a “resting sad face.” Apparently, I walk around looking perpetually disappointed. Resting *bitch* face is so last year, it’s all about the resting melancholy now, I guess. It’s a weird thing to realize about yourself, especially when you’re genuinely vibing. I'm now on a mission to train my face into a neutral expression. Wish me luck!
