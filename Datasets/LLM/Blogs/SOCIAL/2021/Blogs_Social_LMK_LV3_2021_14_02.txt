As I settled back into my office routine in 2021, I was shocked to discover that my cat, who had grown accustomed to my presence at home, was now exhibiting signs of distress whenever I left for work. During the pandemic, I had the luxury of working from home, and we had developed a lovely habit of going on walks together. However, as I returned to the office, my cat's separation anxiety became apparent. The once calm and relaxed cat was now meowing anxiously and pacing around the house. It was heartbreaking to see my furry friend so distressed. I realized that our bond had grown stronger during the pandemic, and my absence was now causing him undue stress. I'm learning to ease his anxiety by gradually adjusting our routine and providing reassurance when I leave and return home.
