### The Unseen Battle: Choosing Me Over My Desk

It’s 2021, and I should be on top of the world. I landed my dream job right out of college, the one I’d worked towards for years. My team is incredible, and my family beams with pride. From the outside, my life looks like a success story.

But there’s a battle they don’t see. My eating disorder, a shadow I’ve carried since I was a teenager, has gotten louder. The constant anxiety around food and my body is exhausting, and trying to manage it while performing at 100% is breaking me.

So, I’ve made the hardest decision of my life: I’m asking for a leave of absence to go to treatment. And I’m terrified.

My biggest fear isn’t the treatment itself; it’s the perception. Will my coworkers see me as weak? Will my family be disappointed that their “success story” is hitting pause? It feels like I’m admitting failure.

But I’m learning that real strength isn’t about powering through. It’s about having the courage to say, “I need help.” My health has to come first, even if it means stepping away from the dream to ensure I’m well enough to truly live it. This isn’t a step back; it’s the foundation for everything that comes next.
