## The PCT Puzzle: When Rejection Feels Personal

Okay, real talk. Anyone else feeling the sting of job applications lately? I’m a third-year BSN student, and I’m *really* wanting to get my foot in the door with a PCT role. Seems like the perfect way to build experience, right? 

But…rejection after rejection. It’s tough. It's 2021, and the healthcare field is *so* competitive. I started doubting myself – was my lack of "real" experience holding me back? 

Then I remembered why I started this journey: a genuine desire to help people.  It's not about the job title right now; it’s about learning and growing. So, I'm dusting myself off, tweaking my application, and focusing on what I *do* bring to the table.  Anyone else in the same boat? Let’s encourage each other!




Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
