## Putting on a Face, Feeling the Weight

It's weird, isn't it? How something as simple as makeup can feel…loaded. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with that feeling. I'm still navigating the waves of depression, medicated and working on it, one day at a time. And honestly, some days are *hard*. Really hard.

But then there are days where I feel…okay. Not amazing, not “cured,” just…okay. And on those days, I find myself drawn to my makeup bag. A little concealer, some mascara, a swipe of lipstick – it’s a ritual, a small act of self-care.

Except, it's not always met with support. My family, bless their hearts, mean well. They worry. A lot. They see the depression, the exhaustion, and when they see me putting on makeup, their immediate reaction is often a concerned, "Are you trying to look *better*? Are you feeling okay? You shouldn’t have to hide how you feel.”

It stings. It feels like they’re saying my effort is disingenuous. Like I'm trying to fool everyone, including myself. But it’s not about hiding anything. It’s about reclaiming a little bit of myself. It’s about finding a tiny spark of joy in a world that feels very gray sometimes.

It’s 2021, and we’re (hopefully) getting better at talking about mental health. But sometimes, the well-intentioned concerns of loved ones can feel like another burden. I’m trying to explain that self-care looks different for everyone, and for me, sometimes it looks like a carefully blended eyeshadow. It’s a work in progress, for sure.
