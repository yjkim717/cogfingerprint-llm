It’s 2021, and my trusty Kamvas 13 has been a game-changer for my digital art—until I tried using it with a Thunderbolt extender on my Mac. On Windows, it’s flawless, but on macOS? Nothing. The Huion cable works fine, but the driver just won’t recognize it.

Here in India, where cable returns are basically a myth, I’ve learned to tread carefully with tech purchases. It’s a small reminder of how our local policies shape our digital experiences, sometimes leaving us in limbo between platforms. Still, it’s a journey—one that’s taught me patience and the art of troubleshooting across operating systems. Sometimes, the quirks make the story richer.
