You know what I’ve always been curious about? How service dogs for wheelchair users balance their duty with their own needs. After hours of focused stillness in public, where does all that pent-up energy go? Watching them finally stretch, play, and explore with such joy is a beautiful reminder: even the most dedicated helpers need time to just be a dog. It’s a lesson in balance we could all learn from.
