>## The Unexpected Joy of Tangible Creation in a Digital World

It's 2021, and honestly, most of my creative energy lately has been poured into the endless scroll. Social media, online communities – they're consuming, aren't they? But something shifted for me recently. I started craving *making* something real. 

I’ve been diving into designing custom cases for my old Game Boy Advance and Game Boy Color games. Sounds random, I know! But there’s something profoundly satisfying about taking a digital design in Blender 3D and envisioning it as a physical object. 

It’s a slow process, a little fiddly, and definitely outside my comfort zone. Yet, it’s pulled me away from the screen in a way I desperately needed. It's a reminder that creation isn't just about likes and shares – it’s about the tangible joy of bringing something new into the world, even if it's just a personalized case for a classic game.
