## The Headshot Hurdle & Our Online Selves

It's 2021, and our online presence feels…permanent. I saw a post on Reddit the other day about someone wanting professional headshots because they just *never* look good in photos. It resonated! We're all curating versions of ourselves online, and sometimes that feels daunting. Investing in a good headshot? Maybe it’s not vanity, but a way to finally feel authentically represented in the digital world. Anyone else feel this pressure?
