The Weight of Unfinished Business: Reflecting on Guilt and Fandom. 
As I sat down to rewatch Berserk in 2021, the news of Kentaro Miura's passing still lingered. I felt a mix of emotions - sadness, nostalgia, and guilt. I had attempted to read the manga years ago but didn't quite grasp it. Now, I felt a sense of responsibility to appreciate it, given Miura's dedication to the series. The fear of not doing it justice haunted me. I realized I'm not alone in this feeling. Many fans struggle with unfinished business, whether it's a book, a series, or a hobby. We often put off experiencing things, thinking there's always tomorrow. But life has a way of reminding us that tomorrow isn't guaranteed. As I finally dove into Berserk, I understood that it's not just about the story; it's about honoring the creator's passion and legacy.
