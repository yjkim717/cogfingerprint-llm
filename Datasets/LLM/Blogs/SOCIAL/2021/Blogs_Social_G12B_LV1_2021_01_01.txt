## The Scroll and the Smoke

It’s 2021, and I'm constantly scrolling. But lately, a thought’s been nagging at me: will future generations look back at our social media obsession the way we view old cigarette ads? Remember those smiling folks puffing away? We now know that was a dangerous illusion. 

I wonder if our curated feeds, the constant comparison, the dopamine hits… if *that* will eventually be seen as detrimental to our mental wellbeing. Maybe the unplugging revolution is just around the corner.
