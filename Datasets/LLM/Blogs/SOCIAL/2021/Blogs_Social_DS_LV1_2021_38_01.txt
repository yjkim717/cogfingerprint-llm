It’s funny how we search for meaning in the smallest details. Watching Bo Burnham’s *Inside* in 2021, I was struck by that cool blue glow—the kind that bathes everything in an artificial calm. My first thought? Grow lamps. A metaphor for personal development during a time when we were all stuck indoors, trying to become better versions of ourselves.

But then it hit me: that light isn’t nurturing plants; it’s the same glow from our phones, the very screens that connect and isolate us simultaneously. We’re reaching for growth while bathed in the light of distraction. Maybe the real growth is recognizing the irony—and still trying to bloom anyway.
