The guilt of coming home to a crying cat! As I settled into my work-from-home routine in 2021, I couldn't help but notice my furry companion's behavior changing. With the office commute gone, I was spending more time at home, but my cat, Luna, wasn't getting the same attention she was used to. We'd go on shorter walks, and I'd leave her alone for hours while I worked. When I'd return to the living room, she'd be waiting by the door, meowing pitifully. It broke my heart! As the days went by, Luna's separation anxiety worsened, and she'd howl at the door whenever I was late getting back to her. I realized that our routine had been disrupted, and it was time to make some changes. I started taking longer walks with Luna and dedicating more time to play. The crying subsided, and our bond strengthened. It was a tough lesson to learn, but sometimes, all it takes is a little adjustment to make our pets (and ourselves!) happy again.
