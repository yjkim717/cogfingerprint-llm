>## That Feeling When "Everything Seems Fine" Isn't Quite Right

Okay, so things have been…a lot lately. My girlfriend was in a car accident last week. Thankfully, she’s physically okay, but it was terrifying. The worst part? After losing consciousness and a little fluid leaking from her ear (seriously, *scary*), the ER doc said everything looked “fine” after a quick check. 

Relief washed over me, sure. But also…unease. That "fine" felt a little too easy. Now we're scheduling a neurology appointment, just to be sure. Anyone else ever felt that disconnect between what you're *feeling* and what the medical professionals say? It's a weird space to be in, navigating worry and trying to trust the system.
