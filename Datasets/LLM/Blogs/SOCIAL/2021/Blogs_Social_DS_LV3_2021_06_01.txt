Of all the things I expected 2021 to throw at me—another lockdown, sourdough starter, a newfound appreciation for birdwatching—a kangaroo was not on the list. And yet, there I was, in the hazy, illogical world of a dream, being ceremoniously handed the leash of a lanky, mischievous marsupial. It felt less like an adoption and more like a cosmic prank.

The dream had a strange, bureaucratic weight to it. I had to take him. His name, I was told, was Kevin. In the way of dreams, this made perfect sense.

The trouble began almost immediately upon Kevin’s dream-arrival. My suburban backyard, a carefully curated rectangle of patchy grass and a struggling hydrangea, became his personal demolition derby. He wasn’t malicious, just… exuberantly destructive. He’d bound from the patio furniture to the fence with a powerful, graceful thud, sending my potted herbs flying.

My initial solution was a hastily erected electric fence—the kind you use for small dogs. I remember the dream-logic satisfaction of clicking the charger on. *There*, I thought. *Problem solved.*

It was, in fact, the moment the problem escalated from a private nuisance to a full-blown neighborhood conflict. Kevin, with a kangaroo’s innate talent for physics, quickly learned that a well-timed leap could clear the fence entirely, landing him directly in the meticulously manicured garden of my neighbors, the Wilsons. The first time it happened, I awoke to the sound of their very real, very angry shouts filtering into my dream. My subconscious had seamlessly blended the dream-Kangaroo with my actual, waking-life anxiety about neighborly relations.

Suddenly, the dream wasn’t about the kangaroo anymore. It was about the delicate ecosystem of suburban life. It was about the invisible fences we build between ourselves and the people living ten feet away. My attempt to contain my problem had only succeeded in launching it directly into someone else’s domain, electrifying the tension.

I woke up with a start, the phantom sound of a thumping tail and indignant neighbors fading away. Lying there in the quiet dark of my very kangaroo-free room, the metaphor felt painfully clear. How often do we try to box up our own chaos with a flimsy solution, only to have it leap the fence and cause a bigger mess? The dream wasn’t about a kangaroo; it was about the unruly parts of our lives we try to hide, and the surprising, often messy, consequences of when they inevitably get out.
