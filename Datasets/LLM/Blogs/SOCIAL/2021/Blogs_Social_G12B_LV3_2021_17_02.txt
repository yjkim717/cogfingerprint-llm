## The Heat, the Food, and That Fluttery Feeling...

Okay, real talk. Yesterday was… a lot. It was one of those scorching summer days where the air itself feels thick and heavy. I pushed through, enjoying the sunshine, but maybe I overdid it a little. Then came the heavy meal – comfort food, you know? Sometimes you just *need* a giant plate of pasta. 

But afterward? My stomach started doing this weird thing. A fluttery, uneasy feeling, coupled with a general wave of anxiety. It’s a feeling I’ve battled before, and it always makes me question everything. Is it something I ate? Am I getting sick? Is this… a panic attack?

Honestly, the anxiety itself can trigger all sorts of physical symptoms, especially digestive distress. It’s a vicious cycle, and I know it well. I’ve been digging into emetophobia a lot lately (it’s a fear of vomiting, if you’re not familiar) and realizing how deeply it can impact daily life. 

Anyone else relate to that feeling of your body betraying you, especially when you’re already feeling stressed? It's 2021, and we’re all carrying a lot. Just wanted to share, because sometimes knowing you're not alone makes a world of difference. Sending calming vibes to all of us navigating the anxieties and the unexpected tummy troubles!
