## Lost in Translation (and Dish Soap)

Okay, so this might sound random, but I've been wrestling with something at work. I'm a dishwasher, and most of my colleagues are Hispanic. Recently, I’ve been hearing the term “batitas” or “baditas” thrown around, and I'm unsure if it’s friendly or…not. It's a stark reminder that even in 2021, navigating cultural nuances and language can be tricky. Anyone out there have experience with Spanish slang? Any insights would be hugely appreciated!
