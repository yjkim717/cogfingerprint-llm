### The Unintended Consequences of a "Better" Game

Remember when "casual" in gaming actually meant casual? I’ve been thinking about that a lot since Rocket League’s latest update. They removed the "vote to forfeit" option in casual matches and slapped on stricter penalties for leaving. On paper, it sounds great—fewer abandoned games, right?

But here’s the thing they missed: the psychology of an escape hatch.

That simple vote was more than a white flag; it was a pressure release valve. When a match became a toxic slog, my buddy and I would look at each other, one would say "FF?", and we'd tap out with no hard feelings. It was a mutual, graceful exit from a bad situation.

Now? That frustration has nowhere to go. I’ve watched teammates who clearly want out just stop playing, idling on the field or driving in circles. The toxicity hasn’t vanished; it’s just mutated. It feels like the developers, in their quest to force a "better" experience, forgot that sometimes the most casual thing you can do is simply agree to walk away. It’s a lesson in how the best intentions can backfire, leaving us all stuck in a game nobody’s enjoying.
