>Okay, here's a reflective blog post inspired by the provided summary, aiming for a conversational tone and storytelling style, set in a 2021 context:

## The Glow-Up We Didn't See Coming

Remember when everyone was obsessing over Bo Burnham’s *Inside*? It was *the* thing to dissect during the pandemic, right? Everyone had theories about what the single grow lamp he used represented – mostly, it seemed, that it was just a stand-in for his phone, a symbol of our constant connection and digital dependence. 

But something else stuck with me.  I kept thinking about that lamp, steadily bathing the room in a specific, almost nurturing light.  It wasn't harsh or clinical. It felt… hopeful. 

Maybe it *was* about the phone, sure. But I couldn't shake the feeling it also represented something more.  Like, what if it was about *growth*? About actively cultivating something, even in the darkest, most isolated of times? We were all stuck inside, battling our own anxieties, desperately trying to *become* something, to *grow* through the sheer weirdness of 2021. 

That little lamp, in its quiet, persistent glow, felt like a visual metaphor for that struggle, that quiet hope.  Maybe we were all just trying to grow a little, even under artificial light.
