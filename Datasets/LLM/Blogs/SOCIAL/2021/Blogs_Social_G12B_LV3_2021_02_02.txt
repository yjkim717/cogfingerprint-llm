## The Crabsnake Tax and the Bitter Taste of Letting Go

Okay, so I had a *moment* in Subnautica last night. A frustrating, rage-inducing moment that somehow ended up teaching me a little something about… well, letting go, I guess?

I lost my Seamoth. Vanished. Poof. I searched everywhere, convinced it was a glitch. Turns out, it wasn't a glitch at all. Remember those adorable, bouncy Crabsnakes you can release into the biomes? Yeah, I'd let a few loose a while back, thinking I was being helpful. Turns out, they have a *serious* appetite for Seamoths. 

It stung, losing that vehicle. But looking back, it was a weird lesson in unintended consequences, wasn't it? Sometimes, even with the best intentions, things we set free can bite us later. It felt a bit like 2021 social media, honestly. You share, you post, you release… and you can't always control where it ends up. A little humbling, that. Anyone else had a Subnautica-life parallel lately?
