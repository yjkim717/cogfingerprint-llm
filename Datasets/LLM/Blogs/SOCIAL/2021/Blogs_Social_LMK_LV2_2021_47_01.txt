"Sticking to Your Bullet Journal: A Journey of Self-Discovery. As I flipped through my bullet journal in 2021, I realized that the real challenge wasn't setting up the perfect spreads, but making journaling a habit. I struggled to write consistently, feeling like I was failing. But I discovered that it's okay to start small and be imperfect. By embracing flexibility and making journaling a self-care ritual, I turned my bullet journal into a productivity tool that truly worked for me. Now, I'm sharing my journey to help you overcome your own initial hurdles and make journaling a sustainable habit."
