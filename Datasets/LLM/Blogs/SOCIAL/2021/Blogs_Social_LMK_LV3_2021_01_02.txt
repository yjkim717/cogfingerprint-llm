The latest Rocket League update had me fuming - and I'm not alone. By removing the ability to leave casual games without penalty, Psyonix has inadvertently opened the floodgates to toxicity. As a player, I've experienced firsthand the frustration and anxiety that comes with being stuck in a game with a toxic teammate. The update's intention was to encourage players to see games through, but it's had the opposite effect. Instead of promoting teamwork, it's created a culture of blame and hostility. I've found myself dreading casual matches, worried about being paired with someone who's more likely to harass than help. It's disheartening to see a game I love become a source of stress. As the gaming community, we need to acknowledge the impact of game design on player psychology and work together to create a more positive experience.
