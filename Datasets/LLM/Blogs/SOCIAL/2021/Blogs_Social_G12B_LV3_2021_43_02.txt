## The Unseen Work: Service Dogs and Their Daily Life

I stumbled across a fascinating question on Reddit the other day – how do service dogs, especially those working with wheelchair users or individuals with limited mobility, get the exercise and enrichment they need? It really made me think. We focus so much on the incredible assistance they provide, and rightfully so! But these are still dogs, with playful instincts and a need to stretch their legs. It’s a beautiful reminder that even in supporting others, fulfilling a dog’s natural needs is paramount. It’s a challenge, for sure, but one worth celebrating!
