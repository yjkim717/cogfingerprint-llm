**The Tightness in My Chest & The Summer Shame**

Honestly, 2021 felt… intense.  We were all just trying to navigate a world that still felt a little unsteady, and for me, it manifested in some really strange ways.

I’d be out in the sun, feeling good, and then suddenly, bam – the anxiety would hit, accompanied by a desperate need to… well, you get the picture. 

It was mortifying, to be honest.  Trying to manage it in public felt like a performance.  I just wanted someone to *understand* that sometimes, the biggest battles aren't fought with words, but with a desperate need to just *breathe*.  Has anyone else experienced something similar?
