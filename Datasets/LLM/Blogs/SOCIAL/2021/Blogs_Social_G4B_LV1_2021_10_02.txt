**5:15 AM – Seriously, What’s Happening?**

Okay, so 2021 was… a year. A *lot* of scrolling. I was a total night owl, fueled by caffeine and doom-scrolling on Reddit. Then, completely out of the blue, I started trying this whole “early riser” thing. Now, I’m up at 5:15 am most days, hitting the pavement for a run. It’s honestly changed my perspective.  It’s a tiny act of self-improvement, and surprisingly, it’s made me feel… calmer.  Anyone else dipping their toes into this madness?

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps generate a different version with a slightly altered focus?
