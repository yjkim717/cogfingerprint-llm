## Lost in Translation (and Dish Soap)

Working alongside a vibrant team of Spanish speakers this year has been amazing, but sometimes… bewildering. The other day, a coworker used the word "baditas" while chatting about a particularly stubborn casserole dish. I froze. Was it an insult? A term of endearment? The similar "batitas" just added to the confusion. Language barriers are real, and even seemingly small misunderstandings can highlight the importance of open communication and genuine curiosity. I’m definitely adding “Spanish slang” to my 2021 learning list!
