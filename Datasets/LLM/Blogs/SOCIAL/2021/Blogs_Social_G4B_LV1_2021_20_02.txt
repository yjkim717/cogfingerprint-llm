**Is This My Life? (2021 Edition)**

Okay, real talk. This semester of college felt…weird. Like I was stuck in a loop. Scrolling through TikTok, then hitting “pause” on an online assignment just to binge-watch another show. It wasn’t *deliberate* laziness, exactly, but a genuine struggle to prioritize anything beyond immediate gratification. 

I’d tell myself I’d “just do the bare minimum” – a passing grade was enough.  But the guilt was building.  Everyone else seemed to be *doing* something, and I was just…existing in a haze of streaming. It’s a surprisingly isolating feeling, realizing you’re letting your social life (and Netflix) dictate your academic future.  Anyone else feeling this way?
