The other day, I found myself scrolling through yet another social media feed, my thumb moving on autopilot. A news alert about a political crisis, a meme about climate anxiety, a friend’s perfectly curated vacation photo, and an influencer’s “five tips to beat burnout” all blurred into one endless, noisy stream. I finally put my phone down, but the feeling lingered—a heavy, dull ache of exhaustion that has become my unwelcome companion in 2021.

It’s more than just being tired. It’s a deep, soul-level weariness with the state of… everything. The world outside feels like it’s perpetually on the brink, and the world inside my phone is a frantic, performative circus. I’ve started to feel a profound sense of hopelessness, as if I’m watching a carousel of problems spin too fast to even comprehend, let alone help solve.

This global fatigue has seeped into my personal life, poisoning the wells I used to drink from for joy. My sketchbook has been open on my desk for a month, the first page still blank. I stare at it, waiting for the spark, but my mind is a flatline. This creative block isn’t the fun, dramatic kind you see in movies. It’s silent and hollow. It’s the feeling that adding one more thing—even a joyful, personal thing—to the overwhelming cacophony of the internet is utterly pointless.

What I find myself longing for isn’t a viral post or a groundbreaking idea. It’s peace. Real, quiet, unplugged peace. I dream of a digital sabbath that lasts longer than a weekend, of a world that feels a little less like it’s shouting all the time. I miss the simple, unrecorded moments that don’t need a filter or a clever caption.

I know I’m not alone in this. I see the same world-weariness in the muted comments and resigned posts of my friends. So, if you’re reading this and feeling the same weight, just know that your silence is understood. Your creative block is valid. Sometimes, in a world that demands constant reaction, the most radical act is simply to be still, to unclench your jaw, and to admit that you, too, are utterly exhausted. Maybe our collective sigh is the first step toward catching our breath.
