## My Apple Watch & The Unexpected Handwashing Battery Drain

Okay, so I'm officially baffled. Anyone else experiencing weird battery drain on their Apple Watch lately? I’ve been glued to mine since the pandemic started – tracking workouts, notifications, you name it. But recently, it felt like I was charging it *twice* a day.

I dove into troubleshooting, and stumbled upon a weird discovery. Apparently, that new handwashing feature in watchOS 7.2 (the one that gently reminds you to wash for 20 seconds) was a *major* battery hog. Seriously! After disabling it, my Series 4 practically jumped back to life, lasting a full 24 hours again. 

It’s funny, right? A feature designed to help us stay healthy was actually impacting my tech health! Just a little reminder to check your settings sometimes – you never know what’s quietly draining your resources. Anyone else have a similar experience? Let me know!
