**The Weight of "Hello"**

Okay, so 2021 felt… heavy, didn’t it? Like everyone was trying to figure out what was *real* after everything. And honestly, a lot of that weight was coming from my own family. Specifically, my parents. 

For years, it was this constant push and pull – arguments over everything, a relentless need for my opinions to be validated (even when they weren’t), and a way of making me feel small, just… constantly. It wasn’t outright yelling, it was this insidious drip of criticism and invalidation that chipped away at my confidence. I realized it wasn't just disagreements; it was emotional abuse, masked as “just being honest.”

Lately, I've been seriously considering something I’d never even dreamed of a few years ago: no contact. It’s terrifying, of course. The guilt, the questions… but the thought of reclaiming my peace of mind is stronger. 

I’m not advocating for everyone to do this – it's a deeply personal decision. But I'm learning that sometimes, setting boundaries, even radical ones, is an act of self-love. It’s about choosing your own autonomy, your own emotional well-being. It’s about realizing you don’t owe anyone a constant stream of “hellos” if it’s actively hurting you. 

Anyone else navigating similar waters? Let’s talk. ❤️ #toxicfamily #boundaries #mentalhealth #selfcare
