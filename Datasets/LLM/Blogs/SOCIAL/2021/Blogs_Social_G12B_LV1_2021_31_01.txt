## Dusting Off the Butterflies: A First Date Post-Pandemic

It feels weird to even type that – “first date.” It’s been… well, it’s been a long time. Like, pre-pandemic long. 2019 feels like a different lifetime. So much has changed, and honestly, the whole dating scene felt frozen in time.

But last night, something shifted. I met someone. We actually *met* in person, not through a screen. We grabbed coffee, talked for hours, and somehow, it just… flowed. It was surprisingly easy, comfortable. 

I know it sounds cheesy, but I felt a flicker of something I hadn’t felt in ages – that nervous, fluttery feeling. The butterflies. It’s ridiculous, I know, it was just coffee, but it felt like a small victory. A sign that maybe, just maybe, getting back out there isn't as terrifying as I thought. 

It’s 2021, the world is still a little wonky, but maybe, just maybe, there’s room for connection and a little bit of hope. Let's see where this goes.
