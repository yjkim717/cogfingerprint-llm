Scrolling through my Instagram feed in 2021, I felt this weird tug of… nostalgia. Specifically, for the early 2000s K-Pop. Suddenly, all those bubblegum bright tracks from groups like H.O.T. and S.E.S. weren’t just catchy tunes; they felt like pure, unadulterated joy. It’s funny how music can instantly transport you back. Those songs sparked a feeling of warmth and optimism – a simple, hopeful vibe that’s sometimes missing in the constant stream of 2021.  It made me realize how much we crave that feeling of connection and inspiration.
