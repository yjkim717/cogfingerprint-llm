**The Loneliness of Late-Night Doodling**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2021 and I still felt this sharp pang of isolation, even surrounded by classmates. I was buried in research, stressing about rent for my grad housing, and desperately hoping my spouse could visit.  Scrolling through Reddit late one night, I saw someone asking about on-campus spouse policies - it hit me hard.  Sometimes, the biggest challenge isn't the work, but just *being* seen.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different length?
