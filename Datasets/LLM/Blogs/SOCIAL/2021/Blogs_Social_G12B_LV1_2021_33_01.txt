## The Irony of the Highway Hustle

It was a Tuesday afternoon in late 2021, and I was heading home after a particularly draining work week. Traffic was, predictably, a mess. I saw this beat-up pickup truck weaving aggressively through lanes, practically daring anyone to say anything. He was blasting past cars, double yellow lines be damned, clearly convinced he was on a mission. 

Honestly, I was annoyed, but also kind of numb to it by then – reckless driving seemed to be the norm these days. Then, the unbelievable happened. He zipped past… a police cruiser. I actually gasped. I figured for sure we'd see lights flashing any second. Nothing. 

But the kicker? He ended up getting completely stuck. Dead stop, right behind a tractor-trailer. The irony wasn't lost on me. All that frantic maneuvering, all those broken rules, and for what? To end up exactly where everyone else was. It just felt like a tiny, bizarre lesson in futility, and a sad commentary on how sometimes, trying *too* hard just gets you nowhere.
