## The Tiny Nibbles and the Big Lessons in Puppyhood

Okay, friends, let's be real: puppyhood is *adorable chaos*. We’re smack-dab in the middle of teething season with our little guy, and it’s a constant cycle of frozen washcloths and frustrated whimpers. But amidst the chewing frenzy, he’s developed this *sweetest* habit. He’ll gently nibble on my arm – a tiny, exploratory chomp – then immediately stop the second I say “No.” 

It's ridiculously cute, and honestly, a little heartbreaking. He’s just trying to soothe his aching gums, seeking comfort where he can find it. It’s a reminder that even small creatures are navigating discomfort and learning boundaries. 

It’s made me think about how we all do that, right? We sometimes reach out in clumsy, unintentional ways, searching for connection, and then pull back when we realize we’ve crossed a line. Puppy training is teaching me patience, and more than that, it's subtly teaching me about empathy and communication – a lesson I think we could all use a little more of in 2021.
