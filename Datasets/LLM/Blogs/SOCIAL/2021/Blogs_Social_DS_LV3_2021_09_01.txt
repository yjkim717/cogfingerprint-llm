It’s 2021, and my old car’s on its last legs. I’m torn: grab a used Nissan Leaf now, or wait for a Bolt? The Leaf’s seats aren’t the comfiest, but its depreciation is steep—so it’s a bargain. Yet, I keep thinking about those longer drives; will I regret skimping on comfort for savings? It’s more than a car choice—it’s about balancing daily ease with future value. What would you do when practicality and peace of mind pull you in different directions?
