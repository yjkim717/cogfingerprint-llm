It’s 2021, and I’m pretty sure my internet has a personal vendetta against me.

I’ve got the fancy ISP plan, a router I’ve restarted more times than I can count, and all my drivers are up to date. My ethernet speed should be a superhighway, and my WiFi should be a reliable side street. Instead, it feels like I’m trying to stream my life through a dial-up modem.

It’s in these moments of buffering and spinning wheels that I feel the strange, quiet loneliness of our hyper-connected world. My work calls freeze, my movie nights stutter, and the simple act of sending a message becomes a test of patience. I’m surrounded by the promise of instant communication, yet I’ve never felt more disconnected.

Maybe it’s a sign to just look up for a minute, to exist without a signal. But first, let me just try restarting the router one more time.
