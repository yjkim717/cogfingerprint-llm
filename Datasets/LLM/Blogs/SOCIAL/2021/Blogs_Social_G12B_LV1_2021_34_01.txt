## The Mountain of Laundry & the Scroll Hole

Okay, real talk. Moving is stressful enough, right? But when you have ADHD and executive dysfunction, it’s like moving a *planet*. Seriously. I’m staring at a mountain of laundry right now – a small one, relatively speaking – and the thought of even *starting* feels… monumental. 

It's 2021, and I’m acutely aware of how much time I’ve already lost to the endless scroll. Instagram, TikTok, news… it's all just a comforting distraction from the actual stuff I need to do. I know I *should* be packing, but my brain is screaming, "Watch this cat video! It's vital!"

I'm trying to be kinder to myself. Breaking things down into tiny steps. Five minutes of laundry. Five minutes of boxes. It’s slow, but it's something. Anyone else battling the inertia monster right now? Send help (and maybe some motivation!).
