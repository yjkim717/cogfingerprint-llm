## The Ghost of Cycles Past

It’s weird, right? Months after stopping hormones, these phantom cramps have started popping up. Like my body’s remembering a life it no longer lives. It's unsettling, this echo of a period I haven’t had in ages. I keep wondering if it's just my brain playing tricks, or if there’s some lingering connection to my body’s past. Anyone else experiencing this post-transition? It’s a strange feeling, this ghost of cycles past.
