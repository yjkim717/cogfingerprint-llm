It’s 2021, and I’m scrolling through grocery delivery options—something that’s become a lifeline during the pandemic. It got me thinking about shows like *My 600-lb Life* and the harsh reality behind the drama. Why didn’t participants use services like this to avoid the public eye? Maybe because the show thrives on exposing their most vulnerable moments. It’s a stark reminder of how easily real human struggles can be packaged as entertainment, leaving us to wonder: are we watching their stories, or just consuming their pain?
