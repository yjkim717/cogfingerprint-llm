It’s 2021, and I’m thinking about the legacy we’re leaving behind. Every time I read about climate change, I feel a surge of hope hearing that nuclear energy offers a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels. It’s a step forward, right? Less carbon, more power—what’s not to love?

But then my mind drifts to the other side of the story: nuclear waste. We’re burying it deep underground, out of sight and out of mind, as if sealing it in concrete and earth makes it disappear. It doesn’t. It lingers, radioactive for thousands of years, a silent, invisible burden we’re handing to our children and grandchildren.

That’s what keeps me up at night. Are we truly being responsible stewards of this planet, or just cleverly deferring a problem we don’t want to face? It feels like we’re writing a check that future generations will have to cash, with interest. As I sip my coffee and scroll through the news, I can’t help but wonder: is this progress, or just a more sophisticated form of passing the buck?
