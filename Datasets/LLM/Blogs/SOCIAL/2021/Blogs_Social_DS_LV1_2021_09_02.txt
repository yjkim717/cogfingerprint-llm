### The Stories Our Signs Tell

I was driving through a familiar Coastal Bend town the other day, heading to the coast for a much-needed breath of salty air. As I crossed the city line, my eyes flicked to the green and white sign, a habit as automatic as checking my mirrors.

*"POP. 4,210"*

I actually laughed out loud. I remember seeing that exact same number when I got my driver's license back in the early 2000s. Two decades, two housing booms, and what feels like a constant stream of new faces later, and that sign is still telling the same old story.

It got me thinking, especially after the strange census year we had in 2020. We’ve spent so much time lately talking about numbers—infection rates, vaccination counts, unemployment figures. We treat them as absolute truth, the hard data that defines our reality. But here, bolted to a post for everyone to see, is a number that everyone knows is a fiction. It’s a charming, weathered piece of fiction, but a fiction nonetheless.

In a way, it’s a comforting relic. It speaks to a smaller, simpler time. But it also makes me wonder what other "official" stories we’re still telling ourselves that no longer match the vibrant, complicated, and ever-changing communities we actually live in. Sometimes, the most honest thing isn't the number on the sign, but the shared understanding in the rearview mirror.
