## The Rabbit Hole of Lost Fanfic

Anyone else spend way too much time down internet rabbit holes? I was scrolling through Fanfiction.net the other day – a nostalgic trip, honestly – and stumbled across a thread of people desperately searching for a specific Marauders-era story. It was a wild premise: Lily and Remus as prefects, James pulling a ridiculous Polyjuice potion stunt to try and “help” Remus during a full moon.

It's amazing how a single, elusive story can capture so many people's imaginations. It just goes to show the power of fan communities and the dedication we have to these fictional worlds. Still hunting for it, by the way, if anyone has a lead!
