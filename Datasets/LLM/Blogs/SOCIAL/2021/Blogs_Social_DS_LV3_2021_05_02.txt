There’s a moment in *The Last of Us Part II*’s Grounded mode—deep in that rain-soaked forest chapter—where the game strips away any illusion of mercy. I’d been scraping by, rationing every bullet and blade, feeling grounded in its grim reality. Then, two shamblers emerged from the fog. My supplies were nearly gone.

I tried everything—stealth, evasion, a desperate Molotov—but each attempt ended with that dreaded fade to black. It was *so* frustrating. I felt that familiar 2021 tension: isolated, up against something bigger than myself, running on empty. It mirrored those days when just getting through felt like a boss battle.

Eventually, I swallowed my pride and reloaded an earlier save. Sometimes, starting over isn’t failure—it’s acknowledging your limits. That lesson, carved out in a virtual struggle, felt deeply human. We all face our own shamblers; having the courage to reset might be the real survival skill.
