## The Weight of Silence: When Professors Disappear and Grades Become a Mystery

Okay, let's be real for a minute. College. It's supposed to be this incredible journey of learning, growth, and figuring out who you are. We’re told it's an investment in our future, a springboard to amazing careers, and a time of forging lifelong friendships. And sometimes, it *is* all those things. But sometimes… it’s just *really* hard. And lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about just how much of that "hard" comes down to something surprisingly simple: communication – or, more accurately, the *lack* of it.

This past semester, I hit a wall. A pretty significant one. It wasn't a sudden crisis, more of a slow, creeping sense of dread that built up around one particular class. It wasn’t the material itself, I actually found it pretty fascinating. The problem was my professor.

Now, I’m not going to name names. This isn’t about publicly shaming anyone. It’s about exploring a really common, and incredibly damaging, dynamic that I think a lot of students experience, especially in the age of online learning and increasingly packed schedules. This was Fall 2021, remember? We were still navigating the weirdness of hybrid classes, staring at screens for hours on end, and feeling perpetually disconnected.

The core issue? Radio silence.

I’m talking emails unanswered for weeks. Office hours that felt like a black hole – show up and you’d find an empty room. Questions posed in class met with vague responses or, more often than not, were simply ignored. It wasn't intentional rudeness, I don’t think. It felt... detached. Like I was just another name on a roster, another grade to be assigned.

And it bled into everything. 

The final paper for this class was worth a huge chunk of our grade. I poured my heart and soul into it. I researched, I wrote, I revised. I even, nervously, sent a draft to the professor weeks before the deadline, hoping for some feedback, a little nudge in the right direction. Crickets.

That’s when the anxiety really started to set in. Was my topic too ambitious? Was my writing terrible? Was I just completely missing the point of the course? The uncertainty was crippling. I found myself second-guessing every decision, endlessly tweaking the paper, fueled by panic rather than genuine improvement.

I know I’m not alone in this. Scrolling through online forums and student groups, I saw the same frustrations echoed over and over.  The hashtag #professoraccountability was trending, not in a malicious way, but as a collective cry for basic support. Students were sharing stories of feeling lost, overwhelmed, and ultimately, devalued.

It's easy to blame the students, right? "Just work harder," they say. "Manage your time better." But what happens when you're putting in the effort,
