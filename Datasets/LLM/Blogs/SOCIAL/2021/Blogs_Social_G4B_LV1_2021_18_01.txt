**Lost in Translation (and Dishwasher Jargon)**

So, last year I was working a shift at a pretty busy commercial dishwasher – and I got totally thrown for a loop. My coworkers, mostly Hispanic, kept using this word, “batitas” or “baditas,” when talking about the dishes. I had *no* idea what it meant! It wasn’t just “dirty.” It was… something else.  It really highlighted how easily a single word can carry so much cultural context, and how much there is to learn when you’re stepping outside your own experience. #culturalawareness #learning
