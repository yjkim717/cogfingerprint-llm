## The Cone of Uncertainty (and a Little Kitten Drama)

Okay, friends, real talk. My little fluffball just got neutered. The vet, of course, prescribed the dreaded cone. But… he *isn’t* licking his incision! Is it still necessary? Part of me wants to ditch the cone and let him be, but the worry is real. Anyone else dealt with this post-surgery dilemma? Social media rabbit hole, here I come, searching for reassurance and kitten wisdom! Send help (and maybe some comfy cone alternatives!).
