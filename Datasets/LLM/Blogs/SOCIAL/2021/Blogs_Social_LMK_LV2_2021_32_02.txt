"Spreading My Wings, Breaking My Mom's Heart"

As I packed my bags and said goodbye to the familiar comforts of home in the summer of 2021, I couldn't shake off the guilt that lingered within me. At 24, I was finally taking the leap towards independence, but it came at a cost. My mom's tears and anger still linger in my mind, a painful reminder of the family conflict that arose as I moved away. It wasn't just about me leaving; it was about the echoes of the past - my sisters who had moved out before me, and the memories that came flooding back. The long distance between us now feels like a chasm, but I'm learning to navigate it. I'm slowly understanding that my journey towards self-discovery is not a betrayal, but a necessary step towards growth. As I settle into my new life, I'm finding solace in the fact that independence is not about cutting ties, but about becoming a stronger, wiser version of myself.
