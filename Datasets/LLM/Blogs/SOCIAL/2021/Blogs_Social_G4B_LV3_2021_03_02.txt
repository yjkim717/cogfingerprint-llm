**The Unexpected Mess of Connection**

Remember 2021? We were all desperately trying to *connect*, weren’t we? Scrolling, liking, commenting – a frantic attempt to feel seen in the digital space. It felt… exhausting, honestly. Like constantly cleaning and maintaining a virtual self, checking fluid levels of engagement to avoid a dreaded “build-up” of loneliness. 

I started noticing a pattern. The more I focused on *appearing* connected, the more isolated I felt. It made me realize that true connection isn’t about a perfectly curated feed; it’s about the messy, real moments – a quick phone call, a shared laugh, a genuine “how are you *really*?” 

Maybe it’s time to unplug the filters and focus on the simple maintenance of our actual relationships.
