You know that moment when you finally kick off your shoes after a long day? That’s exactly how I imagine it feels for service dogs like my friend’s golden retriever, Finn. After hours of focused work guiding his wheelchair-using partner, Finn’s “off-duty” time is sacred. Watching him bound through the park in 2021, leash-free and full of joy, reminds me that even the most dedicated helpers need—and deserve—their own time to just be a dog.
