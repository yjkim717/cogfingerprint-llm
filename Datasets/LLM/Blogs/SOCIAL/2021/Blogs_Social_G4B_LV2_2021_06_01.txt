**The Night I Became a Kangaroo Keeper**

Okay, so this might sound completely bonkers, but I had the weirdest dream last week. It was vivid, intensely unsettling, and it’s been rattling around in my head ever since. I was… guarding a kangaroo. Not a cute, cuddly one, mind you. This kangaroo was *furious*, practically radiating a simmering, vengeful energy. 

The dream started simple enough – a basic fence. Then, it escalated. Suddenly, I was installing reinforced steel gates, motion sensors, and a ridiculously complex laser grid. It felt like I was building a fortress, desperately trying to contain something powerful and utterly enraged. 

It got really strange. The kangaroo wasn’t just pacing; it was *plotting*. I could practically sense its frustration, its desire to break free. And the whole thing felt… symbolic, somehow. 

Thinking about it now, I realize it mirrored a lot of what I was feeling in 2021. The constant barrage of negativity online, the feeling of needing to build walls around myself to protect my peace, the sense of holding onto something volatile.  Social media, especially, felt like that kangaroo – a source of intense energy, but also a potential for hurt and anger.

It made me think about the importance of acknowledging those feelings, of not just building up defenses, but also finding ways to address the root of the “rage.”  Maybe we all need a little less laser grid and a little more understanding. 

What’s a dream of yours that’s stuck with you lately? Let’s talk about it in the comments.
