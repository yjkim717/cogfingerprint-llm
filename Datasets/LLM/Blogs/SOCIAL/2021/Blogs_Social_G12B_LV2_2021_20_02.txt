>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your keywords and summary, aiming for a relatable and reflective tone, set in 2021:

## The Bare Minimum and a Mountain of Shows

Okay, let's be real. How many of us are *actually* thriving right now? Like, truly, genuinely crushing it? I’m guessing not as many as Instagram would have you believe. 

I've been doing a lot of…existing lately. College is…well, it’s happening. I’m submitting assignments, technically attending lectures (thanks, online format!), but honestly, it feels like I’m just coasting. Bare minimum effort, maximum Netflix. Binge-watching has become a surprisingly effective procrastination strategy.

It’s not that I *want* to fail. It’s more…a lack of motivation? A weird sense of inertia?  I keep thinking, "Surely, this is enough, right?"  But a little voice whispers that maybe it isn't. Maybe I’m settling. 

Anyone else feeling this?  It's 2021, we're all a little weary, but I'm starting to wonder if just scraping by is robbing me of something more. Thoughts?

**Notes on this draft & why I made these choices:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Okay, let's be real," and direct questions to the reader.
*   **Relatability:** I tapped into the feeling of weariness and the commonality of procrastination, especially relevant in 2021 with the ongoing pandemic.
*   **Reflective:** The post doesn't just state the problem, but includes the student's internal questioning and self-awareness.
*   **Storytelling:** It's framed as a personal confession, which can draw readers in.
*   **Clear Language:**  Avoided overly complex vocabulary.
*   **Call to Action (Gentle):** Ending with a question encourages engagement and a sense of community.
