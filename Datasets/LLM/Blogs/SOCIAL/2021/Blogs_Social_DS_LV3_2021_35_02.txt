Of all the notifications that light up my phone, the ones from her still make my stomach drop. It’s 2021, and we’re all still living in these little digital squares, trying to bridge the gap between isolation and connection. My friend, let’s call her Maya, has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). I don’t. And in the space between those two realities is where our friendship often lives—a constant, careful navigation of a storm I can see on her horizon but can never truly feel.

The incident that brought this into sharpest focus happened on a Tuesday evening. I was already coiled tight with my own nameless, free-floating **anxiety**, the kind that had been a constant hum throughout the pandemic. I’d just finished a meditation app session, trying to quiet the noise, when my phone buzzed. It was a direct message from Maya. Not a text. An image.

It was a photo of her forearm, fresh, angry red lines stark against pale skin. The caption was just a single crying emoji.

My heart didn’t just sink; it plummeted. A wave of nausea washed over me, followed immediately by a surge of panic. What do I do? Call her? Drive over right now? My fingers flew across the screen, typing out a frantic, “Oh my god, are you okay? What happened? Please talk to me.” I was ready to drop everything, to be her hero, to fix it.

But I didn’t send it. I paused, my thumb hovering over the send button. And in that pause, something else surfaced beneath the panic: exhaustion. And with that exhaustion came a feeling so thick with guilt I could taste it—the metallic tang of shame. I was exhausted because this wasn’t the first time. It was a pattern. A cry for help, yes, but one that was increasingly directed at me, and I was starting to realize I didn’t have the tools, or the emotional capacity, to answer it correctly without breaking myself.

This is the unspoken, gut-wrenching tightrope of loving someone with a mental illness when you’re grappling with your own. The question isn’t “Do I care?” I care so much it physically aches. The question is, “How do I care without enabling? How do I support without becoming a casualty myself?”

For months, I had been operating without **boundaries**. Every late-night call, every graphic description of her pain, every image of self-harm, I absorbed like a sponge. I thought being a good friend meant being endlessly available, a bottomless well of empathy. I’d spend hours on the phone with her, and after we hung up, I’d lie in the dark, my own **anxiety** having mutated from a hum into a scream, her pain and imagery now looping in my own mind. I was so afraid that saying, “This is too much for me,” was the same as saying, “I don’t love you.”

But that Tuesday night, after staring at that image for what felt like an eternity, I knew I had to change the script. I couldn’t pour from an empty cup; mine wasn’t just empty, it was cracked.

I took a deep, shaky breath and typed a different message. “Maya, I love you, and I am so worried about you right now
