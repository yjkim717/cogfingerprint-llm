As we navigated the challenges of 2021, many of us found ourselves reevaluating our priorities, including our relationship with food. For me, that meant discovering the joy of simple, healthy recipes that fuel my day. One of my favorite breakfast staples is oat and banana pancakes - not only are they delicious, but they're also a great way to support my weight loss goals and meal prep for the week ahead. By incorporating wholesome ingredients like oats and fresh fruit, I can feel good about what I'm putting in my body. Plus, making a batch on the weekend means I can enjoy a quick and easy breakfast on-the-go, even on the busiest mornings. This recipe has become a game-changer for my morning routine, and I'm excited to share it with you - let's start the day off right, together!
