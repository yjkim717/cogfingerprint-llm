### The Night My Subconscious Adopted a Kangaroo

So, I had a dream the other night that my brain, in its infinite and slightly unhinged wisdom, decided I was the perfect candidate to adopt a pet kangaroo. Let me be clear: I have no background in marsupial care. My most ambitious pet was a goldfish that lived for a surprisingly long time. Yet, in this vivid, full-color dreamscape, I was the proud new owner of a six-foot-tall bundle of chaotic energy.

The dream wasn’t all cuddles and pouch inspections. This kangaroo had an agenda. It wasn’t content with a quiet life in my backyard; it was an escape artist, a neighborhood menace. I remember the surreal panic of installing an elaborate, towering electric fence, something straight out of a low-budget sci-fi movie. I stood there, hands on my hips, thinking, “This will do it. This is the solution.”

It was not. The kangaroo, with a look of pure, joyful defiance, would simply hop over it, leaving a trail of upturned trash cans and bewildered neighbors in its wake. The chaos was absolute.

Waking up was a relief, but the feeling lingered. As I sipped my coffee in the quiet of the 2021 morning, still working from my kitchen table, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. And it hit me—this absurd dream was a perfect metaphor for the anxieties we’d all been collectively living with.

The kangaroo was that one overwhelming, unpredictable problem we all seemed to have. Maybe it wasn't a marsupial for you, but a work project, a family stress, or just the general uncertainty of the world. We’d build our "electric fences"—our meticulous plans, our new routines, our attempts to control the uncontrollable. We’d think we had it contained, only for it to burst through and cause chaos all over again.

The dream’s humor, in its own weird way, was a comfort. It reminded me that sometimes, the problems we face are just too big, too bizarre, and too bouncy for any conventional solution. And maybe the lesson isn't about building a higher fence, but about learning to laugh at the sheer surrealism of it all, and acknowledging that sometimes, you just have to watch the kangaroo hop away and hope it doesn’t come back with its friends.
