**The Quiet Uprising**

It’s weird, right? Like, *really* weird. I hadn’t had a period in years, and I was almost… comfortable with it. Then, these phantom cramps started. No bleeding, just this insistent, dull ache. It threw my whole cycle tracking into chaos, and honestly, it felt like my body was staging a quiet uprising.  2021 was already a strange year, but this felt like a completely new, unsettling layer.  Anyone else experience this? #FTM #periodtracking #phantomcramps
