Of all the notifications that light up my phone, the ones from my friend, let’s call her Sam, are the ones that now make my breath catch. It’s 2021, and we’re all still living in this strange, digital purgatory, our friendships mediated by screens more than ever. My relationship with Sam is no different, but it carries a weight I never anticipated.

It started subtly. A meme about existential dread. A vague lyric about feeling empty. Then, the images began. Not frequently, but with a jarring, visceral impact that would derail my entire day. A photo of a bandaged wrist sent with a crying emoji. A picture of fresh scratches with the caption, “Having a bad brain day.”

My first reaction was always a cold wave of panic. *Is she safe? Right now? What do I do?* I’d type out a flurry of messages. “Are you okay?” “I’m here.” “Please talk to me.” Sometimes she’d respond, and we’d talk it through. Other times, radio silence, leaving me to stare at my phone, my own anxiety coiling in my chest, a frantic bird beating against my ribs.

You see, that’s the complicated knot of it all. I love Sam fiercely. She’s witty, incredibly creative, and when she’s doing well, her laughter is infectious. But she has Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), and part of her presentation includes what’s known as “splitting” – where I can be her absolute favourite person one day, and the next, I’m cast as the villain who has abandoned her, often for a minor, perceived slight. The self-harm images often come during these splits, a physical manifestation of her immense internal pain and a desperate, albeit distressing, cry for connection.

And me? I’m navigating my own mental health landscape, one dotted with anxiety triggers I’m still learning to map. The sudden, graphic nature of these images became one of the biggest triggers of all. I’d find myself unable to focus on work, my heart pounding for hours after receiving one. I felt responsible for her safety, as if her life was literally in my hands, held by the thin, fragile thread of a text message. The weight was crushing.

I knew something had to change. This wasn’t sustainable for either of us. My initial, panicked responses, though well-intentioned, weren’t helping her build healthier coping mechanisms, and they were actively harming me. I felt like I was failing as a friend. How could I be so selfish as to think of my own anxiety when she was in such clear, tangible pain?

The turning point came after a particularly difficult week. Sam had sent an image during a splitting episode where she was furious with me. My anxiety spiralled into a full-blown panic attack. Sitting on my bathroom floor, trying to remember how to breathe, I had a stark realisation: I couldn’t pour from an empty cup. I was so focused on being her support beam that I was neglecting my own foundation, which was already cracked.

I did two things I was terrified to do.

First, I reached out to a therapist. I needed professional guidance on how to set boundaries—a word that felt cruel and rejecting at the time. My therapist reframed it for me: boundaries aren’t walls to keep people out; they are the guardrails that keep both people safe on a treacherous road. She helped me understand that I am not Sam’s therapist. I cannot “fix” her BPD. My role is to be her friend, not her crisis manager.

Second, I had a painfully honest conversation with Sam. I didn’t do it in the heat of a crisis. I waited for a calm moment and said something like, “Sam, I love you, and I am always in your corner. Your pain is real and valid. But when you send me images of self-harm, it triggers my anxiety in a way that makes it hard for me to be the supportive friend I want to be. Can we agree that if you’re feeling that way, you text me and say ‘I’m struggling’ instead? I will always call you or come over if I can. But I can’t receive those images anymore.”

It was one of the hardest conversations I’ve ever had. There were tears. There was defensiveness. She felt I was pulling away. It took time and patience, and I had to reiterate my care for her while holding firm to my boundary.

It hasn’t been a perfect fix. Old habits die hard. But the frequency of those images has dropped dramatically. Now, when I get a text that says “I’m having a bad day,” I can respond from a place of calm, rather than panic. I can offer a listening ear, suggest a distracting movie night, or just sit with her in her feelings without my own system going into overdrive.

Supporting someone with a severe mental illness like BPD while protecting your own mental health is a constant, delicate balancing act. It’s not about choosing one over the other. It’s about understanding that my capacity to be a good, present friend is directly linked to my own well-being. In 2021, a year that has asked so much of our resilience, I’ve learned that the most supportive thing I can sometimes do is to make sure I’m still standing, too.
