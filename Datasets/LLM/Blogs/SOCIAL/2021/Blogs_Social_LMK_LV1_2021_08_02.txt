The State of Our Society in a Hotel Room

As I went about my day job as a hotel housekeeper in 2021, I couldn't help but notice the state of some of the rooms I cleaned. It wasn't just the usual mess you'd expect from a family vacation - toys scattered about, crumbs on the carpet, and spills on the furniture. No, some rooms were left in a state that made me wonder about the parents who had stayed there with their kids.

One particular room still haunts me. The family had clearly had a blast, but it was as if they'd made a game out of destroying the hotel room. The trash was overflowing, the TV was smashed, and there were scribbles on the walls. But what really caught my attention was the deliberate mess they'd left behind. It was as if they'd taken great care to make a mess, rather than it just being a result of having fun.

As I cleaned up the chaos, I couldn't help but think about the parenting issues that might be at play here. Were these parents too busy or too exhausted to care about the mess their kids were making? Or were they simply not teaching their children the importance of respecting other people's property? It's a reflection of our society, where some people seem to think that rules don't apply to them.

As I finished cleaning the room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness. Not just for the state of the room, but for the kids who were being taught that it's okay to be reckless and irresponsible. It's a lesson that will stick with them long after they check out of that hotel room.
