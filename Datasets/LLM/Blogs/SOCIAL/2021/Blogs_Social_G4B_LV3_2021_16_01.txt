**The Silent Treatment That Almost Cost Me Everything**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 felt like a year of navigating a lot of unseen currents. And I had a particularly jarring experience with a professor that I still think about. It wasn’t a dramatic confrontation, just a slow, unsettling silence. 

I was working my tail off in a challenging history course, genuinely trying to grasp the material. But my professor? He just… didn’t respond. No feedback on assignments, no clarifying questions, nothing. It felt like I was shouting into a void. 

By the time the midterms rolled around, I knew I was in trouble. The grade reflected it – a potential failing. It wasn't about laziness or lack of effort; it was about feeling completely disconnected and unsupported. 

It was a harsh reminder that communication, even in an academic setting, is *everything*.  It highlighted how easily we can feel lost and discouraged when the people meant to guide us are absent.  It’s a lesson I'm still carrying with me, a quiet push to always advocate for myself and to recognize when a connection is missing.  Has anyone else experienced something similar?
