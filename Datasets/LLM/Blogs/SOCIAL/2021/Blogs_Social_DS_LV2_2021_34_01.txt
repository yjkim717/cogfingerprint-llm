The sun streams through my window, illuminating the dust on my untouched planner. It’s 2021, and my Adderall prescription is filled, my to-do list is clear, yet I’m frozen. The chasm between knowing I need to start a simple task and actually beginning feels miles wide.

This isn't a lack of motivation; it's my ADHD's executive dysfunction holding the reins. I see the path, but my brain refuses to take the first step. If you’ve ever felt paralyzed by your own mind, staring at a task you're fully capable of doing, know you're not alone in this silent, frustrating struggle.
