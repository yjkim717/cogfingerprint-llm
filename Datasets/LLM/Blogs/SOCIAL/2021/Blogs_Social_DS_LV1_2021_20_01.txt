You know that feeling when a song transports you back in time? Lately, I've been diving back into the Korean music of my youth—the late 90s and early 2000s. There's something uniquely warm and nostalgic about those SM Entertainment tracks from artists like H.O.T., S.E.S., and BoA. In 2021, with everything feeling so uncertain, their melodies offer a comforting escape, a reminder of simpler days and the pure, inspired joy music can bring. It’s like a musical hug for the soul.
