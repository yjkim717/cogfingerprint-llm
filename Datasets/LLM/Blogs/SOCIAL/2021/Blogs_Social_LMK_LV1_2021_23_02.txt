"As I watched my mischievous kitten, Luna, struggle with the 'cone of shame' after her neuter surgery in 2021, I felt a pang of guilt. Was I doing more harm than good by keeping it on? I scoured the internet for advice, consulting with fellow pet owners and vets. It was clear that post-op care is a delicate balance. I learned that patience and observation were key to ensuring Luna's recovery, and that sometimes, a little extra love and care can go a long way."
