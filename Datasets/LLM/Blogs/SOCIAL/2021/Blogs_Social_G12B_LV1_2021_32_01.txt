**Title: The Slow Fade: Reclaiming My Space (and My Peace)**

Okay, deep breath. I needed to write this down somewhere, even if it's just for myself. 2021 has been… a lot. I think a lot of us can say that, right? But for me, it’s felt like a slow, steady chipping away at my own sense of self. And I’m finally starting to understand *why*.

For years, I’ve navigated a family dynamic that felt…off. Like walking on eggshells. Constant criticism, emotional manipulation, and a general sense that my feelings were never really *valid*. Looking back, and after a lot of reading and (frankly, painful) self-reflection, I'm realizing that my parents exhibit a lot of narcissistic traits. It’s a difficult thing to admit, especially when societal expectations tell you to cherish and obey your parents above all else.

But the truth is, staying in that environment was draining the life out of me. Every conversation felt like a performance, every decision scrutinized and judged. I was constantly seeking their approval, a need that never seemed to be met. It was exhausting.

So, I've made a decision. A big one. I’m moving out. And beyond that, I’m seriously considering significantly limiting contact. "No contact" felt too extreme, at least for now. Maybe a "low contact" approach is more realistic. It’s terrifying, honestly. The guilt is *real*. But the thought of continuing down this path, sacrificing my mental and emotional well-being, is even more so.

This isn’t about cutting them out of my life entirely. It’s about protecting myself. It's about creating space for *me* to breathe and heal. It's about learning to trust my own judgment and validate my own feelings.

It’s a process, a slow fade. And I know there will be difficult days. But for the first time in a long time, I feel a flicker of hope. A sense that I’m finally taking control of my own narrative. Wish me luck. I think I’m going to need it.
