**The Scroll & The Void**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How easily we can get lost in the endless scroll of social media in 2021. I felt it acutely last month – a deep, unsettling feeling of… nothing. Like I was *present* but not *connected*. 

I’d spend hours scrolling, desperately seeking that spark of connection, that validation. But it always left me feeling emptier than before. It mirrored that feeling of ADHD – the frantic ‘getting started’ on something, only to stall before actually *doing* it. 

Suddenly, I realized I was avoiding real life, avoiding my own thoughts. It was exhausting. Taking a break, just putting down the phone, was the hardest, and most rewarding, thing I did.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post focused on a different theme?
