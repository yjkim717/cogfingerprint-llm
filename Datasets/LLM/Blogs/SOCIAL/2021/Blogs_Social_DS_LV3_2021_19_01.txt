It’s 2021, and I’ve been stuck in a creative rut for months. Then I stumbled upon Pete Beard’s YouTube channel. His deep dives into art history and illustration techniques felt like a private masterclass. Suddenly, I wasn't just watching videos; I was connecting with the minds of past illustrators, understanding their choices and struggles. It reminded me that learning is a social act, even alone with a screen. That channel didn't just teach me—it made me part of a conversation across time.
