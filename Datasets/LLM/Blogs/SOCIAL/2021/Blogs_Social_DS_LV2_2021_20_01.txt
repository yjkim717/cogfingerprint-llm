There’s something about that old-school K-pop sound—the synth beats, the heartfelt ballads from SM Entertainment artists in the ‘90s and early 2000s. In 2021, with everything feeling so uncertain, I find myself hitting play on those retro Korean tracks. Suddenly, I’m wrapped in warmth, nostalgia washing over me like a familiar hug. It’s more than music; it’s a time capsule, a comforting escape that still inspires. Who else leans on these timeless tunes?
