"Unfinished Business: My Guilt Over Berserk"

As I scrolled through my social media feed in 2021, I was hit with the news that still lingers in my mind - Kentaro Miura, the mastermind behind the dark fantasy anime Berserk, had left us far too soon. I felt a pang of guilt wash over me as I realized I had never mustered the courage to watch the series. All those years, I had been meaning to dive into the world of Guts and Griffith, but somehow never got around to it. Now, with Miura-sensei gone, I felt like I was stuck. Watching Berserk would be a painful reminder of my procrastination, and yet, not watching it felt like I was disrespecting his legacy. I'm still torn, unsure if I'll ever be able to bring myself to watch it. The guilt lingers, a constant reminder of the unfinished business that haunts me.
