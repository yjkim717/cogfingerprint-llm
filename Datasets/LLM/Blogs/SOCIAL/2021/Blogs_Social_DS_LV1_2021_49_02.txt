It’s 2021, and I still feel that familiar knot in my stomach before walking into a grocery store. I see shows like *My 600-lb Life* and wonder—why face the stares when delivery is a tap away? But then I get it. It’s not just about food; it’s about being seen. That small, brave act of stepping outside, despite the anxiety, is a quiet rebellion against the fear of judgment. Maybe we’re all just trying to reclaim our space, one aisle at a time.
