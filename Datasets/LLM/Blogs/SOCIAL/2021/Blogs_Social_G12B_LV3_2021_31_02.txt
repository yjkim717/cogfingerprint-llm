## That Sign I Couldn't Quite Place...

Anyone else ever notice a recurring sign or gesture and just *need* to know what it means? I stumbled across a fascinating thread on Reddit the other day where someone was trying to decode an ASL sign they kept seeing. It really struck a chord! It’s a beautiful reminder of how much unspoken communication exists, and how eager we are to connect and understand each other, even across different languages – visual ones included. Makes you wonder what other subtle cues we miss daily!
