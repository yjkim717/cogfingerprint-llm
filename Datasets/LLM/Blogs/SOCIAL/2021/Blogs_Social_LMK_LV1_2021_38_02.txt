As I scrolled through social media in 2021, I stumbled upon a jaw-dropping post about a rare Boba Fett toy being sold at a pawn shop. The shop, eerily reminiscent of the ones featured on "Pawn Stars," claimed the item was legit. But I couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. Was this toy stolen from the manufacturer? It's unsettling to think that a prototype might have been pilfered and ended up in the hands of unsuspecting buyers, highlighting the darker side of the collectibles trade.
