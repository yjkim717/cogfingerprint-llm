### The Silence That Made Me Hear Everything

It started with a frustration I think a lot of us felt in 2021. My world had become a constant, low-grade hum of noise. Podcasts while cooking, streaming playlists while working, background TV while scrolling. As a sound engineer, my entire life was built around audio, but I realized I was hardly ever truly *listening*.

My brain, with its wonderful, distracting ADHD energy, was constantly being fed, but never truly nourished. I was in five places at once, mentally. So, I decided on a radical experiment: for two weeks, I would cut out all *passive* listening. No music as a filler. Just silence, or the intentional choice to engage.

The first few days were… loud. Not externally, but internally. My mind was a browser with too many tabs open. But then, something shifted. The silence stopped being empty and started becoming a canvas. I noticed the rhythmic click of my keyboard, the distant chatter of birds outside my window—a whole symphony I’d been drowning out.

When I finally sat down in my studio to actively work on a mix, the difference was staggering. Without my brain being accustomed to constant background input, my focus was laser-sharp. I wasn’t just hearing frequencies and levels; I was *feeling* the emotion of the music. I could pinpoint the subtle breath of a vocalist, the faint decay of a reverb tail. I was present with the art in a way I hadn't been in years.

This wasn't about giving up music; it was about reclaiming my attention. In a world designed to pull our focus in a million directions, choosing silence became my ultimate act of active listening. It taught me that sometimes, to hear the world—and the people in it—more clearly, you first have to dare to turn down the noise.
