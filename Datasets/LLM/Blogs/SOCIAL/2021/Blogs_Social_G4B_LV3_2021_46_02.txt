**The Weight of the Scroll**

It feels a little silly admitting this, but lately, I’ve been carrying a heavy weight – and it’s not physical. It’s the weight of…everything. Scrolling. The endless feed. 2021 was supposed to be about *doing*, about rebuilding, but I found myself spending more and more time just…absorbing. 

There’s a word for it, isn’t there? *World-weariness*. It’s creeping in, a dull ache beneath the surface of daily life. I’m not immune to the anxieties swirling around social media – the curated perfection, the constant comparisons, the feeling that everyone else is living a more exciting, fulfilling life. It's exhausting. 

I remember last summer, desperately trying to keep up with everyone’s ‘perfect’ vacations, feeling this sharp pang of…well, despair, really. Like I was missing out on *something*. But then, I started to notice a strange thing. When I stepped away from the screen, even for an hour, the exhaustion lessened. 

There’s still a flicker of hope, though. A quiet belief that maybe, just maybe, a simpler existence is possible. Maybe it's about choosing connection over consumption, and finding joy in the small, un-filtered moments.  It’s a constant battle, honestly, but I'm learning to be kinder to myself, and to recognize that my worth isn’t measured in likes or followers.

Do you want me to tweak anything about this, perhaps adjust the tone or focus on a specific aspect?
