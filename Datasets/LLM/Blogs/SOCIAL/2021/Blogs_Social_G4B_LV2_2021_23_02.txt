**Cone of Shame Blues**

Anyone else’s little ones give them *serious* side-eye? My nephew just got his kitten, Leo, neutered last week, and the “cone of shame” is a battle. He’s absolutely miserable, and it’s heartbreaking to watch. Social media was flooded with similar stories – tiny, frustrated faces and a whole lot of head-butting. It’s a reminder that even the cutest moments come with challenges, and a little empathy goes a long way. ❤️ #kittenlife #catcare #postop
