## The Bullet Journal & My Scattered Brain (It's Okay, Right?)

Okay, so I jumped on the bullet journal bandwagon like *everyone* else in 2021. Pinterest was overflowing with gorgeous spreads, minimalist layouts, and people flawlessly tracking every aspect of their lives. I envisioned myself being one of them – organized, productive, and deeply reflective.

Reality? A little different.

I’m finding it surprisingly hard to actually *write* in it. It’s not the drawing, surprisingly. It’s the feeling of… pressure? Like I need to be perfectly productive to justify its existence. And then there's the overwhelm of all the possibilities! Do I track my water intake? My reading? My gratitude? It’s paralyzing!

Anyone else feeling this? I'm starting to think maybe the point isn't to create a work of art, but just to… show up. Even if it’s just a few messy bullet points. Maybe that's the key to unlocking this whole journaling thing. Wish me luck!
