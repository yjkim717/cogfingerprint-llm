**The Quiet That Changed Everything**

Okay, so 2021 was… a lot, right? Scrolling through endless feeds, notifications pinging, music blasting in the background – it was the default setting for pretty much everything. As a social media manager, I practically *lived* in that soundscape. And honestly? I was starting to feel it. A low-level hum of distraction, a constant pull away from anything truly focused.

Then, I did something completely out of character. I took two weeks. No scrolling. No podcasts. Just… quiet. I ended up spending a lot of time with my old recording equipment, dusting it off and actually *using* it.  It felt incredibly strange at first, like a part of me was missing. 

But something shifted. I started to really listen to music again – not just as background noise, but as something to be *felt*. I even revisited some meditation techniques I'd abandoned months before. 

It was like a fog had lifted.  I realized how much of my attention was being hijacked by the sheer volume of sound. Coming back to social media felt different – less urgent, more intentional.  It’s funny how a little silence can completely reset your relationship with everything, including the platforms we’re so used to relying on.  Anyone else ever try a digital detox?
