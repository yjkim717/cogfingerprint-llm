The Hypocrisy on Our Roads. 
As I drove home on a busy 2021 evening, a car whizzed past me, crossing double lines and cutting off another vehicle. I was shocked, but what followed was even more astonishing - a police car was right behind me. I expected them to chase after the reckless driver, but they didn't. Instead, they stayed behind me, tailing me for a while before driving off. It got me thinking - why didn't they intervene? It seemed like a classic case of hypocrisy. The police are there to enforce the law and keep our roads safe, but in this instance, they failed to act. It's experiences like these that make you question the consistency of law enforcement. Was the reckless driver known to them, or was it just a case of being in the wrong car at the wrong time? Whatever the reason, it's unsettling to see such disparities on our roads.
