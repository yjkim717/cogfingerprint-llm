**The Weight of a Recommendation**

It’s funny how a simple request – a friend wanting a nose piercing – can suddenly feel loaded with responsibility.  I remember last year, scrolling through Reddit, seeing someone asking for a good piercer in St. Catharines.  That feeling of wanting to help, to point them towards someone trustworthy, is surprisingly powerful.  Avoiding certain shops, considering a trip to Toronto… it’s a small thing, really, but a reflection of the care we give to those we want to support.
