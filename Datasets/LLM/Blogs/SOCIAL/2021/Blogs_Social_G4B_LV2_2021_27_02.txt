**Remembering the Dogecoin Buzz of '21**

Anyone else vividly recall the sheer *energy* of 2021? Specifically, the Dogecoin craze? It felt…wild. Suddenly, everyone was talking about it, fueled by Elon Musk and a whole lot of hopeful investors. I remember scrolling through Twitter, seeing ‘whales’ – big accounts – driving the price up, and feeling this strange mix of excitement and disbelief.
