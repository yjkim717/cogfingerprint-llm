>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your provided information, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and a 2021 context. I've tried to weave in the *Inside* reference and the gardening/grow lamp symbolism naturally.  I've also included a potential title.

**Title: Finding My Own Light (and a Few Tomato Plants)**

It’s funny how life throws you curveballs, isn’t it? 2021 has been… a lot. Scrolling through social media felt like staring into a black hole sometimes – endless news, endless comparison, endless *everything*. Then, almost on a whim, I started a little garden. Just a few herbs and some tomato plants.

And something shifted. Tending to those tiny seedlings, watching them reach for the light, it reminded me of Bo Burnham's *Inside*. The whole thing felt like a metaphor for finding your own sources of illumination when the world feels overwhelmingly dark. I even invested in some grow lamps – not exactly stylish, but they *work*. It’s a small thing, but nurturing something real, something tangible, has been unexpectedly grounding. Maybe we all need a little extra light these days.
