It’s funny how our own lives shape the way we see art. When I watched Bo Burnham’s *Inside* in 2021, everyone was talking about the lighting—how it symbolized the cold glow of our phones, the isolation of screens. But my mind went somewhere else entirely.

That year, I’d started gardening indoors, relying on a small grow lamp to keep my plants alive. Watching Bo navigate his own cramped space, I couldn’t help but see that same kind of light—not just as a cell phone, but as something nurturing. A quiet, deliberate glow meant for growth in dark times.

Maybe we find symbols that speak to where we are. For me, it wasn’t about being trapped inside, but about what we choose to cultivate there.
