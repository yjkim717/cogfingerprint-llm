**The Summer Shame**

Okay, let’s be real – 2021 was… a lot. And for me, summer felt like a particularly brutal wave. It’s not that I don’t *like* sunshine and swimming, but the pressure to be relentlessly cheerful just felt crushing. Like, everyone was posting those perfect, golden-hour photos, and I was just…existing. 

There was this weird self-consciousness, a constant feeling of being judged for not matching the ‘summer vibes.’  I found myself desperately needing to vent to anyone who would listen, just to acknowledge that this forced happiness felt completely wrong. 

Honestly, it triggered a weird seasonal anxiety – a feeling of dread that just seemed to settle in with the longer days. It’s a surprisingly common thing, isn’t it?  It’s okay to not *feel* the summer. It’s okay to need a little quiet, a little space from the expectations.
