**Lost in the Feels: Remembering a Different Kind of Social**

Okay, be honest – anyone else scrolling through old social media feeds and feeling a serious wave of nostalgia? It’s weird, right? For me, a lot of it circles back to the late 90s and early 2000s – specifically, the K-Pop explosion. Groups like S.E.S. were *everything*. 

There was a rawness to it, a genuine excitement. It felt less curated, more… real.  Comparing it to the hyper-polished content of 2021 is a stark contrast.  It makes you wonder what we’ve lost in the pursuit of perfect feeds.  Anyone else feeling this pang? #nostalgia #kpop #90sfeelings
