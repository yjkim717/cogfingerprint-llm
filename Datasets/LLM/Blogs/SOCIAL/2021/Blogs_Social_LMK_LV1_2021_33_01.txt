"Road Rage and Responsibility: When Cops Don't Crack Down"

I'll never forget the drive home from work last week when I witnessed a blatant traffic violation. A car zoomed past a line of slow-moving vehicles, weaving in and out of lanes without so much as a glance in the rearview. My eyes instinctively darted to the speed limit sign - 65 mph - and then back to the reckless driver, who was now tailgating the car in front. I was shocked when the driver managed to squeeze past the slowpokes and sped off into the distance.

What caught my attention, though, was the police car behind me. The officer didn't even flinch, just kept cruising along as if nothing had happened. It's incidents like these that make me wonder - are our roads becoming more lawless? In 2021, with all the emphasis on road safety, it's disheartening to see such blatant disregard for the rules. Was the cop just having a lazy day, or are we normalizing such reckless behavior?
