It’s 2021, and I’m still processing the family bombshell that dropped last month. I’d been doing so well, but this secret sent me spiraling—hello, mental breakdown. My first instinct? Hide and regress into old, unhealthy habits. But I knew I couldn’t go back there. So, I started counseling. It’s not a magic fix, but it’s helping me cope, piece by piece. Sharing this feels vulnerable, but if my story reminds even one person that it’s okay to seek help, it’s worth it. We’re all just doing our best to move forward, right?
