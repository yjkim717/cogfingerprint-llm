**The Unfollow Button and a Heavy Heart**

2021 felt… strange, didn’t it? Like everyone was desperately trying to curate a perfect online life, a highlight reel of vacations and achievements. And honestly, scrolling through it all felt like a tiny, constant ache. I realized I was spending so much energy worrying about how my life *looked* to others, especially my extended family – a family that, let’s be honest, had been a source of significant stress for years.

My parents are… complicated. Let’s just say they’re a textbook example of narcissistic patterns, and maintaining a relationship with them has been a minefield of emotional manipulation and invalidation.  It got to a point where seeing their posts – carefully crafted images of a happy, idyllic life – felt like a punch to the gut. 

So, I started unfollowing. Not dramatically, not with a huge announcement. Just… quietly, one by one. It wasn’t about judgment, not really. It was about protecting myself. It was about creating space for my own healing and prioritizing my well-being after years of navigating a toxic family dynamic. 

There’s a strange sense of liberation in saying goodbye to the digital versions of people who’ve caused you pain. It's a small act, but it feels powerfully aligned with the need for no contact and a commitment to self-preservation.  It’s a reminder that you get to decide who you let into your emotional space, and sometimes, that means letting go.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
