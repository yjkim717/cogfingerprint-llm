### The Unexpected Community in My Minecraft Server

Back in 2021, stuck in yet another lockdown, I decided to do something I’d never had the patience for: run a Minecraft server. I’m a tinkerer at heart, so I set it up on an old Ubuntu machine, diving headfirst into the world of headless servers and command lines. My goal was simple but technical—to install custom world-generation datapacks without a graphical interface. I spent hours on forums, piecing together commands from cryptic tutorials.

But the real magic didn’t happen in the code. It happened when I finally got the "Vanilla Tweaks" packs running and invited a few friends. Our new world, with its strange, custom-shaped mountains and hidden structures, became more than a game. It became our digital town square. We’d log on not just to mine and build, but to chat in voice call, sharing our isolation and laughter across the distance.

That server taught me that the most complex systems we build—whether with code or with care—are ultimately just frameworks for human connection. In a year we spent so far apart, we built a little world together, one block and one conversation at a time.
