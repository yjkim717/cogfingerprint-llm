The PCT job rejections stung, but my third-year clinicals in 2021 taught me something vital. While I lacked formal healthcare experience, I was already living it—calming a nervous patient, noticing subtle changes, learning to truly listen. Those moments in clinicals weren’t just checkboxes; they were the heart of patient care. Now, I see my applications differently. It’s not about the title I don’t have yet, but the compassionate presence I’ve been practicing all along.
