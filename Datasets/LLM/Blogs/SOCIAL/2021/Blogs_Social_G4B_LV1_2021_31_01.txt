**Suddenly, It Felt…Easy?**

Okay, so 2021 was *weird*, right? Still navigating the whole “socially” thing. But last month, something genuinely unexpected happened. After, like, six months of just…existing, I went on a first date. With a guy. And he was… great. Seriously. 

There was a definite shyness vibe at first, you know? We both kind of just stumbled through the conversation. But then, this little spark ignited. It wasn't a grand, cinematic moment, just a comfortable ease. We ended with a kiss – totally spontaneous, and actually really nice. 

I’m not saying it was a fairytale, or even a guaranteed ‘hookup’ situation. It felt… hopeful. Like maybe, just maybe, reconnecting with people wasn’t as terrifying as I’d been making it out to be.  Definitely craving a ‘gaybros’ catch-up soon!  What about you – any surprising social moments lately?
