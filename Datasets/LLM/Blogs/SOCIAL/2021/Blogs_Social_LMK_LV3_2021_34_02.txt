"After the Crash: Navigating the Unseen Effects of a Head Injury"

In 2021, I witnessed a harrowing car accident that left a 19-year-old woman shaken - literally. The crash was severe enough to cause her to lose consciousness and leak clear fluid from her ear, a sign of a potentially serious head injury. What's striking is that her CT scan showed no major damage, yet the incident raised more questions than answers about the long-term impact of traumatic brain injuries. As we navigated the aftermath, it became clear that the true extent of her injury wouldn't be fully understood without a thorough neurological checkup. This experience made me realize how easily we can overlook the subtle yet significant effects of concussions and head injuries. It's a wake-up call to prioritize our brain health, especially after a concussion or car accident, and to appreciate the importance of comprehensive medical checkups in uncovering the unseen consequences of such incidents.
