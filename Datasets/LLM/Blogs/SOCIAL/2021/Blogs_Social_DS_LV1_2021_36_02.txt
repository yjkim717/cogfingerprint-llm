### The Commute They Never Show

You know what finally broke me? It wasn’t the fifth consecutive “signal malfunction” on the 4 train. It was binge-watching a glossy NYC show where the characters zipped from a Brooklyn brownstone to a Midtown lunch meeting in what seemed like 10 minutes. I actually laughed out loud on my couch.

In 2021, my reality was a careful calculus of subway transfers and the soul-crushing gamble of Manhattan traffic. A simple crosstown coffee date required the logistical planning of a small military operation. Yet, on screen, the city is a seamless, frictionless playground.

I get it—watching someone wait 20 minutes for a delayed L train isn’t “good television.” But in smoothing over these shared struggles, these shows erase a fundamental NYC truth. Our character isn’t forged in the destination, but in the chaotic, frustrating, and often absurd journey to get there. Showing that wouldn’t just be more accurate; it would be a quiet nod of solidarity to every one of us who has ever been late because the city itself said, "Not today."
