Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your summary and guidelines:

**The Weight of Tomorrow**

Remember when we used to build things – massive, impressive things – without really thinking about what would happen *after*? Like, seriously, did anyone stop to consider what we’d leave behind? I was thinking about it a lot in 2021, staring at headlines about nuclear energy and, frankly, the sheer volume of nuclear waste piling up.

It’s a weird feeling, isn’t it? Knowing that we’re creating a problem for future generations, a burden they’ll have to carry. It feels… irresponsible. We talk about environmental responsibility, about being good stewards of the planet, but sometimes our actions speak louder than our words. 

This isn’t about demonizing nuclear energy – it’s about recognizing that progress shouldn’t come at the expense of those who come after us.  We need to be smarter, more thoughtful, and ask ourselves: what kind of legacy are we truly building?

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
