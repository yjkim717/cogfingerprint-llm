### My Quarantine Project: Breathing New Life into Old Game Boy Cartridges

Remember that box of old Game Boy games gathering dust in the attic? During the 2021 lockdowns, I finally faced mine. I wanted to honor these tiny cartridges, so I decided to build them a proper home.

Inspired by online creators, I dove into Blender, a free 3D editing software. My mission? To design and print custom cases that blended the iconic look of GameCube cases with the sleekness of PSP ones. It was a steep learning curve—my first attempts were hilariously lopsided. But after countless YouTube tutorials, I held a perfect, custom-fit case for my childhood copy of *Pokémon Gold*.

This project was more than a hobby; it was a form of connection. Sharing my progress online, I found a whole community of retro enthusiasts doing the same. In a year we spent apart, this little craft unexpectedly brought us together, one 3D-printed case at a time.
