As I sat for my linear algebra exam in 2021, I realized that the open book format wasn't just about having resources at my fingertips. It was about understanding the connections between matrices, multidimensional ODE's, and stochastics. I recalled how a friend used real-world examples to grasp these complex concepts. This experience made me think - are our assessments truly testing our knowledge, or just our ability to navigate our notes?
