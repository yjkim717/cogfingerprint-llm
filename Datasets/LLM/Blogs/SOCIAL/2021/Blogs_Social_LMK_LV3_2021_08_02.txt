"The Messy Truth About Parenting: A Housekeeper's Lament". 
As I reflect on my experience as a hotel housekeeper in 2021, I'm reminded of the countless times I've walked into a room and felt a mix of frustration and dismay. The state some parents leave their rooms in, after checking out with their little ones, is nothing short of astonishing. Toys scattered everywhere, trash overflowing, and sometimes, it seems like they've intentionally trashed the place. It's as if some parents have lost sight of basic hospitality norms, treating a hotel room like their own personal playground. I'm not asking for perfection, but a little responsibility wouldn't go amiss. It's disheartening to see the lack of effort some parents put into teaching their kids about respect for others' property. As someone who's seen it all, I wonder, are we as a society failing to instill a sense of accountability in our children?
