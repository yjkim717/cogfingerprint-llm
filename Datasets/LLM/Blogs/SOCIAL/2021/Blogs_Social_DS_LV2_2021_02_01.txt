The year was 2021, and in the digital expanse of No Man's Sky, I found a strange parallel to our socially-distanced world. I was on a tough expedition, utterly stranded without a ship.

Then I found it: a bustling trading post. It wasn't the ships or the resources that struck me most; it was the other players. We couldn't speak, but we exchanged friendly gestures, shared discoveries, and used the simple trade terminals to indirectly help one another stockpile what we each lacked.

In a year we were often forced apart, this little hub reminded me that connection isn't always about grand conversations. Sometimes, it's the quiet, shared understanding in a common struggle, and the simple, unspoken agreement to help each other get back to the stars.
