### The Quiet Chores of Connection

It was during the third load of laundry in our 2021 lockdown bubble that it hit me. As I ran an empty cycle with vinegar to clean the washing machine, I thought about all the invisible maintenance we were suddenly doing. Not just for our appliances, but for ourselves.

We were all running our own “empty cycles.” The Zoom call with a friend where we didn’t talk about anything important, just to see a familiar face. The careful cleaning of the dishwasher’s filter felt like tending to the small, grimy build-ups of our own anxieties. We learned that too much soap—or in our case, too much frantic news consumption—just leaves a residue that’s hard to rinse out.

Maintaining a machine isn’t about the grand gestures; it’s the small, consistent acts that prevent a breakdown. In a year that felt overwhelmingly broken, we rediscovered that the same is true for our connections. It’s the quiet, regular check-ins that clear the traps and keep everything running smoothly, long after the world starts spinning normally again.
