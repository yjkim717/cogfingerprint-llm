**Scrolling into the Void**

Okay, real talk. Lately, I’ve felt… utterly drained. Like I’m wading through mud, and every step just pulls me deeper. It’s weird, because I *know* I should be excited about 2021, about the possibilities. But honestly, a lot of the time I just feel this heavy, suffocating *world-weariness*.

I think it’s the internet. Or, more specifically, the endless, curated highlight reels of everyone else’s lives. Social media just feels like a constant pressure to be *more*, to be happier, to be… better. It’s exhausting. 

There's this creeping sense that nothing feels real anymore, just a performance.  I’ve been craving something simple, something genuine.  I’m not saying delete everything – that’s probably not the answer – but I need to be more mindful about how I’m consuming it all.  Maybe a little less scrolling, a little more… breathing.  Anyone else feeling this way lately? #depression #socialmedia #2021 #mentalhealth

Would you like me to generate a different version, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect of the summary or aiming for a slightly different tone?
