## The Doorway Drama: Reclaiming My Home (and My Sanity) After Lockdown

Remember those blissful days of lockdown? The constant companionship, the cozy routines, the feeling of…well, *home*? I certainly do. And like so many of us, I’m slowly easing back into office life. But there’s been a rather vocal casualty of this transition: my cat, Jasper.

He's developed a serious case of separation anxiety, and it manifests in dramatic howling sessions the moment I step through the front door after work. It’s not a quiet meow, folks. It’s a full-blown, operatic wail that echoes through the apartment. Honestly, it's a little embarrassing!

It's heartbreaking to hear him so distressed. I feel guilty leaving him, even though I know he's perfectly capable of entertaining himself. I’ve been trying a few things – leaving out puzzle toys, rotating his cat walks to keep him stimulated, even playing calming music when I leave. Distraction seems to be the key. A crinkly ball or a feather wand usually buys me a few precious moments of quiet. 

This whole experience has been a surprisingly emotional one. It's a stark reminder of how much our pets adapt to our routines, and how disorienting change can be for them. It’s also a gentle nudge to be more mindful of their needs, even when *I'm* juggling a million things. 

Anyone else dealing with post-lockdown pet adjustments? Send help (and cat-approved distraction techniques)! I'm clearly going to need them.
