It’s 2021, and my TikTok feed is a blur of dance trends and memes—but I’m on a different mission. As a longtime Naruto fan, I’ve noticed how many new viewers are diving into the series, hungry for more than surface-level takes. So, I started digging deeper, researching characters like Shisui Uchiha or Kimimaro, whose stories carry so much weight but get overlooked. Each video I create feels like passing on a piece of the ninja world’s soul, not just trivia. Seeing comments like, “I never knew this!” or “This changes everything!” reminds me that storytelling, even in 60 seconds, can build real connection. Who knew a little research could make a fandom feel like home?
