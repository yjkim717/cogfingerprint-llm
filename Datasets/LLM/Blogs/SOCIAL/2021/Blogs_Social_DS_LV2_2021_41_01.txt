### The Pancake That Saved My Sanity

Remember 2021? We were all still glued to our screens, trying to figure out this new hybrid life. My social life had become a series of little rectangles on a Zoom call, and honestly, I was lonely.

One gray Tuesday, I decided to make those oat banana pancakes I’d saved on my phone weeks ago. As I mashed the banana and mixed in the oats, something shifted. It was quiet, methodical, and real.

The next weekend, I texted a friend: "Come over. I'm making pancakes." She came. We stood in my kitchen, laughing, with real sunlight—not a virtual background—streaming through the window. No fancy brunch, just simple, healthy pancakes and a proper conversation.

It hit me then: connection doesn't need to be a grand gesture. Sometimes, it’s just sharing a quick, wholesome meal. That little ritual of cooking for someone became my anchor. It was my small rebellion against the digital drift, a way to nourish my body and my friendships, one calorie-counted pancake at a time.
