**The Tightrope Walk of Showing Up**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How much of ourselves we keep hidden, even from the people we *want* to share our lives with. I was scrolling through Instagram in 2021 – everyone seemed to be thriving, launching businesses, travelling – and I felt this intense pressure to project a perfect image. But underneath, I was really struggling with my mental health, specifically with a really difficult eating disorder. 

Recently, I had to ask my new boss for some accommodations, a tiny step towards acknowledging the chaos inside. It was terrifying. The thought of admitting I needed support felt like exposing a raw, vulnerable part of myself. And then, the even harder part – talking to my friends and family. 

It's a tightrope walk, isn't it? Showing up authentically while protecting yourself.  Recovery isn’t about being fearless; it's about finding the courage to ask for help, one shaky step at a time.  It’s a reminder that seeking support isn't a weakness, but a sign of strength.  And honestly, it’s okay to not have all the answers.
