"As a digital artist on-the-go, I'm always on the lookout for reliable gear. In 2021, I put Huion's Kamvas 13 to the test with a Thunderbolt extender on both Windows and MacOS. To my surprise, it worked seamlessly on Windows, but MacOS refused to detect it. This got me thinking - why do we often overlook compatibility issues when choosing creative tools? It's a social issue, really. We need to demand better interoperability, not just for our own sanity, but for the sake of collaboration and creativity."
