The metronome’s steady click was my lifeline in 2021, a year that still felt unsteady. Our first concert back felt monumental. I was so nervous during the "Emperata Overture" that I rushed, my fingers flying ahead of the beat. Our band director’s calm gaze from the podium was a silent plea to breathe.

Then came the Dixieland piece. The music loosened, becoming a joyful, collective conversation. I locked eyes with the trumpet player, and we just *felt* the swing. In that moment, the rigid isolation of the past year melted away, replaced by the simple, profound truth of making music together. It was more than a recovery; it was a reconnection.
