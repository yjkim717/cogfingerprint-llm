It’s 2021, and I’m sitting here scrolling through my phone, watching friends and strangers alike post about their new businesses, fitness transformations, and dream jobs. Meanwhile, I feel like I’m standing still, stuck in a loop of my own thoughts.

I’ve always believed in self-improvement—reading the books, setting the goals, trying to plan a future that feels meaningful. But lately, it’s like I’m running on a treadmill: putting in effort but going nowhere. I keep asking myself, “What am I even passionate about?” The more I search for that spark, the more it feels like trying to catch smoke.

And oh, the overthinking. It’s a special kind of torture, isn’t it? One minute, I’m mapping out my next five years; the next, I’m paralyzed by every “what if.” What if I choose wrong? What if my passion isn’t profitable? What if I’m just…not cut out for this? The noise in my head gets so loud that taking any step forward feels impossible.

I know I’m not alone in this. So many of us are wrestling with direction and purpose, especially now. We’re told to chase our dreams, but what happens when you can’t even find the starting line? Maybe the first step isn’t about having it all figured out—maybe it’s just about quieting the noise and giving ourselves permission to be a little lost, together.
