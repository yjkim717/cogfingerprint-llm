**The Algorithm and the Avoidance**

It’s weird, isn’t it? 2021 felt like a constant battle against the screen. Scrolling, liking, endlessly consuming. I’d tell myself I was “connecting,” but honestly, it often felt like expertly practiced avoidance. Like when I’d stare at a half-finished project, paralyzed by… well, executive dysfunction, basically. 

I’d see everyone else’s curated highlight reels and feel this crushing pressure to *do* something, anything.  Then, I’d just… keep scrolling.  It’s a pattern I’m still trying to break.  Anyone else feel this pull?

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a different tone?
