The Weight of Being 'Sick Enough': Navigating Depression and Identity.

As I reflect on my journey with depression in 2021, I'm reminded of the suffocating pressure to prove my struggles to others. Family members would often ask, "Are you sure you're really depressed?" or "You seem fine, why can't you just snap out of it?" The implication being that I wasn't 'sick enough' to be believed. This expectation not only trivialized my experience but also made me question my own identity. I felt like I was stuck in a constant battle to validate my emotions, rather than focusing on my self-care. The stigma surrounding mental health issues like anxiety and depression can be overwhelming, making it harder to prioritize my well-being. By sharing my story, I hope to create a ripple effect of understanding and empathy, and encourage others to do the same, fostering a more supportive community for those navigating mental health challenges.
