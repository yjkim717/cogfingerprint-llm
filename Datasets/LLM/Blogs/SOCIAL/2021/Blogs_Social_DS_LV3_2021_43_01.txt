It’s 2021, and I’m sitting at our kitchen table, watching my wife stare blankly at her laptop. Her shoulders are slumped, her coffee’s gone cold, and she’s been sighing for ten minutes straight. This isn’t a rare sight anymore. It’s become our new normal.

For the third time this year, one of her teammates has gone on maternity leave. And for the third time, the bulk of that person’s workload has landed squarely on her desk. There were no questions, no discussions about capacity—just a quiet assumption that she would absorb the extra tasks. She’s now managing two roles, attending back-to-back meetings, and working later into the evening, all while trying to keep her own projects afloat.

What gets me isn’t just the increased workload—it’s the profound silence around compensation. She hasn’t received a bonus, a raise, or even an extra day off in return. When she gently raised the issue, her manager praised her “team spirit” and said they were “so grateful she could step up during this transitional period.” It felt less like gratitude and more like exploitation wrapped in corporate politeness.

I can’t help but feel there’s a deeper, unspoken imbalance here. Our friends who are parents rightly receive support through maternity and paternity leave—and they absolutely should. But what about employees like my wife, who don’t have children? It often feels like their time, energy, and personal lives are treated as infinitely flexible. There’s an underlying expectation that childfree employees can—and should—shoulder more because they don’t have “family responsibilities.” But we *do* have families. We have relationships, hobbies, mental health, and a right to a life outside of work, just like anyone else.

This isn’t about resenting parents or the support they receive. It’s about asking why supporting parents has to come at the cost of other employees’ well-being. True workplace equity shouldn’t mean redistributing stress. It should mean planning for coverage, hiring temporary staff, or at the very least, offering tangible recognition—whether through overtime pay, compensatory time, or clear boundaries.

As my wife finally closes her laptop around 8 PM, I see the exhaustion in her eyes. It’s the kind of tired that doesn’t just come from a long day, but from feeling overlooked and undervalued. In a year where so many of us are rethinking what matters—balance, respect, fairness—it’s clear that being “childfree” shouldn’t mean your time is free for the taking.
