## The Weight of Shared Walls (and Opinions)

Living with family – it's a beautiful, chaotic tapestry, isn't it? Lately, mine has felt a little… tangled. I brought a puppy home a few months ago, a little ball of fluff named Pip, and while he’s brought so much joy, he’s also stirred up a surprising amount of anxiety amongst my relatives. 

We all share a property, and their tiny terrier, Winston, is practically family royalty. Now, I completely understand wanting to protect your beloved pet. But the constant questions, the worried glances, the hypothetical scenarios about Pip and Winston’s interactions… it’s started to feel like a judgment, not a concern. 

It’s making me question everything. Am I being a responsible dog owner? Are my boundaries clear enough? And honestly, is this living situation truly sustainable if it’s built on a foundation of unspoken tensions? 

2021 has been a year of reevaluating so much, and this feels like another layer of self-reflection I wasn’t quite expecting. Maybe a good, honest conversation is what's needed. Wish me luck!
