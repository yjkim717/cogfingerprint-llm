**The Seat’s the Thing (and Maybe My Next Car?)**

It’s funny how the smallest details can suddenly dominate your thoughts. Lately, I’ve been obsessing over seat comfort – seriously! It started with a friend telling me about the agonizing drive in a friend’s used Nissan Leaf versus the Chevy Bolt. Suddenly, I’m researching electric vehicles, comparing specs, and wondering if a comfortable seat is *really* worth prioritizing.  It’s a surprisingly human thing, isn’t it?  Maybe this whole car-buying process is just a reflection of our need for a little bit of cozy in a constantly moving world.
