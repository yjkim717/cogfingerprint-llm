**The Day the Rules Didn't Matter**

It was one of those Tuesday afternoons, the kind where the commute feels eternal. I was in the slow lane, just trying to get home, when a beat-up sedan came roaring up behind me. They swerved, illegally passing me, then two other cars, with a blatant disregard for the solid yellow line.

My heart jumped. Right there, in the next lane, was a police cruiser. I felt a flicker of vindication—*finally, someone’s getting a ticket.*

But the cruiser didn’t move. No siren, no flash of lights. The aggressive driver just sped off into the horizon, leaving me in a cloud of disbelief and simmering frustration.

That was the moment in 2021 when something clicked. If the rules aren't enforced, what’s the point? It’s not just about one reckless driver; it’s about the silent message it sends to everyone else on the road. It chips away at our collective trust, leaving us all wondering why we even bother to follow the rules when the consequences seem so… optional.
