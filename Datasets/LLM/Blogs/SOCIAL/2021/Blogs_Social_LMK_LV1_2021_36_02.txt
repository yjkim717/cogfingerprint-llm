The City That Never Sleeps - or Stops Moving? Not Quite. As a native New Yorker, I've always been frustrated by the way TV shows like Gossip Girl and Law & Order portray our city's transportation. In 2021, it's still baffling to see characters gliding effortlessly through Manhattan without a care in the world. Where's the congestion? The delays? The occasional apocalypse that is a crosstown bike ride? In reality, navigating NYC's streets is a daily challenge. I've spent countless hours stuck in traffic or waiting for a delayed subway. It's not all glamour and Upper East Side penthouses. By glossing over these relatable struggles, these shows miss an opportunity to tell more nuanced stories about life in NYC. So, to all the showrunners out there, let's get real - our city's traffic is a character in its own right, and it's time you gave it some screen time.
