The glow of my laptop screen feels like a spotlight, and for a moment, I just stare at the draft email. The cursor blinks mockingly next to the subject line: “Request for Medical Leave.” It’s 2021, a year that was supposed to be about rebuilding and moving forward, and here I am, about to ask my dream job to pause.

My eating disorder isn't a new companion; it's a shadow that has followed me for years, its whispers growing louder amidst the pressure to perform. I love my work and the team that feels like a second family. The thought of letting them down, of becoming a "burden," is a heavy cloak of guilt. My own family, who has cheered every career milestone, flashes in my mind. Would they see this as a step back?

But my therapist’s words echo: "You cannot pour from an empty cup." This isn't about failing. It’s about the most courageous project I will ever undertake: my recovery. It’s about trading the exhausting internal battle for a real fight for my mental health. Taking this leave isn't a retreat; it's a strategic investment in the person I need to become—for my team, my family, and most importantly, for myself. Hitting "send" feels less like surrender and more like the first, shaky step toward reclaiming my life.
