"Getting a nose piercing in St. Catharines can be intimidating, but with the right piercer, it's a breeze. In 2021, I learned the importance of seeking out APP certified professionals. Not only do they follow proper hygiene and safety protocols, but they're also skilled artists. I visited a local tattoo shop with certified piercers and was impressed by their expertise. If you're looking for a trustworthy piercer, do your research and ask about APP certification - your body (and nose) will thank you!"
