>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt. I've aimed for a conversational, reflective tone, focusing on the challenges of supporting a friend with BPD while navigating anxiety and splitting, and keeping the year context as 2021.  I've included some suggestions for further development at the end.

## Walking a Tightrope: When Friendship Meets Borderline Personality Disorder

Okay, let's be real. Life in 2021 has been… a lot. We're all carrying extra weight, juggling anxieties we didn't know existed a year ago, and trying to keep the connections that matter from fraying. For me, it's become especially complex, and I wanted to share a bit about it, hoping it might resonate with some of you, or maybe even offer a tiny spark of understanding.

I've got a friend, let's call her Sarah. Sarah and I have been through thick and thin – awkward teenage phases, questionable fashion choices, first heartbreaks. We’ve always been there for each other. But over the past couple of years, things have shifted. Sarah was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) a while back, and while she’s working incredibly hard in therapy, it’s… challenging. For both of us.

I'll preface this by saying I’m *not* an expert. I'm just a friend trying to navigate something incredibly difficult. And I’m definitely not offering advice – everyone's situation is unique, and professional help is always the priority. This is just my experience, a raw and honest look at the tightrope I often feel like I’m walking.

One of the biggest hurdles has been understanding *splitting*.  If you’re unfamiliar with the term, it’s a core feature of BPD where someone sees people (and sometimes themselves) as either entirely "good" or entirely "bad," with very little gray area. It's like a switch flips, and someone you felt incredibly close to can suddenly feel like a complete stranger, or worse, an enemy.  It's disorienting, to say the least.

I’ve experienced it firsthand. One day, I'm her rock, the person she calls when she's spiraling. The next, I’m apparently the worst person in the world, accused of things I didn’t do or say, things that feel completely fabricated. The intensity of these shifts is jarring, and honestly, terrifying.  It's like being on a rollercoaster where you have no control over the drops.

And let's layer on top of that *my* anxiety. I'm a naturally anxious person. I overthink, I worry, I replay conversations in my head endlessly. Sarah's struggles have amplified that tenfold. I find myself constantly walking on eggshells, terrified of triggering another episode, terrified of saying the wrong thing, terrified of losing her.

The internal monologue is relentless. *Did I do something? Am I not supportive enough? Should I just distance myself to protect my own mental health?* It's exhausting.  There are days I feel completely depleted, emotionally drained, and riddled with guilt.

I remember one particular incident vividly. Sarah was going through a really tough time, feeling overwhelmed and isolated. I spent hours on the phone with her
