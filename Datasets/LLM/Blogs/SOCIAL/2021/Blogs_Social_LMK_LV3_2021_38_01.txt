As I watched Bo Burnham's 'Inside', I couldn't help but notice the eerie glow of the grow lamp that follows him throughout. A fellow Redditor's interpretation struck a chord - the lighting symbolized nurturing and growth, much like their own gardening experience. It resonated with me too. In 2021, as we spent more time indoors, many of us turned to gardening as a source of comfort. For me, it was a reminder that even in isolation, we can cultivate hope and renewal, one seedling at a time.
