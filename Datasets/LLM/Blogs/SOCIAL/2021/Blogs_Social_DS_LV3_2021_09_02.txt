You know that little green sign on the edge of town, the one that proudly announces the city’s population? I passed ours the other day, and the number hasn’t changed in over a decade. It’s a small thing, I know, but it got me thinking.

Here in the Coastal Bend, we feel the growth. The roads are fuller, the familiar skyline shifts, and there’s a new energy that wasn't here ten years ago. Yet, that sign tells a different story—a story frozen in time by some old census data. It’s a strange disconnect, like an old photograph that doesn't capture the person you've become.

It’s more than just outdated numbers. It feels symbolic. How often do we hold onto old versions of ourselves, or our communities, long after we’ve outgrown them? We navigate this daily traffic growth, this tangible proof of change, while an official marker insists on a past reality. It’s a quiet, persistent reminder of how the story we tell ourselves about a place—or even about who we are—can lag far behind the truth.

Maybe it’s time for a refresh, not just of the sign, but of our perspective. To acknowledge that our community, like all of us, is constantly evolving. That sign will eventually get updated, but perhaps its current, stubborn inaccuracy is its most honest message yet: growth isn’t always in the numbers you post; it’s in the life you live just beyond them.
