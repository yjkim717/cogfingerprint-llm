It felt surreal to be going on a first date in 2021, after a year of lockdowns and social distancing. As someone who's been navigating the world of gay dating, I had almost given up on the idea of meeting someone new. But here I was, nervously sitting across from a guy I'd met online, sipping coffee and laughing together like we'd known each other for years. As the evening wore on, our conversation flowed effortlessly, and before I knew it, we were sharing our first kiss under the stars. It was like the world had come alive again, and I felt a spark of hope. For the first time since Covid, I felt like I was part of a world beyond my own bubble. As we parted ways, I couldn't help but wonder if this was the start of something special - a new relationship born in the unlikeliest of times.
