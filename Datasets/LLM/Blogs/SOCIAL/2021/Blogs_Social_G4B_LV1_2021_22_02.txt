**The Weight of Tomorrow**

Okay, so I’ve been doing a lot of thinking lately about this whole nuclear energy thing. We’re talking about building *more* power plants, right? And simultaneously, we’re still grappling with this massive problem of nuclear waste. It feels…reckless, honestly.

Like, we’re so focused on powering our lives *now*, but are we really considering the burden we’re leaving behind?  It’s not about demonizing nuclear energy entirely, but about asking: can we truly call it progress if it’s built on a foundation of unresolved problems?  Let’s start having a more honest conversation about long-term responsibility, folks.
