**The Pixelated Nostalgia Project**

Okay, so I’ve been completely obsessed lately with this idea – painstakingly designing custom game cases for my old Game Boy. It started as a simple desire to *really* celebrate those classic games, to give them a little extra love. But it’s morphed into something deeper. 

It’s forcing me to think about how we interact with our memories, how we curate our digital identities.  Like, these little boxes – they’re not just protecting cartridges; they’re miniature time capsules.  I’m even diving into 3D modeling, trying to capture that specific retro aesthetic.  It’s strangely meditative, this focus on detail.  Maybe it's a reaction to all the endless scrolling in 2021 – a need to build something tangible, something *real*.  Anyone else feeling this pull towards tangible nostalgia?
