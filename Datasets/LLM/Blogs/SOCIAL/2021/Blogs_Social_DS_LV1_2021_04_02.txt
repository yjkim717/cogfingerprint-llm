As an artist, I recently sketched a character with vitiligo purely for its visual appeal. It got me thinking—does using a real condition as an aesthetic choice risk offending those who live with it daily? In 2021, with conversations around representation deepening, I realize art isn’t just about beauty; it’s about empathy. I’d love to hear from people with vitiligo—does this feel respectful or like appropriation?
