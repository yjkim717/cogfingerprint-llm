### The Ticking Clock in My Twenties

I turned 21 in 2021, a year that already felt like a masterclass in uncertainty. But the biggest lesson it taught me wasn't about a virus; it was about time.

While scrolling through endless "hustle" culture posts and LinkedIn success stories, a cold dread started to settle in my stomach. I did the math—a terrifyingly simple calculation. If the standard 40+ hour workweek is the blueprint, how many sunsets with my family, spontaneous road trips, or quiet mornings with a book does that equal? The answer felt like a life sentence.

My generation was sold a dream: work hard, and you’ll succeed. But the fine print nobody mentioned was the potential cost—the slow erosion of our passions, our relationships, and our sanity, all for the sake of a career ladder that seems to have more rungs than ever.

This isn't about laziness; it's about a deep-seated fear of scarcity. The scarcity of time, of genuine joy, of a life that doesn't feel like one long, exhausting to-do list. I’m not disillusioned with hard work; I’m disillusioned with the idea that my entire identity should be built around it.

So, I’m pushing back. I’m looking for a new equation, one where success is measured in contentment, not just paychecks. Because a life spent only working isn't a life I'm willing to sign up for.
