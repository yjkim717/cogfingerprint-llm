**The Weight of a Finished Story**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How sometimes, a beloved thing feels…complicated when it’s finally over. I found myself wrestling with *Berserk* this year, trying to finish it after Kentaro Miura-san’s passing. The sheer artistry of the anime was undeniable, but a heavy feeling settled in. 

There’s this strange guilt, I think – a feeling that I was enjoying something created by a brilliant mind who’s now gone. And a frustrating difficulty connecting with the world, with Guts and Griffith, because it was tainted by the knowledge of its creator’s absence. It felt like trying to appreciate a beautiful sunset while simultaneously mourning the sun itself.  

Social media was filled with similar conversations – fans grappling with the same bittersweet emotions. It made me realize we all carry a little bit of grief for the art we love, especially when it’s connected to someone we’ve lost.

Do you want me to tweak it, or perhaps focus on a different aspect of the original summary?
