### The Lipstick and the Unmade Bed

There’s a particular kind of confusion that comes with my depression, one my family just doesn’t get. Last week, my mom found me meticulously blending eyeshadow, a small island of focus in my chaotic room. The unmade bed and piled-up dishes were a silent accusation in the background.

“How can you care about makeup,” she asked, her voice heavy with worry and frustration, “when you can’t even manage a shower?”

It’s a question that echoes the judgment I feel online and at home. The truth is, in 2021, the world feels so heavy. That twenty minutes with my makeup brushes isn’t vanity; it’s my anchor. It’s a controlled, creative act when my mind is anything but. The small, achievable goal of a perfect winged liner feels like a victory when getting out of bed is a battle.

My illness doesn’t always look the way people expect. The mascara isn’t a mask to hide behind; sometimes, it’s the only thing holding me together.
