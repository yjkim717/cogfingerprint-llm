It’s 2021, and I’m stuck in a cycle I never saw coming. Every morning, I roll out of bed minutes before my online class, camera off, just another name on a screen. Assignments? I scrape by with minimal effort, telling myself, “It’s fine, everyone’s doing it.” But then I spend hours lost in YouTube rabbit holes, chasing that quick dopamine hit instead of real progress. I’m not alone in this—so many of us are just going through the motions, feeling lazy and disconnected. When did we trade our drive for distraction?
