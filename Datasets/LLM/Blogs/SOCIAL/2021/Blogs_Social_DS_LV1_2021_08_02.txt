Of all the rooms I’ve cleaned in my ten years of hospitality work, one from last week still sticks with me. It wasn’t just the mess—the scattered food, the stained towels. It was the two dirty diapers, not in the trash, but placed deliberately on the pillows. And scribbled in soap on the mirror: “Clean this up.”

In that moment, I didn’t just see a filthy hotel room; I saw a message. It felt like a deliberate act to demean the person who would have to deal with it—me. We housekeepers are the invisible backbone of travel, especially through the stress of 2021, ensuring a safe, clean space for everyone. To be treated with such intentional disrespect… it chips away at your spirit.

It makes me reflect on the basic social contract of shared spaces. We’re all just people trying to get by. A simple “thank you” or even just using the trash can is a recognition of that shared humanity. That room was a stark reminder that some people see service work as an invitation for contempt, not courtesy. And honestly, that’s the toughest mess to clean up.
