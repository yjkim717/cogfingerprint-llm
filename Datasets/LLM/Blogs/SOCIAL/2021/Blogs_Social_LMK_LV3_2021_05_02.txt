"Surviving The Last of Us: When Gaming Frustration Takes Over". 

I'll be the first to admit - playing The Last of Us on Grounded mode in 2021 was a brutal experience. As a gamer who's always up for a challenge, I was determined to push through the toughest sections. But, boy, was I wrong. The scarcity of resources had me stuck on repeat, dying more times than I can count. The frustration was real - I felt like I was navigating a never-ending nightmare. Every ammo count, every health kit, and every stealth attempt felt like a gamble. But, as I finally progressed, I realized that it wasn't just about surviving the infected; it was about managing my own emotions. The Last of Us taught me that sometimes, it's not about winning, but about perseverance. And, trust me, that lesson goes beyond the screen.
