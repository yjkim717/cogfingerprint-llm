### The Inheritance We Never Asked For

I was watching my niece build a sandcastle the other day, her small hands meticulously shaping a future that would be washed away by the next high tide. It got me thinking about the permanence of the legacy we’re leaving her generation.

We’ve spent years championing nuclear power as a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels, and rightly so. It’s kept our lights on without pumping carbon into the air. But in 2021, as we push for these solutions, I can’t shake a nagging thought. We’re solving our problem by creating a new, incredibly long-lasting one for them.

We’re taking spent fuel rods—dangerous for millennia—and our grand plan is to bury them deep underground. We’re essentially putting a giant “Do Not Open” sign on a box of our most hazardous materials and handing the key to our great-great-grandchildren.

It feels like the ultimate act of passing the buck. We get the clean energy, and they get the permanent responsibility. Is that truly responsible? Or is it just the most convenient way to quiet our own consciences today? The sandcastle will be gone by morning, but our nuclear waste won't. That’s a heavy truth to build a future on.
