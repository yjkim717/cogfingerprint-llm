**The Weight of a Silent Smile**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a simple expression can carry so much weight. Last year, I found myself stuck with this… resting sad face. It wasn’t *actually* sadness, but people read it that way.  It sparked a strange desire for acceptance – not for the feeling itself, but for the way it impacted my social interactions.  I realized it wasn’t a flaw to fix, just a part of me I was slowly learning to embrace.
