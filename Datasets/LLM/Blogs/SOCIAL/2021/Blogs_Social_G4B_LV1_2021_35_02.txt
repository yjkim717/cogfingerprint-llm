**The Tightrope Walk: Watching a Friend, Holding Myself Together**

Okay, so 2021 was… a lot, right? Between the pandemic, everything feeling perpetually uncertain, and a general sense of anxiousness clinging to the air, I was already teetering on a tightrope. Then, my friend Liam started pulling back, and suddenly, I was walking alongside someone navigating a completely different kind of storm. 

Liam’s been battling borderline personality disorder for a while, and it’s been… intense to witness. It’s not about being difficult or deliberately trying to hurt people, not really. It’s this constant oscillation – intense highs followed by crushing lows, a really strong feeling of ‘splitting’ where people are either ‘all good’ or ‘completely awful’ based on how they’re meeting Liam’s needs in the moment.  

I’d read about it, of course. The research is fascinating, but reading about it and *seeing* it play out in real-time are two very different things.  It triggered a lot of my own anxieties, honestly. I’ve got a history of family trauma, and seeing Liam struggle with intense emotional reactivity reminded me of some of the patterns I’d learned as a kid. 

I found myself wanting to fix things, to offer solutions, but I quickly realized that wasn’t helpful. It’s exhausting for everyone involved. Instead, I started just *being there*. Listening, offering a safe space, and gently reminding him that he wasn't alone. 

And, crucially, I had to check in with myself. Supporting someone with BPD can be incredibly draining. I started practicing some mindfulness techniques – just little moments of grounding to help me stay centered.  It was a reminder that taking care of my own mental health wasn’t selfish; it was essential. 

It's a slow, delicate dance, and I’m still learning. But knowing I could offer a little stability while Liam navigated his own complexities felt… worthwhile.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way – perhaps add more detail to a specific aspect, adjust the tone, or change the length?
