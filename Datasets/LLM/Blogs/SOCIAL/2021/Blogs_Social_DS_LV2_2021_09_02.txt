### The Numbers We Drive Past

I was driving through a neighboring town in the Coastal Bend the other day, running an errand I’d put off for weeks. As I crossed the city limits, my eyes flicked to the familiar green and white sign. And there it was, a population number that felt like a message from a different era. I remember seeing that exact same figure when I got my driver’s license back in high school.

It got me thinking, as the stoplight ahead turned red. That sign isn’t just wrong; it’s a silent story. It speaks of a community frozen in an official statistic, while the reality around it has transformed. I can feel that transformation daily—in the slight extra time my commute now takes, in the new faces at the local grocery store, in the hum of construction that seems to be the area’s new background music.

Our towns are growing. The traffic is undeniable proof, a tangible census of its own. Yet, the signs at our borders tell an old, outdated tale. It’s a strange disconnect. It makes me wonder what other "official" stories we’re telling ourselves that no longer match our lived experience. Are we holding onto an old identity out of habit, even as a new one is being built, car by car and family by family, right outside our windows?

The light turned green. I drove on, leaving the old number behind, but the question lingered in the rearview mirror. Maybe it’s not about the sign being wrong, but about us needing to officially acknowledge how much we’ve truly changed.
