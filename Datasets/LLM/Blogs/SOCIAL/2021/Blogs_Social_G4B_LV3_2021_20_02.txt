**The Quiet Fade-Out**

Remember 2021? It felt… heavy, didn’t it? For me, it was marked by a strange sort of quiet fade-out, especially when it came to my social life. I found myself consistently opting for minimal effort – scrolling through feeds instead of actually *connecting*, saying ‘maybe later’ to plans, and generally just…disengaging. 

It wasn't about being antisocial, not really. It felt like a defense mechanism, a way to avoid the energy drain of socializing. But looking back, I realize it was feeding a deeper feeling of academic struggle and, honestly, a little bit of laziness. 

There’s a huge difference between needing downtime and letting connection wither.  It took a conscious effort to push past that inertia, to actively choose engagement.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the hardest work is showing up for the people – and ourselves – we care about.

Do you want me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the tone?
