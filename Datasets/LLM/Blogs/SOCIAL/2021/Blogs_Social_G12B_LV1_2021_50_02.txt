>## Do People Really Have the Attention Span for Long Movies Anymore?

Okay, so I was thinking about movies the other day, specifically *long* movies. Like, over two and a half hours long. We've got *Avatar*, *Titanic*, *Avengers: Endgame* – these behemoths that demand a serious time commitment. And it got me wondering: in 2021, with TikTok and endless scrolling, do people *really* have the attention span for them?

It's fascinating, isn't it? Because we’ve seen these epic films absolutely *crush* the box office. *Ford v Ferrari* proved that a lengthy, character-driven story could still connect with audiences. But are they the exception, or a testament to a desire for something more substantial amidst the digital noise? I feel like we're all craving immersive experiences, something to truly escape into, even if it means dedicating a good chunk of our Saturday. What do you think? Are long movies making a comeback, or are they destined for streaming-only status?
