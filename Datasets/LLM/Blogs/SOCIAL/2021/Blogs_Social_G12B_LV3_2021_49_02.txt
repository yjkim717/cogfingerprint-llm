## The Curious Case of the Grocery Cart on TV

Okay, so I was scrolling through Reddit the other day, and a thread about *My 600lb Life* really stuck with me. It got me thinking – why, in 2021, with grocery delivery at our fingertips, do the people featured on the show *always* seem to be navigating massive grocery stores themselves? 

I know reality TV thrives on drama, and maybe the struggle of maneuvering a cart is part of the narrative. But it feels like such an easily avoidable hardship! It just highlights a disconnect, doesn’t it? Do you ever notice these little things in reality shows and wonder what's really going on behind the scenes? It’s fascinating, and a little unsettling.
