Looking back at my 2021 semester, I remember how our open-book exam on matrices and stochastics brought our class together. Instead of isolated cramming, we crowdsourced notes and shared digital resources. It wasn't just about solving multidimensional ODEs; it was about realizing that collaboration, not competition, makes us stronger. That collective effort taught me more than any textbook couldâ€”college is richer when we lift each other up.
