The shift back to the office in 2021 was supposed to be a return to normalcy, but my cat, Luna, had other plans. After over a year of my constant presence while working from home, our evening walks were a sacred ritual. Now, with my commute reinstated, those walks grew shorter, and then sometimes, nonexistent.

The protest began subtly—a plaintive meow by the door at 6 PM sharp. It quickly escalated into full-blown, soul-piercing howls that echoed through the apartment. My peaceful living room became a stage for her operatic distress. I tried everything: new toys, extra cuddles, even a calming diffuser. Nothing worked.

I felt like a terrible pet parent. My attempt to reclaim a piece of my pre-pandemic life was causing her genuine anxiety. The distraction was immense; I couldn’t relax, constantly on edge for the next cry. It was a stark reminder that the "new normal" wasn't just about us humans. Our pets' worlds had shifted, too, and Luna was just vocalizing her confusion about why her favorite part of the day had suddenly vanished. Our shared space now held the tension of our conflicting needs.
