The Weight of Fandom: When Guilt Meets Obsession

As I sat down to watch 'Berserk', a sense of unease washed over me. It had been a while since I'd last revisited Kentaro Miura's dark fantasy world, and with his passing in 2021, I felt a pang of guilt. How could I enjoy something he created, now that he was gone? The anime, once a thrilling escape, now felt like a bittersweet reminder of what I'd lost. I struggled to connect with the story, my mind preoccupied with the thought of Miura's dedication and hard work. As a fan, I felt a deep sense of responsibility to appreciate his craft, but my emotions were tangled in grief. I wondered if I was alone in this feeling, or if fellow fans were experiencing a similar sense of guilt and nostalgia. As I navigated this complex mix of emotions, I realized that my love for 'Berserk' was still there, but it had evolved into something more nuanced.
