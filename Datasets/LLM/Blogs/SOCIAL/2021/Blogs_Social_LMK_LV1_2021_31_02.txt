As I navigated the world of online ASL communities in 2021, I stumbled upon a puzzling sign. The poster described a specific hand shape, with the non-dominant hand forming a flat "B" shape and the dominant hand making a "claw" shape, before moving in a circular motion. I was intrigued and a bit stumped. Has anyone else encountered this sign? I'd love to learn more about it and improve my signing skills.
