**The Night I Wrestled a Dream-Kangaroo (Seriously)**

Okay, 2021 was… a year, wasn’t it? Full of unexpected shifts and, honestly, a little bit of controlled chaos. And I had a dream that perfectly encapsulated it all. It was utterly bizarre. 

I was in my backyard – or what *felt* like my backyard – and suddenly, a kangaroo, a ridiculously large, incredibly determined kangaroo, was rampaging through my perfectly manicured lawn. It wasn’t angry, exactly, just… insistent. Like it needed to be *contained*. 

The dream quickly escalated. Neighbors started appearing, yelling, trying to help, but only adding to the mayhem. Then, inexplicably, the kangaroo launched a surprisingly accurate (and terrifying) assault on a garden gnome.  It was a full-blown, surreal disaster. 

Thinking back, I realize the dream mirrored a feeling I’d been battling all year – a frustration with feeling overwhelmed by the constant demands of social media and the pressure to ‘have it all figured out.’  The kangaroo represented that relentless need to control, to contain, and the chaotic fallout when things inevitably went sideways. 

It’s a silly dream, sure, but it served as a strange reminder to let go of the need for absolute security and embrace the beautiful messiness of life.  Sometimes, a dream-kangaroo is exactly what you need to shake things up.
