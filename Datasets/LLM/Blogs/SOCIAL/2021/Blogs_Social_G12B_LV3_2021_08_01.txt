## Does My Face Look Okay? The Curious Case of the Resting Sad Face

Okay, real talk. How many of you have ever been told you look…concerned? Or maybe even a little down? I recently discovered a whole online community bonding over the phenomenon of the "resting sad face." Apparently, mine is pretty pronounced. It's 2021, and I'm still getting questions like, "Are you alright?" when I’m just…existing. It's a strange thing to realize your default expression might be misread as something deeper. Maybe it's a social anxiety thing, or just how my face naturally settles. I'm starting to wonder if I can even *change* it!
