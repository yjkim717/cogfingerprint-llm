### The Casting Couch of Our Dreams

Remember those late-night, pre-vaccine Zoom calls in 2021? My friends and I, trapped in our little boxes, started a new game: dream casting a *Darth Bane* movie. It was our escape, a shared universe built on "what ifs" and IMDb pages.

We’d passionately debate for hours—Gerard Butler for the raw power, or Javier Bardem for the terrifying gravitas? It wasn’t really about Star Wars. It was about connection. In a year that felt so fragmented, we were building something together, weaving a collective fantasy from our separate living rooms.

It makes me wonder—isn't all fandom just that? A desperate, beautiful need to share what we love, to point at a story and say, "You see it too, right?" Our silly casting sessions were a lifeline, a small, glowing kyber crystal in a year of overwhelming dark side.
