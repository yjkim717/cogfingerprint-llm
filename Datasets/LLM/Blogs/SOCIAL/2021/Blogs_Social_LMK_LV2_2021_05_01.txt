"Stuck in a Buffering Loop: My Frustrating Fight with Slow Internet

It's 2021, and I'm still baffled by the buffering wheel on my screen. Despite having a high-speed ISP plan and a capable router and modem, my ethernet and wifi speeds are a far cry from what I expected. I've tried tweaking settings, restarting devices, and even cursing at the wifi signal (don't judge me!), but nothing seems to be working.

As someone who works remotely, a reliable internet connection is my lifeline. But the slow speeds are not just frustrating - they're also impacting my productivity and overall well-being. I've started to wonder if it's just me or if others are experiencing similar issues. Are we being sold a bill of goods by our ISPs, promising speeds that just aren't delivered? I'm sharing my story in the hopes that others will commiserate and maybe, just maybe, we'll figure out a solution together."
