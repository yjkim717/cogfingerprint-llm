Okay, here's a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and around 266 words, set in 2021:

**The Soundtrack to My Distraction**

Okay, let’s be honest. 2021 felt…loud. Not in a physical way, but internally. I was drowning in a sea of background music – Spotify playlists looping, podcasts humming, just *always* something playing. It was supposed to be relaxing, a way to fill the quiet spaces, but it quickly became a habit of passive consumption. I’d be scrolling through Instagram, and a song would just *start* playing. Cooking? A playlist blasting. Even working? A low-level soundtrack to keep the brain ticking. 

I'm a sound engineer, which probably makes this whole thing a little ironic. I spend my days *crafting* sound, meticulously balancing frequencies and crafting sonic landscapes. Yet, I was doing the opposite – letting sound wash over me without really *hearing* it. 

Then, I stumbled across an article about a sound engineer who was consciously breaking this habit. He was actively trying to stop passively listening and started focusing on *making* music. It sparked something in me. 

I started small – turning off the music while I wrote. Then, I picked up my old keyboard and just started messing around. It was messy, awkward, and honestly, frustrating at first. But slowly, something shifted.  

It wasn’t about creating a masterpiece. It was about the *doing*. The feeling of my fingers on the keys, the small victories of actually hitting a chord.  I found a deeper connection to sound, and, surprisingly, a little more focus in my everyday life.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best way to appreciate something is to actively engage with it, not just let it flow over you.

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way (e.g., adjust the tone, add a specific detail, or change the length)?
