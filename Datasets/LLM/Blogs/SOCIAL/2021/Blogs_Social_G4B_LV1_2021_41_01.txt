**Scrolling Through a Feeling**

Remember 2021? It felt…weird, didn’t it? Like everyone was desperately trying to project a perfect version of themselves online, a highlight reel of vacations and achievements. I found myself scrolling, feeling a little inadequate, a little like I was missing out. 

I started noticing this intense pressure to *do* something, to *be* something, just to earn a few likes. It felt exhausting. I remember deliberately muting a lot of accounts – influencers pushing products, friends showing off their seemingly flawless lives. 

Honestly, I took a break. A real one. Just a few weeks of disconnecting, and it shifted something. It wasn’t about chasing validation; it was about actually *living*.  Social media felt less like a requirement and more like an option.  It was a good reminder that real connections happen offline, not through a screen.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic inspired by the original summary?
