"Breaking the Silence: My Journey with Bulimia and Taking Control"

As I sat at my desk, staring blankly at my computer screen, I felt a familiar knot in my stomach. It was 2021, and I was 25, struggling to keep my secret hidden. For years, I'd been battling bulimia, an eating disorder that had taken a toll on my mental health. The pressure to perform at work was suffocating me, and I knew I needed help. But how could I reveal my struggles to my employer? The fear of judgment and repercussions held me back. One day, I decided to take a leap of faith and request a leave of absence for treatment. It wasn't easy, but I knew it was necessary. As I began my journey towards recovery, I realized that I wasn't alone. I'm sharing my story to break the silence surrounding mental health and eating disorders, hoping that it will inspire others to take control of their lives.
