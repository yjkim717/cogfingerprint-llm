"The Unspoken Struggle: When Self-Care Meets Societal Expectations"

As I sat in front of the mirror, surrounded by makeup brushes and half-finished beauty tutorials, I couldn't shake off the feeling of guilt. In 2021, where mental health awareness is more prominent than ever, I'm still caught in the vicious cycle of depression and anxiety. People often assume that because I enjoy doing makeup, I'm not struggling enough. That my love for self-care is a sign of laziness. But the truth is, it's the opposite. On my bad days, doing makeup is my therapy. It's my way of taking control, of telling myself that I'm still here, still fighting. But the stigma surrounding mental health still lingers. I'm torn between being open about my struggles and being judged for not being "sick enough." It's time to break free from these societal expectations and acknowledge that self-care is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength.
