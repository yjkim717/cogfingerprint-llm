"Growing up in the early 2000s, I often felt like I was stuck in limbo. I was too young for the carefree days of the 90s, but too old to be part of the social media-obsessed Gen Z. I missed out on dial-up internet and cassette tapes, but also on the effortless online connections of today's teens. It's funny how being born 'in between' can make you feel like you're missing out on the best experiences of all."
