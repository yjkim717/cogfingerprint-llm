**The Shadow of Change**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How quickly things can shift, how a familiar landscape can feel like it’s being slowly, deliberately rearranged. I was thinking about this the other day, remembering a conversation with an old neighbor, Mr. Henderson. He’d lived in our little cul-de-sac for sixty years, practically a fixture. 

He was genuinely heartbroken about what was happening down the street. A beautiful, old church – the one with the massive oak trees shading the parking lot – was being gutted and turned into a nightclub. Just…gone.  Apparently, the new owners were prioritizing parking spaces, ripping out the trees without a second thought. 

It made me think about the way communities change, sometimes without anyone really noticing until it’s too late. It’s a reminder that these small, shared spaces – the church, the trees, the familiar rhythm of a neighborhood – are fragile.  We need to be more aware, more vocal, about protecting the things that make a place *feel* like home.  What do you think?
