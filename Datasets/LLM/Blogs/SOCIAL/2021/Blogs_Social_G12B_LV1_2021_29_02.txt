## When Anime Makes You Question Everything (and Google "Kudayari")

Okay, confession time: I’ve been *obsessed* with *Dr. Stone*. It’s just so brilliantly nerdy! The show's commitment to scientific accuracy, even in a post-apocalyptic setting, is genuinely impressive. But then I got to the Kudayari – that giant, stone-powered drill – and my brain short-circuited. 

Seriously, is it even *possible* to generate that much energy with that setup? I spent a solid hour last night down a rabbit hole of theoretical physics, thanks to Hyoga’s ingenuity. It’s a fun reminder: sometimes, the most engaging stories spark real curiosity and make you question the world around you, even if it’s through the lens of a beautifully animated anime. Anyone else feel this way?
