Of course, here is a reflective blog post based on your summary.

It was the growl that stopped my heart. My gentle giant, who cuddles like a teddy bear with our other dog at home, was suddenly a tense, rumbling statue at the park. In 2021, we were all re-learning how to be social, and I realized my Mastiff was, too.

I’d assumed that because he had a built-in best friend, he’d be a social butterfly. But the chaotic, unpredictable world of the dog park was a world away from our safe, multi-dog home. His fear wasn't aggression; it was overwhelm.

It was a humbling lesson in empathy. True socialization isn’t about throwing them into the deep end. It’s about understanding their comfort zone and gently expanding its borders, one careful, positive step at a time. We’re still working on it, together.
