>## Is Kate Bishop Officially Taking the Arrow?

Okay, Marvel fans, let's talk *Hawkeye*. The trailers were intriguing, but the set photos… whoa. Hailee Steinfeld as Kate Bishop has been *everywhere*. It’s got me wondering, is Clint Barton truly the main focus of this series, or are we witnessing the passing of the Hawkeye torch? 

Reddit’s buzzing with the same question, and honestly, Steinfeld's prominence makes a compelling case for Kate stepping into the spotlight. It’s exciting to think about a new hero rising, especially as we head into 2022! Thoughts?
