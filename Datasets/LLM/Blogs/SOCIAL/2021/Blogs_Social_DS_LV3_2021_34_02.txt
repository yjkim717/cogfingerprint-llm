The screech of tires still echoes in my mind. One moment we were laughing, the next—impact. At the ER, they called it a mild concussion, but when she drifted into unconsciousness and they mentioned clear fluid from her ear, my stomach dropped.

I stood there, helpless, as they rushed her for a head CT. The neurology team was calm, but every second felt like an hour. In 2021, hospitals were still tense places, and sitting alone in that waiting room, I realized how fragile our normal really is. We take our health for granted until a car accident reminds us how quickly everything can change.

It’s in those sterile hallways that you understand what truly matters—not the meetings missed or plans canceled, but the person behind those doors.
