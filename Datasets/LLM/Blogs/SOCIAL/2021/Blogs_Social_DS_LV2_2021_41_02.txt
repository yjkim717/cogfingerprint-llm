### The Summer I Stopped Faking It

Everyone posts about their "hot girl summer," but for me, the heat just amplifies the pressure. As the days get longer in 2021, my anxiety doesn’t fade—it intensifies.

It’s not the weather I dislike; it’s the expectation. The pressure to be constantly social, to have a body worthy of a tiny bikini, to project a version of myself that is always "on" and having fun. Scrolling through feeds of seemingly perfect beach days, I feel a familiar knot in my stomach. My own reflection feels like a checklist of insecurities.

This year, I’m giving myself permission to opt out. To say no to the pool party, to wear what feels comfortable, and to admit that my mental health doesn’t operate on a seasonal schedule. My quiet, air-conditioned summer is just as valid as anyone else's.
