## The Cone of Shame & Online Validation

Okay, so I’m officially feeling seen. My little Leo just got neutered, and the vet, like most, prescribed the dreaded cone. But honestly? He barely licked his incision! It was almost comical. Naturally, I posted a picture on Reddit’s r/cats with the caption, “Is this cone even necessary? He’s a good boy!”

The replies flooded in. Some were hilarious memes, others genuinely helpful advice. It's wild how a tiny kitten and a plastic cone can spark such a community conversation. It made me realize how much we crave validation, even for pet parenting decisions! 2021 feels like this constant cycle of sharing and seeking reassurance - even about something as simple as a cat’s post-surgery attire.
