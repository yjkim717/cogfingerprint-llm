It’s 2021, and my Epson printer keeps flashing “paper error” even though everything’s loaded perfectly. I’ve checked the printhead, swapped ink cartridges—nothing. It’s funny how this little machine mirrors life sometimes: you can have all the right pieces in place, but something unseen still blocks the way. Maybe it’s not about fixing it, but learning to pause and breathe before trying again.
