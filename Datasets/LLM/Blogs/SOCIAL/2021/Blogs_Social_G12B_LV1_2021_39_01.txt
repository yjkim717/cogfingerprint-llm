## The Night the Beat Got Away (and Why I'm Still Practicing)

Okay, so remember that huge virtual concert we put on for the school last November? The one we were *all* so proud of, painstakingly recorded and edited together? Well, there's a story behind it, and it's a little embarrassing to admit.

We were tackling "Emperata Overture," a seriously ambitious piece for our high school band. Everything was going great during the recording, until… the Dixie jazz section. Suddenly, *something* felt off. The metronome seemed to slip, and the whole section just… wandered. It was a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it moment, but it was there.

Editing couldn’t completely fix it. Looking back, it’s a stark reminder that even with all the amazing technology we had in 2021, nothing beats solid practice. It’s humbling, honestly. Still working on those tricky rhythms, but hey, at least we learned something!



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you’d like any adjustments.
