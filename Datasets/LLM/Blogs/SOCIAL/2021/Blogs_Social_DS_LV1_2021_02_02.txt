### The Day My Seamoth Vanished

So, there I was in 2021, deep in a VR session of Subnautica, utterly immersed. My trusty Seamoth—my underwater golf cart and mobile safe space—was my pride and joy. I’d parked it near the Mushroom Forest, you know, just a quick trip to grab some resources. I was keeping one eye out for the resident Crabsnakes, those territorial eels that love to surprise you.

I turned my back for what felt like ten seconds. When I spun around, it was just… gone. No wreckage, no beeping distress call, just empty, silent blue water. My heart absolutely sank.

At first, I blamed the wildlife. A sneaky Crabsnake attack I’d missed? But there was no evidence. Then it hit me: the infamous VR mode glitch. The game had simply failed to load my vehicle back in, erasing it from existence with a digital shrug.

It was a weirdly profound moment. That little sub was my creation, my project. Losing it to a random glitch felt so unjust, a stark reminder that sometimes, things just disappear through no fault of our own. It was a small, virtual lesson in non-attachment, delivered at 100 meters below sea level. I just wish the lesson hadn’t cost me so many titanium ingots.
