There’s a quiet rhythm to the upkeep of our homes, one I’ve come to appreciate more than ever in 2021. After months spent mostly indoors, I started noticing the small things—like the faint, musty smell from my washing machine or the stray spinach leaf stubbornly lodged in the dishwasher trap. It hit me then: these appliances work tirelessly, often without thanks, until they quietly demand attention.

I’ve made it a ritual now. After each cycle, I leave the doors ajar, letting the steam escape and the interiors breathe. Once a month, I run a cleaning cycle with vinegar or a specialized cleaner, and yes—I check the traps. It’s not just about maintenance; it’s a small act of care, a way of saying, “I see you, and thank you.”

In a year when so much felt uncertain, this simple practice grounded me. It reminded me that consistency, even in the smallest tasks, builds a foundation for everything else to run smoothly. And honestly? There’s something deeply satisfying about a machine that hums along, clean and dependable, just when you need it most.
