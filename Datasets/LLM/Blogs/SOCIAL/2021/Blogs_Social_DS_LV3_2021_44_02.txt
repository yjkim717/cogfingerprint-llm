Of all the ways I imagined my Tuesday lunch break going, sitting in a dentist’s chair wasn't on the list. It all started with a seemingly innocent salad. I was scrolling through my phone, completely absorbed in the endless 2021 news cycle, and not paying a lick of attention to my plate. I speared a cherry tomato, brought the fork to my mouth, and chomped down with my usual distracted gusto.

Instead of the satisfying pop of the tomato, I heard a sickening *crunch*. A jolt of pain, sharp and electric, shot through my jaw. My eyes watered instantly. I carefully opened my mouth and pulled out the fork. There, clear as day, was a perfect imprint of my front tooth on the stainless steel tine. My heart sank. That wasn't just any tooth; it was the one my dentist had bonded just two years ago after a minor biking mishap.

The rest of the afternoon was a blur of frantic phone calls. "I bit a fork," I’d whisper, feeling utterly ridiculous. The receptionist was wonderfully kind, but I could hear the suppressed amusement in her voice. It was a stark, and frankly embarrassing, reminder of how my constant multitasking—trying to consume information and food simultaneously—had literally backfired.

Sitting in the waiting room, I made a promise to myself. No more meals with my phone. That simple, mindful act of just eating feels like a radical form of self-care now. My tooth is fixed, but the lesson is bonded to me far more permanently. Sometimes, you need to break a tooth to realize you need to break a habit.
