**The Quiet Rebellion of Likes**

Remember 2021? Everyone was *obsessed* with social media. I was too, honestly. Scrolling, liking, feeling… vaguely connected. But lately, I’ve been noticing a strange, persistent feeling – a quiet rebellion, if you will. It started with my cat, Jasper. He’s a lovely, demanding boy, and his nighttime vocalizations have become a serious test of my patience. It’s mirroring something bigger, I think.

It’s like I was chasing validation through likes and comments, constantly measuring my worth by the number of hearts on a post. But Jasper doesn't care about my follower count. He just wants a quiet cuddle, a routine, and a little reassurance. 

Suddenly, the frantic need for online approval felt… exhausting.  I realized I was prioritizing a performance of connection over genuine moments.  Maybe, just maybe, true peace comes not from broadcasting our lives, but from finding contentment in the simple, unedited moments – like a purring cat curled up beside you.  It’s a slow process, but I’m learning to appreciate the quiet, offline corners of my life.
