**The Year My Halloween Makeup Tried to Kill Me (and Miss a Big Day)**

Okay, so 2021. We were *still* figuring out Zoom calls and the whole “living our lives online” thing. I was determined to go *hard* on Halloween. Like, aggressively hard. I’d seen this insane, layered zombie makeup tutorial on TikTok – all the intricate details, the fake blood, the whole shebang. I was obsessed.

I spent literally *days* perfecting it, layering on glitter, sculpting my face, and even getting a temporary tattoo for extra effect. It looked amazing, honestly. I was posting everything to Snapchat, racking up the likes, feeling like a total queen. 

Then, the tattoo started to peel. Badly. Like, dramatically. It was stuck to my skin, refusing to budge, and frankly, it was incredibly painful. While I was wrestling with this stubborn piece of plastic, my aunt called. It was my grandmother’s funeral. 

I completely froze. The makeup, the Snapchat validation – it all vanished in that moment. It was a brutal reminder that sometimes, the things we chase online just don’t matter when real life needs us.  It’s a lesson I’m still trying to learn, and honestly, a pretty embarrassing one.  Anyone else have a social media mishap they’d like to share?
