**Embracing Freedom: My Journey to No Contact with Toxic Parents**

As I sit down to write this, I'm filled with a mix of emotions - anxiety, guilt, and a hint of liberation. For years, I've been trapped in a toxic family dynamic, with my mother and stepfather's abusive behavior taking a toll on my mental health. The stress and anxiety had become a constant companion, making even the simplest tasks feel like climbing a mountain.

In 2021, I realized that I had a choice to make. I could continue to subject myself to the emotional abuse, or I could take control of my life. The decision to go no contact with my toxic parents wasn't easy, but it was necessary. The thought of cutting ties with the people who were supposed to love and support me was daunting, but I knew it was the only way to break free from the trauma.

It's been a challenging journey, with moments of self-doubt and fear of the unknown. But with each passing day, I feel a weight lifting off my shoulders. I'm slowly rediscovering myself, my interests, and my passions. I'm learning to prioritize my own needs and surround myself with people who uplift and support me.

Going no contact doesn't mean I've forgotten the past or the pain. It means I'm choosing to prioritize my own healing and well-being. It's a journey I'm committed to, and one that I'm taking one step at a time. If you're considering a similar path, know that you're not alone. There is freedom on the other side, and it's worth fighting for.
