**The Brushstrokes of a Shield**

It’s weird, right? In 2021, when everyone’s glued to their phones, I found my solace in a little compact of eyeshadows. Seriously. When the depression hit – a grey, heavy blanket I couldn’t shake – I started meticulously applying makeup. Not for anyone else, but for *me*. 

It became a ritual, a way to build a shield against the world’s judging eyes. But my family… they didn’t get it. “Just a phase,” my mom said, dismissing it. “You’re being dramatic.” And honestly, it stung. They couldn’t see the darkness, the constant exhaustion. 

I felt like I was hiding a vital part of my struggle. It wasn't about vanity; it was about control, about feeling *something* when everything felt numb.  It’s a complicated dance, trying to navigate mental health with the expectations of those around you.  It’s a conversation we all need to be having, honestly.
