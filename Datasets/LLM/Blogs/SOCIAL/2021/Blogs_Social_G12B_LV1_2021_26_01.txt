## The Tiny Nibbler and the Power of a Look

Okay, so puppy life is definitely…an experience. We’re smack-dab in the teething phase with little Finn, and he’s discovered my arm is a surprisingly appealing chew toy. It started as these tiny, exploratory nibbles, almost endearing. Almost. 

What’s been fascinating, though, is how quickly he’s learned. A firm, but gentle, “no” paired with a slightly disappointed look – and *bam* – the nibbling stops. No yelling, no harshness, just a clear signal. 

It's a tiny interaction, but it’s making me think about communication in general. How much can be conveyed without words? How powerful a simple expression can be? It feels oddly relevant to navigating online spaces in 2021, doesn’t it? A little empathy, a clear boundary… maybe that’s what we all need a bit more of.
