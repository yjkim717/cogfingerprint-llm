## The Tiny Terror and My Own Anxious Heart

Bringing home a kitten is supposed to be all sunshine and fluff, right? Well, mine, Pip, has been a *little* more drama than I anticipated. We got him eight weeks old last week, and honestly, the first 24 hours were a whirlwind of adorable chaos. But thenâ€¦ no poop. 

Panic set in. Google searches about "kitten constipation" became my new obsession. I kept thinking, "Is he scared? Is my nervous energy stressing *him* out?" I even tried a gentle stomach massage, feeling ridiculous but desperate. 

Finally, yesterday, a tiny, perfect poop appeared! It was such a small thing, but it felt like a huge victory. It reminded me that sometimes, even the smallest creatures mirror our own anxieties. And that a little patience (and a lot of cuddles) can go a long way. #kittenlife #newpet #anxiety #2021
