## Rethinking My Gains: Why I Ditched the "Bulk First" Mentality

Okay, so for years I’ve been following the standard bro-science playbook: bulk like crazy, then cut. Seemed logical, right? Pack on the muscle, then chisel away the fat. But something felt…off. I was constantly battling stubborn fat, and my energy levels were all over the place.

Then I stumbled across some interesting research questioning the whole "insulin sensitivity" thing and how it relates to muscle growth. It made me pause. This year (2021), I decided to experiment with a "cut before bulk" approach. It's been surprisingly effective! Feeling leaner, more responsive to training, and actually *enjoying* the process. Maybe there's more to building a physique than just piling on the calories. Food for thought, right?
