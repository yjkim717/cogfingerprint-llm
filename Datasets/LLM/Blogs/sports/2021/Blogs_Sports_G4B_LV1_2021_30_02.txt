**The Mitchell Dilemma: When Greatness Feels Like a Struggle**

Remember watching Donovan Mitchell last year? Pure electricity, right? That guy could *create* a basket out of thin air. But there were moments – especially in the playoffs – where it felt… frustrating. He’d be launching, forcing shots when the play wasn’t there, trying to be the hero ball guy every single time.

It’s a common trap, I think, for players with that kind of explosive talent. You get so used to being *that* guy that you forget the value of setting up your teammates.  I saw it happening a lot with some of the rising stars in the NBA – a beautiful skillset, but sometimes a little too reliant on individual brilliance. 

Mitchell’s a phenomenal player, undeniably. But maybe the next step is trusting the system, letting the ball find the open man, and letting his playmaking shine through *because* he’s making everyone else better. It's about shifting from individual hero to a true team leader.
