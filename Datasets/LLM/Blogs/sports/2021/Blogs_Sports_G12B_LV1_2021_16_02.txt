## The Quiet Thrill of Knowing More Than Everyone Else (and Tuesday Nights!)

Okay, confession time: I’m a trivia nerd. Not the pub quiz shouting, team-based kind (though I appreciate those too!), but the quiet, solitary joy of knowing obscure facts. And lately, that joy has been amplified by a little corner of the internet and a whole lot of College Football.

It all started this fall, really.  2021 felt… strange, didn't it?  The world was still navigating the pandemic, but college football was back in full swing.  And I, like many, was devouring every game, every stat, every article I could find.  But simply *watching* wasn't enough. I wanted to *know*.

That’s when I stumbled upon a Reddit thread – a weekly CFB trivia contest, affectionately dubbed “Trivia Tuesday” by its dedicated followers. It’s run by someone who goes by “OrdoTewct,” and they’ve built something genuinely special.  It's not about the million-dollar prize; it’s about the challenge, the community, and the sheer satisfaction of answering a question about, say, the career rushing yards of a little-known back from Boise State in 1987. (Don't ask me how I know that, it’s Trivia Tuesday magic!)

Last week, someone named "CrimsonTideFan78" absolutely crushed it, securing the top spot.  Huge congrats to them! They’ve earned bragging rights until next Tuesday, and a coveted "alternate flair" on the subreddit.  It's silly, I know, but those little badges of honor add a surprising layer of competitive fun.

And speaking of honors, OrdoTewct just announced a new championship tier – the "Gridiron Grandmasters." It’s reserved for the truly dedicated, those who consistently dominate the leaderboard.  It's a testament to how much this little community has grown, and it's pretty inspiring to see the passion for college football trivia flourishing.

It’s a small thing, a Tuesday night ritual, but it’s become a surprisingly welcome escape in a pretty chaotic year.  Anyone else finding joy in the unexpected corners of the internet?
