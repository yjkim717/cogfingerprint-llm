**My First Time: A Surprisingly Good Fifth Place**

Okay, so 2021 was… a year. And for me, it culminated in something I’d been nervously dreaming about for months: my first ever strongman competition. Seriously, I’d always watched these behemoths throw logs and heave stones, thinking, “Wow, that looks intense!” and then, completely on a whim, I signed up. 

My name’s Eric, by the way, and I was a complete newbie. Like, *really* new. I’d started a pretty intense training program six months prior, mostly just trying to build a baseline of strength, and figured, “Why not?”  I’d been focusing a lot on periodization – breaking my training into phases to peak for something – and spent a ridiculous amount of time researching what a ‘meet prep’ actually looked like. 

The competition itself was… chaotic. There were so many people, the atmosphere was electric, and honestly, I was a bit of a mess. I set a few personal records on the lighter events, which was incredible, but the heavier stuff? Let’s just say my technique needed some serious work.  

I ended up placing 5th in the novice class. Fifth!  It wasn't first, obviously, but coming up in the rankings felt amazing. More than the placement, though, it was the feeling of actually *doing* it.  Pushing myself beyond what I thought possible, the camaraderie with the other competitors, and that incredible surge of adrenaline when you finally complete a really tough lift – it was addictive. 

There were definitely moments of doubt, of feeling completely out of my depth. But looking back, it was a fantastic learning experience. I realized that the journey, the training, and the willingness to step outside my comfort zone were just as valuable as the final result.  And who knows, maybe next year I’ll be aiming for a little higher!
