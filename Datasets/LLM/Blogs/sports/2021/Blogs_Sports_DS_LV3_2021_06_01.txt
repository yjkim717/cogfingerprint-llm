As a lifelong Pelicans fan, 2021 was a year of profound "what ifs." Watching our roster, brimming with generational talent, felt like seeing a sports car stuck in first gear. The constant shadow of injuries was a cruel joke, turning our brightest assets into spectators. But the real sting came from the coaching and management. It felt like we had all the pieces of a championship puzzle, but no one with the vision to put them together. That’s the core of true disappointment—not losing, but knowing you never had a real shot to win.
