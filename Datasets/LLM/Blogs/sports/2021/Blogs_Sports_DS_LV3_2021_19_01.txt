Of all the places I expected to find myself on a crisp Saturday morning in the fall of 2021, standing in a dusty field in rural Pennsylvania, staring down a 300-pound log, was not one of them. I’m 41. I have a mortgage. My most intense physical competition most weeks is a spirited debate over the last coffee pod. Yet, there I was, Vaseline smeared on my shoulders, a lifting belt cinched tight enough to restrict breathing, and a number “7” scrawled on my bicep in permanent marker. This is the story of my first strongman competition, a plunge into a world of iron and camaraderie that taught me more about myself than I ever learned from a comfortable routine.

The seed was planted during the long, stagnant months of the pandemic. Gyms were closed, and my usual weightlifting routine in my garage felt increasingly solitary, a mechanical process of counting reps and adding plates. I was strong, sure, but I was bored. I stumbled upon a video of a strongman competition online—a spectacle of sheer, raw human power. It wasn't just about lifting a barbell in a perfectly controlled environment; it was about lifting awkward, monstrous objects. Atlas stones, farmer’s walk handles, yokes. It was chaotic, primal, and strangely beautiful. I wasn't watching sculpted bodybuilders; I was watching powerlifters, construction workers, and everyday people with extraordinary will. A thought, quiet at first, then deafening, crept in: *Could I do that?*

At 41, the answer wasn't immediately "yes." It was, "Are you insane?" But the allure was too strong. I found a local competition with a novice class, designed for first-timers. The events were announced: Max Log Press, Farmer’s Walk for 80 feet, Yoke Walk for 80 feet, and a medley of a Sandbag Carry and a Sled Drag. My training program, which had been a predictable rotation of bench, squat, and deadlift, was thrown out the window. My garage transformed. I built a yoke from scrap wood and plumbing pipe. I found a decently round stone and started practicing the awkward, almost-hugging technique of the Atlas stone lift. My log was a heavy, awkward metal cylinder that never felt balanced.

Training was humbling. The first time I tried the yoke, a contraption designed to be carried on your back, I took three steps and nearly face-planted under the weight. It wasn't just about strength; it was about stability, coordination, and a kind of aggressive patience. My body ached in new and inventive ways. My hands, once smooth, became a tapestry of calluses and tears, held together by athletic tape and stubbornness. My wife would watch from the kitchen window, a mixture of concern and bemusement on her face. "You're doing this for fun?" she'd ask. I wasn't always sure.

But something shifted during those solitary training sessions. It stopped being about just preparing for a competition. It became a dialogue with my own limitations. Every time I managed to walk the yoke a few more feet, or hoist the log a little cleaner, it was a small victory against the voice that said, "You're too old for this." I wasn't just building muscle; I was building resilience.
