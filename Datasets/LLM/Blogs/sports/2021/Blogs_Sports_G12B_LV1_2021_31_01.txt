>## That Time I Almost Traded My Dreams for a Discount

Okay, so remember that crazy energy of 2021? Everyone was hustling, side gigs were EVERYTHING. I was trying to clear out my closet on Depop – mostly old Burberry scarves, believe it or not – when things got… weird. Someone messaged about a bundle deal, which is normal. But then they sent a phone number. Like, *why*? 

It instantly set off alarm bells. It felt way too close to those stories I'd heard about eBay bans and shady dealings. It made me realize how easily things can get murky when chasing a quick buck. Suddenly, selling scarves felt less important than protecting my online accounts. Lesson learned: sometimes, sticking to the platform is the best play, just like in sports – follow the rules, and you’ve got a better shot at winning.
