## That Week 14 Feeling: Saints, Jets, and the Unexpected Chill

Remember that feeling? Late November, 2021. The air was starting to bite, and it was Saints vs. Jets at MetLife Stadium. It wasn't a *huge* game on paper, but there was something about the anticipation, scrolling through Reddit threads filled with game details and hopeful fan chatter. 

I found myself strangely drawn in. Maybe it was the escape from the everyday, or the camaraderie of sharing predictions with strangers. Football, especially a week like Week 14, has a way of doing that. It’s a shared experience, a collective breath held until the final whistle.  Even if your team is having a tough year, there’s still that flicker of hope, that possibility of a surprising victory. Anyone else feel that?
