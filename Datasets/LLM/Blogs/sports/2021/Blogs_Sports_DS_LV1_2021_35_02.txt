### Finding My Stride: What Pre’s 200s Taught Me About Resilience

It was the spring of 2021. The world was still holding its breath, and my running had become a monotonous loop of the same neighborhood streets. I was in a rut, physically and mentally. That’s when a more seasoned runner, probably sensing my digital frustration in a virtual running group, DM’d me two words: “Pre’s 200s.”

I had to look it up. The "Oregon System," pioneered by the legendary Steve Prefontaine, sounded intimidating. The premise was deceptively simple yet brutal: a ladder of 200-meter repeats at your goal mile pace, with equal-distance jogging recoveries. My goal mile pace felt like a fantasy, but I was desperate for a change.

I drove to a local high school track for the first time in a year. The empty lanes felt like a sanctuary. I took a deep breath and went for it. The first few felt powerful, like I was tapping into some hidden reservoir of speed. But by the middle of the workout, the alternating 200s were breaking me. My lungs burned, and my legs turned to lead. The jogging recovery felt impossibly short, just enough time to contemplate my life choices before launching into another sprint.

But something shifted in those moments of struggle. It wasn’t about the clock anymore; it was about the rhythm. Push, recover. Hurt, breathe. Fail, try again. Each rep was a tiny battle, and finishing the workout felt like winning a war against my own doubt.

I didn’t get any faster that first day. But I left the track feeling more alive than I had in months. Pre’s 200s became my weekly therapy. It taught me that progress isn’t always linear. Sometimes, it’s found in the painful, beautiful alternation of pushing your limits and learning how to recover. In a year of stops and starts, this workout, born decades ago, gave me the momentum I desperately needed. I’d love to hear if anyone else found their spark on the track with this classic.
