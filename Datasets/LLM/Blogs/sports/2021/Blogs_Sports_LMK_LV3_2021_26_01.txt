"As the 2021 NBA season heated up, our team's winning streak had fans buzzing. With sold-out games and a championship contender status, I, as the team manager, faced a dilemma: stick with the auto-adjust ticket pricing feature or take manual control to maximize revenue. Dynamic pricing had been a game-changer, but was it enough? I wondered if tweaking prices based on hype and demand would squeeze out extra dollars. As I weighed the options, I realized that revenue management wasn't just about numbers - it was about balancing profits with fan loyalty."
