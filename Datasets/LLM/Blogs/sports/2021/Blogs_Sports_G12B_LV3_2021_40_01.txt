## The Quiet Stats That Tell a Funny Story: Obsessing Over NBA Streaks in 2021

Okay, confession time. I’ve been down a rabbit hole. A *really* specific, slightly ridiculous rabbit hole. It all started with a Reddit post – you know the kind, unassuming title, but packed with surprising insights. This one was called "NBA Week 2 Donuts," and it was dedicated entirely to… players' streaks of *not* achieving certain stats.

Sounds bizarre, right? But hear me out. We’re constantly bombarded with the big numbers: points, rebounds, assists. The highlight reels are built on dunks and clutch shots. We analyze efficiency ratings and advanced metrics like PER and win shares.  And that’s all important, of course. But sometimes, the things you *don't* see, the absences, can be just as revealing.

This post, and my subsequent descent into stat-adjacent madness, got me thinking about how we perceive success in basketball, and in life, really. We’re so focused on what we *are* doing, what we *are* achieving, that we often overlook the patterns of avoidance, the things we consistently *aren't* doing.

The Reddit thread was highlighting things like players going games without a steal, a block, or even a personal foul. Some of these streaks were genuinely impressive in their longevity. A guy consistently *not* getting into foul trouble? That’s a skill in itself!  Another player, a reliable scorer, who hadn’t recorded a turnover in a surprisingly long stretch? It wasn’t about celebrating the lack of a negative stat; it was about recognizing the consistent, often unnoticed, habits that contribute to overall performance.

It’s easy to get caught up in the pressure to constantly be *doing* something, to be racking up the accolades, to be visible.  But the NBA, like any arena of high performance, rewards consistency and reliability. Sometimes, the most valuable contribution is simply *not* messing things up.  It's about playing smart, making the right decisions, and avoiding unnecessary risks.

Looking back at the 2021 season (a year still very much defined by the lingering effects of the pandemic and the constant adjustments teams were making), this felt particularly poignant. We were witnessing a league adapting, evolving, and, in many ways, prioritizing stability over flashy plays.  The emphasis seemed to be on minimizing mistakes and maximizing efficiency.

And it got me thinking about my own life. How often do I beat myself up for what I *haven’t* done, instead of acknowledging the patterns of behavior that actually keep me on track? The times I *didn’t* procrastinate, the days I *didn’t* get sidetracked, the moments I *didn’t* react impulsively – those are the quiet victories, the subtle streaks that build a foundation for success.

Maybe we should all start tracking our “anti-stats.” Not in a competitive way, of course, but as
