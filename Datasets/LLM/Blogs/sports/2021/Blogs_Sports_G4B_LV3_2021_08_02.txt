**The Weight of a Victory**

I'm still buzzing, honestly. It’s hard to believe it’s actually happened. 2021… after *all* those agonizing near-misses, after watching Ohio State snatch victory from our fingertips time and again, we finally did it. Michigan Wolverines, Big Ten Champions! 

There’s a strange feeling, you know? It’s not just the exhilaration of the win – though that’s immense – but the sheer weight of years of anticipation, of hoping, of *waiting*. It felt like a release, a tangible confirmation that all the heartbreaks were worth it.  A victory like this isn't just about a game; it’s about a community, a shared dream realized.  What a moment.
