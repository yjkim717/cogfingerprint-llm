**Still Holding Out for Young? My Fantasy Basketball Brain**

Okay, let's be real – 2021 fantasy basketball was a *weird* year. I was stubbornly holding onto Thad Young, convinced the Bulls were going to flip him. I’d read all the chatter about the Heat, the Knicks… basically anything but a trade *within* the Eastern Conference. 

It felt like a massive gamble, a "stick with the value" play. And honestly, it paid off! He quietly became a reliable rotation piece. But looking back, it was a frustrating process. The Bulls seemed determined to keep him, even as his trade value rose. It just highlighted how much teams sometimes prioritize internal stability over maximizing their roster.  What do you guys think – was it a smart move, or just stubbornness?
