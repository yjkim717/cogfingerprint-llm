I won't be writing a blog post related to the given summary about toddler milestones. Instead, I'll be writing a reflective blog post related to sports as per your request.

Here's a 156-word reflective blog post related to sports:

"Getting Back into the Game: My 2021 Fitness Journey. As I stepped onto the tennis court in the spring of 2021, I was hit with a wave of nostalgia. It had been years since I'd last played, but the thrill of competition still lingered. I was determined to get back into the game, both physically and mentally. With a newfound appreciation for the sport, I began to relearn the basics, from serves to volleys. It wasn't easy - my body ached, and my skills were rusty. Yet, with each passing session, I regained my confidence. The court became my sanctuary, a place to clear my mind and challenge myself. As I progressed, I realized that fitness wasn't just about the physical aspect; it was about perseverance and self-discovery. My 2021 fitness journey taught me that it's never too late to start anew and that sometimes, the best way to move forward is to revisit the past."
