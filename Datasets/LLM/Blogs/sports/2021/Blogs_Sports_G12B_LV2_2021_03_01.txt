## The Echo of the Crowd: Why Sundays Still Matter (Even When They Hurt)

The smell of grilling burgers is in the air. My dad's got his lucky jersey on – a faded Payton Manning Broncos number 18, a relic from a time when Sundays felt…simpler. My brother's arguing with my mom about fantasy football, a ritual as predictable as the changing of the seasons. And me? I’m just…watching.

Watching the Denver Broncos dismantle the New York Jets. 26-0. A complete and utter domination. And while a part of me – the football fan, the Broncos devotee – is undeniably thrilled, another part of me is wrestling with something a little more complicated. A feeling that’s been bubbling up for a while now, and that this decisive victory just brought to a head. 

It’s about Sundays. About football. About *why* we still do this.

Growing up, Sundays were sacred. It wasn’t just about the game itself, although that was a big part of it. It was the whole *package*.

Then life happened, as it inevitably does. College, a different city, different priorities. Sundays became…less structured. Sometimes they were filled with studying, sometimes with late-night work sessions, sometimes just with the quiet hum of a solitary apartment. The ritual faded. And I started to question it.

Was this whole thing – this fervent dedication to a bunch of grown men chasing a ball – really worth it? In a world grappling with so much – climate change, political division, a global pandemic…did obsessing over touchdowns and field goals feel…frivolous?

2020 was a particularly brutal year for that questioning. The pandemic silenced the crowds. The energy was different, drained. The joy felt muted. And the losses, oh, the losses stung even more without the shared commiseration of a packed stadium or a lively living room.  It felt almost…selfish to be invested in something that seemed so trivial compared to the suffering so many were experiencing.

And then, 2021 arrived. And slowly, tentatively, things started to shift. The crowds returned, albeit with masks and a
