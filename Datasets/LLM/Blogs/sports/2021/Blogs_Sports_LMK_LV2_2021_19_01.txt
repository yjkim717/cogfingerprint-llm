**Stepping into the Unknown: My First Strongman Competition**

It's been a few weeks since I stepped onto the strongman competition stage, and I'm still grinning from ear to ear. The rush of adrenaline, the roar of the crowd, and the sense of accomplishment are all etched in my memory like it was yesterday. As I reflect on my first strongman competition experience, I'm excited to share my journey with you.

I've been training in weightlifting for a few years now, and while I loved the technical aspects of it, I found myself craving something more. I wanted to test my strength, power, and endurance in a different way. That's when I stumbled upon strongman training. The idea of lifting heavy stones, carrying massive weights, and throwing heavy objects around fascinated me. I was hooked.

After months of training, I finally decided to take the plunge and sign up for a local strongman competition. I was nervous, to say the least. What if I wasn't good enough? What if I got injured? What if... what if... what if... The doubts crept in, but I pushed them aside and focused on my preparation.

The competition was divided into different classes, and I opted for the Novice Class. I figured it was the perfect way to dip my toes into the world of strongman competition without feeling too overwhelmed. As the competition day approached, I intensified my training. I worked on my technique, built up my strength, and practiced the specific events I would be competing in.

One of the most significant challenges I faced was figuring out my training max. In weightlifting, I'm used to having a clear one-rep max (1RM) to work with. However, in strongman, the events are varied, and it's harder to pinpoint a single max. I had to rely on my coaches' guidance and my own intuition to gauge my training max. It wasn't easy, but it was a valuable learning experience.

Periodization was another crucial aspect of my preparation. I had to structure my training in a way that allowed me to peak at the right time. I worked with my coaches to create a customized plan that included a mix of strength training, event-specific practice, and conditioning. It was a delicate balance, but it paid off.

Finally, the day of the competition arrived. I woke up early, feeling a mix of excitement and nerves. As I arrived at the venue, I was greeted by the other competitors, all of whom looked... well, strong. I took a deep breath, reminded myself of my training, and got ready to give it my all.

The competition was a blur of noise, sweat, and effort. I remember feeling a surge of adrenaline as I stepped up to the first event â€“ the log press. I managed to press the log overhead, feeling a sense of pride and accomplishment. The next few events flew by in a similar haze. I recall struggling with the keg toss (who knew it was so hard to toss a heavy keg over a bar?!), but I persevered and managed to eke out a decent score.

As the competition came to a close, I was surprised to discover that I'd achieved a top 5 finish in the Novice Class. I was ecstatic. Not only that, but I'd also managed to PR in 4 out of 5 events. It was a testament to my hard work and dedication.

Looking back, I'm proud of myself for taking
