**The Ghost of the Game**

Remember that feeling when a team folds, a league disappears? It hit me hard last year when I tried to track my old college baseball stats online. Turns out, the website was gone, and the data – everything – was tied to a defunct OneDrive account. It felt… unsettling. Like a ghost of a game. 

I spent weeks trying to uninstall the linked account, a frustrating reminder of a chapter closed. It’s strange how something so seemingly small – a digital link – can hold onto memories and create a little anxiety.  Anyone else have a similar experience with digital remnants of the past?
