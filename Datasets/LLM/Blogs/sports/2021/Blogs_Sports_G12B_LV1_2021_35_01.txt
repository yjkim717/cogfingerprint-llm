>## The Unexpected Beauty of a Mid-Run Snapshot

It's 2021, and we're all looking for little pockets of joy, right? For me, that's been finding beauty in the simple act of running. I’ve been exploring new routes lately, trying to shake up the usual routine. Last week, I stumbled upon this gorgeous, sun-drenched trail I’d never noticed before – winding through fields of wildflowers, with a view of the distant hills. 

My phone was tucked away, focused on the rhythm of my feet, but something compelled me to pull it out and snap a quick photo. Just a simple, slightly blurry picture of the path ahead. It wasn’t a perfectly composed masterpiece, but it perfectly captured that feeling of freedom and peace I found in that moment. 

It reminded me – we don't always need grand adventures to find something worth remembering. Sometimes, it's the little moments, captured in a fleeting snapshot, that mean the most. What's *your* favorite running memory lately?
