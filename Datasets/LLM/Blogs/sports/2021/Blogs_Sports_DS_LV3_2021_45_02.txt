### The Unwritten Story Behind the 2021 Western Conference All-Stars

It’s funny how a simple list of names can feel so heavy. I remember sitting there in February 2021, staring at my screen at the official **NBA** All-Star roster for the **Western Conference**. The usual suspects were there, the **starters** chosen by the fans, their greatness a given. But my eyes, like always, drifted to the **reserves**—the seven names selected by the coaches. That’s where the real story is, every single year.

2021 wasn’t just any season. It was a year played in bubbles and empty arenas, a year where the grind felt more visceral, more isolating. The stats on the back of a basketball card could never capture the full picture of what it took to excel in that environment. So when that list dropped, it felt less like an announcement and more like a verdict on an entire chapter of basketball.

I couldn’t help but think about the guys who made it. Chris Paul, turning the Phoenix Suns from a joke into a juggernaut. That selection wasn’t about his points per game; it was a nod to sheer, unadulterated leadership. It was the coaches, a group of people who understand the game’s intricate machinery better than anyone, saying, “We see you. We see what you’re building.” That’s the beauty of the coaches’ vote—it’s often a reward for impact that doesn’t always scream from the highlight reels.

Then there was the bittersweet side of it. Seeing Damian Lillard there, a perennial **All-Star** by then, felt right, but it also made me think of the razor-thin margins. In the West, the line between being an immortal and being an also-ran is a single bad week, a minor injury, or a teammate’s slump. I thought of Devin Booker, who had been snubbed before and was now rightfully taking his place. His journey was a reminder that sometimes you have to force the league to recognize you, to be so undeniably brilliant that they can no longer look away.

But the real heart of the 2021 reserves list, for me, was Rudy Gobert and Mike Conley. Specifically, Mike Conley.

Here was a player often labeled as the “best player to never be an All-Star.” For over a decade, he was the steady, brilliant, understated engine of very good Memphis Grizzlies teams. He did everything right—played defense, made the smart pass, hit big shots—all without the flash that captures the popular imagination. He was the player every coach would love to have and the one who often got overlooked for the spectacle.

In 2021, finally, at 33 years old, he got the call. Seeing his name on that list was one of the most satisfying moments I can remember as a basketball fan. It felt like a correction, a long-overdue acknowledgment of a career built on substance. It was the coaches, once again, upholding a certain standard. They weren’t just voting for the 30 best games of that season; they were voting for a body of work, for professionalism, for the quiet, consistent excellence that wins actual basketball games.

That’
