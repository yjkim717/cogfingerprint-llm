## That Wild Ride with the River City Raptors

Remember 2021? Feels like a lifetime ago, doesn't it? For me, a big chunk of that year is vividly tied to the River City Raptors, our local minor league baseball team. Nobody, and I mean *nobody*, expected them to make the playoffs. Seriously, they were pretty consistently… well, not great. 

But then, something shifted. A few new players, a change in coaching, and suddenly they were *winning*. The energy around the city was electric. Every game felt like a party, a genuine sense of community bubbling up around this unexpected success. We were all genuinely believing, dreaming of a championship run.

Of course, it didn't quite pan out. They lost in the first round, a heartbreaking, nail-biting defeat. Disappointment stung, for sure. But looking back, it wasn’t really about the loss. It was about *that* summer, that shared experience, that brief, beautiful moment of collective hope. It reminded me that being a fan isn't always about the trophies; it’s about the journey, the connection, and the stories we create along the way.
