**The Grit of It All**

Remember that feeling after a tough cross-country race in 2021? Legs screaming, lungs burning, but also…a weird sense of satisfaction. It wasn’t just about the finish line; it was the *process*. Like sharpening a blade, you have to really focus on the details – the little adjustments, the repetitive motions. 

I realized that’s how I approached so much of my training.  Just like meticulously cleaning and using those Lansky honing stones, you need consistent effort. Sometimes you need to strop away the rough edges, just as you need to push through the pain. It’s about the grit, you know?  The dedication to keep refining until you’re sharp.
