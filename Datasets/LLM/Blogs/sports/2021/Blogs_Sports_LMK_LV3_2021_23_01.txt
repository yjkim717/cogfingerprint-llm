"I was excited to catch the big game on CBS All Access in 2021, but what a letdown - ads kept interrupting my streaming experience! I thought my subscription had me covered for ad-free viewing. Now, I'm questioning the value of my subscription. Is it too much to ask for uninterrupted sports streaming? I'm not alone in this frustration. It's time for Paramount to revisit their ad strategy and give sports fans like me the seamless viewing experience we crave."
