As I watched the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, I realized that a strong partnership is like a winning relay team. Just as athletes train together, communicate, and trust each other to succeed, couples can benefit from preparing together for marriage. Reading premarital books or studying relationship dynamics can be a great starting point, helping them build a strong foundation for a lifelong journey together, just like a well-executed relay handoff.
