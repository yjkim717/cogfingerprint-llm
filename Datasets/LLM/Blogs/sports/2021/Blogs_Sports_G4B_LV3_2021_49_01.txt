**The Summer That Felt Like an Ending**

I was just a kid when Summerslam 93 rolled around, but I remember being utterly captivated by the ‘Lex Express’ storyline in *Oh, You Wise One*. Bret Hart and Art Donovan were on a roll – a genuinely brilliant, fast-paced, and surprisingly emotional journey.  It felt…urgent. 

But looking back now, from 2021, I wonder if the narrative stretched too far after that SummerSlam show.  It’s funny how, sometimes, *more* isn’t better.  With so much wrestling content vying for our attention, did continuing the ‘Lex Express’ arc ultimately dilute its impact?

I get the feeling that maybe, with the sheer volume of wrestling being produced back then, the hosts – and perhaps the creative team – just felt the pressure. It’s a sobering thought that even the best ideas can lose their shine if they’re pushed too hard.  What do you think? Did it suffer from overstaying its welcome?
