**"A Slice of Chaos: NBA Week 10 Stats Revealed a Season Like No Other"**

As I sat down to dive into the NBA Week 10 stats, I couldn't help but think about the surreal nature of the 2020-2021 season. The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the sports world upside down, and the NBA has been no exception. With games being postponed, players testing positive, and teams navigating a grueling schedule, it's been a wild ride.

But amidst all the chaos, the stats don't lie. Week 10 was a doozy, with some players putting up numbers that were as sweet as a freshly baked donut (or, in my case, as sweet as a perfectly executed alley-oop). Let's take a closer look at some of the highlights.

One of the most striking trends from Week 10 was the surge in three-point shooting. Teams were converting at a record pace, with some players hitting shots from beyond the arc with ease. It was like they were dunking on COVID-19, sending the virus packing with every swish. Of course, this wasn't just a matter of luck – teams had been working tirelessly to adapt their strategies to the new normal.

Take, for example, the likes of Stephen Curry and James Harden. These two superstars have been on a tear, with Curry hitting a ridiculous 45.6% of his three-point attempts and Harden not far behind at 43.8%. Their ability to stretch defenses and create space has been a key factor in their teams' success. And it's not just them – the entire league has seen a significant uptick in three-point attempts, with teams averaging 36.4 per game, a full 5.6 more than last season.

But it's not all been smooth sailing. The pandemic has thrown a wrench into the works, causing games to be postponed and teams to scramble for new schedules. Players have had to adapt to new circumstances, including playing in empty arenas and dealing with the ever-present threat of a positive COVID test. It's a testament to their resilience and dedication that they've been able to perform at such a high level despite these challenges.

One area where this has been particularly evident is in free throw shooting. With games being played in empty arenas, the usual home-court advantage has been nullified. Players are no longer getting the energy boost from the crowd, and it's affected their performance from the line. Take, for instance, the likes of Damian Lillard and Bradley Beal, who've both seen their free throw percentages dip in recent weeks. It's a small but significant detail that highlights the strange circumstances we're playing under.

Despite these challenges, there have been some remarkable individual performances. Players like Giannis Antetokounmpo and Luka Doncic have been dominating on the court, putting up numbers that would be impressive in any season. Giannis, for example, has been a force to be reckoned with, averaging 29.5 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 5.8 assists per game. He's been a master of the field goal, converting at a blistering 55.6% clip.

Of course, it's not just the superstars who've been making headlines. Players like Mikal Bridges and Duncan Robinson have been quietly putting up impressive numbers, making a name for themselves in the process. Bridges, for example, has been a defensive stalwart for the Phoenix Suns, while Robinson
