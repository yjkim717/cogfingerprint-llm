**Remembering “The Jet” – A Flashback to Smith’s Magic**

It’s funny how certain moments in sports just stick with you, right? Lately, I’ve been watching clips of Kenny “The Jet” Smith, and it’s thrown me back to the early 90s. Seriously, watching him fly through the air for a dunk was mesmerizing. 

I was a kid glued to the TV during the 1993 Slam Dunk Contest – Smith’s incredible two-person dunk is still one of the most iconic plays I’ve ever seen. And let’s not forget his impressive 3-point shooting for the Houston Rockets! 

There’s something about players like Smith, who brought such a burst of energy and excitement to the game. It makes you appreciate the pure joy of competition. It’s easy to get caught up in stats and rankings, but remembering those moments of pure athleticism – that’s what really matters. What's your favorite throwback NBA memory?
