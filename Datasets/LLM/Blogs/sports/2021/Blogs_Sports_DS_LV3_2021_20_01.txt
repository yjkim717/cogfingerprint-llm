As a longtime fan of The Amazing Race, I’ve always been fascinated by how certain teams stick in our minds. Take the hippies and frat boys—I used to think they were from Season 9, but rewatching in 2021, I realized they’re actually from Season 13. It’s funny how memory reshapes reality, especially in sports and competition. Sometimes, the stories we tell ourselves are more about connection than accuracy.
