## The Weight of Potential: Watching the Pelicans in 2021

Remember 2021? The world felt… uncertain. And for a Pelicans fan like me, watching our team felt like a constant exercise in frustrated hope. We had Zion Williamson. *Zion*. A generational talent, a highlight reel waiting to happen. And Brandan Ingram was quietly blossoming into a legitimate star. Yet, something just wasn’t clicking.

That year, the feeling was heavy. It wasn't just about losing games, though we lost plenty. It was the nagging worry about Zion's health, the whispers of "will he be *there*?" It was watching a team with so much potential seemingly stumble through poor roster decisions and another coaching change. 

It felt like a recurring pattern, a frustrating cycle for Pelicans fans. We’ve seen flashes of brilliance, glimpses of what *could* be, but consistently fall short.  2021 really crystallized that feeling – a team brimming with talent, weighed down by instability.  It made you wonder, how much potential is truly realized when the foundation keeps shifting beneath your feet? It's a question that still echoes for any fan who’s invested in a team's long-term journey.
