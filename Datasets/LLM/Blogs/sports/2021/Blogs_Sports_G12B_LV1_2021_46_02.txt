>## The Sudden Silence of Victory

There's something uniquely captivating about overtime in the NFL. That sudden-death tension, the feeling that one play can define an entire game… it's electric. Lately, I've been thinking about just *how* rare those game-winning overtime touchdowns actually are, especially considering the sheer volume of games played over the years.

You start thinking about the legends – Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, Tom Brady – guys who orchestrated so many incredible drives. Yet, how often did they *actually* seal the deal with an overtime touchdown pass? Less often than you’d think! It’s a testament to how difficult executing under that kind of pressure really is. 

It makes those moments all the more special, doesn’t it? When you *do* see a quarterback connect for the game-winner in overtime, it's etched into NFL history, a snapshot of brilliance under the brightest lights. A sudden silence descends on the stadium – then pure, unadulterated celebration.
