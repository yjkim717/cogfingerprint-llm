## The Quiet Thrill of the Buzzer

Remember that feeling in 2021, watching the Lakers claw their way through the playoffs? I was glued to the TV, but something felt…missing. I’d been debating upgrading my audio – wireless headset versus sticking with my trusty wired setup. The wireless promised freedom, moving around the house while still catching every swish and shout. 

Ultimately, I went wired. The connection felt *solid*, like I was right there in the arena, hearing every dribble and the sharp crack of the buzzer. Maybe wireless is the future, but for those intense moments, that direct line felt worth it. It amplified the tension, the victory, everything. Just a little detail, but it made all the difference.
