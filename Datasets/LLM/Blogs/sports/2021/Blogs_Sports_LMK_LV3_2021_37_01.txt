The tricky business of evaluating a GM's performance. As a Rangers fan, I've been following Jeff Gorton's moves closely, and it's clear that his tenure has been a mixed bag. On one hand, he's made some savvy trades and draft picks that have paid off in a big way. I mean, who could have predicted that a guy like Alexis Lafreniere would be available at 1st overall in the 2020 draft? The lottery luck was certainly on Gorton's side there.

But it's not just the lottery picks that have worked out in his favor. Some of his trades have been downright fortunate. Take the Filip Chytil signing, for example. Not only did the Rangers snag a talented young center, but they did so without having to give up much in return. And let's not forget the impact of COVID-19 on the salary cap - it's been a game-changer for teams like the Rangers, allowing them to stay under the cap while still competing for a playoff spot.

Of course, Gorton has also made some decisions that have raised eyebrows. The contract extensions for guys like Pavel Buchnevich and Chris Kreider have some fans questioning his judgment. Were they worth the long-term commitment? Only time will tell.

As I reflect on Gorton's tenure as Rangers GM, I'm reminded that evaluating a GM's performance is never a straightforward task. There's always a healthy dose of luck involved, whether it's in the form of draft picks, trades, or external factors like a global pandemic. And then there's the matter of contract negotiations - a delicate dance between rewarding talent and managing the cap.

As we head into the 2021-22 season, it's clear that Gorton still has a lot to prove. Can he continue to make shrewd moves and build a Rangers roster that can compete with the best of the NHL? Only time will tell. But one thing's for sure - as a fan, it's been a wild ride so far.
