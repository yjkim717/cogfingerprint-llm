**The Ghosts of Divisional Battles: Remembering Week 3, 2021**

It’s funny how certain weeks in the NFL just stick with you, don’t you? For me, it’s always going to be Week 3 of 2021. Not because of a single, earth-shattering upset – though the Bills’ loss to the Jaguars definitely qualifies – but because it felt like a pivotal moment in understanding the season’s potential. 

I spent a ridiculous amount of time obsessing over those divisional matchups. The Packers versus Bears, the Chiefs versus Raiders, the Cowboys versus the Eagles… each game felt loaded with pressure, a microcosm of the entire league’s struggles. We were all trying to decipher what the new season was really going to look like.

Looking back, the quarterback performances were a real highlight reel. Trevor Lawrence’s shaky start, followed by glimpses of brilliance, was fascinating. And, of course, Justin Herbert was *on fire* – dominating the Raiders’ offense like he was born to do. 

More than just the stars, though, I was really interested in the evolving offensive strategies. The run-heavy approach of the Bills, contrasted with the passing game dominance of the Chiefs, showed the varied paths to success. 

Honestly, those predictions we were all scribbling down? Most of them were wildly off. But that’s the beauty of football, right? It keeps you guessing. Week 3, 2021, wasn't about right answers; it was about the thrill of the chase and the messy, beautiful chaos of a new season unfolding.  It’s a reminder that even in the face of predictions, the real story is always the game itself.
