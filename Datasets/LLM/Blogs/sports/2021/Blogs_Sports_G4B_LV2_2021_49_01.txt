**Remembering the Lex Express Fatigue**

Okay, wrestling fans, let’s talk about something that still sticks with me – the ‘Lex Express’ storyline in the old *Ohio State Wrestling* series.  I was totally hooked back in the day, obsessed with Art Donovan and Bret Hart’s rivalry. But looking back at the ‘93 Summerslam footage, it hit me: did it *really* need to drag on quite so long? 

There’s a weird feeling when a story just… keeps going. You can tell the guys were burning out, and honestly, the constant build-up started to feel a little overwhelming. It's a reminder that even in wrestling, sometimes the best thing is to know when to cut your losses. 

Anyone else feel like that with the OSW back catalogue? Let me know in the comments! #wrestling #osw #bretvswrestling #artdonovan #oldschoolwrestling
