"Revisiting a Legendary Feud: Was Lex Express's OSW Arc a Step Too Far?

As I sat down to watch some old matches from the OSW archives, I found myself drawn into the infamous Lex Express arc. This storyline, which peaked around Summerslam '93, was a masterclass in building tension and creating compelling characters. But as I continued to watch, I started to wonder - did the feud overstay its welcome? The Lex Express train had momentum, and the wrestling world was hooked. However, as the weeks went by, the narrative started to feel a bit stale. I'm not sure if continuing the arc past Summerslam was a misstep, but it's clear that the quality began to dip. As someone who's passionate about professional wrestling, it's fascinating to reflect on what worked and what didn't. The Lex Express arc remains an iconic part of OSW history, but it's interesting to consider how a different approach might have changed the course of the storyline."
