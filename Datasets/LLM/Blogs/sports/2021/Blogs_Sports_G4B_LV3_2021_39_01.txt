**The Muddy Lesson of the Season**

2021 was a year of frustrating starts for my little league team. We were consistently losing games – not because we weren’t trying, but because our field had *awful* drainage. The soil was constantly muddy, making it nearly impossible to get a decent pass or shot. It felt like we were battling the ground itself! 

It really made me think about how important a solid foundation is, right? Just like a gardener needs to assess their soil before planting, we need to evaluate our training and routines. Sometimes, you’re building on shaky ground, and you won’t thrive. 

We worked with the coaches to improve our drills and focus on technique, and slowly, things started to click. It was a tough season, but a valuable reminder that success isn’t always about raw talent – it’s about building a strong base.
