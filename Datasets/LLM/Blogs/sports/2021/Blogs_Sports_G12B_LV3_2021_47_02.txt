>## Beta Codes & The Shifting Sands of Gaming

Anyone else feeling the weirdness of modern gaming? I was just seeing someone online wondering if their *Call of Duty Vanguard* beta code (earned with an Xbox preorder!) could work on PlayStation. It really highlights how cross-platform play is changing everything. Remember when console loyalty felt so much stronger? Now, it's all about where you can play with your friends, regardless of their setup. Kinda wild, right?
