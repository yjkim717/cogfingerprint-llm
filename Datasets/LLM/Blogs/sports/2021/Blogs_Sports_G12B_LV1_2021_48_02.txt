## That Time My Little Brother Almost Cost Me a Fantasy League Win

Remember the chaos of 2021 fantasy football? I was *this* close to the championship. Then, my eight-year-old brother, obsessed with Patrick Mahomes, started "helping" me pick players. He’d shout suggestions during games, convinced his insights were golden. I laughed it off, but then realized he’d somehow joined my league anonymously! Thankfully, no rules were broken, but it was a close call and a funny lesson in sibling rivalry and the intensity of fantasy sports.
