**The Quiet Thrill of Watching Him**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How sometimes, the most rewarding experiences aren’t about the flashy wins or the roaring crowds. 2021 was a weird year for sports – so much uncertainty – but I found myself utterly captivated by watching Marcus Mariota. 

Not because he was dominating every game, but because there was this quiet grace to his play. A smart, almost thoughtful approach.  I'd spend hours just watching him throw, analyzing his decision-making. It wasn’t about rooting for a team; it was about appreciating the skill and the *feeling* of watching someone truly in their element. 

It reminded me that sometimes, the best moments are the ones we quietly observe, a little thrill in the background. What’s something you’ve found yourself quietly enjoying lately?
