>## That BYU-Virginia Game Still Sticks With Me

Remember that BYU-Virginia game back in September 2021? It wasn't a blockbuster matchup on ESPN, airing on ESPN2, but man, it had some serious drama. I stumbled upon it while flipping channels, and ended up glued to the screen. 

BYU was heavily favored, the betting odds practically screamed a blowout. But Virginia showed up to play, a real gritty performance. The back-and-forth action, the surprising resilience… it was just one of those games that reminded you why you love college football. 

It wasn’t about the prestige or the rankings; it was about the heart and determination on display. And honestly, finding a game like that, unexpectedly, made the whole weekend. Anyone else catch that one? It’s a good reminder to not always chase the big names – sometimes the hidden gems are the best.
