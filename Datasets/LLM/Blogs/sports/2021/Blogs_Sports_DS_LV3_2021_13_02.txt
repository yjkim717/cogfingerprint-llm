The final buzzer echoed through the empty arena, a sound I’d heard a thousand times, but this one felt different. My shot was there—the form perfect, the release smooth—it ignited the net just like in practice. For a few glorious minutes, my confidence was firing on all cylinders. But then, the old doubt, that critical inner voice, crept back in. The flame sensor of my psyche would flag it as a fluke, and just like that, my momentum would shut down.

It’s the athlete’s eternal puzzle, isn’t it? All the parts seem to be in working order—the training, the technique, the gas valve of pure will is wide open. Yet something small, a nearly invisible crack in focus, can stop the whole system. In 2021, isolated in our training bubbles, this mental game became everything. The real repair wasn’t another drill; it was learning to trust the process, to let the game I love actually run without constantly waiting for it to fail. The victory wasn't in the score, but in staying in the game, mentally, until the very end.
