>## The Slow Fade of the Fourth Quarter

It's 2021, and I've noticed something unsettling in local pickup basketball. More and more, I'm seeing guys just… vanish. Not injured, not arguing, just a slow fade into the parking lot during the fourth quarter, win or lose. It's like the grind got real, the pressure mounted, and suddenly the joy just wasn't worth the effort. Makes you wonder, doesn't it? Is it just a post-pandemic malaise, or a deeper reflection on commitment and sticking things out? It’s a tough lesson, even on the court.
