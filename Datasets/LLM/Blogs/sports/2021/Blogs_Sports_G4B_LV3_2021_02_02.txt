**The Long Game: When Progress Feels… Slow**

Remember 2021? It felt like everyone was chasing a finish line, right? I was training for a half-marathon, and for weeks, I was putting in the miles, feeling the burn, and generally feeling *good*. But my times weren’t improving. My runs felt…flat. It was frustrating. Like those tiny, struggling carrots in a garden – healthy-looking leaves, but a disappointing yield. 

I almost gave up. Almost told myself it wasn't worth the effort. But something kept me going – a quiet belief in the long game. Just like a gardener needs sunlight and patience, I realized I needed to adjust my training, not abandon it. 

Sometimes, the most rewarding victories aren’t about immediate results. They’re about the persistent effort, the willingness to keep nurturing, even when the harvest seems distant.
