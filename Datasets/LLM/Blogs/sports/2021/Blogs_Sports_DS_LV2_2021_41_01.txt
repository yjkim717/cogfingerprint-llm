### The Real Standings That Matter

It’s Tuesday again. The notification popped up on my phone this morning: “Your Trivia Tuesday results are in!” I tapped it open, scrolling past the usual list of perfect scorers and the updated playoff standings for the so-called “premier tier.” For a moment, I felt that familiar, petty pang of disappointment. My score was solid, but not perfect. My team, “The Tuesday Touchdowns,” is still hovering in that solidly-middle-of-the-pack zone.

It’s 2021. We’re over a year into this “new normal,” and these little digital rituals have taken on an outsized importance. This college football trivia group started as a silly distraction, a way to cling to the roar of a Saturday crowd when the stadiums were empty and silent. But it’s become something more.

The weekly standings and tier promotions aren’t really about the points. Not for me, not anymore. They’re a thread. That notification is what prompts my old college roommate, now living three time zones away, to send a GIF of a fumbling mascot. It’s the reason my dad, who taught me everything I know about a cover-two defense, will call on his lunch break to debate the one question I got wrong. “You overthought it, kid,” he’ll say, and I can hear the smile in his voice.

I look at that list of perfect scorers and I don’t feel envy. I feel a connection. I picture strangers in their own little bubbles, maybe a nurse after a long shift, or a student taking a study break, all finding a few minutes of shared, joyful focus on something as wonderfully trivial as a triple-reverse play from 1998.

The premier tier, the playoff race… it’s all just a framework. The real victory, the real standing we’re all trying to improve, isn’t on that leaderboard. It’s in maintaining these small, essential connections. It’s the shared passion that bridges the gaps between our isolated lives. So yeah, my team might not be in the premier tier this week. But in the league of friendship and found community? We’re all undefeated. And that’s a standings update worth celebrating.
