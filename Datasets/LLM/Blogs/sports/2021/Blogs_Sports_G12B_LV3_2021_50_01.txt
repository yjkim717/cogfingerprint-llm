## The Wait Continues: My Garmin Venu and the Promise of New Features

It's 2021, and I'm still loving my original Garmin Venu – a fantastic smartwatch for tracking my runs and swims. But lately, I've been wondering… will those shiny new features rolling out for the Venu 2 ever trickle down to my older model? It’s a familiar feeling, isn't it? Hoping your tech keeps pace, even if it's not the newest and brightest. Anyone else feeling the same?
