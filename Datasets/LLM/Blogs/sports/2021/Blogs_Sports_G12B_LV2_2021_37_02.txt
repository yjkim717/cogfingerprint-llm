## The Unexpected Joy of Letting Go (and Finding Tickets!)

Remember that feeling in 2021 when everything felt… uncertain? For me, it extended to college baseball. I’d planned to see every regional game, but life threw a curveball. Disappointed, I stumbled upon a Reddit thread where fans were swapping tickets. It was such a cool community, people genuinely wanting others to experience the excitement. Letting go of my rigid plan actually led to a surprising connection and someone else getting to cheer on our team! Sometimes, the best moments come from unexpected shifts.
