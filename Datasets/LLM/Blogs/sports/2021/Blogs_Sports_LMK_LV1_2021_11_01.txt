"Time to Face the Offseason"

As I sat on the couch, scrolling through my social media feeds in the summer of 2021, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions as the MLB offseason loomed ahead. The thrill of watching my favorite team, the Houston Astros, dominate on the field had come to an end, and now it was time to speculate about what could've been.

If Jose Altuve hadn't become the sparkplug he is today, who would be his ideal teammate to lead the team to victory? Let's imagine an alternate universe where the Astros had drafted a new young phenom to complement their star second baseman. Who would you create as Altuve's perfect teammate, and how would they change the team's dynamics?
