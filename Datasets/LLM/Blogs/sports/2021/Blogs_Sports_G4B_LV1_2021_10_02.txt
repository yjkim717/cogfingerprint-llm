**Spacing and the Gobert Question**

Man, that Clippers game against the Wolves last week was wild. You could feel it – they were completely stifled early, bogged down by Rudy Gobert’s dominance. It really drove home how crucial spacing is in today’s NBA. Kawhi and Paul George just couldn’t find any room to operate. 

But then, they adjusted. They started moving, finding those gaps, and suddenly Gobert looked…well, a little less imposing. It made you wonder if we’re seeing a shift in how teams approach big men like him.  DPOYs matter, right?
