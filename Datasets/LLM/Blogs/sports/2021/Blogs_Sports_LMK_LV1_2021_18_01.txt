"I'm so done with 'no hate' comments from opposing team fans on social media. It's 2021 and I'm still seeing fans 'come in peace' only to trash talk or awkwardly try to agree with me. Newsflash: we don't all have to get along just because we share a love for the same sport. Can't we just respectfully disagree or, better yet, not engage at all? It's time to ditch the superficial niceness and own our team pride."
