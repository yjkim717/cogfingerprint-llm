### The Real Madness is in the Waiting

It’s March 2021, and in the world of college basketball, we’re all holding our breath. The air is thick with that familiar, intoxicating blend of hope and pure anxiety. The NCAA Tournament is the promised land, but first, you have to navigate the gauntlet of your own conference.

Right now, my social media feed is a whirlwind of graphics and tweets breaking down the Big 12 seeding scenarios. Baylor, Kansas, West Virginia… the names are familiar, but the math feels new every year. Who gets the coveted double-bye? Who has to play an extra game, draining precious energy before the main event?

I can’t help but smile. This frantic number-crunching, this obsession with every possible outcome, isn’t really about the math. It’s about the stories. It’s about the senior at Kansas who wants one more shot at a title. It’s about the Baylor team that fought through a pandemic pause, wondering if they’d even get this chance. It’s about West Virginia, a team that can look like world-beaters one night and look lost the next, leaving us all wondering which version will show up.

We get so caught up in the brackets and the projections that we forget these are just kids. They’re checking their phones, too, seeing the same scenarios we are. They feel the weight of every possession, knowing a single rebound or a missed free throw could change their entire postseason path.

This is the real pre-tournament drama. It’s not just about who’s in or out; it’s about the winding, uncertain road each team must travel to get there. And honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way.
