"As I strapped on my trusty Garmin Venu in early 2021, I couldn't help but wonder: will it ever get the sleek software upgrades that its successor, the Venu 2, boasts? I'm loving the new watch faces and varied training types on the Venu 2, but my original Venu still gets the job done. Will it be left behind, or can I expect some much-needed TLC? Only time will tell."
