## The Night Alabama Broke My Heart (and Maybe Redefined College Football)

January 11th, 2021. It feels like a lifetime ago, doesn’t it? The world felt… different then. We were still grappling with the pandemic, the news cycle was relentlessly heavy, and for a few hours that evening, the fate of college football rested on the outcome of the National Championship game between Alabama and Ohio State. And honestly? It was a gut punch.

I’m a Buckeye through and through. Born and raised in Columbus, scarlet and gray runs in my blood. My dad, my grandpa, my entire extended family – we bleed Ohio State. We’ve weathered the ups and downs, celebrated the triumphs, and mourned the defeats. We consider it a birthright to be eternally optimistic, even when the odds are stacked against us. That night, we felt… hopeful.

Ohio State had navigated a bizarre, pandemic-shortened season with remarkable resilience. Winning the Big Ten Championship felt like a validation, a statement that even amidst all the chaos, the Buckeyes were still a force to be reckoned with. We’d seen flashes of brilliance from Justin Fields, Garrett Wilson, and Chris Olave. We believed. We *really* believed.

Every missed tackle, every dropped pass, every seemingly insignificant penalty felt like a hammer blow to our collective hope. Alabama, on the other hand, looked… unstoppable. Mac Jones, cool and collected under center, was dissecting the Ohio State defense with surgical precision. DeVonta Smith, playing with an otherworldly grace despite his own visible injuries, was making catches that defied gravity.

And then there was Najee Harris. I have to admit, even as a Buckeye fan, watching Harris run was something else. He wasn't just a running back; he was a force of nature. Powerful, elusive, and with an undeniable will to win. Every carry felt like a declaration. He was a man on a mission.

The score kept climbing, the gap widening. The hope started to drain away, replaced by a quiet resignation. It wasn’t just the losing; it was the *way* we were losing.  We looked… smaller.  Alabama looked bigger, faster, stronger, more determined. It felt like a mismatch, a
