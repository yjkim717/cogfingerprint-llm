>## The Unexpected Lesson From My Pickup Basketball League

Remember that feeling of absolute, unadulterated frustration? That’s been my soundtrack lately, thanks to my recreational basketball league. We’re a ragtag bunch, but a few players consistently grief the fun – hogging the ball, questionable fouls… It's made me think about how even in something meant for joy, you need rules and respect. Kind of like building a Minecraft server, I guess! Gotta protect the good times.
