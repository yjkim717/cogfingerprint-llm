As I watched the Tokyo Olympics unfold in 2021, I couldn't help but think of the underdog spirit. Much like Loki's unpredictable plot twists, the Games were full of surprises. The song 'Pompeii' by Bastille echoed in my mind as I cheered on athletes who defied expectations. Just as Pompeii was frozen in time, the Olympics captured a moment of triumph, a fleeting glimpse of glory before the apocalypse of the next competition.
