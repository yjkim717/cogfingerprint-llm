As I stepped onto the tennis court in the summer of 2021, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between fine-tuning my serve and maintaining my trusty knife. Just as a dull knife can be a hindrance in the kitchen, a poorly maintained racket can be a hindrance on the court. I recalled a fellow player's tip on using a Lansky Sharpening System to keep their hunting knife in top shape. It got me thinking - just as a sharp knife requires regular cleaning and stropping, a tennis player's skills require regular practice and fine-tuning. As I served and volleyed my way through the match, I realized that the discipline of maintaining a sharp knife was not so different from the discipline required to master a perfect serve.
