As I stepped onto the frozen rink in the winter of 2021, I couldn't help but draw a parallel between troubleshooting my gas furnace at home and the struggles our hockey team faced that season. Just like my furnace, model GUX090X35A, that would ignite, run for a few minutes, and then shut down, we would start strong, only to lose momentum mid-game. The issue wasn't with our team's skill or determination, but rather with our inconsistent energy levels. Upon reflection, I realized that just as a faulty ignition system or dirty flame sensor can cause HVAC problems, our lack of a consistent warm-up routine and team communication was hindering our performance. By addressing these issues and adopting a more disciplined approach, we were able to "repair" our game, much like one would repair a gas furnace, and finish the season on a high note.
