### The Detroit Lions and the Coaching Bermuda Triangle

It’s 2021, and as another Lions season unfolds with familiar hope and fresh challenges, I found myself falling down a historical rabbit hole. I started thinking about the men on the sidelines, the ones tasked with one of the toughest jobs in football: leading the Detroit Lions.

The statistic I stumbled upon is both stark and telling. Since the end of World War II, a staggering 23 individuals have held the title of head coach. Out of those 23, only four managed to leave with a winning record. Let that sink in. Four.

But the real kicker, the detail that truly paints the picture of this franchise's unique gravitational pull, is what happened to most of these coaches *after* Detroit. For the majority, their tenure in the Motor City wasn't just a rough patch; it was a career-ender. They simply didn't get another head coaching job in the NFL.

It’s as if the Lions' head coaching role is a professional Bermuda Triangle. Promising careers sail in, get caught in the storm of immense expectations and historical struggles, and simply vanish from the head coaching map. It makes you wonder: is it the coaches, or is there something uniquely challenging about this particular job?

It adds a layer of respect for the men who do take on the challenge. They aren't just trying to win games; they're battling a piece of NFL history. As we watch the current chapter unfold, that history is the silent, weighty backdrop to every play call and every fourth-quarter drive. Here's to hoping the next name on that list can finally change the narrative.
