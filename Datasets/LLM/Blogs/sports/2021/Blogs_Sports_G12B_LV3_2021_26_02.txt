## Saying Goodbye to George, Hoping for Russ

It's hitting me a little harder than I expected. Seeing George Hill traded felt… complicated. As a Thunder fan, especially in 2021 when we're still navigating this rebuild, it's tough to lose anyone with his professionalism and quiet leadership. He was a steady hand, a calming presence, and honestly, a fantastic mentor to our younger guys. 

But then I remember George deserves a shot at something bigger, a real championship run. And that’s a beautiful thing. It also puts a spotlight back on Russell Westbrook. Can Russ, with this new core around him, recapture that leadership spark we all remember? That’s what I’m really hoping for now – a resurgence fueled by experience and a renewed sense of purpose. Here's to George, and to the Thunder's future.
