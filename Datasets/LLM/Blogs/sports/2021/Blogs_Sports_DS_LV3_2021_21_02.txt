That 2021 season was supposed to be my comeback. I’d trained all winter, but on game one, my login for the team’s new stats app failed. A spinning wheel of death—a digital 504 error. I tried everything: different phones, browsers, even the library’s Wi-Fi. Nothing. Stuck on the sidelines, I realized the game wasn’t in some app. It was in the mud, the sweat, the high-fives. Sometimes the best connection isn’t to a server, but to the person next to you.
