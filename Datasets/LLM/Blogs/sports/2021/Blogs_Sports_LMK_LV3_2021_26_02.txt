As I looked back on the Oklahoma City Thunder's rebuild in 2021, I couldn't help but feel a sense of gratitude for George Hill's stint with the team. His professionalism and leadership were invaluable to a young core, especially with Russell Westbrook's departure. Hill's presence helped ease the transition, and his mentorship will have a lasting impact on the players. His legacy extends beyond the court, and the Thunder organization is better for having him.
