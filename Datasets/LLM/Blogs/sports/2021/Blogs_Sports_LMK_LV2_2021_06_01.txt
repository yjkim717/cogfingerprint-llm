The New Orleans Pelicans - a team that's left fans feeling more than a little frustrated. In 2021, they held the worst record in the NBA, and it's hard not to feel a sense of disappointment. With a franchise player like Zion Williamson, you'd expect greatness, but injuries have held him back. Poor management decisions haven't helped, and it feels like wasted opportunities. As a fan, it's tough to watch. The Pelicans have potential, but it's hard to be optimistic when it seems like they're taking steps back. Can they turn things around?
