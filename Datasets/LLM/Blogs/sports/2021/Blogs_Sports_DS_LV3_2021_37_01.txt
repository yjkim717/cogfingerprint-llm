### The Unwritten Chapters of a GM's Legacy

It’s funny how we judge a general manager’s tenure. We look at the trades, the signings, the final standings—the hard, cold data points that form a career résumé. But what about the chapters written by pure, unadulterated luck, or the ones completely erased by a global crisis? When I think about Jeff Gorton’s time with the Rangers, my mind doesn’t just go to the moves he made; it goes to the lottery balls and the lockdowns.

Let’s be honest, 2021 was a year for looking back, stuck at home with only replays and "what-ifs" for company. And you can’t talk about Gorton without talking about that draft lottery luck. Landing Alexis Lafrenière felt like the hockey gods were finally smiling on Broadway after years of frustration. It was a franchise-altering moment that any GM would kill for, a golden ticket handed over in a sealed envelope. That’s the stuff of legacy, right there. It’s the kind of break that can define an era, and it’s entirely out of anyone’s control.

But for every lucky bounce, there’s an unforeseen check. Enter COVID-19. Remember the optimism when that big contract was signed, the one that was supposed to be the final piece of the puzzle? We all looked at the cap hit and thought, "Yeah, that’s manageable." Then the world stopped. The **salary cap** became a hard, flat ceiling, frozen in time while the world’s economy shuddered. Suddenly, those same contracts didn’t look like shrewd investments; they felt like anchors, tying the team’s hands at the worst possible moment. It’s a brutal reminder that a GM isn’t just playing against 31 other teams; they’re playing against fate.

So, how do you evaluate a tenure built on such extremes? On one hand, you have the masterful acquisitions and the lottery-winning grins. On the other, you have a pandemic that reshaped the entire financial landscape of the league, making every pre-2020 decision look different in hindsight. It’s the ultimate "what if." What if the pandemic never happened? What if those lottery balls fell another way?

The truth is, a GM's story isn't just in the moves they make, but in how they navigate the tsunamis of luck and disaster they never saw coming. The final grade for Gorton will always have a giant asterisk, not for lack of skill, but for the sheer unpredictability of the game beyond the ice.
