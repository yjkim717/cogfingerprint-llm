**Remembering That Wild CFB Trivia Tuesday**

It’s crazy to think about how obsessed we all got with trivia back in 2021. Seriously, remember Trivia Tuesday on r/CFB? It felt like a weekly ritual—a little dose of competitive fandom. I specifically recall one particular week where the questions were *brutal*. 

We were deep into the college football season, the SEC was absolutely dominant, and the rankings were shifting constantly. My group chat exploded with frantic guesses and arguments about obscure stats. I even lost a few bragging rights! 

Looking back, it wasn't really about winning. It was about that shared experience – the collective groan when a ridiculously specific question popped up, the triumphant shout when someone nailed it. It was a little reminder that even amidst all the games and the hype, college football was, at its core, a fun, engaging community.  Anyone else have a favorite Trivia Tuesday memory from that year?
