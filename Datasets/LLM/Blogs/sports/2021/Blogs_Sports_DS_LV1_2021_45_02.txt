### The Unwritten Rules of the All-Star Snub

I’ve always been fascinated by the week of the NBA All-Star announcements. It’s a strange time in the basketball world. For a handful of players, it’s a career-defining validation, a dream realized. For the rest of us watching, it’s the official start of the most heated, passionate, and utterly subjective debate of the season: The Snub.

And in 2021, the Western Conference was a snub factory.

Let’s rewind. It’s February 2021. The world is still figuring things out, and the NBA is playing in mostly empty arenas. But on the court, the talent in the West was deafening. You had the usual suspects—LeBron, Steph, Kawhi—locking down those starter spots. That part was easy. It was when you got to the reserve spots, chosen by the coaches, that the real headache began.

I remember staring at my screen, looking at the list of names that made it. Damian Lillard? A lock. Rudy Gobert, anchoring the best team in the league? Absolutely. But then… my eyes kept scanning. Where was Zion?

That’s where the unwritten rules come in. Zion Williamson was a force of nature. He was averaging over 25 points a game on historic efficiency, a human highlight reel bulldozing his way through grown men. The argument for him was pure, visceral spectacle. But the argument against him was the cold, hard calculus of team success. His New Orleans Pelicans were languishing below .500. In the eyes of many coaches, that’s an unofficial disqualifier. It’s the age-old debate: individual brilliance versus team value.

Then there was Devin Booker. My goodness, Devin Booker. Here was a cold-blooded scorer carrying the Phoenix Suns, who were suddenly… good? Really good. He was the engine of a team on the rise, the kind of player who could get you a bucket when the play broke down and the shot clock was dying. He’d been an All-Star before, but this felt like the year he’d cemented his status.

And yet, his name was missing.

The outrage was immediate and, in my opinion, justified. It felt like the system had failed. It felt like reputation and legacy had outweighed current, undeniable production. Booker was the quintessential snub—a player everyone *knew* was an All-Star, except for the official list.

Of course, the universe has a funny way of course-correcting. An injury to Anthony Davis opened up an injury replacement spot. And who do you think got the call? Devin Booker. It was a poetic justice that almost felt scripted. He got his jersey, he got to play in the game, and the record books would forever show he was an All-Star that year.

But it doesn’t erase the initial sting, or the conversation it sparked. That week taught me that the All-Star selection isn’t just about the stats. It’s a messy, imperfect blend of narrative, team record, positional requirements, and plain old reputation. For every player celebrating, there’s a Zion or a pre-injury-replacement Booker, whose omission fuels our debates and reminds us that even at the highest
