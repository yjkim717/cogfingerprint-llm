There’s something special about watching a record fall—it’s like witnessing a quiet moment of history being rewritten. I remember watching Mac Jones in 2021, threading passes with a kind of calm precision that felt almost effortless. And yet, behind that ease was a mountain of expectation.

Colt McCoy and Joe Burrow had set the bar almost impossibly high. Their names were etched into NCAA lore, symbols of excellence in completion percentage and passing efficiency. For years, those numbers felt untouchable—until they weren’t.

What struck me wasn’t just that Mac broke those records; it was how narrowly he did it. A fraction of a point here, a completed pass there. It reminded me that greatness isn’t always about blowing the doors off—sometimes, it’s about inching forward, about persistence paying off in the smallest of margins. In a year where so much felt uncertain, there was something reassuring about that. A reminder that even the tallest barriers are there to be gently, patiently overcome.
