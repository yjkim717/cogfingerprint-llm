The Tokyo Olympics felt like a collective exhale after holding our breath for so long. Watching athletes compete in near-empty arenas was surreal, a stark reminder of the world we were still navigating. Yet, there was something incredibly pure about it. Stripped of the roaring crowds, it was just raw human effort and emotion on display. It reminded me that the heart of sport isn't the spectacle, but the quiet, relentless pursuit of a dream, even in solitude.
