### The Thirsty Garden: Fixing My Raised Bed's Water Woes

I stared at the raised bed, a perfect rectangle of dark soil that should have been a promise of abundance. Instead, it was a source of confusion. When I watered, the liquid would simply pool on the surface for a moment before running off the sides, leaving the roots beneath parched. My garden mix was failing the most basic test: absorption.

The problem, I discovered, wasn't a lack of water, but a failure in my **soil composition**. I had been too heavy-handed with fine, bagged topsoil and peat moss, which had compacted over time into a surprisingly water-repellent slab. It looked rich, but it was dysfunctional.

The solution was a complete overhaul. I emptied the beds and started fresh, creating a new **compost blend** heavy on chunky, well-rotted matter and coarse sand. I mixed in shredded leaves for aeration. The first watering was a revelation—the water disappeared instantly, drinking deep into the bed. The fix wasn't more water; it was building a soil structure that could finally welcome it.

### The Final Whistle

It’s strange, the things that stick with you. For me, it wasn’t the championship win in 2019, but the empty echo of a gym in 2021. After a year of cancelled seasons and solo drills in my driveway, our first game back felt more like a reunion than a competition.

The pre-game jitters were the same, but the stakes felt different. We weren't playing for a trophy anymore; we were playing for the sheer, forgotten joy of it. The sound of squeaking sneakers and a bouncing ball was a symphony we’d almost forgotten. We lost that game, badly. But as we walked off the court, drenched in sweat and laughter, I realized we’d won back something more important. We’d remembered that before it was about winning, it was about this—the simple, collective act of play. Sometimes, you have to lose the game to find the sport again.
