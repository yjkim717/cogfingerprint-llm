"The NBA's Resting Players Policy: A Tale of Unequal Enforcement?"

As I was scrolling through the latest injury reports during the 2021 NBA season, I couldn't help but notice that the Detroit Pistons were sitting out several of their key players - again. This got me thinking, why weren't they facing the same scrutiny, or fines, that other teams had recently received for similar instances of resting players? The NBA has a clear policy in place to discourage tanking and ensure that fans are treated to competitive games. So, what's going on here? Is the Pistons' rebuilding status giving them a free pass? It seems unfair that some teams are being held to a different standard than others. As a fan, it's frustrating to see inconsistent enforcement of the rules. I'd love to hear the league's take on this - are they applying their policy equally across the board, or are some teams getting a bye?
