The AP Poll - a staple of college basketball excitement. As we dove into Week 6 of the 2021 season, I took a closer look at voter consistency, and what I found was fascinating. Jay Tust stood out as the most consistent voter, a true stalwart in the world of college hoops. But what really caught my attention was the diversity of opinions among voters, particularly in the preseason. It was like looking at a mosaic - each piece unique, yet together forming a beautiful picture. The varying ranking styles and perspectives on the top teams showed that there's more to college basketball than just wins and losses. As I analyzed the poll, I realized that the AP Poll is more than just a ranking - it's a reflection of the complexity and nuance of the sport. It's a reminder that even in a fast-paced, ever-changing world, some things remain delightfully unpredictable.
