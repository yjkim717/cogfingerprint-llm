## The Long Season and the Lingering Doubt

It’s late August 2021, and the air already carries that crisp, back-to-school feeling. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about persistence, and oddly enough, it's all tied back to my little carrot patch. I poured so much love and effort into those seedlings this spring, and the foliage? Absolutely *thriving*. Lush, green, practically begging for attention. But the carrots themselves… they’re stubbornly small. 

We've had a surprisingly cloudy summer, and I'm starting to wonder if they’re getting enough sunlight. It’s a frustrating feeling, isn’t it? Putting in the work, visualizing success, and then… this. It's a bit like watching a sports team struggle through a season, showing flashes of brilliance but ultimately falling short. 

I'm at that point now where I'm questioning how much more I can realistically expect. Do I keep watering, keep hoping, or is it time to admit defeat and move on? It’s a small garden dilemma, sure, but it echoes a bigger truth about effort and expectation. Sometimes, despite our best intentions, things just don’t pan out the way we planned.
