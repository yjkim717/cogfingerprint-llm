"Redeeming himself after a tough outing against the Raiders, Villanueva bounced back with a stellar pass-blocking performance against the Chiefs in 2021. His improved play earned him a respectable PFF grade, a welcome respite from the criticism he faced earlier. The bounce-back was a testament to Villanueva's grit and adaptability, and a great sign for the team's future prospects."
