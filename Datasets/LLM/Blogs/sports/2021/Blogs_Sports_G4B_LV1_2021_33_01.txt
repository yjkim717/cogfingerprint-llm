**The Year the Rankings Made Absolutely *No* Sense**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2021 was… weird. And not just because of everything else going on in the world. For college football fans, it was a year where the College Football Playoff rankings felt less like a system and more like a suggestion written by a committee who’d clearly had a few too many espressos. 

I remember staring at the AP Poll, and then the CFP rankings, and just… shaking my head. We had undefeated teams languishing outside the top four, while one-loss teams – some from the Group of 5 conferences – were sitting comfortably ahead of undefeated Power Five squads. Seriously, how does that even *work*? 

It felt like the algorithm was prioritizing some intangible quality we couldn’t quite grasp. Was it strength of schedule? Momentum? A general feeling about a team’s “cool factor”?  

Honestly, it threw everything into chaos. Every week felt like a referendum on the rankings.  It was frustrating, yes, but also kind of fascinating. It forced us to step back and realize that the rankings are just one piece of the puzzle.  Ultimately, it was a reminder that in college football, passion and gut feeling still matter just as much as any computer formula.  Anyone else feel like 2021 was a truly unforgettable – and baffling – year for college football?
