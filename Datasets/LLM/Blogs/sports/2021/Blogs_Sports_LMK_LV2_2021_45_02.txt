**Predicting the 2021 Western Conference NBA All-Stars: A Look Back and Ahead**

As we dive into the 2020-2021 NBA season, the excitement is building for the annual NBA All-Star Game. One of the most anticipated events in the basketball calendar, the All-Star Game brings together the best of the best from the Eastern and Western Conferences. As a huge NBA fan, I've been following the stats and performances of top players, and I'm excited to share my predictions for the 2021 Western Conference NBA All-Stars.

Last year's NBA All-Star Game was a thrilling event, with the Western Conference taking home the win. The likes of LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Luka Doncic shone bright, showcasing their incredible skills and cementing their places as top contenders in the Western Conference. So, how have these players performed in the current season, and who are the new faces emerging as potential All-Stars?

Let's take a look at some of the top performers in the Western Conference so far this season. Luka Doncic has continued his impressive form, averaging an astonishing 28.5 points, 9.5 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game. The young Dallas Mavericks star has been almost unstoppable, leading his team to several crucial wins. Damian Lillard has also been on fire, scoring an average of 29.5 points per game, while also dishing out 7.5 assists. The Portland Trail Blazers' ace has been a consistent performer, and his stats make a strong case for his inclusion in the All-Star lineup.

Other players who've caught my eye include Nikola Jokic, who's been dominating the paint with his impressive all-around skills. The Denver Nuggets' big man has been averaging 22.5 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 8.5 assists, making him a near-shoe-in for the All-Star Game. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers' LeBron James continues to defy age, putting up impressive numbers and leading his team with his trademark leadership and tenacity.

As I analyze the stats and performances of these top players, I'm starting to form a picture of what the 2021 Western Conference NBA All-Stars might look like. Alongside the likes of Doncic, Lillard, Jokic, and James, I predict that players like Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, and Brandon Ingram will also make the cut. George has been in top form with the Los Angeles Clippers, while Leonard's been quietly impressive, leading the Clippers to several key wins. Ingram, meanwhile, has been a revelation for the New Orleans Pelicans, averaging 23.5 points and 5.5 rebounds per game.

As the season continues to unfold, it's clear that the Western Conference is stacked with talent. The competition for All-Star spots is fierce, and it will be fascinating to see how the players respond to the pressure. One thing's for sure â€“ the 2021 NBA All-Star Game is shaping up to be an unforgettable event.

In the end, predicting the All-Stars is all about balancing past performance with current form. While last year's lineup provides a useful starting point, this season's stats and performances will ultimately determine who makes the cut. As we head into the final stretch, I'll be keeping a close eye on the Western Conference's top players, eager to see who will shine brightest on the All-Star stage.
