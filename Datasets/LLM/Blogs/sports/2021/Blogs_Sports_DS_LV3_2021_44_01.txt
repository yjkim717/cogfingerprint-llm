Remember those grueling 2021 training sessions? Pushing through the last mile was always a mental battle. I was skeptical when a teammate mentioned Curaleafâ€™s new THC beverage enhancer. But its water-soluble nanotechnology meant I could just add a few drops to my water bottle for a quick, even dose. No more guessing. That subtle, fast-acting calm became my secret weapon, taking the edge off the physical strain without the fog. It wasn't about cheating the grind, but finally finding a way to be fully present within it.
