**The Unlikely Underdog: How Sports Teaches Us to Reevaluate Our Assumptions**

As I sat in front of the TV in the summer of 2021, watching the Tokyo Olympics unfold, I couldn't help but be reminded of the ongoing debate in the space industry about NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) and its commercial counterparts. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that the world of sports has a lot to teach us about reevaluating our assumptions - a lesson that can be applied to the SLS discussion.

The Olympics showcased incredible stories of perseverance and grit, like the ones of athletes who defied the odds to reach the world's biggest stage. One such athlete was Simone Biles, the gymnastics superstar who withdrew from several events due to mental health concerns. Her decision sparked a heated conversation about the pressure athletes face and the importance of prioritizing well-being.

As I watched the Olympics, I started thinking about the parallels between the sports world and the space industry. Just as some athletes and teams are often overlooked in favor of more established favorites, NASA's SLS has faced criticism for being costly and limited in its capabilities compared to more agile commercial alternatives like SpaceX's Starship.

The Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the lunar surface by 2024, has been a major driver for the development of SLS. However, with the rapid advancements being made in commercial space, one can't help but wonder if SLS is the most effective way to achieve this goal. Just as the Olympics often feature underdog stories, perhaps it's time to reevaluate our assumptions about the role of SLS in the Artemis program.

The sports world has a way of keeping us on our toes, and the Olympics are no exception. As we watch athletes push themselves to new heights, we're reminded that there's often more than one way to achieve greatness. Similarly, in the space industry, it's worth considering whether a more commercial approach might be the underdog that ultimately helps us reach new frontiers.

As the Olympics came to a close, I was left with a renewed sense of appreciation for the power of sports to inspire and challenge our assumptions. Whether it's Simone Biles redefining what it means to be a champion or Starship pushing the boundaries of what's possible in space, there's no denying that the underdogs can sometimes surprise us with their talent and determination.
