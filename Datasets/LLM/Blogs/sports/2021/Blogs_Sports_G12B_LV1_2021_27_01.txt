>## The Coaching Carousel Keeps Spinning

It's been a wild few years for college football coaching, hasn't it? You blink, and suddenly someone's jumped ship, taken a new role, or completely switched conferences. This past week brought another ripple through Texas, and it got me thinking about the relentless nature of the game.

News broke that Kenny Perry, a name familiar to many in the Lone Star State, was heading to Texas Tech as their new defensive coordinator. Perry’s resume is fascinating – a climb from high school coaching, a successful run at TCU, a detour through Kansas, and even a stint in the XFL. That’s a diverse path, showing adaptability and a willingness to learn. 

It makes you wonder about the pressure these coaches are under. The constant scrutiny, the expectation of immediate results… it’s a pressure cooker. And for Perry, moving to Texas Tech, he's got a challenge ahead. Can he bring that TCU success to Lubbock? Only time will tell, but it’s another exciting chapter in the ever-evolving story of Texas college football.
