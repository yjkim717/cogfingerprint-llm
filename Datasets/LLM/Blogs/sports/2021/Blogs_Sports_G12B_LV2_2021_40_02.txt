## The Week the NBA Felt… Different. And Maybe That’s Okay.

Okay, let's be honest. Watching the NBA in December 2021 felt…weird. Not in a bad way, necessarily, but just…different. We were deep into the season, teams were battling for playoff positioning, and yet, every game felt like a potential landmine of roster uncertainty. Week 10, in particular, stands out in my memory.

It wasn't the high-scoring games, though there were certainly some of those. It wasn’t the dramatic finishes, although we had a few nail-biters. It was the *feeling* behind the games, the underlying current of disruption that just wouldn’t go away. COVID-19 protocols were back with a vengeance, and the ripple effects were shaking up teams in ways we hadn’t quite seen to this extent earlier in the season.

I remember scrolling through the injury reports, which had become longer and more complicated than ever. "Out due to health and safety protocols" seemed to be the new default explanation. It wasn’t just the star players either. It was role players, bench warmers, guys you'd barely notice unless you were a die-hard fan meticulously tracking every minute detail. And *that* was the thing that really struck me.

Suddenly, the league felt less about the established hierarchy, the predictable narratives, and more about…opportunity. The opportunity for guys who usually sat on the sidelines to prove themselves. The opportunity for teams to discover hidden gems. The opportunity, frankly, for things to get a little delightfully chaotic.

And we *did* see that chaos unfold. I was watching a game – I think it was the Lakers playing the Celtics, though my memory is a bit fuzzy thanks to the sheer volume of games I was trying to keep up with – and this guy, DeJon Watson, who'd just signed a ten-day contract, was *balling*. Seriously. He was hitting shots, making smart passes, and playing with a quiet confidence that seemed to surprise everyone, including, I suspect, himself.

He wasn't going to be an All-Star, let's be real. But in that moment, in that game, he was *impactful*. And that’s what made it so captivating. It was a reminder that in the NBA, and in life, sometimes the most unexpected people step up when you least expect it. These ten-day contracts, which often feel like a footnote in the larger NBA story, suddenly felt incredibly important. They were lifelines, chances to show what you could do, a shot at making a lasting impression.

It also made me think about the players who *weren’t* getting those chances. The guys stuck in the G League, grinding away, waiting for their opportunity to shine. The guys
