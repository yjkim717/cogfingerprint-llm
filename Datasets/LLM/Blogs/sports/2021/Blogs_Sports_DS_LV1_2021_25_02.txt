**That Eerie Feeling on the Court**

It was the summer of 2021, and I was having a classic post-match debrief with my doubles partner. We were lamenting the worn-out surface of our local court, joking about the specific type of acrylic resurfacing it desperately needed. It was pure, off-the-cuff tennis shop-talk.

Later that evening, while scrolling through my phone, an ad stopped me cold. It was for that exact type of acrylic court resurfacing product. My blood ran a little cold. I hadn’t googled it. I hadn’t searched for court maintenance, ever.

The coincidence felt too perfect. Had my phone been listening? It’s a modern sports mystery that has nothing to do with backhands or footwork, but everything to do with the world we play in now. It made me realize how our conversations, even the ones we have while tying our shoelaces on the sideline, might not be as private as we think. It’s a strangely unsettling feeling, a new kind of unforced error in the game of daily life.
