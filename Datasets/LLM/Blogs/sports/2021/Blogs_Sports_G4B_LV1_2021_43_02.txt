**Lost in Middle-earth (and My Own Memories)**

Okay, so I just re-watched the *Lord of the Rings* movies – like, *really* watched them – after years of just casually enjoying them. And honestly? I felt completely bewildered. It’s weird, right? Like, I’d devoured the books as a kid, but something got lost in translation between page and screen.  It made me think about how we all have these hazy, incomplete memories of things we loved – a feeling I definitely experienced during the 2021 playoffs!
