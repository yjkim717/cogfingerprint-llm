**The Price of Hope (and a Playoff Run?)**

Anyone else feeling a little conflicted about this whole “raise the prices when you’re good” strategy? I was reading about how some teams are thinking of bumping up ticket costs after a solid playoff run – and honestly, it got me thinking. Does a surge in revenue *really* come from celebrating success, or is it just fans willing to pay more to be there? 

Our local team had a fantastic 2021, but the luxury tax talk always feels a bit…calculated, doesn’t it?  It’s a tough balance, wanting to reward fans and build a winning team.
