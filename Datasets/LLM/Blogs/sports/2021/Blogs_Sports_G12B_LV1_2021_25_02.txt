## The Algorithm Knows My Forehand Woes?

Okay, this has been rattling around in my head all week, and I need to get it out there. It’s probably nothing, a classic case of confirmation bias, but… it’s weird.

So, I've been trying to improve my backhand slice. Seriously, *trying*. I spent a solid hour last Tuesday dissecting Federer’s technique on YouTube, muttering about wrist angles and court surface impact. My wife just rolled her eyes and went back to reading.

Then, yesterday, boom. An ad pops up on my Instagram feed. Not just *any* ad. It’s for a specialized tennis coaching program focusing on… you guessed it… the backhand slice. And it specifically mentioned the importance of a clay court for developing the technique. Clay court! I hadn't even mentioned clay courts!

I know, I know. Algorithms are clever. But the timing felt… unsettling. It’s 2021, and the whole data tracking thing feels intensely personal sometimes. Was it a coincidence? Or did my mumbled YouTube analysis somehow end up contributing to my targeted ad experience? I’m officially spooked, and now I’m double-checking my privacy settings. Anyone else experiencing this level of personalized creepiness?
