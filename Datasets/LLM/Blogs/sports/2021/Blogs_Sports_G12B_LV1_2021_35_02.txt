## The Ghosts of Hayward Field and the Burn in Your Lungs

It’s late October 2021, and the air here in Oregon is that crisp, almost painful kind of cold that makes you want to wrap yourself in a blanket and never leave. But, of course, when you're a runner, blankets just aren’t an option. Especially when you're chasing ghosts. 

I've been thinking a lot about Steve Prefontaine lately. Not just because the new Hayward Field is finally *really* open and spectacular (seriously, it's a track lover’s dream), but because I’ve been wrestling with a stubborn plateau in my training. I need something… different. Something to really shake things up.

My coach suggested something a bit… old school. "Try Pre's 200s," he said with a knowing grin. 

Now, for those unfamiliar, Pre's 200s are legendary. Developed by the brilliant, eccentric Bill Bowerman, and then practically weaponized by Prefontaine himself, it's a brutal interval workout consisting of 200-meter repeats, run at near-maximum effort with short recovery jogs in between. The number of repeats? That’s where the “Pre’s” comes in – usually around 20-24, depending on how you're feeling.

Let me tell you, it’s not pretty. It's a controlled burn in your lungs, a screaming in your legs, and a mental battle you didn't even know you were signing up for. I did my first set last week. I remember feeling strong through the first few, fueled by the thought of Prefontaine, pushing himself relentlessly on those very same tracks. But by repeat number 12, the lactic acid was singing a decidedly unpleasant tune.

It’s humbling, to be honest. It's a stark reminder that even with all the fancy gels and heart rate monitors and data analysis we have now, some things remain timeless. Bowerman's genius wasn't about inventing new technology; it was about understanding the human body and pushing its limits. And Prefontaine? He was the living embodiment of that philosophy.

I still have a long way to go, and I'm sure there will be plenty more agonizing 200s in my future. But there's also a strange sense of connection, of standing on the shoulders of giants, that makes the pain a little more bearable. Maybe, just maybe, chasing these ghosts will help me break through my own wall.
