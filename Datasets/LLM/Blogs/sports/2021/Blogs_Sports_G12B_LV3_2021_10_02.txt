ra Royce O'Neale’s missed potential still stings, doesn't it? Watching the Utah Jazz fall to the Clippers in the 2021 playoffs felt like a punch to the gut. I keep replaying moments, wondering "what if?". Specifically, why didn't we see more of Royce? And let’s be honest, Rudy Gobert’s defensive hesitancy – that reluctance to close out on shooters – was a recurring theme in those Clippers comebacks. It felt like a missed opportunity, a tweak that could have shifted the series. Just another reminder that even incredible talent needs strategic adjustments to truly contend.
