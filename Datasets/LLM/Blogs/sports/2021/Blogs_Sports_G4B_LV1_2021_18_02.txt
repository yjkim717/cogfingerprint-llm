Okay, here’s a blog post inspired by the wedding planning summary, followed by a reflective sports-related piece:

**Blog Post – “Leveling Up Your Marriage: It Starts Before the Dress”**

So, you’re engaged! Huge congrats! Beyond the Pinterest boards and venue scouting, there’s a really important foundation to build – your marriage. We’ve been getting a lot of questions about resources for couples wanting to go deeper than just wedding planning. Think of it like a pre-season study guide. Books on communication, conflict resolution, and even just understanding each other's love languages can make a *massive* difference.  #maritalpreparation #engagement #bookstudy #recommendations

**Reflective Blog Post – 2021**

It was 2021, and I was stuck in a slump with my softball. I’d lost my competitive edge, just hitting ground balls and feeling…off. Then, during a particularly frustrating practice, my coach told me to focus on *process*, not outcome.  Suddenly, it wasn't about the grand slam, but about each swing, each throw.  That simple shift – embracing the small steps – completely flipped my game. It taught me a lot about life, too. #sports #reflection #2021 #personaldevelopment
