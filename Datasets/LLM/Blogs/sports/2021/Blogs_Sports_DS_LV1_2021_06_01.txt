It’s 2021, and as a Pelicans fan, I can’t help but feel a familiar sting of disappointment. We’ve watched promising young talent come through the door, only to see potential derailed by injuries and questionable front-office moves. That "injury-prone" label hangs over us, and our record shows it. It’s a cycle of hope and frustration: you get excited about a new draft pick or a free-agent signing, and then a bad trade or another setback pulls the rug out. We have the pieces, but the puzzle just won't come together. It’s a tough league, and right now, it feels like we’re our own worst enemy.
