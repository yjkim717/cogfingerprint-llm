**The Quiet Architect of a Team**

It’s funny how sometimes the most important roles in a sports team aren’t the flashiest. I was just thinking about Kenny Perry’s move to Texas Tech as their recruiting coordinator – a former high school coach stepping into a behind-the-scenes position. It really got me pondering. 

You don’t see him on the sidelines, making the calls, but he’s the one building the foundation. Like a recruiting coordinator, he’s the quiet architect, carefully selecting the pieces to make a winning team. It reminded me of how much goes into a successful season beyond just the star players.  Seriously, give recruiting coordinators some love! #TexasTech #Coaching #Recruiting
