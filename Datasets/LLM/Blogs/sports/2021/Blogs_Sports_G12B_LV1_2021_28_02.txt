## The Little Things That Matter (and a Near-Disaster)

Okay, so I'm *obsessed* with my vintage leather cycling jacket. Got it last year, and I genuinely feel like a cycling legend when I'm wearing it. But, you know, legends need their gear protected! I nearly had a heart attack last week. I was out on a particularly windy ride, leaning into the handlebars, and felt this *scrape*. Turns out, the buckle on my shoe was relentlessly rubbing against the jacket’s arm. 

It made me realize how much the small details matter. Like those little nylon caps you see sometimes – kind of like what leatherworkers use for protection?  I’m thinking I need to figure out a way to adapt that idea.  Protecting what you love, whether it's a jacket or a dream, is all about those little adjustments, right?
