**The Unlikely Boost: How a Simple Change Revolutionized Pokémon Competitions in 2021**

As a Pokémon enthusiast and competitive battler, I'm still reeling from the impact of a seemingly minor update that shook the meta in 2021. The Technician ability, once a niche feature, suddenly became a game-changer. For those who may not know, Technician is an ability that boosts the power of moves with a base power of 60 or less. However, in 2021, the patch changed the threshold to 70 or less, and boy, did it make a difference!

At first, I was skeptical. How much of an impact could a simple power boost have on the competitive scene? But as I started experimenting with my team, I realized that this change was more significant than I thought. Suddenly, a plethora of Pokémon and moves became viable, and the meta shifted in unexpected ways.

Fully evolved Pokémon like Lucario and Conkeldurr, which were already formidable, became even more deadly with their boosted low-power moves. Lucario's Bullet Punch, in particular, became a force to be reckoned with, dealing massive damage with its newfound power. Other Pokémon, like Hitmonchan and Emolga, also saw a significant damage boost, making them more attractive to competitive battlers.

As I dove deeper into the world of Pokémon battling, I began to appreciate the intricacies of the game and the impact of subtle changes like the Technician ability. It's a reminder that, even in a game that's been around for decades, there's always room for innovation and evolution.

The Technician ability's update was a wake-up call for me, and I'm sure for many other battlers. It showed us that even the smallest changes can have a profound impact on the game, and that sometimes, all it takes is a little boost to bring a Pokémon or a strategy to the forefront.

As I look back on the 2021 competitive season, I'm grateful for the excitement and surprises that the Technician ability's update brought. It's a testament to the dynamic nature of the Pokémon universe, and I'm eager to see what other changes the future holds.
