The year 2021 was a strange one for sports—arenas echoing with silence, then slowly filling with tentative cheers. It reminded me that the soul of the game isn't just in the final score, but in the quiet character development of the athletes themselves. Think of LeBron James, no longer just the explosive phenom but the seasoned leader guiding his team. Or Simone Biles, making the brave choice to prioritize her well-being over competition, teaching us all a lesson in true strength.

It’s like finding a soulmate in the sport you love; the romance isn't in the constant highs, but in navigating the challenges together and growing from them. That season, we didn't just watch athletes perform; we connected with their humanity, their resilience. And in that shared journey, our own love for the game deepened in ways we never expected.
