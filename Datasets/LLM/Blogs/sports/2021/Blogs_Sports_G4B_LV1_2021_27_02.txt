**The Raiders Redemption – A Tackle’s Tale**

Okay, let’s be honest, the Raiders game in September was rough. Really rough. We were getting absolutely dominated, and our right tackle, Villanueva, was a huge part of that. It felt like every pass rush was finding him. 

But something shifted after that. I started noticing a different energy around him during practice. He was relentlessly focused on pass blocking, drilling the technique until it felt ingrained. 

Then, against the Chiefs last week, it was a revelation! Villanueva was a wall. He completely shut down their edge rusher, giving Mahomes *none* of the time he needed. It was a mini-redemption, a reminder that even a tough loss can spark serious improvement.  It’s a good lesson for us all, really – sometimes you need a wake-up call.
