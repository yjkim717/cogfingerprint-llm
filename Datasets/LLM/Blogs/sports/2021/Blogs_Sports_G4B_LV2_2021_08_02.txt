**Still Can’t Believe It**

Okay, folks, I need to just *process* something. Last night was… insane. Watching the Michigan Wolverines absolutely dominate, especially after the Ohio State game and then Iowa too? Seriously, my jaw was on the floor. 2021 was supposed to be a year of rebuilding, but they turned it into a historic run. 

It’s not just the wins, it’s the *way* they won. That grit, that determination – it felt like a tidal wave. As a longtime fan, this is a feeling I’ll never forget.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the impossible actually happens.  Go Blue! #MichiganFootball #BigTenChampions
