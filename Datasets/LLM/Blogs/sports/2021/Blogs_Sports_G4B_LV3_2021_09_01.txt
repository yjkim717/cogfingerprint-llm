**Is the Dream Worth the Price Tag? (And Maybe Starship Knows Best)**

Remember 2021? We were all buzzing about the Artemis program, NASA’s big push to return to the moon. It felt… monumental. But honestly, staring at the projected cost of the Space Launch System – billions and billions – it started to feel a little overwhelming, right? 

I kept thinking about my old high school basketball team. We poured so much into fancy equipment, travel, and coaching – all in the name of winning a championship. But sometimes, you wonder if the investment truly delivered the best results. 

It’s the same feeling I had about SLS.  It’s an incredible feat of engineering, no doubt. But SpaceX’s Starship, with its ambitious vision and talk of drastically lower costs, started to seem like a more sensible route to a sustained lunar presence. 

Maybe it’s just me, but there’s a growing sense that prioritizing efficiency and innovation – like a well-executed play – is just as important as aiming for the stars.  What do you think?
