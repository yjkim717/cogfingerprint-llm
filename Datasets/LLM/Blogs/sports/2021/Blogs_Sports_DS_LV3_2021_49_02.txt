The roar of the crowd is a distant memory in 2021, replaced by the quiet hum of analytics. My sports channel has 42,000 loyal subscribers, a team Iâ€™m proud of. But lately, my videos on niche training techniques hit just 6,000 views. The comments are supportive, yet I can't help but wonder: is this success? Am I still creating content that truly connects, or am I just preaching to a smaller, quieter choir? The game has changed, and so has the scoreboard.
