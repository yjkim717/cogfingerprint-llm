**The Luck of the Draw (and a Little Bit of Trading)**

It’s weird how much people focus on skill and strategy in sports, right? Sure, coaching, player talent, and a solid game plan are *huge*. But let’s be honest, a little bit of luck can absolutely make or break a season. I was thinking about it a lot this past year, watching the New York Rangers, and how much Jeff Gorton’s tenure has been shaped by it.

Seriously, look back at their rise – it wasn't just about building a team from the ground up. The 2017 lottery pick, Lias Andersson, was a gamble, obviously, but the subsequent draft picks and shrewd trades he’s made have landed them some real gems. 

That 2021 trade deadline acquisition of Mika Zibanejad? A fantastic move! It’s easy to credit Gorton’s vision, but a lot of it felt like the right timing, the right opportunity presented itself. 

It’s tempting to attribute everything to brilliance, but I think Gorton’s success is a blend of calculated moves *and* recognizing when the universe is handing you a break.  You can’t control the lottery, or the availability of a top player at the deadline, but you *can* be ready to capitalize when those moments arrive.  It’s a humbling reminder that sometimes, a little luck is just as important as a whole lot of skill.

Do you want me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps write a post focused on a different sport or aspect of the topic?
