**The Moment the Signal Died**

It’s funny how a single, frustrating moment can stick with you, right? Last winter, I was playing in a local hockey league – a real mishmash of skill levels, honestly – and we were down by one goal with, like, a minute left. The puck was bouncing around the boards, the tension was palpable, and I had a clear shot. 

I took it. 

But instead of the satisfying *thwack* of the net, just…nothing. The puck dribbled harmlessly wide. It felt like the signal had just died – the connection, the chance, the momentum.  

It wasn't about the goal, of course. It was about that tiny, stinging realization of a missed opportunity.  Like a furnace shutting off unexpectedly, disrupting the whole system. 

That feeling – that brief, sharp disappointment – mirrored a lot of what I felt during the season.  We had our wins, sure, but those missed moments, those times when things didn't quite go as planned? They were just as important in shaping the experience.  It’s a good reminder that sometimes, the pursuit is just as valuable as the outcome, isn’t it?
