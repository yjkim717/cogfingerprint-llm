**The Ghosts of Ford Field: Looking Back at the Lions’ Coaches**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How you can get so invested in a team’s history, especially one with a… let’s be honest, complicated past like the Detroit Lions. Lately, I’ve been diving deep into the archives, specifically looking at all the head coaches who’ve steered the ship since World War II. It’s a surprisingly fascinating rabbit hole.

You start to realize that the current struggles – and believe me, we’ve all felt them – aren’t just about this year’s roster. There’s a lineage here, a series of wins and losses that stretch back decades. Guys like Buddy Parker, with that incredible winning percentage in the 50s, are almost mythical figures. Then you have the more recent coaches – the ones who came so close but never quite broke through.

It's sobering to see the post-Lions record of some of those leaders. A few impressive wins, sure, but a lot of disappointing finishes. It makes you wonder if there's a pattern, a particular style or approach that just hasn’t clicked. 

As we head into 2021, it’s easy to get caught up in the present, but understanding the past – the successes *and* the failures – feels crucial. Maybe by honoring those who came before, we can build a better future for the Lions. What are your favorite Lions coaches from history?
