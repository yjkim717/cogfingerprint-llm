## The Unexpected Lesson from a Losing Season

Remember 2021? The year the Cubs… well, let's just say it wasn't their finest hour. Honestly, watching them struggle felt deflating. But something shifted for me. It wasn’t about the wins and losses anymore. It was about the grit, the resilience of the players, even in defeat. It reminded me that life, like a baseball season, has ups and downs, and showing up, fighting hard, is what truly matters. A surprising lesson from a frustrating year.
