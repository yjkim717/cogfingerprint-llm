Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your request, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone and incorporating the provided keywords/summary. I’ve aimed for a 2021 context and a relatable feel.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: Is This the Future of Football? Watching Mahomes Redefine Greatness**

Man, watching Patrick Mahomes play is just…different, isn't it? I remember back in 2017 when the Chiefs drafted him, there was a buzz, sure, but nobody really expected *this*. Now, here we are in 2021, and he’s already rewriting the record books.

It's not just the highlight-reel throws – though those are incredible, don't get me wrong. It's the sheer volume of production. I was reading something the other day about how he's on pace to break both the all-time passing yards and touchdown pass records within the next few years. Six or seven seasons? Seriously? It feels almost impossible to wrap your head around. 

It makes you think about what we even consider "greatness" in football. We used to look at longevity, at consistent excellence over a decade or more. Mahomes is forcing us to reconsider. He’s showing us that explosive, record-shattering performance *now* can be just as defining.

It’s exciting, a little daunting, and honestly, just plain fun to watch. I'm curious - do you think he'll actually do it? What does his career trajectory mean for the future of the game itself? Let’s chat in the comments!
