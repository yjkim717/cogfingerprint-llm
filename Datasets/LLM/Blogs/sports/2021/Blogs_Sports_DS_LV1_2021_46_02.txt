It’s 2021, and I still dream of that perfect playoff moment: a star quarterback, down by three, launching a sudden-death overtime touchdown. But here’s the twist that haunts me—none of the legends with 300+ career TD passes have ever done it. Not Brady, not Brees, not Rodgers. All those regular-season fireworks, yet in the playoffs' most dramatic scenario, that final pass remains a fantasy. It’s a strange, beautiful reminder that in sports, some scripts—even the ones we write in our heads—are never guaranteed.
