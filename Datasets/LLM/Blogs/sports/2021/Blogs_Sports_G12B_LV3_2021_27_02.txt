## Sometimes, You Just Need to Go Back to What You Know

It’s funny how often in life – and apparently in football too – the answer is simpler than we think. We were all watching the Steelers struggle last week, and that right tackle position was a real point of concern. But then came the Chiefs game, and something shifted. Alejandro Villanueva, who'd been battling at RT, went back to LT – his familiar spot – and the difference was night and day. Zero pressures allowed! 

It got me thinking: how many times have *we* stubbornly stuck to a new path, forcing something that just doesn't feel right, when the comfort of what we already know is staring us in the face? Sometimes, leaning back into your strengths, your experience, is exactly what you need to get back on track. A valuable lesson, both on and off the field, wouldn't you say?
