For years, I religiously leaned out before any bulk, convinced it was the golden rule for muscle growth. The logic was simple: less body fat meant better insulin sensitivity, which supposedly turbocharged gains. But in 2021, I dug into the science and found the foundation was surprisingly shaky. It felt like a fitness myth we’d all accepted without question. Now, I focus more on consistent training and nutrition, not an arbitrary order of operations. Sometimes, the biggest gains come from questioning the “rules” we follow without a second thought.
