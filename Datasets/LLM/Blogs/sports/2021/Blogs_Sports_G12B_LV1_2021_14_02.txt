## The Bracket Dance: Why College Basketball Seeding Still Gets Me

It’s March 2021, and the air is thick with the nervous energy only college basketball can conjure. I’m glued to my phone, refreshing ESPN every five minutes, obsessing over what’s happening in the Big 12. It’s not just about who’s winning or losing, it’s the *way* they're winning or losing. Because seeding for the Big 12 tournament – and ultimately, the NCAA tournament – is a chaotic, beautiful puzzle.

This year felt particularly wild. Baylor was looking dominant, then suddenly… not so much. Texas was surging, West Virginia was grinding out wins, and every single game felt like it held the key to unlocking a completely different bracket. I remember one night, staring at a spreadsheet my friend sent (yes, we went *that* deep), trying to figure out how a Baylor loss to Oklahoma State could potentially vault WVU into a higher seed. 

It’s more than just numbers and algorithms, though. It's about the narratives. The teams that defied expectations, the ones that battled back from early-season struggles – they deserve a little extra consideration, don't they? 

Maybe that’s why I find the whole seeding process so captivating. It's a reminder that even in a world of data and analytics, there's still room for a little bit of unpredictable magic. It's the reason I'll be back next March, spreadsheet in hand, ready to obsess all over again.
