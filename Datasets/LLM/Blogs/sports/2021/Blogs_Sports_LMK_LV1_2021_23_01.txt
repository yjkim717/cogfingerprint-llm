"I was stoked to catch the 2021 NFL season on CBS All Access, but my excitement was short-lived. After shelling out $9.99 for an ad-free experience, I was annoyed to be bombarded with commercials. I thought Paramount's streaming service had my back, but it seemed they were more interested in raking in the ad revenue. Now, I'm stuck watching Big Brother with a side of ads - talk about a buzzkill."
