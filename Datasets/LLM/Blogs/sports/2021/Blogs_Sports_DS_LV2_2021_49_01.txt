**The Art of Knowing When to Let Go**

I was listening to an old wrestling podcast the other day, revisiting the infamous Lex Express arc from '93, and it got me thinking. As a lifelong sports fan, I see this all the time in 2021—the struggle of knowing when a story has run its course.

Whether it's a veteran player hanging on a season too long or a team clinging to a faded rivalry, we've all seen a good thing stretch past its peak. It’s tough to let go, to admit the magic might be gone. But stepping away isn't failure; sometimes, it’s just respect—for the legacy, and for the fans who remember the glory days. It’s a delicate dance between loyalty and knowing when to turn the page.
