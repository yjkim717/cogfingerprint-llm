**The Quiet Thrill of a Trivia Tuesday**

It’s funny how sometimes the smallest, most low-key moments can stick with you. This fall in 2021, I found myself really drawn to something that started as just another Reddit thread: /r/CFB’s weekly Trivia Tuesday. Honestly, I almost scrolled right past it. It seemed…well, a little nerdy. 

But then I saw the post – a recap of last week’s college football chaos, with a quiz designed to test our knowledge. And suddenly, I was hooked. There’s something incredibly satisfying about flexing your football brain, right? 

It wasn't about bragging rights, not really. It was about that shared experience, that little corner of the internet where a bunch of us – strangers, mostly – were passionately arguing about obscure stats and play calls. The “intersession standings” felt oddly important, a silly little leaderboard that brought a bit of friendly competition. 

I realized then that sports, at its heart, is about connection. It's about finding those small communities that understand your obsession, your joy, your frustration. Trivia Tuesday on Reddit wasn't just a quiz; it was a reminder that sometimes, the best moments are found in the quietest corners.
