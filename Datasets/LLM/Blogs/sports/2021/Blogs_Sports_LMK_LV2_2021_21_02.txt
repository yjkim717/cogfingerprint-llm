As I stepped onto the field in 2021, I couldn't help but think of the frustrating 504 errors I'd encountered online. Just like a glitchy third-party app, my game was off - my passes were being intercepted, and my shots were wide of the mark. But I didn't give up. I refocused, just as I would when troubleshooting a login issue on Reddit. And that's when it clicked - sometimes, it's not about the tech, it's about perseverance.
