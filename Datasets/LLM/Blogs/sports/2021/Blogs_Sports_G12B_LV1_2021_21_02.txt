>## That Gut-Wrenching Feeling: Remembering the Braves' Collapse

Man, 2021 baseball was a rollercoaster, wasn't it? As a Braves fan, I’m still processing September. We were *up* by 10 games! Ten! It felt like a guaranteed trip to the World Series. Then, seemingly overnight, the bats went cold, the pitching faltered, and the Phillies clawed their way back. 

That feeling of watching a lead evaporate like that… it’s brutal. You start to believe, you start to plan, and then *bam*. It's a reminder that in sports, nothing is ever truly guaranteed. Even when you're sitting pretty, a comeback is always lurking. It definitely made me appreciate the resilience the Braves showed in the NLCS, even if it didn't end the way we’d hoped.
