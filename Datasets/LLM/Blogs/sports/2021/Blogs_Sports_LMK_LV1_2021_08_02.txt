What a season it's been for the Michigan Wolverines! Winning the Big Ten Championship was the icing on the cake for this talented team. Finishing with a 12-1 record was a testament to their hard work and dedication. The thrilling OSU/Iowa game was a nail-biter, but ultimately, the Wolverines' strong performance propelled them to the top. As the 2021 college football season comes to a close, I'm still beaming with pride - a national ranking is within their grasp, and I couldn't be more excited to see what the future holds for this championship team!
