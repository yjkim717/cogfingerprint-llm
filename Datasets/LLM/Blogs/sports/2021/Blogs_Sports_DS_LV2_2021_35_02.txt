The rain is coming down in sheets, blurring my watch face as I hit “lap” for the sixth time. My lungs burn, my legs feel like lead, and a single, stubborn thought loops in my mind: *Why am I doing this?*

It’s 2021, and the world feels heavy. The collective pause of the last year left many of us searching for anchors, for something tangible to hold onto. For me, that anchor has been a brutal, beautiful workout called Pre’s 200s.

The legend goes that the iconic runner Steve Prefontaine, under coach Bill Bowerman, would run a set of fast 200-meter repeats with brutally short recovery jogs. It’s a staple of advanced running, designed to build a unique kind of strength and pain tolerance. But for me, it’s become more than an interval session.

As I push through the eighth rep, the discomfort is a stark, honest reality. There’s no hiding from the pace, no faking the effort. In a time when so much feels uncertain and out of our control, this struggle is entirely my own. It’s a private conversation between my will and my body. Each surge forward is a small rebellion against the inertia that 2021 sometimes threatens to impose.

Finishing the final sprint, I slow to a walk, hands on my knees, the rain now a cool relief. The exhaustion is profound, but so is the clarity. This workout, born decades ago, connects me to a lineage of runners who also sought their limits. It reminds me that progress isn't always comfortable, but showing up for the hard things—on the track or off—is where we find out what we’re made of. And right now, that feels like everything.
