There’s something special about gameday, isn’t there? Back in 2021, I remember settling in for that Saints vs. Jets Week 14 clash. The broadcast was queued up, but the real magic was happening on our Discord server. Friends, scattered across different states, were all tuned in together—sharing reactions, groaning at penalties, celebrating big plays as if we were in the same room. It was more than just football; it was a shared experience, a digital living room where our passion for the game bridged the miles. In a season full of uncertainty, that connection felt like a win all on its own.
