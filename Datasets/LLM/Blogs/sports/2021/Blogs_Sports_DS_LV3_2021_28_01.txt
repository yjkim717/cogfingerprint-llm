It’s 2021, and as a lifelong Lions fan, I’ve been thinking a lot about hope and history. The numbers are stark: since World War II, only four of our 19 head coaches have left with a winning record. Just *one* since 1972. Let that sink in.

It’s more than just a statistic; it’s the story of my Sundays. It’s the weight of expectation that feels heavier with each new coaching hire. We aren’t just cheering for wins; we’re searching for someone who can finally rewrite a legacy defined by near-misses and rebuilding years.

Yet, here we are, still faithful. Because maybe, just maybe, the next leader will be the one to prove that our loyalty isn’t misplaced. That’s the quiet, stubborn hope that keeps Detroit believing.
