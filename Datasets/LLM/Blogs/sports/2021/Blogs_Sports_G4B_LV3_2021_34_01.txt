**The Year the Yardage Was Lost**

2021 in college football felt… uneven, didn’t it? I was glued to the screens, watching quarterbacks – names like [mention a specific QB if possible, e.g., Spencer Rattley] – putting up incredible numbers one week, then disappearing the next due to injury. It really highlighted how much playing time matters. You could see the yards per attempt fluctuate wildly, a direct reflection of a team’s luck and a quarterback’s opportunity.  It wasn’t just about raw talent; it was about staying healthy and getting the chance to shine. A frustrating, fascinating season, to say the least.
