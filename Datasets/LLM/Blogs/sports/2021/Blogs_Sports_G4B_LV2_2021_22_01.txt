**Remembering the Mud & the Magic**

It’s funny how certain moments stick with you, right? 2021 felt… messy. Football season was a rollercoaster, and honestly, I spent more time covered in mud than celebrating wins. But there was this one game – a late-season rivalry – where our team was down by a ton. We rallied, a ridiculous flying disc catch sealed the deal, and the whole field erupted. Pure, unadulterated joy. It wasn't about the score; it was about the grit, the shared experience.  Those are the memories that truly matter.
