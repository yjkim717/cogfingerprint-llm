**OneDrive Woes & Lingering Ghosts**

It’s a frustrating feeling, isn’t it? Like a digital shadow clinging to you. I was battling OneDrive this week – trying to completely remove it from a personal device after a former employer closed their account.  The login prompts kept popping up, a constant reminder of a job I’d moved on from. It felt like trying to scrub away a memory.  Sometimes, you can’t just delete the connection; you have to acknowledge it, let it fade, and finally, truly sever the link.  Anyone else dealt with this kind of digital baggage?

**2021 – The Year of Almost**

2021 felt like a year of "almost." My local rugby team came so close to winning the championship, pushing us to overtime in the final. We had the momentum, the skill, *almost* everything. But a single missed tackle, a crucial penalty – it all fell apart.  It was a brutal lesson in resilience.  You can train, you can strategize, but sometimes, luck plays a part.  More importantly, it taught me that the sting of defeat is far more valuable than the sweetness of victory.
