It was a crisp autumn afternoon in 2021, and I’d just wrapped up a grueling tennis match with my friend Mark. As we packed our gear, we got to chatting about the worn-out court surface—how the cracks were starting to affect our game, and maybe it was time to look into resurfacing. I hadn’t given it another thought until later that evening.

Scrolling through my phone, an ad for professional court maintenance services popped up. My heart skipped a beat. I hadn’t searched for anything like that—not a single click or query. It felt like my phone had been eavesdropping from my pocket, right there on the sidelines.

It got me thinking: in a world where our devices seem to know us better than we know ourselves, where’s the line between convenience and intrusion? That moment on the court was just about sport, about the simple joy of the game. But technology turned it into a marketing opportunity, leaving me wondering if any part of our lives is truly private anymore.
