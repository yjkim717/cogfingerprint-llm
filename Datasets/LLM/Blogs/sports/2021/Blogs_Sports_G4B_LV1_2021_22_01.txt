**A Monstrous Mouth for October**

Okay, so my Halloween plans are getting seriously ambitious. I’m tackling my garage door – transforming it into a gaping, monstrous mouth! The idea hit me last week: a huge, black fabric ‘tongue’ hanging down, maybe with some strategically placed, glow-in-the-dark discs to look like teeth.  It’s going to be ridiculously cheap to do with some salvaged black fabric and a bit of ingenuity. Seriously considering a whole lot of spooky vibes for next month. Wish me luck!

**The Shot I Almost Didn't Take**

It was the last game of senior year basketball, and we were down by one with five seconds left. I’d been hesitant all season, playing it safe, letting others take the big shots. But Coach gave me the nod – “Just shoot,” he said.  My legs were shaking, the crowd was roaring, and I took the shot. It rimmed out.  Honestly, I wanted to disappear.  But looking back, it wasn't about making *that* shot. It was about finally trusting myself.
