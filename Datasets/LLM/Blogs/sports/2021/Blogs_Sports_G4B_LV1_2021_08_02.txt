**Still Can’t Believe It**

Okay, seriously, I’m still buzzing. November 2021 – I watched the Michigan Wolverines absolutely *dominate* Iowa. It felt… surreal. For so long, that series had been a painful reminder, a streak that just felt impossible to overcome. To finally see them break through, to witness that raw emotion on the field, was incredible. 

I mean, beating Iowa was huge, but then Georgia? It felt like a dream. A glorious, improbable dream. As a lifelong fan, I’ve seen plenty of heartbreak. This victory felt different. It wasn’t just a win; it was a release. A validation.  Go Blue!
