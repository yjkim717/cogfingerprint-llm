## The Lingering Echo of a Team

It's strange, isn’t it, how certain memories cling to you? Like the scent of freshly cut grass and the roar of a crowd. This year, 2021, I’ve been thinking a lot about my old high school basketball team. We weren’t champions, not even close. But those practices, those bus rides, the shared victories and crushing defeats… they’re all still vivid.

Recently, I was clearing out old files – a digital declutter, if you will – and stumbled across photos from those years. It felt a bit like trying to delete an old work account from OneDrive; you want to move on, but traces remain. It’s a reminder that even when chapters close, the people and experiences shape who we become. And sometimes, that’s a pretty good thing.
