## Did We *Really* See This Coming? Remembering the 2021 College Football Chaos

Man, 2021 college football. Just thinking about it still gives me a little shiver, a mix of excitement and that bewildered feeling you get when reality just… doesn't match expectations. Remember that Week 9 /r/CFB poll? It feels like a lifetime ago, but it's etched in my memory as a moment when the sport felt truly, wonderfully unpredictable.

For years, college football felt like a fairly predictable cycle. The SEC and Big Ten titans duked it out, occasionally with a Pac-12 or Big 12 contender throwing a wrench in the works. But 2021? 2021 was different. It was a year of upsets, of teams rising and falling with dizzying speed, and of a whole lot of questioning the very foundations of the College Football Playoff selection committee.

That Week 9 poll, specifically, felt like a snapshot of that chaos. Georgia, the seemingly unstoppable Bulldogs, were sitting pretty at number one. They were playing good, dominant football, and honestly, most of us expected them to steamroll their way to the championship. Nothing felt *wrong* about Georgia being on top. They were the picture of consistency and power.

But then there was Cincinnati. *Cincinnati*. The Bearcats. 

I distinctly remember scrolling through /r/CFB and doing a double-take. Number two? Cincinnati? Seriously? It was… surreal. It wasn't like they were having a quietly good season. They were *dominating*. And they were doing it with a quiet, almost understated confidence. Quarterback Desmond Ridder was playing his heart out, and their defense was a brick wall. But still, Cincinnati? From the American Athletic Conference? It felt like a fever dream.

And then, right there in third, were the Michigan Wolverines. Jim Harbaugh’s squad had finally seemed to put it together, and they were looking like a legitimate contender. Seeing them in the top three alongside Georgia and Cincinnati felt… right, in a weird way. It validated the idea that maybe, just *maybe*, the traditional power conferences weren't the only forces to be reckoned with.

The conversations that followed that poll were *wild*. The usual debates about strength of schedule, conference quality, and "eye test" arguments exploded. Could Cincinnati really hang with the big boys? Did they deserve a shot at the national championship? The internet was ablaze.

Looking back, it's easy to see how Cincinnati’s run was a pivotal moment for Group of Five programs. They proved that you didn’t *need* to be in the SEC or the Big Ten to compete for the ultimate prize. They forced the sport to take a serious look at its playoff selection process and the inherent biases towards the traditional powerhouses.

Of course, the rest of the season didn’t unfold exactly as that Week 9 poll predicted. Georgia ultimately held strong, and they went on to win the
