**The Chill That Wasn’t Just the Wind**

November 2021. The air in Vermont was biting – a proper, bone-deep cold that made you question all your life choices. I was out for my usual winter run, loving the solitude and the stark beauty of the snow-dusted trees, when I realized something was seriously wrong. Not with my pace, but with my… well, my nether regions.

I'd always struggled with cold sensitivity, but this was different. My usual running shorts and compression socks just weren't cutting it. It felt like a constant, low-level discomfort, distracting me from the rhythm of my feet hitting the trail. I started experimenting – thicker leggings, even layering a pair of boxer briefs underneath – but nothing truly solved it. 

It made me think about how much we focus on performance in sports, but sometimes, the small, uncomfortable details can derail everything. It’s a weird thing to dwell on, I know, but as a runner, you’re intimately aware of your body.  Maybe it’s a sign of needing some serious cold adaptation training!
