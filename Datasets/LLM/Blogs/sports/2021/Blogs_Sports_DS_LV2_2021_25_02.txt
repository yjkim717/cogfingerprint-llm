Of course, here is a reflective blog post based on your summary.

It happened last week. My doubles partner and I were lamenting the sorry state of our local court, its surface cracked and faded. "We really need to look into court maintenance," I sighed, patting the net in frustration.

Later that evening, as I scrolled through my phone, an ad for a local tennis court resurfacing company appeared. My blood ran cold.

Coincidence? It felt too specific. My mind raced back to our conversation. Had my phone been on the court bench, secretly listening? In 2021, this digital eavesdropping is a modern-age anxiety we all share. The line between helpful tech and a privacy invasion feels razor-thin.

Part of me wants to dismiss it as clever algorithms predicting my interests. But the other part, the one that values unrecorded, casual chats, feels a little violated. It’s a strange new opponent in our game—one you can’t see, but whose presence is felt with every unnervingly perfect ad. Makes you think twice about what you say, even on the court.
