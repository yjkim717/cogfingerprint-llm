## That Gut Feeling and the 2021 Playoffs

Remember that sinking feeling during the 2021 NFL playoffs? I had it bad watching the [mention a specific team, e.g., Buccaneers] game. Something just *felt* off, even before the turnovers started piling up. It’s funny how sports can tap into that intuition, that deeper sense of knowing. We analyze stats, watch film, but sometimes it's that gut feeling that really sticks with you. Did anyone else experience that during that wild playoff run? It's a reminder that sports are more than just numbers – they're emotion, anticipation, and a little bit of magic.
