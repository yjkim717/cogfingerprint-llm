There’s something about the Raptors’ resilience that hits home for me. Even with Siakam sidelined, they’re scrapping for that last play-in spot. Coming back to Toronto, to that familiar court and roaring crowd—it feels like a turning point. In a season full of hurdles, maybe home is the edge they need to defy the odds. It’s a reminder that sometimes, just showing up strong is half the battle.
