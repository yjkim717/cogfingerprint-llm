**The Mitchell Dilemma: When Greatness Feels Like a Gamble**

Remember 2021? It felt like everyone was obsessed with Donovan Mitchell. And honestly, it wasn’t hard to see why. The guy was *electric*. A blur of impossible drives, gravity-defying shots, and pure, unadulterated excitement. But watching him, especially in those high-pressure moments – game on the line, a quick three needed – I started noticing something a little unsettling. 

He’d force shots. Really *force* them. Beautiful, athletic shots, sure, but often low percentage ones. It felt like he was trying to carry the whole team, to be the hero every single time. 

I found myself thinking about how much pressure athletes, particularly those with immense talent, face. It's easy to get caught up in the need to deliver, to prove yourself. But sometimes, the most impactful play isn't the flashy, individual brilliance. It’s the trust – trusting your teammates, trusting the system, and letting the game unfold organically. 

Looking back, I realize Mitchell was battling that internally. It’s a constant struggle, isn't it? Balancing individual ambition with team success. It’s a lesson that resonates far beyond the basketball court, a reminder that sometimes, the smartest play is the one that doesn’t always scream for attention.
