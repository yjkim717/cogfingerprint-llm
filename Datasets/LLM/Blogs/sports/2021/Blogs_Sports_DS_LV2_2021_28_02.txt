That first crisp autumn run of 2021, my old leather jacket felt like a second skin. But with every stride, I heard it—a faint *scrape, scrape*. The buckle tongues were slowly etching their signature into the leather with every arm swing. It wasn't a dramatic tear, just a persistent, quiet damage from the motion I loved. It got me thinking about sports; how the smallest, most repetitive friction, the thing you barely notice day-to-day, can be the very thing that wears you down over a long season. It’s the tiny adjustments that preserve your passion.
