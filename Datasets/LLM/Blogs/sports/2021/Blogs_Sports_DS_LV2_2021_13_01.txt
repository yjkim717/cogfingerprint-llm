### The Knock Sensor in All of Us

I’ll never forget the 2021 playoffs. My team was a machine, a symphony of talent destined for the finals. Then, our star point guard went down. Not in a dramatic, season-ending crash, but with a quiet, persistent knee twinge we’d all ignored.

It was our collective "knock sensor" failure.

We’d seen the signs—the slight limp after a hard game, the extra ice packs. But the engine was purring, so why tinker? We dismissed the subtle warnings, assuming sheer will could override a fundamental physical need. The result? A devastating playoff exit. The dealership—or in our case, the front office—was left with a massive rebuild.

That experience taught me that in sports, and in life, the small, preventative maintenance matters most. It’s the extra rest day, the honest physio session, the unglamorous drills. We get so caught up in the roar of the crowd and the pursuit of victory that we ignore the soft, persistent knocks telling us to slow down.

Because a missed update, whether for a car’s engine or an athlete’s body, can lead to a catastrophic and heartbreaking failure. The cost of listening is always less than the price of a total breakdown.
