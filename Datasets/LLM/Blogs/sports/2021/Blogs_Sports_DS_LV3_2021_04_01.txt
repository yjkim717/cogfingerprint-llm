Remember that chaotic 2021 play-in race? As a Raptors fan, I felt every twist. Siakam was balling out, but our ranking was a constant nail-biter. That final push for a spot against Charlotte and Washington was pure stress. But coming back to Toronto, even without a packed arena, just *felt* different. That home court vibe? It was the boost we desperately needed to believe we could still claw our way in.
