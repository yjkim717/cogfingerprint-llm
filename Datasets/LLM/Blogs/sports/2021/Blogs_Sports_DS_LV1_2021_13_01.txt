### The Update I Almost Skipped

It was the championship game, 2021. The score was tied, and I had the ball. I went for my signature crossover, the one I’d practiced a thousand times, but my legs just didn’t respond. It was like my body had a secret memo it never gave me. I stumbled, turned the ball over, and we lost.

Later, my coach pulled me aside. "You looked a step slow all game. Didn't you get the updated playbook I emailed last week? We changed the offensive sets to counter their full-court press."

My heart sank. I’d seen the email but figured my old moves were good enough. I didn't need an "update." That assumption cost us the game.

It reminds me of my buddy’s Kia. His engine failed, but the warranty was denied because he’d missed a crucial knock sensor software update. The dealership had sent notices, but he kept putting it off. By the time the engine started knocking, it was too late. He was penalized for a problem he didn't even know was actively developing, all for skipping a simple, preventative step.

My basketball failure was my own "warranty denial." I failed because I ignored the necessary update, thinking my foundation was solid. It was a brutal lesson in 2021: whether it’s a car’s engine or an athlete’s strategy, staying current isn’t just about improvement—it’s about preventing a total breakdown when the pressure is on. Now, I never skip the "software update," on or off the court.
