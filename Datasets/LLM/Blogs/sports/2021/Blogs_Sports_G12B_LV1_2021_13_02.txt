## The Season That Just Wouldn't Quit (and a Little Bit About Perseverance)

Man, 2021 felt like *that* season. You know, the one where you keep thinking things are getting better, only for them to sputter and die right when you need them most. I'm talking about the Chicago Cubs, of course.

We’d had a rough few years, but there was a flicker of hope early on. A few promising rookies, some decent trades… we felt like we were finally building something. But then… the inconsistency. Games where they’d dominate, followed by baffling collapses. It was like watching a furnace that kept shutting off after just a few minutes of running. You’d get that warm feeling of optimism, then *poof* – cold again.

It reminded me of the frustrating repairs we were dealing with at home that year. Our furnace was acting up – inducer motor, gas valve, the whole shebang. One fix would seem to work, then another problem would pop up. Just when you thought you were out of the woods, *bam*, another issue.  It felt like a constant cycle of troubleshooting and hoping.

The Cubs’ season ultimately ended in disappointment, naturally. But thinking back, it wasn't just about the wins and losses. It was about witnessing that persistent struggle, that resilience in the face of repeated setbacks.  Just like trying to keep a temperamental furnace running through a Chicago winter, sometimes it’s about the fight, the refusal to give up, even when things are clearly not going your way.  And honestly, that's a lesson worth remembering, win or lose.
