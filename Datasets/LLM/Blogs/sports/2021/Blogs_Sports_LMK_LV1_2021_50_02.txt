As I laced up my running shoes in early 2021, I couldn't help but think about my tech struggles. Switching to a MacBook Air with the new M1 chip, I wondered if the base 8GB RAM model could handle my photo editing needs with Affinity Photo. Just like a well-oiled athletic team, I hoped my new laptop and software would work seamlessly together, allowing me to focus on my passion - capturing sports moments through photography.
