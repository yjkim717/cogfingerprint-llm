## The Unexpected Pivot: Remembering 2021's Baseball Season

Remember 2021? It felt like the world was still catching its breath. For me, it was particularly memorable because of the baseball season. After the weirdness of the shortened 2020 year, we were all so excited to be back at the ballpark, cheering on our teams.

But even then, it felt…different. The pace of change *everywhere* was accelerating. Like watching a pitcher throw a fastball you weren't quite ready for. It made you realize how quickly things can shift, how traditions can be disrupted.  It wasn’t just baseball; it was everything.  It was a reminder to adapt, to embrace the unexpected, and maybe, just maybe, appreciate the moment while it lasts. Anyone else feel that vibe?
