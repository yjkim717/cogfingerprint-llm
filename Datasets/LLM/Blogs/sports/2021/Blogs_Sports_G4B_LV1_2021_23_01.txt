**The Price of Watching the Game**

Remember 2021? Streaming everything felt like the only way to catch the games. I shelled out for a premium CBS All Access subscription, specifically for the ad-free experience – I *needed* to focus on the action! But last night, BAM!

Streaming’s great, but these billing inconsistencies are a real buzzkill.
