What a season this has been for the Michigan Wolverines. After years of falling short, finally capturing the Big Ten Championship felt like a dream. Watching our team rally, play with heart, and secure that win was one of the highlights of my year as a fan. Now, as 2021 winds down, we set our sights on Georgia. It’s a daunting challenge, but this team has already given us one of its best seasons in memory. Whatever happens next, I’ll cherish this ride. Go Blue
