"Finding My Flow on the Court"

As I stepped onto the basketball court in the summer of 2021, I couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and nervousness. It had been a while since I'd last played competitively, and I was eager to get back into the swing of things. As I warmed up, I noticed a group of younger players effortlessly executing complex maneuvers - it was humbling, to say the least. I realized that, just like in Age of Empires 2, where mastering new civs and metas requires dedication and practice, improving my game required a similar mindset. I took a deep breath, focused on my footwork, and started to play. With each passing minute, I felt my confidence grow, and my movements become more fluid. It was exhilarating to be back in the zone, and I left the court that day with a renewed sense of purpose - and a few new tricks up my sleeve.
