### The Ghost in the Honolulu Blue

It’s 2021, and as a Lions fan, you learn to look for hope in the strangest places. Lately, my mind has been wandering down a particularly bleak historical path: the legacy of our head coaches.

I stumbled on a stat the other day that hit me like a November wind off the Detroit River. Since World War II, barely a handful of men who’ve led our Lions have finished their tenure here with a winning record. Even more haunting? The ones who left almost never found success elsewhere.

Let that sink in for a second. It’s not just that they struggled *here*; it’s as if the job itself casts a shadow, a curse that follows them out the door. They become defined by their time in Detroit, and not in a good way. It’s the "post-Detroit record" that really stings. It makes you wonder, is it them, or is it… us? Is there something about this organization, this unique pressure cooker of hope and history, that changes a person?

Watching other teams cycle through coaches who get hired, fired, and then re-hired elsewhere feels like watching your exes thrive on social media. You’re happy for them, in a distant, slightly bitter way. But ours? They just seem to fade away.

It’s a sobering reflection, but it also clarifies the mission. The next great coach for the Detroit Lions won’t just be someone who can win games. He’ll have to be the one who finally, definitively, breaks the cycle. The one who proves that success can not only be built here but that it can last. Until then, we wait, and we wonder about the ghost in the Honolulu Blue.
