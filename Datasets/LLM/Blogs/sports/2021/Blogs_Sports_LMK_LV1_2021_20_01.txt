As I watched The Amazing Race reruns during the 2021 NBA lockout, I couldn't help but think about the show's most infamous seasons. Season 9 was often ridiculed for its supposedly "outrageous" cast, but I disagree with the hate. The hippies and frat boys were just trying to have fun, just like the contestants on Season 13. Let's give them credit - they played the game and entertained us, even if they weren't the most likable characters.
