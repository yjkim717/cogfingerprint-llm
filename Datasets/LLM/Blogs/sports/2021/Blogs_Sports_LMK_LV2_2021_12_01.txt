"Resting Players: A Tale of Two Teams"

As I watched the Detroit Pistons sit out their star players in 2021, I couldn't help but think of the recent fines handed out to other NBA teams for similar infractions. The league's policy on resting players is clear: teams are expected to play their best lineup in most games. But it seems like some teams are being held to a different standard.

The Pistons, in the midst of a rebuilding phase, have been accused of "tanking" in the past. Yet, they're not being fined for resting their key players. Meanwhile, other teams were recently slapped with hefty fines for similar infractions. It's hard not to feel like the league is picking and choosing who to penalize. Is it fair to single out certain teams while letting others off the hook? The inconsistency is puzzling, and it's got me wondering: what's the real message the NBA is trying to send?
