Okay, here’s a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a conversational and reflective tone, around 203 words, and set in 2021:

**The Weight of a GM’s Decisions**

It’s funny how quickly a season can shift, isn’t it? I was scrolling through some old hockey news the other day, specifically looking at Jeff Gorton’s time as the New York Rangers’ GM, and it really got me thinking about the incredible pressure those guys are under. 

You read about the “luck” of landing great lottery picks – and there's definitely truth to that, right? – but it feels like a huge oversimplification. Gorton’s tenure was a real tightrope walk, balancing those lucky breaks with some seriously long-term contracts that, looking back, didn’t quite pan out the way they should have. 

As a fan, you get caught up in the excitement of a potential star, the hope of a deep playoff run. But as a GM, you’re not just building a team; you’re building a *future*. You’re making decisions that ripple outwards for years, potentially impacting the entire organization. 

It’s a lonely job, I imagine.  You're constantly second-guessing, analyzing, and trying to anticipate what will work.  It’s a lot more than just scouting reports and trades. It’s about carrying the weight of an entire fanbase’s expectations – and that’s a heavy burden to bear.  It makes you appreciate the players even more, doesn't it?

Would you like me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a specific aspect of the summary?
