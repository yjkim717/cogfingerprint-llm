It’s 2021, and I’m sitting here watching Patrick Mahomes do what he does best—threading impossible passes, turning broken plays into touchdowns, and making the extraordinary look routine. It’s hard not to get swept up in the "what ifs."

What if he stays healthy? What if this blistering pace continues? Analysts are already running the numbers, and the projections are staggering: in just six or seven seasons, Mahomes could rewrite the NFL record books for passing yards and touchdowns. Let that sink in.

It feels like we’re witnessing history in real time—not just highlights, but the steady, relentless climb of a player who’s changing how the game is played. Every Sunday, he adds another layer to his legacy, another reason to believe that the records we once thought untouchable are now within sight.

As fans, we get to be part of this journey. We’ll look back and say, "We saw it happen." And maybe, just maybe, that’s the real magic of sports: watching someone chase greatness, one throw at a time.
