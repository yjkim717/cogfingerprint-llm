The 2021 College Football season was one for the books, and one of the most debated topics was the CFP rankings. As a die-hard fan, I was glued to my screen every Tuesday morning, eagerly awaiting the release of the latest rankings. This year was particularly interesting, with several teams making waves and shaking up the traditional power dynamics.

One of the most striking aspects of the 2021 CFP rankings was the presence of four undefeated Power 5 teams in the top 4 spots. Historically, the committee has been hesitant to rank teams based solely on their win-loss record, often prioritizing strength of schedule and head-to-head matchups. However, this year, they seemed to take a more straightforward approach, rewarding the undefeated teams with top billing.

Cincinnati, for instance, was ranked #2 despite not being in a particularly challenging conference. Their schedule was relatively soft, with most of their opponents coming from the American Athletic Conference. And yet, they were rewarded for their consistency and dominance, ultimately landing a spot in the top 3. This was a significant departure from past years, where teams from smaller conferences were often overlooked in favor of more established powerhouses.

Michigan, on the other hand, was a more traditional choice for the top 4. With a strong schedule and impressive wins against Notre Dame and Ohio State, they were a clear-cut choice for the #1 spot. But what's interesting is that they weren't even the most dominant team in the Big Ten. That distinction belonged to Michigan State, who had a more impressive non-conference schedule and were arguably the more consistent team.

The presence of Georgia and Alabama in the top 4 was also notable, as both teams were undefeated and had impressive resumes. However, it's worth noting that both teams had relatively easy schedules, with Alabama facing a particularly weak non-conference slate. Georgia, on the other hand, had a more challenging SEC schedule, but ultimately came out on top.

As I looked back on the 2021 CFP rankings, I was struck by the committee's willingness to break with tradition. In past years, they might have prioritized teams with more challenging schedules or head-to-head wins against other top teams. But this year, they seemed to focus more on a team's overall body of work, rewarding those who had performed consistently throughout the season.

Of course, not everyone was happy with the committee's decisions. There were plenty of debates and controversies surrounding the rankings, with some arguing that certain teams were over- or under-rated. But as a fan, I appreciated the committee's willingness to shake things up and challenge traditional notions of what makes a top team.

As the season came to a close, it was clear that the 2021 CFP rankings had set the stage for an exciting playoff. With four undefeated teams in the top 4, the stakes were high, and the competition was fierce. In the end, it was Georgia who emerged victorious, claiming the national championship in a thrilling finale.

Looking back, the 2021 CFP rankings were a fascinating case study in how the committee approaches the ranking process. While there were certainly some surprises and controversies along the way, the end result was a thrilling playoff that had fans on the edge of their seats. As we move into the next season, it's clear that the committee will continue to face tough decisions and challenges. But if the 2021 season is any indication, they're up to the
