Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for a reflective, conversational tone and a sports theme, set in 2021. I've focused on a relatable feeling of disappointment and unexpected shifts, drawing a parallel to the initial prompt's theme of unexpected billing increases.  I've included a suggested title and some potential image ideas at the end.

## The Year the Momentum Shifted: Remembering the 2021 Braves

It’s funny how quickly things can change, isn’t it? I’m still processing 2021, honestly. For a while there, it felt like the Atlanta Braves were unstoppable. Remember that incredible run in the summer? We were all convinced – this was *our* year. The energy was electric, the team was clicking, and even my usually stoic dad was wearing Braves gear around the house.

I vividly recall watching games with friends, the collective anticipation building with every home run, every diving catch. We were already planning the World Series parade, mentally decorating our lawns with blue and red. I'd even started looking at Braves championship hats online. 

Then… the shift. The momentum just *vanished*. Suddenly, those winning streaks felt like distant memories. The playoffs were tougher than we anticipated, and the sting of the NLCS loss still lingers.

It’s a harsh reminder that even when things look perfect, even when you're riding high, things can change in an instant. It's not about dwelling on the disappointment, but about recognizing that feeling – that unexpected change of direction. It’s a universal feeling, really. We all experience it, whether it’s in sports, in our careers, or even in our personal lives. 2021 taught me to appreciate the highs, but also to brace for the inevitable shifts, because they *will* come. And sometimes, they’re a bigger surprise than you ever imagined.
