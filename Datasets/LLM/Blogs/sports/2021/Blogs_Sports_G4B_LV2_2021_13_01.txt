**That Annoying Knock – It Made Me Think About My Old Runner**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a small, persistent problem can suddenly feel like a huge deal. Recently, I was dealing with a really frustrating situation with my Kia Sportage – a weird knocking sound, and a dealership refusing to address it because they hadn’t received a recall notification. It just felt…wrong. 

It made me think back to my old Subaru, a little 2012 Impreza that I absolutely *loved*. She had a similar little rattle for the last year of her life, and I stubbornly ignored it, figuring it was just “character.” Then, bam – a major engine issue. 

That Sportage experience was a harsh reminder that sometimes, preventative maintenance really *is* key. It’s easy to put things off, to think “it’ll be fine.” But that little knock? It could have been so much bigger, and way more expensive, if I’d just listened to what my car was trying to tell me.  Anyone else have a story about ignoring a small warning sign?
