"Breaking Down the AP Poll: A Look at Voter Consistency in College Basketball"

As the 2021-2022 college basketball season tips off, the AP poll is once again a hot topic of discussion. But have you ever stopped to think about the voters behind the rankings? I dug into the data from the preseason AP poll to analyze voter consistency and see who's on the same page as the group. It turns out, some voters are more in tune with the overall rankings than others. I ranked voters by their similarity to the group, and the results were fascinating. Some voters stood out as consistently mirroring the overall rankings, while others took a more contrarian approach. It's interesting to see how different voters weigh factors like team performance, strength of schedule, and preseason expectations. By examining voter consistency, we can gain a deeper understanding of the AP poll and the factors that drive its rankings.
