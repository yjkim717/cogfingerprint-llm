As I laced up my running shoes in early 2021, I realized my training had plateaued. I was relying on the same old routes, the same predictable paceâ€”my own single "connection" to fitness. It made me think of tech friends tweaking their home setups, trying to merge Spectrum and Google Fiber for a faster, more reliable link. What if I applied that dual-WAN mindset? I started blending long, steady runs with explosive interval sessions. The result wasn't just better speed; it was a renewed passion, proving that sometimes, two paths are better than one.
