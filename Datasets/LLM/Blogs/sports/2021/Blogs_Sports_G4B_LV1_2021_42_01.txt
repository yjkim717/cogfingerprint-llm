**Remembering the East Division Grind of ‘21**

2021… man, that NHL East division was a battle. I spent a ridiculous amount of time glued to the standings, obsessing over the Buffalo Sabres’ record against those rivals. It wasn’t pretty at times, honestly. Some frustrating losses, some hard-fought wins – it felt like a constant push and pull. 

More than just the points and the record, though, I remember the intensity. That division was hungry, and the Sabres had to earn every single victory. Looking back, it’s a reminder that sports aren’t just about the final score; it's about the grit and determination along the way.
