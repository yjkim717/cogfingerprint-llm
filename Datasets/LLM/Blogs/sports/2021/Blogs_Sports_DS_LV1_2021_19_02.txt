That first gym photo from January 2021 still makes me cringe. I was so focused on the "cut before you bulk" rule, convinced I had to get painfully lean before even thinking about muscle. I spent months in a calorie deficit, feeling weak and watching my strength plummet, all for a six-pack that never really came. Now I realize the real gains were lost in that obsessive chase. Sometimes, the biggest lesson isn't in the plan you follow, but in the dogma you finally let go of.
