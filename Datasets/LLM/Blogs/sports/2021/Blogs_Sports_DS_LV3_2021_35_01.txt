There’s something special about our weekly trail runs—it’s not just the competition or the miles logged, but the moments we capture along the way. In 2021, when so much felt uncertain, our running community started sharing photos from our routes: golden sunrises over muddy trails, candid laughs mid-stride, and that triumphant finish-line feeling.

Each snapshot tells a story—of perseverance, friendship, or quiet reflection. And now, we’ve turned it into a celebration. Every week, we pick standout photos that embody the spirit of our runs. It’s not about who’s fastest; it’s about who helps us see the beauty in the journey. These images remind me why I run—not just for fitness, but for connection. Through a lens or on the trail, we’re all in this together.
