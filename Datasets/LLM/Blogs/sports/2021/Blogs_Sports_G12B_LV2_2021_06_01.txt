## The Weight of "What If?" - Watching the Pelicans Struggle

It’s tough, isn’t it? Watching a team you root for just…underachieve. This year with the Pelicans, I’ve been feeling that a lot. We’ve got Lonzo Ball showing flashes of brilliance, real potential, but it feels like we’re constantly battling injuries and a sense of just *missing* something. 

It’s frustrating because you see the talent. You see the potential for something special. But then you remember the missed calls, the questionable rotations, the constant revolving door of players in and out of the lineup. It’s a classic case of wasted potential, and it leaves you with this lingering "what if?"

Anyone else feeling this? It’s a reminder that in sports, and maybe in life, effort and talent aren’t always enough. Sometimes, you just need a little bit of luck, and a whole lot of smart decisions from the people calling the shots.



Hope this captures the requested tone and style! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
