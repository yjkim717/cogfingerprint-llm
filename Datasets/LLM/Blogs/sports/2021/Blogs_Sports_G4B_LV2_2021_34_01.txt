**The Quiet Numbers That Tell a Story**

Remember 2021? It felt like a year of huge swings and soaring highlights in college football. We were all glued to the box scores, watching the flash of touchdowns and the roar of the crowds. But honestly, I started noticing something else – the yards per attempt. 

Specifically, I was fascinated by the stats for some of the rising stars. Seven quarterbacks, each with their own unique story, and each putting up impressive numbers. It wasn't just about the wins; it was about *how* they were winning. 

I found myself digging deeper, wondering about the injuries that sidelined some of these guys, and how that impacted their efficiency.  It’s amazing how a single number – yards per attempt – can reveal so much about a quarterback's style, their resilience, and the challenges they faced. It made me realize that sometimes, the quietest stats tell the most compelling stories.

Would you like me to tweak this draft, perhaps focusing on a specific quarterback or adding a slightly different angle?
