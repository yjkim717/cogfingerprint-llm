As I laced up my hiking boots in 2021, I couldn't help but think about my trusty leather jacket, worn from countless adventures. But with the buckle tongue constantly scratching the leather, I worried it wouldn't last much longer. I'd seen it happen to fellow outdoor enthusiasts - the unsightly damage that can ruin a great jacket. After some research, I discovered a simple fix: nylon caps and adjustment belts can make all the difference. By taking a few precautions, I can ensure my jacket remains a faithful companion on all my future escapades.
