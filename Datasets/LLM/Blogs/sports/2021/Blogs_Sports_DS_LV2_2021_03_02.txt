The crisp December air at MetLife Stadium carried a familiar mix of hope and anxiety in 2021. As a Saints fan, you learn to embrace the beautiful chaos. There we were, a team defined by resilience, lacing up in our classic colors against the Jets. The kickoff time approached, and with it, that collective deep breath shared by thousands through a screen. It’s more than a game thread; it's a digital campfire where we gather, riding every unpredictable play together. Win or lose, it’s in these shared moments—the groans and the cheers—where fandom truly lives, a testament to sticking with your team through every twist.
