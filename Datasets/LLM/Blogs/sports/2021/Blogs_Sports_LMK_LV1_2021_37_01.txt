"A Shot of Luck: Evaluating Jeff Gorton's Reign with the NY Rangers"

As I sat down to reflect on Jeff Gorton's tenure as the General Manager of the New York Rangers in 2021, I couldn't help but feel that a healthy dose of luck was involved in some of his most pivotal decisions. On the surface, Gorton's track record appears to be a mixed bag, with some bold moves paying off while others have left fans scratching their heads.

One of the most significant factors that contributed to Gorton's successes was the salary cap landscape during his time at the helm. The Rangers were able to make savvy moves, snagging key players while staying under the cap. However, it's debatable how much of this was due to Gorton's masterful planning versus being in the right place at the right time. The NHL's cap landscape can be notoriously volatile, and it's possible that Gorton simply got lucky with the timing of his moves.

Take, for example, the Rangers' draft picks during Gorton's tenure. While some have panned his draft choices as uninspired, others have argued that he showed a keen eye for talent. The truth likely lies somewhere in between. Sure, Gorton made some savvy picks, but he also got a few lucky breaks. Who can forget the emergence of players like Igor Shesterkin, who was drafted in 2014? At the time, it was a relatively low-risk pick, but Shesterkin's development into a top-tier goalie was hardly a guarantee.

As we evaluate Gorton's performance as GM, it's essential to acknowledge the role that luck played in his decision-making. While he's certainly made some shrewd moves, it's also clear that the Rangers benefited from a few fortunate breaks. As the NHL continues to evolve, it's likely that the Rangers will face new challenges under their new leadership. As we look to the future, it's worth considering how much of Gorton's success was due to his own abilities versus the circumstances that surrounded him. One thing's for sure â€“ the Rangers' next GM will have big shoes to fill.
