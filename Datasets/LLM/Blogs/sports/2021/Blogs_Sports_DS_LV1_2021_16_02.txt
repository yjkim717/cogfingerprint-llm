Of all the things I missed during the strange, distanced football season of 2020, I never expected to feel the absence of Trivia Tuesday so keenly. But here we are in 2021, with stadiums slowly filling back up, and its return has been a weekly highlight that’s about so much more than just knowing who coached where in 1987.

Every Tuesday, I’m glued to my screen for five rapid-fire questions. There’s a frantic, beautiful chaos in that first minute—the "speed bonus" is a ruthless but fair mistress. Get it right fast, and you can practically feel yourself climbing the **individual standings**. It’s a solo mission, a test of your own obscure knowledge, but it’s woven into this larger tapestry of community.

Checking the **championship tier** leaderboard afterward is a ritual. It’s not just about my name; it’s about seeing how "my" team is faring against the others. And that’s the other layer that came back this year—the **alternate flair**. Picking a second team to support feels like choosing a side in a friendly civil war, adding a personal stake to games I’d otherwise just watch passively.

In a sport built on roaring crowds and shared energy, this little trivia contest became a quiet, digital campfire for us fans. It’s a reminder that fandom isn't just about the 60 minutes on a Saturday; it's about the stories, the history, and the weird little communities we build around them, one Tuesday at a time.
