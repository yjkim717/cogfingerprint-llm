**Leveling Up: When the Game Changes**

Remember 2021? I was completely obsessed with *Rocket League*, grinding to get to Diamond. I’d mastered the aerial shots, knew the perfect boost timings – I *thought* I was at the top of my game. Then, suddenly, everything shifted. New cars, tweaked mechanics, and a whole new meta emerged. 

It was frustrating, honestly. My strategies that worked just weeks before felt…wrong. I spent a lot of time just *watching* better players, trying to understand what I was missing. It felt like starting over, like going back to level one.
