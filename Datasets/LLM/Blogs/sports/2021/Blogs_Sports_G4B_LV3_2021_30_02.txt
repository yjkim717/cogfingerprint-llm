**The Weight of the Shot – And Why Trusting the System Matters**

Remember watching Donovan Mitchell in 2021? Pure electricity. He could seemingly conjure shots out of thin air, a dazzling display of individual brilliance. But there was something…frustrating. He’d be forcing shots, especially when the pressure mounted, leading to missed opportunities and a dip in the team’s overall performance. 

It made you think, didn’t it? We love to celebrate the stars, the guys who can seemingly single-handedly carry a team. But sometimes, that individual magic can actually *hurt* the collective. 

I realized it mirrored something I was grappling with personally that year – pushing myself too hard, trying to do everything myself instead of leaning on the support system I had.  The Jazz’s coaching staff was essentially pointing this out: Mitchell needed to trust the team system, to become a conductor rather than just a soloist. 

It’s a lesson for all of us, really. Sometimes, the most effective path isn’t about showcasing our own abilities, but about recognizing the power of collaboration and letting the bigger picture guide us.
