It's Trivia Tuesday again, and I'm excited to dive back into the world of College Football (CFB) trivia with my fellow Redditors. As we wrapped up the first few weeks of the 2021 season, our little community came together to test our knowledge and see who's the ultimate CFB buff.

Our intersession standings were a bit of a mixed bag, with some folks holding strong to their top spots while others were still scrambling to climb the ranks. But that's all part of the fun, right? The championship tier is always a closely contested battle, with our top contenders going head-to-head in a series of challenging questions that put their CFB expertise to the test.

As I looked back on our standings, I was struck by the incredible depth of knowledge among our group. From obscure bowl game records to the intricacies of conference realignments, our Redditors brought their A-game to the trivia contest every week. And while some might say it's all just for bragging rights, I think it's really about the camaraderie and shared passion for the sport that makes our little community so special.

As we head into the rest of the 2021 season, I'm looking forward to seeing how the standings shake out and who'll emerge as our ultimate Trivia Tuesday champion. Will it be a newcomer or a seasoned veteran? One thing's for sure: it's going to be a wild ride. So, if you're a CFB fan with a thirst for trivia and a love of competition, come join us â€“ we can't wait to see you on the leaderboard!
