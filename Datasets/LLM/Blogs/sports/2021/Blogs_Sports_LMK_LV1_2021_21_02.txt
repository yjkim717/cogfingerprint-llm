"My morning jog was disrupted when I tried to log into my fitness tracking app, only to be hit with a frustrating 504 error. It was like hitting a roadblock on my usual route. Thankfully, a quick Reddit search revealed others were experiencing the same issue. After some tinkering, I re-authorized the app and was back on track - literally. It was a minor setback, but a great reminder to stay flexible, even on my daily runs in 2021."
