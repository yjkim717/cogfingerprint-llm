"Improving My Byzantine Gameplay: A Deep Dive into Build Orders and Counter Strategies in Age of Empires II"

As I sat in front of my computer in the summer of 2021, diving back into Age of Empires II, I couldn't help but feel a mix of nostalgia and competitiveness. The game, a staple of my childhood, had seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to its anniversary release, and I was eager to test my skills against the online community. Specifically, I was keen on fine-tuning my Byzantine build order.

For the uninitiated, the Byzantines are a unique civilization in Age of Empires II, boasting a distinct set of units and technologies that reward players for adopting a particular playstyle. As a fan of archer play, I was drawn to the Byzantines' ability to produce powerful ranged units, and I had spent countless hours honing my skills with this faction.

My typical build order for the Byzantines involves a fast castle age transition, leveraging the civilization's unique starting advantages to quickly gather resources and produce a robust economy. I focus on producing a mix of archers and skirmishers to counter enemy units, while also investing in technologies that boost my resource gathering and unit production.

However, as I climbed the ranked ladder, I began to encounter opponents who consistently countered my strategy. Their clever use of siege units and heavy cavalry left my archer-heavy army in shambles, and I found myself struggling to adapt.

Determined to improve, I turned to the Age of Empires II community for guidance. I shared my build order on online forums, asking for feedback and suggestions on how to counter my opponents' strategies. The response was overwhelming, with many experienced players offering insightful advice on how to refine my build order and adapt to different opponents.

One of the most valuable takeaways was the importance of flexibility in my build order. By incorporating more versatile units and technologies, I could better respond to changing circumstances on the battlefield. For example, adding a few monks to my army allowed me to counter enemy units with conversion, while investing in siege technologies gave me a much-needed edge against enemy fortifications.

As I continue to refine my Byzantine build order, I'm reminded of the value of community and collaboration in improving at competitive games. By sharing knowledge and strategies, we can all learn from each other and push the boundaries of what's possible in Age of Empires II. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, I encourage you to share your own build orders and strategies â€“ and let's keep the competitive spirit alive!
