## The Unexpected Timeout and Lessons from the Game

It’s funny how life echoes the sports we love, isn't it? I was thinking about that a lot this week, watching the Iowa basketball team struggle with a frustrating series of turnovers. Reminded me of a homeowner I spoke with – a real head-scratcher of a situation. His furnace kept cutting out, just a few minutes into operation. After a couple of replacements – inducer motor, gas valve – and a previous regulator freeze, you’d think it'd be running smoothly, right? 

It felt like watching a team keep making the same mistakes. You fix one thing, then another pops up. Sometimes, you just need a timeout, a reset, to figure out what's *really* going on. It's a good reminder, isn't it? Whether it's a faulty furnace or a tough game, perseverance and a methodical approach can eventually lead to a win. Even if it takes a few tries.
