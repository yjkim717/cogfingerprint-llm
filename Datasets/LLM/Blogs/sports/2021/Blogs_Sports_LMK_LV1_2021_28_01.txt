The Detroit Lions - a team that has seen its fair share of highs and lows over the years. As I sat down to think about their history, one thing that struck me was the revolving door at the head coaching position. Since World War II, they've had a whopping 23 head coaches come and go. That's a lot of change, and not a lot of stability.

As I dug deeper, I was surprised to find that most of these coaches have struggled to achieve a winning record with the team. In fact, a quick glance at the stats reveals that only a handful have managed to finish with a .500 or better record. And if you think that's bad, it's even more striking to consider how few have gone on to succeed elsewhere in the NFL.

One name that did catch my eye was Gary Moeller, who coached the Lions back in the 90s. Moeller's tenure was marked by some promising seasons, but ultimately, he couldn't quite turn the team around. It's a pattern that's repeated time and time again - a new coach comes in with high hopes, but ultimately fails to deliver.

As I reflected on this, I couldn't help but wonder what's behind the Lions' struggles to find a successful head coach. Is it a lack of talent, a flawed organizational culture, or something else entirely? Whatever the reason, it's clear that the team has a long way to go before it becomes a consistent contender in the NFL. As we head into the 2021 season, one thing's for sure - the Lions will be hoping to break the mold and finally find some success on the sidelines.
