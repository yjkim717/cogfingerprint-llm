It’s March 2021, and I’m scrolling through the latest AP Poll for college basketball, just like I have every week this season. But this year, something different caught my eye—a dive into voter consistency. It’s fascinating, really. Most voters fall in line, their rankings a steady drumbeat echoing the collective wisdom. But then there are the outliers, those few who stubbornly stick to their guns, ranking a team far higher or lower than anyone else.

In a way, it reminds me of life. Aren’t we all navigating our own seasons, trying to stay consistent while occasionally being that outlier? It’s the outliers that make things interesting, that challenge the status quo. As this unpredictable season barrels toward March Madness, I find myself rooting for those voters—and teams—who dare to be different. After all, consistency is reliable, but it’s the outliers that often tell the real story.
