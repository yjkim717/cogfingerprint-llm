## The Future of Recovery? I'm Intrigued.

Remember those brutal post-game aches after a weekend soccer tournament in '21? I'm starting to wonder if things are about to change. I recently read about Curaleaf’s Select Squeeze – a THC beverage enhancer using nanotechnology. The idea of faster absorption for quicker recovery is fascinating. While it’s not available everywhere yet, the potential for athletes (and weekend warriors like me!) to bounce back faster is definitely something to keep an eye on. Could this be the future of sports recovery?
