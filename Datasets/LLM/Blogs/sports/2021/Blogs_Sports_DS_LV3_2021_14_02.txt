The final buzzer of the regular season is about to sound, and here in the Big 12, nothing is settled. It’s 2021, and the air is thick with that familiar, electric tension. For two more days, everything is still on the table.

My mind keeps circling the standings—Baylor’s relentless drive, Kansas finding its rhythm at the perfect time, West Virginia’s gritty determination. They’re not just teams; they’re narratives colliding. The fight for those seeds, positions two through seven, feels deeply personal. It’s a reminder that the journey isn’t just about who finishes first, but about every single team scrapping for their place in the story.

It makes me think about my own life’s tournaments—those moments where a single day, a single decision, reshaped everything. There’s a beautiful, terrifying honesty in this sport. The standings don’t lie. For these players and coaches, these final 48 hours are the culmination of a year’s worth of sweat and belief. You can just feel the weight of every possession, and honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way. Let the chaos begin.
