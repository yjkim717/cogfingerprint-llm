>## The Unexpected Bench Time and a Lesson in Patience

It's funny how life, much like a sporting event, throws you curveballs when you least expect them. I'm a huge basketball fan – always have been. This year, 2021, I was really invested in my local team, the Wildcats. We were looking strong, making a serious run for the playoffs. I was religiously watching every game, analyzing every play, feeling every win and loss like it was my own.

Then, disaster struck. A freak ankle injury sidelined our star point guard for what felt like an eternity. The team’s momentum stalled. Suddenly, I found myself feeling… frustrated. I wanted them to win *now*. I was losing patience.

But watching the backup step up, seeing the team rally around each other, I realized something. Success isn’t always about immediate gratification. It's about perseverance, adaptation, and trusting the process. Just like waiting for an injured player to heal, sometimes you have to accept setbacks and believe in the long game. It's a lesson I’m carrying with me, both on and off the court.



Hope this fits the prompt!
