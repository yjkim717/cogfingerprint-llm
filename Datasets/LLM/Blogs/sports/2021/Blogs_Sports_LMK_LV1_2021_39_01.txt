I'm still reeling from our team's disappointing season in 2021. We had high hopes, but it felt like we were playing on barren ground - our usual strategies just weren't taking root. As I reflect on what went wrong, I realize our team's "soil composition" was off. We had a few strong players, but the rest were struggling to get the right "nutrients" to grow. We were "watering" our efforts in the wrong places, too, with too much focus on individual performances rather than teamwork. Now, I'm thinking about how to "compost" our mistakes and create a better "garden mix" for next season. By analyzing our weaknesses and adjusting our approach, I'm confident we can build a stronger team and avoid the same "watering issues" that plagued us this year.
