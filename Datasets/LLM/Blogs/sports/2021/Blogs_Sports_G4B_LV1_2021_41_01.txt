**The Obsession That Keeps Me Up at Night (and Why It’s Awesome)**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 was a *year* for college football. And not just because of the way the season played out, though that certainly helped. It was the *way* I watched it, too. I got completely sucked into this little corner of Reddit called “Trivia Tuesday,” and I’m still trying to figure out how it happened.

Basically, it’s a weekly trivia contest that’s laser-focused on college football. They track the standings, the playoff projections – the whole shebang. But it’s not just about knowing who’s winning; it’s about digging deep into the stats, remembering obscure plays, and really understanding the nuances of the “Premier Tier” teams. 

I’ll admit, I started it as a mindless distraction during lockdown. Now, I find myself obsessively refreshing the Reddit thread, arguing with strangers about defensive formations, and genuinely excited about players I’d never even heard of before. 

There’s something incredibly satisfying about that little “correct” notification popping up. It’s a small win, a tiny burst of knowledge, and a reminder that even amidst everything else, there’s still room for passionate, slightly nerdy, football fandom.  It’s a weird, wonderful obsession, and honestly, I wouldn’t trade it for anything.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or adjusting the length?
