**The Thrill of the Chase: Why CFB Trivia Keeps Us Hooked**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How a simple trivia contest on Reddit can become such a weekly obsession? I’ve been diving into r/CFB’s “Trivia Tuesday” for the past few months, and honestly, it’s more than just a game.  

This year, 2021, with the college football season feeling so unpredictable, it’s been a lifeline for staying connected to the sport.  Seeing those leaderboard standings shift – watching teams climb and fall – it’s like a tiny, digital reflection of the real-world chaos on the field. 

I love that it’s not just about remembering who scored the most touchdowns. It’s about the rankings, the playoff pushes, and the little debates about where teams *should* be. It sparks conversations and reminds you why we love this sport in the first place.  It's a fun, low-pressure way to engage with the season and, let's be honest, feel a little bit smarter about it all.
