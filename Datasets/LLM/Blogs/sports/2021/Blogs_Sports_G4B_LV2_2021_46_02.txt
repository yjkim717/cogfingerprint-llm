**The Strange Quiet of Overtime Touchdowns**

Remember those epic backyard games as kids? The clock ticking down, the desperation, the *thud* of a perfectly thrown ball – and then, BAM, a touchdown! It felt like the whole world held its breath. 

This past season, watching the NFL felt… different. I started noticing how rarely we actually saw overtime touchdown passes. It’s almost bizarre, right? All that strategy, the pressure, and yet, those game-changing throws seemed to happen less and less. 

I kept thinking about those carefree afternoons, where a single, well-placed pass could completely shift the momentum. Maybe the NFL’s evolved, prioritizing field goals and careful playcalling. But a little piece of me misses the raw, exciting chaos of a childhood football field – and those improbable, dramatic overtime touchdowns.
