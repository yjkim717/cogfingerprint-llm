**The 100-View Paradox**

2021 felt… weird for my training. I was hitting the gym consistently, feeling stronger, but my YouTube videos on technique were only averaging around 100 views. It’s funny, right? I’d get a few encouraging comments, a little positive feedback, and still feel this nagging question: is this *really* success? 

I started wondering if my audience was losing interest, or if I was just stubbornly clinging to a number. Maybe true success isn’t about the views, but about the small, genuine connection with someone who’s also striving to get better.
