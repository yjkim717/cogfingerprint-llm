>## The Weight of the Moment: Can Donovan Mitchell Learn to Share the Load?

Okay, NBA fans, let's talk about Donovan Mitchell. We’ve all witnessed the flashes of brilliance, the incredible athleticism, the game-winning shots that send the crowd into a frenzy. He’s a superstar, no doubt. But something’s been nagging at me, and I’m seeing a lot of chatter about it online too – particularly on Reddit lately.

It's about those crucial moments, those overtime battles where the pressure is *really* on. And too often, it feels like Mitchell defaults to "hero ball." A contested jumper, a difficult drive into traffic… sometimes it works, of course, and we celebrate. But more often than not, it feels like a low-percentage shot, a missed opportunity to find a teammate who’s actually open.

Look, I get it. You're a scorer. You’re built to take those big shots. But in 2021, the NBA landscape has shifted. We're seeing teams thrive on ball movement, on finding the *best* shot, not just the *most spectacular* shot. 

It feels like Mitchell could unlock another level of his game if he truly prioritized playmaking. Imagine the Jazz with Mitchell consistently scanning the floor, trusting his teammates like Mike Conley and Royce O’Neale to knock down open looks. It wouldn't diminish his impact; it would amplify it. 

It's a tough adjustment, I know. Letting go of that pressure to be *the guy* every single time. But I think it’s a necessary one if the Utah Jazz want to truly contend. Maybe this is the year we see Mitchell evolve beyond the highlight reel and become a truly complete, championship-caliber player. What do you think?
