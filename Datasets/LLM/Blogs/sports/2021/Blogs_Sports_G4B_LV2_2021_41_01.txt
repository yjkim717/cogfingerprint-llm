**The Unexpected Thrills of Trivia Tuesday (and Why College Football Still Gets Me)**

Okay, let’s be honest. As a sports fan, I spend a *lot* of time obsessing. I pore over stats, I yell at the TV, I probably know more about obscure defensive formations than I should. But sometimes, amidst the spreadsheets and the predictions, I just…feel it. And this fall, with college football in full swing in 2021, I felt it *big time*.

Recently, I stumbled across a Reddit thread – a weekly “Trivia Tuesday” contest – and it sparked something. It wasn’t about picking the perfect team to win; it was about genuinely knowing the game.  The post summarized the results, highlighting the top scorers and announcing which teams had edged closer to playoff rankings. It was a surprisingly satisfying way to engage with the sport.

I’ll admit, I was a little embarrassed at first. I’m not a walking encyclopedia of college football facts. But it made me think about *why* I love this game so much. It’s not just about the wins and losses, though those are certainly exciting. It’s about the history, the tradition, the sheer unpredictability of it all. 

There’s a certain romance to watching a team claw their way back from a deficit, a feeling of rooting for the underdog. And that Trivia Tuesday contest, with those little bursts of “Hey, did you know *that*?” moments, really tapped into that. 

It reminded me that sports, at its core, is a shared experience. We’re all in it together, celebrating the good plays and commiserating over the bad.  It's a collective feeling, a shared passion. And maybe, just maybe, a little bit of trivia knowledge is a fun way to connect with that feeling, even if it’s just on a Tuesday night.
