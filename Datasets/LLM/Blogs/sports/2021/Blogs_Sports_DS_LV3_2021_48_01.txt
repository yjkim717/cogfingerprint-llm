As a lifelong runner, I’d always chased personal bests—until a hip injury in 2021 forced me to stop. At first, it felt like a defeat. But slowing down let me see the sport differently. I noticed the camaraderie among strangers at the park, the quiet rhythm of a recovery jog, the pure joy of movement without a clock. Sometimes, stepping back from competition is what truly helps you fall in love with the game all over again.
