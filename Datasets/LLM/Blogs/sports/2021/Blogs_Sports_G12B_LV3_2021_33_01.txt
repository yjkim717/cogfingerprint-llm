>## When the Numbers Just Don't Add Up: My Head-Scratching CFP Experience of 2021

Okay, college football fans, let's talk. Specifically, let's talk about the 2021 College Football Playoff rankings. I'm still trying to wrap my head around them, and I suspect I'm not alone. We all love the drama of a close season, the nail-biting finishes, the underdog stories. But this year felt… different. It felt *weird*.

I remember watching the rankings roll out each Tuesday night, a mix of excitement and anticipation swirling in my stomach. But as the weeks went on, that excitement started to curdle into confusion. We had multiple undefeated Power 5 teams – Cincinnati, Baylor, and even Utah – all playing incredibly well, dominating their conferences. Yet, they found themselves constantly battling to stay *in* the playoff picture, while teams with a single loss seemed to get preferential treatment.

It felt like the committee was playing a different game than the one we were watching on the field. It's one thing to acknowledge a loss and consider its impact, absolutely. But the way those undefeated squads were consistently penalized, kept just outside the top four… it just didn’t sit right. 

I spent countless hours debating it with friends, scouring forums, and generally losing sleep trying to understand the logic. Was it strength of schedule? Was it “eye test” perception? Honestly, I’m still not entirely sure. And that's the frustrating part.

The 2021 CFP rankings weren’t just a slightly controversial selection; they were a historical anomaly. They forced us to question the very system we’ve come to rely on to determine the best of the best. It made you wonder, what *really* matters to the committee? Is it the wins and losses, or something more intangible?

Looking back, it’s a reminder that even in the world of sports, objectivity can be elusive. And sometimes, even the most meticulously crafted rankings can leave you shaking your head and wondering, “How did *that* happen?”
