### The Mitchell Conundrum: Hero or Hinderance?

Watching Donovan Mitchell this season has been a masterclass in explosive talent. Night after night, he puts up numbers that solidify his place among the league's elite. But as a Jazz fan, there’s a specific, sinking feeling that creeps in during those tight fourth quarters.

It’s the shadow of "hero ball."

You know the scene: the clock ticks down, the defense tightens, and the ball finds its way into Spida’s hands. Then, the offense stalls. The beautiful, whirring system that got us the league's best record suddenly grinds to a halt. Instead of the extra pass or trusting the playmaking of Conley or Bogdanović, we see a forced, contested jumper from 25 feet. The "inefficient chucker" label, unfair as it may be over a full game, suddenly feels all too real in that moment.

It’s frustrating because we’ve seen the alternative. When Donovan leverages his gravity to create for others, this team is virtually unstoppable. His shot selection in the clutch is the final puzzle piece. If he can learn to trust the very system that empowers him, to be the engine and not always the sole finisher, that’s when this team truly becomes a champion. The talent is undeniable; the next step is embracing the collective trust that defines greatness.
