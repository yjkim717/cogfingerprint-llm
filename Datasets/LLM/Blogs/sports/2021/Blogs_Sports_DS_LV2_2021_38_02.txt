Of all the sounds in the world, the one that reliably takes me back isn’t a specific song or a voice, but the low, electric hum of a television on a late December Sunday. It’s the sound of anticipation, of a warm house holding back the winter chill, of my dad in his well-worn armchair. And in 2021, that hum was filled with the particular drama of the NFL’s Week 16, a time when playoff pictures crystallize, and every game feels like a mini-season of its own.

I found myself, as I often did that year, scrolling through the weekly power rankings. There it was, the consolidated table from all the major outlets: a neat, numerical attempt to impose order on the beautiful chaos of the league. My eyes, out of lifelong habit, went straight to the Green Bay Packers, sitting comfortably near the top. It felt right, familiar. But then they drifted down, and I saw the Kansas City Chiefs, not quite as high as they had been, but lurking, a predator waiting in the tall grass.

And just like that, I wasn’t just looking at a table. I was looking at a story. More than that, I was looking at a reflection of the two teams I’ve been my entire life.

You see, I am, in many ways, a Green Bay Packers fan. I don’t mean just in my football allegiance, but in my soul’s constitution. I value consistency, tradition, a methodical build-up. The 2021 Packers were the epitome of that. Under the calm, almost stoic mastery of Aaron Rodgers, they were a machine. They didn’t always blow the doors off, but they were relentlessly efficient. They built their wins play by play, drive by drive. They were the team that did their homework, ate their vegetables, and went to bed on time. You could rely on them. They were the straight-A student who aced the test you forgot was even happening.

This is the part of me that thrives on routine. The part that finds comfort in a well-made plan, in knowing what comes next. It’s the part that pays the bills on time, keeps the car maintained, and has a five-year plan. It’s stable, dependable, and, if I’m being honest, sometimes a little predictable. There’s a deep, profound safety in being the Packers. You know who you are. The world knows who you are. The power rankings confirm it.

But then, there’s the other part. The part that is, unequivocally, a Kansas City Chiefs fan. This is the part that emerged later in life, the part that craves the spectacular, the audacious, the impossible. The 2021 Chiefs, led by the sorcerer Patrick Mahomes, were chaos incarnate. They were a high-wire act without a net. They’d spend three quarters looking confused, making head-scratching errors, and then, in the final ten minutes, they’d remember they were wizards and pull a victory from a hat you were certain was empty. They weren’t just winning; they were performing miracles on a weekly basis. They were the brilliant, chaotic genius in class who never studied but aced the final with a last-second, sleep-deprived burst of inspiration.

This is the part of me that year
