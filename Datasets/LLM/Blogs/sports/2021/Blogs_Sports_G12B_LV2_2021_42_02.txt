## Remember Kenny "The Jet" Smith? Me Neither, Until Yesterday.

It's funny how memories resurface, isn't it? I was watching some old NBA highlights the other day, and suddenly there he was: Kenny "The Jet" Smith, blazing down the court in a Houston Rockets jersey. It instantly took me back to the early 90s. 

I was a kid then, absolutely captivated by the athleticism of the game. Kenny wasn’t always a household name like Hakeem Olajuwon, but he was *electric*. I remember being particularly impressed by his appearances in the All-Star weekend contests – the slam dunk contest and the 3-point contest. He brought an undeniable energy.

And that 1991 season? Wow. The Rockets were a force. Seeing him back on screen reminded me of the pure joy of watching basketball back then. It wasn't about the analytics or the social media hype; it was about the raw talent and the thrill of the game. Anyone else get a nostalgic rush remembering "The Jet?"
