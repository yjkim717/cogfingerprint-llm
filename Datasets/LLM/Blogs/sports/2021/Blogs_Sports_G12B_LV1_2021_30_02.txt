>## The Weight of the Ball: When Heroism Becomes a Hindrance

There's a certain romance to the idea of the clutch hero, isn't there? The player who shoulders the responsibility, the one who rises to the occasion when the game is on the line. We've all seen it – the last-second shot, the driving layup, the seemingly impossible steal. But what happens when that heroic impulse becomes a crutch? What happens when the weight of the ball, quite literally, starts to drag a team down?

Lately, watching Donovan Mitchell with the Jazz has been sparking a lot of these thoughts. He's undeniably talented, a dynamic scorer who can put up points in bunches. But more and more, in those late-game, high-pressure situations, you see a pattern. A relentless drive, a contested fadeaway, a forced shot that just *barely* misses. And you can’t help but wonder: is he truly maximizing his potential, or is he inadvertently hindering his team's chances?

It's a delicate balance, this hero worship. We celebrate the individual brilliance, but basketball, at its core, is a team sport. The Jazz have a roster full of capable players – Royce O’Neale’s defense, Jordan Clarkson’s scoring, even Mike Conley’s veteran savvy. Yet, time and again, the ball seems to end up firmly in Mitchell's grasp, leading to possessions that feel… inefficient. 

It's not about diminishing his scoring ability. It’s about recognizing that true leadership sometimes means trusting your teammates. A quick pass to an open Clarkson, a dish to a cutting O'Neale – those seemingly small decisions can unlock a much higher percentage shot, a more sustainable path to victory. 

Maybe, just maybe, letting go of the ball a little more, embracing the playmaking role, will be the key to unlocking the Jazz’s championship aspirations. It’s a tough lesson for any player to learn, relinquishing control, but it might be the most important one Donovan Mitchell needs to master.
