## Passing the Torch, and a Bittersweet Goodbye

It’s hitting me harder than I expected. Seeing Russell Westbrook traded felt like watching a legend move on, a chapter close in Oklahoma City. There’s a real sadness there, knowing the Thunder are fully committed to a rebuild, a process rarely easy to witness. 

But amidst that feeling, there’s a genuine warmth. George Hill landing with a serious contender? Fantastic. I always admired his professionalism, the quiet steadiness he brought to every team. And beyond that, the stories of his mentorship, his willingness to guide younger players – that’s what really sticks with you. Sometimes, change isn't entirely bad. It just means different stories are beginning.
