As I watched my latest sports analysis video rack up 6-7k views on YouTube, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of disappointment. With 42,000 subscribers on my channel, I had expected more. But as I dug deeper, I realized that engagement was through the roof - comments were pouring in, and viewers were sharing their thoughts. It got me thinking, what truly defines a successful video? Is it the view count, or the conversation it sparks? In the world of sports content, maybe it's not just about the numbers.
