Input: A Reddit user is experiencing a persistent 504 error when accessing third-party apps, despite troubleshooting steps and providing detailed technical information.
Output: There’s something frustrating about hitting a wall, right? Like when you’re finally nailing a new trick on the basketball court, feeling the rhythm, and then – *wham* – a missed shot. It’s a setback, a temporary glitch in the flow. Just like that Reddit user, you keep adjusting, trying different angles, but sometimes you just need to step back and reassess.
