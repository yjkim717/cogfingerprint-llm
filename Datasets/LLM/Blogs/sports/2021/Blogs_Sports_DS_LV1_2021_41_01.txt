### Trivia Tuesday: The Ghosts in the Machine

It’s Tuesday again. For most of the world, that means tackling the weekly grind, but for a certain breed of college football fan, it means one thing: Trivia Tuesday. The email from the league commissioner pings in my inbox, and I click it open with my morning coffee. There they are—the cold, hard stats. The Premier Tier leaders, the teams clinging to the last playoff spots, the handful of “perfect scorers” who, for one more week, have navigated the chaos flawlessly.

It’s October 2021. The stadiums are humming again, packed with students and alumni who spent 2020 watching from their couches. The energy is back, but so is the pressure. Staring at these standings, I’m not just seeing numbers; I’m seeing ghosts.

I remember my own team’s Cinderella run back in my senior year. We weren’t in the “Premier Tier” on paper, but we were perfect scorers in spirit, winning week after week on grit and a little bit of luck. I see a team like that in the standings now—Coastal Carolina, maybe, or a plucky underdog from the Group of Five—and I don’t just see a name. I see the 2 AM bus rides, the smell of deep heat in the locker room, and the specific, gut-wrenching anxiety of knowing your entire season hinges on one fourth-quarter drive.

The blog post will highlight the usual suspects: Alabama, Georgia, Ohio State. Their excellence is a given, a monument to sheer talent and resources. But my eyes are always drawn to the bubble, to the teams fighting for those last playoff spots. That’s where the real drama is. That’s where a single dropped pass or a questionable referee call becomes the story you tell for decades. It’s where legends are forged not from invincibility, but from resilience.

And the perfect scorers? I almost feel sorry for them. There’s a target on your back the moment that zero in the loss column appears. The pressure mounts with every win. Perfection is a brutal, unforgiving goal.

So, as I close the Trivia Tuesday email, the numbers settle in my mind. They’re not just data points for a fantasy league or bragging rights. They’re a snapshot of a thousand different stories playing out on fields across the country. They’re a reminder that behind every ranking, every playoff spot, and every perfect record, there are young men living through the most exhilarating and terrifying autumn of their lives. And for a few moments on a Tuesday morning, we get to watch it all unfold.
