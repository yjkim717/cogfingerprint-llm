## Did I Even *Watch* the Games?

Rewatching the highlights from the 2021 Olympics felt… strange. So many incredible moments, yet I realized I couldn't recall half of them! It’s like reading a favorite book and suddenly questioning if you truly absorbed it the first time around. Did I just passively observe all those victories, or did they really stick? Maybe we all do this – revisit moments and wonder if we *really* experienced them.
