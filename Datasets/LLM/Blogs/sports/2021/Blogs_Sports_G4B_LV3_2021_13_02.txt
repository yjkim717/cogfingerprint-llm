**The Unexpected Pause – Like a Furnace That Won’t Start**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How something so essential – like a reliable furnace keeping you warm – can suddenly just…stop. It’s a frustrating feeling, that little hiccup that throws your whole routine off.  I had a similar feeling during my sophomore year of college basketball. We were on a roll, heading into the regional tournament, feeling confident. Then, in the final pre-game shootaround, my shot just wouldn’t fall. 

It wasn't a dramatic failure, just a persistent pause. Like a furnace struggling with its ignition. I kept trying, analyzing, tweaking my form, but nothing clicked. It felt like a lingering problem from a previous, less-than-stellar practice. 

That pause, that feeling of not being quite *right*, mirrored the furnace issue. It forced me to step back, to really diagnose what was going on, not just react. Sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come not from pushing harder, but from patiently figuring out the root cause.  Just like figuring out if it's the regulator or a forgotten wire.
