"My High School Soccer Comeback Story (2021)"
As I stepped onto the field, memories came flooding back. After a year-long hiatus, I decided to lace up my cleats again for my high school soccer team. It wasn't easy - 2021 was a challenging season. I struggled to regain my endurance, but with every practice, I felt myself getting stronger. The thrill of competition was exhilarating, and I was proud to be back on the pitch, giving it my all alongside my teammates.
