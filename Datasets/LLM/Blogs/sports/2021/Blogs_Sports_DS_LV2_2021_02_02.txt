### The Final Whistle

I stood on the sidelines last weekend, watching my son’s team play their hearts out in the mud. The score was lopsided, and with minutes left on the clock, you could feel the collective hope deflating. It took me right back to those empty stadiums of 2020.

Back then, the silence was the hardest part. Sports without the roar of a crowd felt like a conversation with no one listening. We clung to any game we could stream, not just for the competition, but for a sliver of normalcy.

Now, hearing the parents yell—even the grumpy ones!—and seeing the kids high-five, messy and triumphant, it hit me. We weren’t just waiting for the season to start again. We were waiting for this feeling. The connection. The shared, breathless anticipation of what happens next, together.

The final whistle blew. They lost. But as my mud-caked son jogged over with a wide grin, I realized we’d already won back something much bigger.
