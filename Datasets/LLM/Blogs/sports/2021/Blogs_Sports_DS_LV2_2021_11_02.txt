It’s 2021, and I’m thinking about the voices that shape how I experience sports. Beyond the athletes, it’s personalities like Bill Simmons who feel like part of my weekly routine. His blend of analysis and fan-like passion on his podcast makes the games feel more personal, more human. It’s a reminder that the storytellers—the announcers and journalists—are the ones who often build the community around the sport we all love.
