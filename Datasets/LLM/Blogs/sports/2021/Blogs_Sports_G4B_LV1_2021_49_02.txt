**Is Just a Lot of Views *Really* Success?**

It’s weird, right? I spent most of 2021 obsessing over my little cricket analysis YouTube channel. Subscriber count was climbing – a solid 500 by December – and the video views on my weekend league breakdowns were consistently pushing 10k.  Impressive, I thought. But lately, I’ve been wondering if that’s truly “winning.” 

There’s this creeping feeling of *content fatigue*, you know? Like people are watching, but are they *engaged*?  I’m battling the urge to just churn out more videos, chasing those numbers, when I feel like the quality is slipping.  Maybe success isn’t about the algorithm, but about creating something that genuinely connects.  It’s a humbling thought, especially when you’re staring at those subscriber numbers.
