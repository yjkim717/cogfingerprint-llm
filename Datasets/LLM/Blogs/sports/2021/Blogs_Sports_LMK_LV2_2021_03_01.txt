**Kicking Off Week 3: A Deep Dive into the NFL's Divisional Showdowns**

As we dive into Week 3 of the 2021 NFL season, the excitement is palpable. The initial shock of surprise upsets has worn off, and teams are starting to settle into their rhythms. The divisional matchups are always a treat, and this week is no exception. As a football fan, I'm always eager to share my thoughts on how these matchups will play out. So, grab a snack, get comfortable, and let's dive into my NFL Week 3 predictions.

**A Season of Ups and Downs**

The 2021 season has been a wild ride so far. We've seen top teams stumble and underdogs rise to the challenge. The parity in the NFL is a beautiful thing, keeping us on the edge of our seats from week to week. As we head into Week 3, teams are starting to show their true colors. Some are living up to preseason expectations, while others are rewriting the narrative.

**Divisional Dynamics**

One of the things I love about the NFL is the way divisional matchups can bring out the best (and worst) in teams. When you've got teams that know each other's strengths and weaknesses inside and out, the games become a chess match. Coaches and players are constantly adjusting, trying to outmaneuver their opponents. This week, we've got some intriguing divisional battles that are sure to deliver.

**AFC East: Bills vs. Redskins**

Let's start with the AFC East showdown between the Buffalo Bills and the Washington Football Team (yes, I know they're still figuring out a new name). The Bills are off to a strong start, with Josh Allen leading the charge. Their high-powered offense is giving opposing defenses fits, and I expect them to continue that trend against a WFT team that's struggling to find consistency on both sides of the ball. The Redskins' defense is giving up an average of 400+ yards per game, and I don't see that changing against a Bills offense that's averaging over 30 points per contest. Prediction: Bills by 14.

**AFC North: Steelers vs. Bengals**

The AFC North is always a hotbed of intensity, and this week's matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals is no exception. These two teams have a rich history, and the Bengals are looking to continue their surprising start to the season. However, I believe the Steelers' defense will be too much for them to handle. Pittsburgh's D has been stout, and I expect them to shut down the Bengals' offense. The real question is whether Cincinnati can keep up with the Steelers' offense, which has been looking potent. Prediction: Steelers by 7.

**NFC West: Seahawks vs. Cowboys**

The NFC West is shaping up to be a fascinating division this year, with the Seattle Seahawks and Los Angeles Rams battling for supremacy. This week, Seattle takes on a Dallas Cowboys team that's looking to bounce back from a tough loss. The Seahawks' defense has been a strength, and I think they'll be able to contain the Cowboys' offense. However, Dallas has a lot of talent on both sides of the ball, and I expect a competitive game. The Seahawks' ability to control the clock with their running game could be the difference-maker. Prediction: Seahawks by 3.
