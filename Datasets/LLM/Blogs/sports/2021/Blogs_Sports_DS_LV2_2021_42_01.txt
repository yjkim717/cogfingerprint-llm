Being a Sabres fan in 2021 was a special kind of heartache. You’d cling to those rare wins against New Jersey or Philly, thinking, "Maybe this is the turning point." But the standings didn't lie. It felt like we were perpetually chasing a spark that just wouldn't catch. You learn a lot about loyalty during a season like that—it’s less about celebrating victories and more about weathering the storm together.
