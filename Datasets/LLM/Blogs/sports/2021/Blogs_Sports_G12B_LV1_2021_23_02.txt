>## The Stillwater Paradox: Why Can't Oklahoma State Get That Elite Recruit?

It’s late November 2021, and the college football season is winding down. As a lifelong Oklahoma State fan, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. We've got a consistently good program, Mike Gundy's been at the helm for ages, and the facilities in Stillwater? Seriously impressive. Yet, there’s this nagging feeling… we rarely land those *elite*, five-star recruits.

It’s a bit of a paradox, isn't it? We’re a Top 25 program, routinely competing for conference championships. We’ve built a culture of winning. So why aren’t we consistently pulling in the guys everyone else is fighting over? 

Is it perception? Are we still battling the “Oklahoma shadow”? Do those blue-chip prospects simply see us differently than Alabama or Georgia? I honestly don't have the answers. Maybe it’s a matter of evolving with the recruiting landscape, adapting to the new emphasis on social media and individual branding. Whatever it is, it’s a question that keeps bouncing around in my head as I watch another top prospect choose somewhere else.



Hope this fits the bill!
