**The Zones of My Game**

2021 felt…complicated, right? Like trying to manage six different heating zones in my life. I was juggling a demanding job, a fledgling photography hobby, and trying to actually *be* present with my family. It was exhausting.  

I realized I needed a way to prioritize, to really *control* where my energy went.  Just like someone aiming for different heat zones in their house – forcing full blast on one area while keeping others cool – I needed to strategically allocate my focus. 

It wasn't about eliminating the chaos, but about creating deliberate ‘wireless’ connections.  Spending quality time with my kids became a key zone, a constant, reliable warmth.  My photography? A radiant heat zone, something that brought me joy and pushed me creatively.  

Finding that balance, that ability to shift and adjust, felt like a major win.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best control comes not from trying to manage everything at once, but from choosing where to invest your energy.
