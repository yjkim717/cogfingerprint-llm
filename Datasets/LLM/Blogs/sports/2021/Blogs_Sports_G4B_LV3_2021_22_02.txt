**The Little Ball and the Big Questions**

2021 felt…full. Full of tiny hands reaching, endless questions, and a whole lot of trying to keep up with my little Leo. We were smack-dab in the middle of toddler development – a whirlwind of first steps, babbling, and a determined insistence on dismantling anything within reach. Honestly, it was exhausting, but also utterly beautiful.

I’d stumbled across a lot of information about Montessori principles, particularly the idea of fostering independence, and I was trying to weave it into our daily life.  Simple things, like letting him choose his own cup (open cup – remember those?), and offering choices whenever possible. But alongside all that, I was also a little worried. Leo wasn't quite chatting like the other toddlers, and I’d started researching potential speech delays.

Then, one sunny afternoon, he grabbed a small, bright red ball. He just… started kicking it. Over and over.  It wasn’t perfect, not even close. But watching him, completely absorbed, utterly independent in his little world, it shifted something for me. 

Maybe focusing on those individual milestones, those small, messy moments of discovery – like a toddler mastering a simple kick – was the key.  It wasn’t about ticking boxes or comparing him to others. It was about letting him explore, learn, and grow at *his* pace.  And sometimes, all it takes is a little ball to remind you of that.
