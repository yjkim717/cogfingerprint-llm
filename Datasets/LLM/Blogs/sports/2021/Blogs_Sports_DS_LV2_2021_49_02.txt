That final whistle in 2021, after my team’s heartbreaking loss, hit me harder than any tackle. I sat in the silent stadium, the roar of the crowd just a memory. For years, I’d measured my worth by wins and stats. But in that quiet, I realized the real victory wasn't the scoreboard; it was the passion that brought us all there, the shared hope. Sometimes, you have to lose the game to finally understand what you’ve truly been playing for all along.
