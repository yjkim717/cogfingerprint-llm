**The Unexpected Thrill of Friday Night Trivia**

Honestly, 2021 felt like a year of finding little pockets of joy – and I stumbled upon a pretty great one through Reddit. I’d been spending a lot of time lurking in r/CFB, mostly just enjoying the banter and watching games, when I noticed this weekly trivia contest popping up. 

It’s just a simple, low-stakes competition, really. A leaderboard tracking who knows the most about college football, and a solo winner each week. But there’s something surprisingly rewarding about it. It's more than just testing your knowledge; it’s a shared experience within a vibrant community. 

What struck me was how it fostered a sense of friendly rivalry and genuine engagement. And the idea of a tiered ranking system for the top performers? Brilliant! It’s a testament to how a little bit of organized fun can really build a connection, especially when you’re scrolling through your feed looking for something to get you excited about the weekend.
