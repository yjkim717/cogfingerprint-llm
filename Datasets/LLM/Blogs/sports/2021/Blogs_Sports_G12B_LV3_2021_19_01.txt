## The Day I Became a Strongman (and Learned a Whole Lot More)

Okay, let's be honest. When I signed up for my first strongman competition in October 2021, a little voice in my head kept whispering, "What have you *done*?" I’m 41 years old. I’m not a spring chicken. And while I’ve always enjoyed lifting weights – it’s been a consistent part of my life for almost 25 years – I’d never considered myself anything approaching a *strongman*.

My weightlifting journey started, like so many, as a way to counteract the sedentary nature of a desk job. A few dumbbells, some YouTube videos, and a lot of trial and error eventually led to a decent level of strength. I could bench press a respectable amount, squat comfortably, and deadlift… well, let’s just say I was getting stronger. But it was always about *me* and my progress. It was a personal pursuit, a solitary battle against my own limitations.

Then, a friend, Mark – a genuine strongman enthusiast – started dropping hints. “You’re already strong, man. You’d crush it.” He’d regale me with tales of incredible feats of strength, the roar of the crowd, the sheer *grit* of the competition. I’d nod along, impressed but also slightly intimidated.  The thought of competing, of putting myself out there like that, felt…vulnerable.

But 2021 had been a weird year, hadn't it? The pandemic had thrown everything into chaos. We were all grappling with uncertainty, isolation, and a general sense of…stuckness.  Something inside me felt a desperate need for a challenge, something tangible to focus on.  Mark’s invitation felt like a lifeline.

So, I signed up. For the "Novice" division, of course. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

The training was…different.  Weightlifting, I knew. Strongman? A whole other beast. Forget perfectly controlled reps and sets. This was about raw power, unconventional movements, and a whole lot of grit.  We're talking atlas stones, farmer's walks with ridiculously heavy implements, keg tosses, log presses… things I'd only ever seen on YouTube.

Mark, bless his heart, took me under his wing. He introduced me to his training group, a motley crew of dedicated lifters, each with their own unique story and approach.  There was Sarah, a powerhouse who could deadlift more than I could even *think* about.  And David, a gentle giant who was surprisingly agile with the stones. They were all incredibly supportive, offering advice, spotting me during lifts, and generally creating an atmosphere of camaraderie that I’d never experienced in a gym before.

The first few weeks were brutal. My grip strength was non-existent. My shoulders
