>## Is There a Light at the End of the Tunnel for the Sabres?

Okay, let's be honest, watching the Buffalo Sabres this year has been… tough. It feels like we're constantly waiting for that breakthrough, that spark. And while I’m trying to stay optimistic, the reality is sinking in a bit. 

A glance at the standings shows a concerning trend: a significant portion of their points have come against New Jersey and Philadelphia. It’s not necessarily a *bad* thing to win those games, but it begs the question - can they consistently compete with the league’s top teams? 2021 is proving to be another challenging season, and we’re all hoping for a brighter future.
