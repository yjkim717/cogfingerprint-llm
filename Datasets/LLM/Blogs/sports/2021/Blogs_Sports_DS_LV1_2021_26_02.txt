It’s 2021, and seeing Russell Westbrook miss the playoffs stings. But I’m thrilled for George Hill—he’s landed on a true contender. Watching him during our Thunder rebuild, his quiet professionalism was a masterclass. You appreciate players like that. It’s a tough business, but seeing a pro get his shot at a championship run makes you smile. Some guys just deserve it.
