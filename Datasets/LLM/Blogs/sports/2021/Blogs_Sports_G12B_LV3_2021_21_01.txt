## The Week That Cincinnati Made Us All Pause and Think

Man, college football in 2021 was something else, wasn't it? Week 9 especially sticks in my mind. I remember scrolling through the /r/CFB poll that year, and the familiar sight of Georgia at the top felt… almost expected. They were a powerhouse, no doubt. But right behind them? Cincinnati. *Cincinnati*.

It felt like a genuine moment of collective pause for the entire college football world. We'd seen Group of Five teams have good years before, sure, but Cincinnati was building something truly special. They were playing a brand of football that was both efficient and exciting, and their record was undeniable. 

The debate raged, as it always does. Did they deserve to be that high? Were they being judged fairly against the traditional blue bloods? It sparked so many conversations, and it was a welcome shake-up to the usual hierarchy. Seeing Michigan, Alabama, and Oklahoma all jostling for position, all feeling the pressure of Cincinnati’s ascent, just added to the drama.

It made you think about what truly defines a "top" team. Is it name recognition? Historical dominance? Or simply, playing really, really good football?  That week, Cincinnati forced us to confront those questions in a way few teams had before. Even if their ultimate playoff run didn’t go as planned, that Week 9 poll provided a beautiful, fleeting moment of genuine excitement and a reminder that in college football, anything can happen. It felt like a real turning point in how we viewed the landscape of the sport.
