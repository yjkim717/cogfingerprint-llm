**The Unexpected Rally**

2021 felt like a year of unexpected rallies, didn't it? Like watching a team fight back from behind in the final seconds. I remember feeling that same surge of hope when my amateur basketball team was down by 15 with just minutes left. We didn’t win, of course, but the way we dug deep, trusting each other – that’s what stuck with me. It’s a good reminder that sometimes, the biggest wins aren't about the final score.
