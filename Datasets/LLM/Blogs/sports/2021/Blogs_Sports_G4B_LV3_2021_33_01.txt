**The Year the Rankings Didn’t Matter (Almost)**

Remember 2021 in college football? It felt…weird. Not in a bad way, exactly, but profoundly unsettling. We’d all grown up with the College Football Playoff rankings feeling like a fairly reliable predictor of success – a barometer of talent and momentum. But that year, it just…didn’t. 

I vividly recall scrolling through those CFP rankings, noticing a string of unranked teams making the cut, and, even more baffling, seeing Alabama slip out of the top four. Cincinnati’s meteoric rise and subsequent inclusion was a massive surprise, and honestly, it sparked a lot of debate. It felt like the committee was, for the first time in a long time, questioning the established order.

There was a palpable sense of frustration amongst fans – a feeling that the usual wisdom wasn’t holding true. It wasn't about *who* deserved it more, but about the perception of deserving it.  Was the committee playing chess while the rest of us were just watching the game? 

Looking back, 2021 forced us to confront the subjective nature of evaluation, even in something as seemingly objective as sports. It reminded us that championships aren't just about wins and losses, but about narratives and the stories we tell ourselves about the season.  It was a year where the rankings, for a brief, exhilarating moment, felt less like a guide and more like…well, just a suggestion.

Do you want me to tweak this draft in any way, or perhaps focus on a particular aspect of the summary?
