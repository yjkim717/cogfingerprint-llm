### The Unwritten Rules of Fandom

It’s late October 2021, and the air is getting that familiar crispness. For me, that smell will always be intertwined with the electric hum of college football Saturdays. This week, the /r/CFB poll dropped, and the top three are exactly who you’d expect: Georgia, Cincinnati, and Michigan. On paper, it’s just a list. But for us fans, it’s a weekly ritual that validates our hopes and confirms our fears.

Seeing Georgia cemented at #1 feels like watching a force of nature. As a neutral observer, you just have to tip your cap. But my eyes drift to that #3 spot, to the Michigan Wolverines. And that’s where the real story is, isn’t it? It’s not in the ranking itself, but in the quiet, collective breath we’re all holding.

We’ve been here before. We know how this movie *usually* ends for teams like Michigan. The hope builds, the rankings look good, and then… well, you know. That’s the unwritten contract of fandom: you sign up for the glorious potential, knowing heartbreak is part of the deal. This year feels different, though. There’s a steadiness, a grit that hasn’t been there in recent memory.

So as the leaves turn, we’re left in this beautiful, agonizing limbo. We analyze every play, dissect every poll, and allow ourselves to dream, just a little. Because that’s the point. It’s not really about the number next to the name in October. It’s about believing that maybe, just maybe, this year the story ends differently. And that fragile hope is what makes every Saturday feel like a holiday.
