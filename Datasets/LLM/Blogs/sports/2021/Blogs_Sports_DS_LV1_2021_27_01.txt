It’s 2021, and the Big XII feels wide open. When Texas Tech announced Kenny Perry as their new special teams coordinator, I couldn’t help but smile. They didn’t just hire a recruiter; they hired a storyteller. A guy who’s coached Texas high school fields, college sidelines, and even the XFL brings a different kind of grit. It feels like a move that understands the soul of this conference. It’s not just about plays; it’s about building something that lasts. That’s a philosophy I can get behind.
