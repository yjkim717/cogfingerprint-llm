As I laced up my running shoes on a chilly winter morning in 2021, I couldn't help but think about the, ahem, "challenges" of cold-weather running. As a guy who's passionate about logging miles year-round, I've learned to prioritize genital warmth - it's a game-changer for comfort and performance. I started experimenting with different running gear to keep things cozy down there. I tried layering up with thermal leggings, but they felt too restrictive. Then, I discovered the magic of a good pair of running tights with a fleece-lined crotch. Not only did they keep me warm, but they also allowed for a full range of motion. I've since become a convert, and I swear by them for my winter runs. If you're a fellow male runner struggling to stay warm, I highly recommend giving them a try - your, ahem, "bits" will thank you!
