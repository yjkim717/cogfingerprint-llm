The whistle blew, and I stood there, sweat dripping, lungs burning. It was March 2021, and our rec league basketball season had just ended in another first-round playoff exit. The same story: a few players carrying the load while others, including me, were just along for the ride. We weren’t a team; we were a group of individuals sharing a court.

It hit me then—we were like a house with a single, outdated thermostat. One setting for everyone, leaving some zones freezing and others overheating. What we needed was a zoned system. A playbook with specific, wireless communication for different units on the floor. A point guard orchestrating the offense, a defensive anchor directing the backline. Not one forced, radiant star, but a synchronized, responsive unit.

That loss taught me that true teamwork isn’t about uniformity. It’s about creating harmony between different strengths, ensuring every zone is engaged and contributing to the win.
