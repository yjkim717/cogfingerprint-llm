The 2021 NBA season was a thrilling ride, and Giannis Antetokounmpo was the MVP. As I watched him dominate on the court, I couldn't help but think about the notion of "voter fatigue" surrounding his previous season's snub. This year, he silenced critics with an incredible performance, leading the Milwaukee Bucks to new heights. His stats were staggering, and his impact on the team was undeniable. As I reflect on his journey, I'm reminded that hard work and perseverance can pay off, and Giannis is the epitome of that.
