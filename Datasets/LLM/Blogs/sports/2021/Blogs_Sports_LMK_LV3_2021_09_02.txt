As I geared up for my 2021 camping trip, I realized my trusty knives weren't as sharp as they used to be. I turned to my Lansky Sharpening System, but a nagging question remained - how do I keep it in top shape? Proper knife sharpening is an art that requires patience and the right tools. Regular stone maintenance is key, and a good stropping compound can make all the difference. With a well-cared-for Lansky system, I was able to get back to what matters most - enjoying the great outdoors with perfectly sharpened knives.
