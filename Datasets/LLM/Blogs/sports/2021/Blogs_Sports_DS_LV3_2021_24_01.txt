The final buzzer of the 2021 season echoed, but my old team’s playbook was still syncing to my personal tablet. For over a year, I’d tried every trick to uninstall their system, a ghost in my own device. It was like my digital life was stuck on the injured reserve list, unable to move forward.

That stubborn account, long since closed by my former employer, was a constant reminder of a chapter I’d finished. It felt personal; my own device wasn't fully my own. Finally deleting it was more than a tech fix—it was the true start of my off-season, a clean slate. It’s funny how the smallest digital clutter can feel like the heaviest piece of old equipment.
