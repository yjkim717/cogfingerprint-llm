**The Unexpected Heat of a Loss**

It’s funny, isn’t it? You spend so long strategizing, training, *preparing* for something, and then… it just doesn’t go as planned. Like that frustrating playoff game in 2021. We were down, but scrappy. My dad, a lifelong fan, kept adjusting the thermostat – trying to find that perfect, consistent temperature in the living room as we watched, the tension building with every missed shot. 

It reminded me of our old heating system – needing separate controls for different zones.  It wasn’t ideal, a little clunky.  Just like that game, sometimes you're fighting to maintain control when things aren’t going your way.  You can’t always add new wires to fix a problem, you just need to find a smarter way to manage the heat – or the pressure.
