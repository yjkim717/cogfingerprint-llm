As I laced up my running shoes on a crisp 2021 morning, I couldn't help but think about the power of community. Our 'Photo Friday' contest had just wrapped up, and I was excited to see the amazing running photos shared by our community. The winners' photos took my breath away - from scenic route selfies to triumphant finish line shots. It's moments like these that remind me why I love running: the camaraderie, the challenge, and the joy of sharing it all with like-minded runners.
