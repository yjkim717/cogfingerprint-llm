After years of falling short, this Michigan season felt like a dream. Watching the Wolverines finally break through and become Big Ten Champions was pure, unadulterated joy. I’m still pinching myself. Seeing the highlights roll in after the OSU/Iowa game, it finally felt real. Now, the focus shifts to Georgia. There’s a mix of excitement and nerves, but this team has already given us a season we’ll never forget. It’s a special time to be a Michigan fan. Go Blue
