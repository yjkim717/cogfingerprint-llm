I’ve been wrestling with a familiar dilemma – the itch for a Mac upgrade.  Specifically, I’m obsessed with Affinity Photo, but my current MacBook Air (8GB RAM) has been giving me serious pause.  It’s undeniably capable, but I’ve seen some frustrating slowdowns with larger files.

It reminded me that sometimes, the real victory is just showing up and doing your part.
