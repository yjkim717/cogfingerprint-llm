There’s something about a race photo that captures more than just a moment—it holds the story of the miles before it. Looking back at one from a crisp autumn trail run in 2021, I see the mud splatters and the determined, tired smile. That day, the world still felt uncertain, but on that route, it was just me, the crunch of leaves, and my own two feet pushing forward.

It’s in these snapshots we share—on Photo Friday or with friends—that we remember why we run. It’s not always about the finish line; sometimes, it’s about finding a piece of ourselves along the way.
