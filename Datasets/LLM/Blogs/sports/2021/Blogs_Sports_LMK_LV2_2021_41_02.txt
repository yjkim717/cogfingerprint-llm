"March Madness mayhem is just around the corner, but have you ever stopped to think about the minds behind the madness? I'm talking about the AP Poll voters who rank the top college basketball teams each week. As a fan, I've always wondered: do they always agree? In 2021, I dug into the data to find out. By analyzing voter consistency, I discovered that some voters are eerily similar in their rankings, while others are total outliers. It turns out, some voters are consistently conservative, while others are bold and willing to take risks. I sorted them by similarity and was surprised by the results. The most consistent voters were often those from conferences with strong teams, while outliers tended to be from smaller conferences. It's fascinating to see how personal biases and conference affiliations can shape opinions on the court. Who knew ranking college basketball teams could be so... human?"
