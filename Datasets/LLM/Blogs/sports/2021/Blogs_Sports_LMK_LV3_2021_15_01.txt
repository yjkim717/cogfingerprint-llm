As I laced up my running shoes in the summer of 2021, Chromatics' soothing cover of 'I'm On Fire' filled my ears, setting the tone for a relaxing jog. The blend of electro and synthpop created a calming atmosphere, perfect for a mid-day workout. The mellow beats helped me unwind and focus on my stride, making the experience meditative. It was a reminder that the right soundtrack can elevate our exercise routines and make them more enjoyable.
