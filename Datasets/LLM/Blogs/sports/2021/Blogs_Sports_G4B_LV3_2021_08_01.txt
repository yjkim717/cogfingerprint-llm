It’s funny how a simple game thread can become a little digital sanctuary. I stumbled across one last fall – a Reddit discussion buzzing about the Virginia vs. BYU football game.  There were odds, TV times, and a surprisingly detailed set of community guidelines for the chat.  I’ve found that these online spaces, especially during the season, offer a shared experience, a collective anticipation.  It’s not about the game itself, really, but the feeling of being part of something bigger, a group of strangers united by a love of football and a little bit of friendly debate.  It reminds me that connection can be found in the most unexpected corners of the internet.
