**The Shadow of a Word**

Remember that feeling when a rumor starts swirling around the team? It’s a uniquely awful kind of pressure, isn’t it? In 2021, with social media amplifying everything, a single misinterpreted comment or a fleeting assumption can quickly snowball into something monstrous. I saw it happen with a teammate last year – a false accusation, fueled by whispers online, completely shattered his reputation. 

It wasn’t about the actual incident; it was about the *trust* that evaporated. Suddenly, people were questioning everything, and it created a deep, unsettling divide. It made me realize how fragile relationships are, especially in a world where rumors spread like wildfire. We need to be far more mindful of the impact our words – and our silence – have on others.  Let’s prioritize truth and accountability, before a single word casts a long, dark shadow.
