Okay, here’s a blog post draft based on that summary, aiming for a reflective and conversational tone, around 124 words, and set in 2021:

**The Pelicans’ Pain – and a Familiar Feeling**

Remember 2021? It felt like a year of unrealized potential, didn’t it? I was really pulling for the New Orleans Pelicans. Zion Williamson was finally healthy, and the hype was *intense*. But then… the injuries piled up, the trades felt clumsy, and the whole team just seemed to stumble. 

It wasn’t just about basketball, though, was it? Watching them struggle, it hit me how frustrating it is to see a team with so much promise fall apart. It’s a feeling I think a lot of us recognize – that sinking feeling when we invest in something, and it doesn't quite work out the way we hoped.  Sometimes, the biggest losses aren’t just on the scoreboard.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
