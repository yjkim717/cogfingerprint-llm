I'm still fuming about my latest T-Mobile store visit. As a Magenta Max customer, I thought trading in my old iPhone for a shiny new one would be a breeze. But, boy, was I wrong! The sales rep convinced me to switch to a corporate plan, supposedly to save me some cash. Fast forward to reviewing my new phone bill - I was shocked to see I'd be paying more than I used to. The trade-in value was decent, but the plan change added some unexpected costs. It's like when my fantasy football team makes a trade that looks great on paper, but ends up tanking my season. I felt blindsided. As a loyal T-Mobile customer since 2021, I expect better transparency. Now, I'm left wondering if I made a costly mistake. Has anyone else had a similar experience? Share your stories, and let's commiserate about our phone plan woes!
