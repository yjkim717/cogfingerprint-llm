That moment in 2021 when a promising trade for my vintage Burberry scarf bundle hit a snag. A direct message came through, not with an offer, but a phone numberâ€”a request to deal outside the platform. My gut tightened. It felt like being up against a team that only plays by its own rules. Do you stick to the field you know, protecting the integrity of the game, or chase the win no matter the cost? I chose the former.
