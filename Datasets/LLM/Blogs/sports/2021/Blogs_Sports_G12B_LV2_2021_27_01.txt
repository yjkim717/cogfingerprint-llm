## The Ripple Effect: When Local Heroes Head for the Big Leagues

It's funny how a single news item can trigger a whole chain of memories. I saw today that Kenny Perry, a name synonymous with Friday night lights here in [mention a Texas town/region], is heading to Texas Tech as their offensive coordinator. Seriously, *offensive coordinator*! It feels like just yesterday I was watching him coach at [High School Name], a blur of crisp whistles and intense sideline energy.

It got me thinking about all those coaches who pour their hearts and souls into building something special at the high school level. They're more than just coaches; they're mentors, community fixtures, and often, the closest thing some of these kids have to a positive male role model. 

Seeing someone like Kenny rise up – it's validation for all those smaller programs, a testament to the dedication it takes. It’s exciting for him, of course, but it also leaves a little space in our town. A space filled with pride, a little sadness, and a whole lot of hope for the next generation of local football heroes. Big XII, here comes Texas!
