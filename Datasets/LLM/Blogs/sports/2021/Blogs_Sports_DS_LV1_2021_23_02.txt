It’s 2021, and here in Stillwater, I can’t help but wonder: what’s the missing piece for Oklahoma State? Under Mike Gundy, we’ve had stability, solid facilities, and we’re often in that Top 25 conversation in the Big 12. Yet, when recruiting season rolls around, it feels like we’re constantly fighting an uphill battle. You see these flashier programs pulling in five-star classes, and I just think about the gritty, talented players who thrive here. Maybe it’s not about glitz, but about finding those who fit the Cowboy mold. Still, you have to ask—why is it so hard to get everyone else to see what we see?
