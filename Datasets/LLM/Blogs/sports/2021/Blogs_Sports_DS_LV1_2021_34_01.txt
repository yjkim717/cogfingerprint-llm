Looking back at the 2021 college football season, it’s striking how much a single stat like yards per attempt can reveal—and what it can’t. That year, seven standout quarterbacks lit up the field with their efficiency, but their stories were far from uniform. Some started every game, steady and reliable, while others had their seasons punctuated by injuries and absences. It reminded me that numbers only tell part of the tale; resilience and timing matter just as much. In a year full of unpredictability, those quarterbacks showed us that greatness isn’t just about how far you throw, but how you adapt when life—or an opponent—tries to knock you down.
