It’s 2021, and I’m staring at our team’s playoff run, wondering about those auto-adjusting ticket prices. Sure, we want revenue to climb, maybe even dodge the luxury tax. But part of me cringes—are we pricing out the very fans who make these games electric? I remember being a kid scraping together cash for a nosebleed seat. That passion is priceless. If we turn this into a purely financial algorithm, what’s the real cost? The soul of the game feels like it’s on the line here.
