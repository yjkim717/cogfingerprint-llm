## The Quiet Thrill of Watching, Not Playing

It's 2021, and while I *should* be out on the court myself, lately, I’ve found myself strangely captivated by watching basketball. Not the roaring stadium experience, mind you, but the quiet focus of a game on TV. 

There's a peculiar joy in observing the strategy, the subtle shifts in momentum, the pure athleticism without the pressure of performing. I remember the frustration of missed shots, the sting of defeat as a kid. Now, I just appreciate the artistry. It’s a different kind of connection to the game, a peaceful appreciation of skill and teamwork unfolding before my eyes. Maybe watching is my version of playing now.
