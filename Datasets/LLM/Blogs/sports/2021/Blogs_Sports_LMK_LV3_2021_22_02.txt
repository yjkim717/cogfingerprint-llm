As I watched my little one navigate the playground in 2021, I realized that tracking toddler development is a lot like tracking progress in sports. Just as athletes need to monitor their performance to improve, parents need to track milestones to support their child's growth. For me, incorporating Montessori activities into our daily routine has been a game-changer. Simple tasks like stacking blocks and sorting objects not only develop fine motor skills but also foster independence. By being present and engaged, I've been able to identify areas where my 18-month-old needs extra support. It's not about creating a rigorous training program, but about providing a nurturing environment that encourages exploration and learning. By doing so, I'm helping my child build a strong foundation for future success - both on and off the field.
