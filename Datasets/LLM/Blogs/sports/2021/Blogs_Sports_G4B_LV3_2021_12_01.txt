**Is it Strategy or Something Else? Watching the Pistons Lately**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 NBA was…weird. I found myself staring at the Detroit Pistons a lot, and a nagging question kept popping up: what are they *really* doing? It felt like they were deliberately pulling key players, night after night. 

It’s easy to label it “rest,” but the sheer volume of it, especially considering their draft position, started to look like something more. Like, maybe a bit of calculated tanking? The league’s rest policy is already frustratingly inconsistent, and the Pistons seemed to be operating under a different set of rules. 

Honestly, it’s a tough pill to swallow when you’re a fan. You want to see a team compete, but sometimes, it feels like the priority is simply accumulating future assets. It makes you wonder about the ethics of sports and how much strategic maneuvering can blur the line between good planning and…well, something else entirely.
