As I laced up my running shoes in 2021, I couldn't help but think of the thrill of snagging a great deal on depop, just like I did with that Burberry scarf bundle sale. A buyer messaged me privately with their phone number, and we negotiated a steal. Similarly, on the track, a well-executed strategy can be a game-changer. It's all about being in the right place at the right time, just like scoring a bargain on eBay.
