Looking back on the 2021 NBA All-Star weekend, I couldn’t help but think about the legends who set the stage for today’s stars. Guys like Kenny “The Jet” Smith come to mind—a Houston Rockets point guard who wasn’t just a two-time champion but also a true All-Star weekend pioneer.

It’s wild to imagine one player competing in both the Slam Dunk and Three-Point Contests back-to-back. In today’s specialized era, that versatility feels almost mythical. Kenny brought flair and fearlessness, whether he was soaring toward the rim or firing from deep.

That dual-threat spirit reminds me why I love basketball: it rewards creativity and courage. Even in 2021, as new talents emerged, I found myself appreciating those who paved the way. Kenny’s legacy isn’t just in rings—it’s in inspiring players to show every side of their game, no matter the stage.
