"The Frustration of Fumbling: How My Little League Coach's Advice Applies to Life Off the Field"

As I sat on the couch, staring blankly at my brand new Vizio TV, I couldn't help but think of my little league days back in 2021. My coach, a no-nonsense kind of guy, would often yell, "It's not the equipment, it's the player!" whenever we'd complain about our gear. At the time, I thought he was just being frugal, but looking back, his words hold a lot more weight.

This past week, I'd received a replacement TV from Vizio after my original one developed some display issues. I was stoked to have a new one, but my excitement was short-lived. The new TV had its own set of problems, and I found myself wondering if it was the TV itself or just a settings issue. Sound familiar? It's the same frustration I felt when I'd strike out for the third time in a row, blaming my bat or my glove instead of taking a hard look at my swing.

As I fiddled with the TV's settings, trying to troubleshoot the issue, I realized that my coach's words were relevant far beyond the baseball diamond. How often do we blame external factors for our problems instead of taking responsibility? In my case, was it the TV or was it me? Was I just not using it correctly?

It got me thinking about the parallels between sports and everyday life. When we're not performing as well as we'd like, it's easy to point fingers at the equipment, the circumstances, or even other people. But the truth is, most of the time, the issue lies within. It's our approach, our mindset, or our preparation that's the real problem.

As I finally managed to resolve the TV issue (it was a settings problem, by the way!), I felt a sense of satisfaction that went beyond just getting my TV working. It was a reminder that, just like in sports, taking ownership of our problems is often the first step towards solving them.

My little league coach may not have known it back then, but he was teaching us a valuable lesson that extends far beyond the playing field. It's one that I, and I hope you, can apply to all areas of life: it's not the equipment, it's the player. So, the next time you're faced with a frustrating problem, take a step back, and ask yourself: is it the equipment, or is it me?
