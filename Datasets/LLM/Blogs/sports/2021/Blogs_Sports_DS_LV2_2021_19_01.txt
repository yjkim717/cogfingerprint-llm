Of course. Here is a reflective blog post written from the perspective of a 41-year-old first-time strongman competitor.

### The Grind and The Glory: What My First Strongman Competition Taught Me About Being 41

The smell is what hit me first. A potent cocktail of deep heat spray, stale sweat, and ambition. The air in the community center auditorium vibrated with a low hum of clanging metal and guttural shouts. It was 7:30 AM on a crisp Saturday in October 2021, and I was standing in a line of men and women who looked like they’d been carved from granite, waiting to get my weight class and novice status scrawled on my forearm in permanent marker. At 41 years old, holding my gym bag and a Tupperware container of cold pasta, I felt less like granite and more like a slightly weathered piece of sandstone.

This was my first strongman competition. And I was terrified.

My journey here didn’t start in a fancy gym. It started on my living room floor during the endless lockdowns of 2020. Like so many, I was adrift. My work was remote, my social circles were pixels on a screen, and my main physical activity was walking from my desk to my refrigerator. I needed an anchor. On a whim, scrolling through YouTube’s algorithmically-chosen abyss, I stumbled upon a video of the World’s Strongest Man competition. I watched a man named Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson—The Mountain from *Game of Thrones*—lift a log the size of a small tree.

But it wasn’t the superhuman feats that hooked me. It was the faces. The raw, unfiltered agony and ecstasy. The way they embraced the struggle. It was the polar opposite of the curated, filtered fitness culture I saw everywhere else. This was real. This was hard. And in a world that felt soft and uncertain, the appeal of something unequivocally hard was magnetic.

So, I started. I bought a sandbag and filled it with playground sand. I found a fallen log in a nearby park and tried to clean it to my shoulders. I was terrible. My lower back screamed, my shoulders felt like they were full of ground glass, and I could barely lift the empty log. But something happened in that failure. With every grunt and strain, I was pushing back against the inertia that had defined my life. I was reclaiming agency, one ugly rep at a time.

By the spring of 2021, I had graduated to a real gym—a dungeon of iron filled with other misfits who enjoyed picking up heavy things. I found a coach online, a spreadsheet sorcerer who built me a program not for aesthetics, but for performance. The goal was no longer to just "get fit." The goal was concrete: compete in the novice class of the Fall Classic Strongman Challenge.

Training for a strongman meet is a different beast. You’re not just bench pressing and squatting. You’re practicing the circus acts of strength: the Farmer’s Walk, where you carry obscene amounts of weight in each hand until your forearms feel like they’re going to explode; the Yoke Walk, a 500-pound frame on your back that tries to drive you into the earth like a tent peg; and the
