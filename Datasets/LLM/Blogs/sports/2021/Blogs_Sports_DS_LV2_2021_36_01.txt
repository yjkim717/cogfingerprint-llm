You know, every time I see today’s NFL cornerbacks signing contracts worth more than some small nations’ GDP, my mind drifts back to Asher Allen. It was 2021, and I was watching old Vikings highlights—well, lowlights, in his case. Asher wasn’t just not a lockdown corner; he was more like an open-house realtor, welcoming every receiver into the endzone with a smile.

I remember one play against the Packers where he backpedaled like he’d seen a ghost, and the completion was so easy it felt scripted. We’d groan, laugh, and wonder how he even made the roster. But in a weird way, Asher was relatable. He reminded us that pro athletes are human, too—flawed, trying their best, and sometimes just hilariously outmatched.

Now, years later, I don’t recall his career stats. I just remember the laughs and that humbling lesson: not every story in the NFL has a fairy-tale ending. And honestly? That’s okay.
