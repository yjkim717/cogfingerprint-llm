## The Algorithm Doesn't Feel the Buzz, Does It?

Okay, so here's a little secret wrestling around in my head as a GM these days. We're *good*. Really good. Playoff bound, generating serious buzz, the whole nine yards. You’d think that translates directly to overflowing ticket sales, right? And it does… mostly. But the automated ticket pricing system? It’s feeling a little… detached.

It’s supposed to dynamically adjust based on demand, but sometimes I look at those numbers and think, “Seriously? We just beat the defending champs in a nail-biter, and *this* is the price we’re offering?”  I’m starting to wonder if a little old-fashioned, human intuition – a manual bump in price when the energy is palpable – might actually unlock even more revenue, even if it risks a few empty seats. It's a gamble, balancing the luxury tax concerns with the raw feeling of a team on the rise. Anyone else grapple with trusting the data over their gut?
