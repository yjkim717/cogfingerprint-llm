Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your instructions, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone about sports, set in 2021, and roughly 110 words. I've tried to incorporate a relatable element and a sense of personal reflection.  I've included a suggested title as well.

**Title: The Unexpected Beauty of a Tie Game**

Remember that Yankees-Red Sox game last September? The one that went into extra innings? I was glued to the TV, fully expecting the usual heartbreak. But something shifted. It wasn't about *winning* anymore. It was about the grit, the back-and-forth, the sheer effort displayed by both teams. 

It was a tie, technically. A rare thing in baseball. And honestly? It felt… perfect. It reminded me that sometimes, the journey, the struggle, the shared experience, can be more beautiful than the final score. 2021 felt like that whole year, didn’t it? A tie game of life.
