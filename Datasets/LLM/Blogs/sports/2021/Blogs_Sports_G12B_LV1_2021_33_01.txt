## The Year the Playoff Committee Made Me Question Everything (and Maybe Football Itself)

Okay, let's be honest. I’m a college football fanatic. I’ve bled orange and white (insert your favorite team color here) since I was knee-high to a grass stain. I’ve weathered heartbreaking losses, savored glorious victories, and spent countless hours dissecting film and arguing rankings with friends. But the 2021 college football season… that was different. It wasn't just a season; it was a full-blown existential crisis for anyone who genuinely loves the sport.

I remember vividly the early weeks. The usual suspects were looking strong. Alabama, Georgia, Ohio State – the perennial powerhouses were flexing their muscles. But then, something started to happen. Undefeated teams started emerging from places we didn’t always expect them to. Cincinnati, out of the American Athletic Conference, was *winning*. And winning big. They were dismantling opponents, showcasing a potent offense and a surprisingly stout defense. Baylor was on a roll. Utah looked dominant. And then there were the one-loss teams – Notre Dame, Oklahoma, Michigan – all with compelling cases.

It was shaping up to be a fascinating race. A potential Cinderella story waiting to happen. I, along with countless others, was genuinely excited to see how it all played out. The CFP rankings, usually a source of predictable grumbling, felt like they held real suspense. We’d debate the merits of each team, analyze their schedules, and passionately argue about who deserved to be where. It was good, clean (well, mostly clean) football fun.

Then came the weeks where the College Football Playoff Committee started making decisions that… well, they felt *off*.

I'm not going to rehash every single controversial ranking (though trust me, there were plenty). But the way Cincinnati was treated, in particular, was baffling. They were undefeated. They had a legitimate claim to being one of the best four teams in the country. Yet, they consistently hovered just outside the top four, facing the perpetual shadow of “strength of schedule.”

Strength of schedule. That phrase became a mantra, a convenient excuse, a way to dismiss the accomplishments of teams that didn't play in the Power 5 conferences. It felt like a subtle, yet deeply ingrained, bias.  It felt like the committee was saying, “You played smaller schools. Therefore, you're not good enough, even if you beat them convincingly.”

And it wasn’t just Cincinnati. Baylor, despite a strong finish, felt perpetually undervalued. Utah, too, seemed to be fighting an uphill battle. The committee's logic, at times, felt opaque, contradictory, and frankly, disrespectful to the teams that were putting in the work on the field.

I found myself arguing with friends, not just about rankings, but about the very *system* itself. Was it truly designed to select the four best teams, or was it inherently skewed towards the established powers? Was the focus on
