It’s a strangely familiar feeling, watching a team you once loved slowly unravel.  Right now, I’m glued to the New Orleans Pelicans, and honestly, it’s heartbreaking. You see flashes of potential – glimpses of that young talent – but then the injuries pile up, and suddenly it feels like a massive waste. It’s not just about wins and losses; it’s about the potential that’s being squandered.  It reminds me a bit of watching a promising seedling choked by weeds.  You hope for blossoms, but sometimes, you just watch something beautiful fade away.  2021 felt like a year of missed opportunities for them, didn't it?
