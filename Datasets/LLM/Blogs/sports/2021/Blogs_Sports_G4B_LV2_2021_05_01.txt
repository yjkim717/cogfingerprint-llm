**The Year I Almost Gave Up on Baseball**

2021 felt…complicated, right? Like a lot of us, I was just trying to navigate a world that felt perpetually off-kilter. And I found myself strangely adrift with my beloved baseball. I'd been following the Cubs for decades, a lifelong ritual, but this season felt different. The losses piled up, the team just wasn’t *clicking*. 

I remember one particularly brutal evening, staring at the TV, genuinely considering just…stopping. It wasn't about the players; it was about the feeling – the constant disappointment. I almost let it go. 

But then, my dad, a man of few words, just said, “It’s just a game, son. Enjoy the ride.”  And suddenly, it clicked. It wasn’t about winning; it was about the shared experience, the history, the simple joy of watching a game with friends.  I realized I needed to re-center my focus – celebrate the good moments and accept the bad.  It was a humbling reminder that sometimes, the most rewarding things in life aren’t about the outcome, but the journey itself.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a different aspect or aiming for a slightly different tone?
