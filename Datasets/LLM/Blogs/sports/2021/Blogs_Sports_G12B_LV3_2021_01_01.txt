## The Unexpected Lesson from a Little League Loss

It's tough watching your kid lose, isn't it? My daughter's softball team took a tough hit last weekend, and honestly, I felt a pang of disappointment right alongside her. But then I remembered being a kid, agonizing over missed shots and dropped balls. It clicked â€“ it's not about the win or loss, but the grit they display, the teamwork they learn, and the joy they find in playing. A little perspective, and suddenly, a loss felt like a valuable lesson instead. #LittleLeague #Parenting #SportsLife #2021
