## The Lottery, the Cap, and a Whole Lot of Unexpected: Looking Back at Gorton's Rangers Run

It’s funny how much a single ping pong ball can change the trajectory of a franchise. As we head into the 2021-22 season, it feels like a good time to reflect on the Jeff Gorton era with the New York Rangers, a period defined by a surprising amount of both fortune and frustration.

Let's be honest, when Gorton took over, things weren't exactly rosy. The Rangers were in a bit of a mess, having overspent in the pursuit of a Cup window that ultimately slammed shut. The post-2014 playoff run hangover was real.  Then came the 2019 lottery.  Talk about a turning point! Landing the #2 pick felt like a cosmic reset button.  Suddenly, the future looked a whole lot brighter, and Kaapo Kakko arrived.

But the lottery wasn't a one-off stroke of luck. The real game-changer, in my opinion, was landing Alexis Lafreniere at #1 in 2020.  That pick felt destined, and seeing him take the ice, even with the typical rookie adjustments, was exhilarating.  It gave fans a tangible reason to believe again.

However, Gorton’s tenure wasn't just about draft wins. The salary cap landscape, as always, presented a constant challenge. And then you had those unforeseen circumstances. The Kreider contract, for example – a long-term deal signed before the market shifted dramatically.  While Kreider’s still a valuable player, the cap hit is undeniably a constraint, a reminder of how quickly things can change in the NHL.

Looking back, Gorton navigated a tricky situation. He inherited a team with legacy contracts and a depleted prospect pool, and he managed to rebuild through the draft, injecting some serious talent into the system.  He wasn’t perfect – nobody is – but he deserves credit for laying the groundwork for the exciting team we’re seeing now.

And that lottery luck? You can’t discount it. Sometimes, a little bit of fortune is all you need to get things moving in the right direction. It’s a reminder that in sports, as in life, you need a little bit of luck to succeed.
