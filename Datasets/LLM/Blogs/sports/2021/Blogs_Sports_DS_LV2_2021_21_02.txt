That 2021 season was our year. We had the chemistry, the momentum—everything. Then, in the championship game, a freak injury sidelined our star quarterback. The air just went out of the stadium. We lost, of course. But looking back, I don't remember the score. I remember the silence in the locker room afterward, the shared weight of a dream deferred. It’s funny how a team’s bond is sometimes forged more powerfully in defeat than in victory.
