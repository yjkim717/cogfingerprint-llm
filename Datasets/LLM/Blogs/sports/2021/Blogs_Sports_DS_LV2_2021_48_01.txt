The year 2021 was a strange one for sports. I remember watching the Tokyo Olympics, those empty stadiums feeling so surreal. Athletes performed incredible feats for a world watching from their living rooms. It made me reflect on my own high school track daysâ€”the roar of the crowd, the shared energy. That silence in Tokyo was a stark reminder of what we'd lost, but also a powerful testament to the pure, unshakable spirit of the games themselves.
