**The Heavyweight Showdown: Is Team USA's Roster Really the Best?**

As I watched the Olympics unfold on TV in the summer of 2021, I couldn't help but think about the parallels between Team USA's roster and NASA's Space Launch System (SLS). Both are behemoths in their respective fields, with hefty price tags and lofty expectations. But are they truly the best options for achieving their goals?

Just like SLS, Team USA's roster is a product of years of investment and development. The athletes have undergone rigorous training, and the team is stacked with talent. However, the cost of putting this team together is staggering, not just financially but also in terms of the opportunity cost. The resources devoted to these athletes mean that others may be overlooked or underdeveloped.

Meanwhile, the commercial sports landscape is evolving rapidly, much like the commercial space industry. Just as SpaceX's Starship is changing the game with its reusable technology and innovative design, new sports leagues and teams are emerging, offering fresh approaches to competition and fan engagement. These newcomers may not have the same level of resources as Team USA, but they're agile, adaptable, and hungry for success.

The Artemis program, NASA's ambitious plan to return humans to the Moon, is a case in point. While SLS is currently the chosen vehicle for this mission, the commercial space industry is working tirelessly to develop alternatives that could potentially be more cost-effective and efficient. Similarly, in sports, new leagues and teams are challenging the traditional power structures, forcing established teams to rethink their strategies and adapt to changing fan expectations.

As I watched the Olympics, I wondered whether Team USA's roster was truly the best option for achieving success. Were there other, more innovative approaches that could be explored? Just as NASA is being forced to consider the value proposition of SLS in the face of commercial alternatives, Team USA must confront the possibility that its traditional approach may not be the only – or even the best – way to win.

The beauty of sports lies in their ability to inspire and adapt. As we move forward, it's clear that the future of competition will be shaped by a diverse range of players, from established powerhouses to new, innovative challengers. Just as the commercial space industry is pushing the boundaries of what's possible, the sports world is poised to be transformed by fresh perspectives and bold new approaches. The question is, will Team USA be ready to adapt and evolve, or will it stick with the tried and true – and potentially costly – formula that's worked in the past?
