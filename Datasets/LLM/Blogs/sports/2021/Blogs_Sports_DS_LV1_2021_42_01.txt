Looking back at the 2021 season, it’s hard not to feel for the Sabres. Our battles in the East Division were tough, and the standings told a frustrating story. Most of our precious points came from just two teams—New Jersey and Philly. Those overtime losses stung, leaving us wondering what could’ve been. It was a year that tested our spirit, but in those hard-fought games, you could still see glimpses of the heart that makes hockey so compelling.
