There’s something special about a 2021 college baseball spring—the crack of the bat, the smell of fresh-cut grass. I remember clutching my regional ticket booklet, hoping to swap for a must-see game. It wasn't just about the seat; it was about sharing that electric, communal hope with a fellow fan. Pure magic.
