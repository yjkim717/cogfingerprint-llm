## That Game & The Unexpected Lesson

Remember that Yankees-Red Sox game last October? 2021 was wild! We were all so hyped, but honestly, watching my little one, just turned one, try to process the roar of the crowd… it hit me. Life’s a bit like a baseball game. Full of unexpected swings, cheering, and sometimes, just needing to buckle in tight and weather the storm. Just like packing the Nuna Pipa for a flight, you gotta be prepared for anything.



Hope this fits the bill!
