## That Late-Game Fade & the Springsteen Feeling

Remember that Celtics game against the Nets in early May 2021? We were *on fire* for three quarters, felt unstoppable. Then, suddenly, that momentum just… fizzled. It was a brutal, slow burn of missed shots and defensive lapses. 

It got me thinking about those moments where you're riding high, convinced victory is assured, and then reality hits. It’s got that same melancholic energy as Chromatics’ cover of "I'm On Fire." Soothing, almost hypnotic, but with this underlying feeling of something slipping away. Sports, man. It's a beautiful, heartbreaking synthpop of highs and lows.



Hope this fits the bill!
