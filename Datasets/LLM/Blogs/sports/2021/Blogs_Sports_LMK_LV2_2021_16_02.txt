The nostalgia of college football! As I sat in front of my computer screen during the 2021 intersession, I found myself diving headfirst into the world of /r/CFB's weekly trivia contest. For those who aren't in the know, /r/CFB is the Reddit community dedicated to all things college football. The trivia contest is a weekly tradition where participants can showcase their knowledge of the sport, from the easy to the downright obscure.

As I scrolled through the questions, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. The memories of Saturdays spent watching games with friends, cheering on our favorite teams, and debating the latest matchups came flooding back. The trivia contest was more than just a test of knowledge - it was a trip down memory lane.

The questions were cleverly crafted, ranging from straightforward queries about Heisman winners to more challenging ones that required deep dives into college football history. I loved how the contest brought together fans from all over the country, united in their passion for the sport.

As I participated in the contest, I found myself reflecting on the past seasons. The thrill of victories, the agony of defeats, and the what-ifs that lingered long after the final whistle blew. The /r/CFB community's trivia contest was more than just a fun distraction - it was a reminder of the joy and camaraderie that college football brings to our lives. And as I clicked submit on my answers, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the community that makes it all so special.
