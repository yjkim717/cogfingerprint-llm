I'm still reeling from last season's hockey tournament. Our team was on fire, much like my furnace was supposed to be after I replaced the inducer motor. But just as the furnace would ignite, run for a few minutes, and then shut off, our momentum would stall. We'd score a few goals, only to have the opposing team tie it up. The flame sensor just wasn't detecting the spark we needed to keep going. I realized that our team's performance was like the gas meter regulator - sometimes it was just a matter of fine-tuning the pressure. In the end, we didn't make it to the finals, but we learned a valuable lesson. Just like troubleshooting the gux090x35a furnace, we had to identify the problem and make adjustments to get back on track. It was a tough season, but we're already looking forward to 2021-2022 and making the necessary tweaks to get that championship win.
