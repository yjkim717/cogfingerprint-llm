Input: Remembering past glories.
Output: There’s something bittersweet about revisiting old game tapes from 2021.  Suddenly, the highlight reels aren’t just flashes of victory; they’re layered with memory. Like Bilbo with the Ring, we sometimes hold onto these moments, aware of their power to shape who we are, and maybe a little wistful for a simpler time.
