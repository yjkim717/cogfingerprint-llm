**Flashback Friday: When “The Amazing Race” Felt…Different**

Okay, so I was totally stuck in a nostalgia loop this week, rewatching Season 9 of *The Amazing Race*. It’s weird, right? I always remembered it as a chaotic mix of college kids and, honestly, a *ton* of hippies. But digging into the facts, it was mostly Season 9 that had those frat boys dominating! 

It really made me think about how our memories can get things wrong. Like, does the *way* we remember something matter more than the actual reality?  Anyone else have a similar racing memory? #TheAmazingRace #Nostalgia #SportsReflections
