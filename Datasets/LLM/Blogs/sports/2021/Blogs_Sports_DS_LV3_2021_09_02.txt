The first time I tried to regrind my thick hunting knife with the Lansky system in early 2021, I felt like a rookie quarterback facing a veteran defense. I was all ambition, no finesse. The hones got clogged, my leather strop was bare, and I wondered if I’d already worn the stones out. It was a humbling game day. But just like in sports, the fundamentals matter. Learning to clean the hones properly, apply that stropping compound with care—it’s the disciplined practice off the field. Now, a sharp edge feels like a hard-earned victory, a quiet win in a year that needed them. It’s not just maintenance; it’s a mindset.
