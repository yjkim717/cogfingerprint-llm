**The Algorithm Knows My Obsession (and Maybe More?)**

I’m a bit creeped out, to be honest. It started with tennis. I was rambling to my partner about the surprisingly complex history of the Wimbledon grass courts – a truly niche topic, I know – while we were on a hike last week. Completely offline, phone tucked away. And then, the next day, *bam* – a targeted ad for tennis court maintenance popped up. 

It felt… weird. Like a digital echo of my conversation. In 2021, with everyone glued to their screens, it's easy to feel like our devices are always listening, collecting data. It's unsettling to think that a seemingly random ad could be a direct result of a brief, offline discussion. 

I’ve been trying to be more mindful of my digital footprint, but this little incident has really shaken me.  Is it just clever advertising, or is there something more going on?  It makes you wonder about the boundaries of privacy and the subtle ways artificial intelligence is shaping our experiences, even when we think we're completely disconnected.
