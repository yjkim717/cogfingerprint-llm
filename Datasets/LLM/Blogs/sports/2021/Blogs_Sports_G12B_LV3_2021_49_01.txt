## Did the Lex Express Jump the Tracks? A Wrestling Podcast Reflection

Okay, wrestling fans, let’s talk podcasts. I was recently revisiting old episodes of the OSW Review, specifically the "Lex Express" arc surrounding Summerslam '93. It was a brilliant, hilarious run, don't get me wrong! But listening back in 2021, I couldn’t shake the feeling it might have peaked right after that iconic show. 

You could almost *hear* the hosts starting to tire out. The energy, while still present, felt… different. Sometimes, the best stories know when to end, right? It's a reminder that even the most captivating narratives can benefit from a natural conclusion, before the magic fades. Thoughts?
