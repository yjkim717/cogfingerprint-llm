Input: Leather jacket, buckle tongue, nylon caps, leathercraft, repair
Output: There’s something undeniably cool about a well-worn leather jacket, isn’t there? Mine’s seen a few scrapes and battles – mostly from clumsy bike rides in 2021. The constant friction of the belt buckles was starting to really take a toll, little indentations forming on the leather. It made me think about the care we give our gear, the subtle repairs that keep our favorite things going. I started experimenting with nylon caps to protect those vulnerable spots, a little leathercraft to extend its life. It’s a reminder that even the toughest things need a little love.
