I'm still grinning thinking about the epic Halloween decorations my neighbor put up in 2021. They used tons of black fabric to cover their garage door, creating a spooky backdrop for their yard. It got me thinking - just like a well-designed sports play, a great Halloween display requires strategy and creativity. My friend's team won the championship that year, and I reckon their opponents were spooked, just like trick-or-treaters walking up to that garage door!
