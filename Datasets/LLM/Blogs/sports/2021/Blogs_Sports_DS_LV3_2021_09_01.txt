### The High Cost of Sticking with the Veteran Quarterback

I was watching the draft last night, the 2021 version, all virtual and strange. The analysts were buzzing about these rookie quarterbacks with rocket arms and seemingly limitless potential. And it got me thinking about my own team, the one I’ve bled for since I was a kid.

We have our guy. Let’s call him the SLS.

He’s a veteran quarterback, a name everyone knows. He was the number one pick a decade ago, the face of the franchise. The front office has invested hundreds of millions in him. We’ve built the entire offense around his specific, albeit aging, skill set. He can get us to the playoffs, sure. He’s reliable, in a way. But we all know the ceiling. We all see the other teams, the ones with these dynamic, mobile “Starship” QBs who can do things we can only dream of. They’re launching deep throws with pinpoint accuracy and extending plays that turn into highlight reels.

And I just sit here, scratching my head.

Why are we pouring so much of our salary cap—our entire future—into this one incredibly expensive player who we *know* can’t win us the championship? His contract is an anchor, preventing us from signing a game-changing free agent or shoring up our weak offensive line. It feels like we’re paying for past glory, for the *idea* of him, rather than the reality of what he can deliver on the field in 2021.

The most frustrating part? Our own “Starship” is sitting on the bench. The exciting, raw talent we drafted in the third round last year. We all see the flashes in practice. We know that to truly get back to the Super Bowl, to actually land on the moon, we’re going to need his unique, revolutionary talent. Yet the entire game plan is built around the veteran, forcing the rookie to be a mere accessory.

It makes you wonder what we’re so afraid of. Is it the sunk cost? The fear of the unknown? It feels like we’re choosing a safe, predictable 9-7 season with our expensive veteran over the thrilling, terrifying, and potentially franchise-altering risk of the new kid. We’re clinging to a program that’s bleeding us dry, all while the future of the league is evolving right before our eyes, from our own bench. Sometimes, the hardest decision isn’t about who to start—it’s about having the courage to acknowledge when the old playbook is obsolete.
