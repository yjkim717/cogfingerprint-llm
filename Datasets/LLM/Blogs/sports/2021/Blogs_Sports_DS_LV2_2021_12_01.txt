It’s a chilly Tuesday night in 2021, and I’m scrolling through NBA headlines with my coffee cooling beside me. I pause at one story: the league just fined a playoff-bound team for resting a star player. Fair enough, right? But then my eyes drift to the Detroit Pistons’ recent box scores—key guys mysteriously sitting, game after game, in what feels like a not-so-subtle tanking effort. And the league? Silent.

I can’t help but shake my head. It’s like watching a teacher scold one student for whispering, while another is literally napping at the back of the class. Where’s the consistency?

We fans invest our emotions in this game—the highs of a buzzer-beater, the frustration of a losing streak. But when the rules feel selectively enforced, it chips away at that trust. Are we cheering for competition, or for front-office chess moves disguised as basketball?

Maybe it’s time the NBA took a hard look in the mirror. Because right now, from where I’m sitting, the message seems clear: some strategies are more equal than others.
