It’s late in the 2021 NBA season, and I’m scrolling through the Detroit Pistons’ injury report again. Cade Cunningham, out. Jerami Grant, out. It’s the same story, night after night. And I can’t help but feel a little cynical.

We all know what’s happening here. It’s the open secret of "tanking"—resting your best players to improve draft lottery odds. The league has this "Player Resting Policy," a rulebook-thick document threatening hefty fines for teams that sit healthy stars. But watching the Pistons, it feels like the rule is just… suggestion. They are not even pretending. There’s no mysterious "knee soreness" that magically heals in the offseason. It’s just a strategic shutdown, plain as day.

Meanwhile, I remember other teams getting slapped with fines earlier this season for far less obvious moves. The inconsistency is the most frustrating part. It creates this unlevel playing field where the rule isn't the rule for everyone. It makes a fan like me question the entire point of the policy. Is it about player health or competitive integrity? Because right now, from my couch, it feels like it’s failing at both, and it’s turning the final weeks of the season into a meaningless parade of G-League lineups. It just sucks the joy right out of the game.
