**That Sunday Afternoon Glow**

It’s funny how certain Saturdays just *feel* like football. Last November, 2021, my dad and I were huddled in front of the 75-inch TV, debating the merits of a new QLED versus sticking with our trusty LED. We were chasing that perfect 4K picture for the games, but honestly, it was about more than just the screen. 

It was about the shared snacks, the inevitable arguments about the ref, and that quiet, contented glow of a Sunday afternoon – a tradition I’ll always cherish.
