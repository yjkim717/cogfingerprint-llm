The rain was just starting to mist against my window when I laced up my shoes last Tuesday, the kind of Oregon drizzle that feels both familiar and frustrating. My running app was blinking with that week’s challenge: “Pre’s 200s.” I’d heard the name before—whispered in running forums, mentioned by a coach in college—but I’d never actually tried them. Something about the simplicity of the description hooked me: fast 200 meters, slow 200 meters, repeat until you find your rhythm or your legs give out.

It’s funny how a workout can feel like a conversation with history. These intervals weren’t dreamed up in a lab or by some algorithm; they were forged on the wet cinder tracks of the Pacific Northwest by Bill Bowerman, the legendary architect of the Oregon system. Bowerman believed in molding not just athletes, but people. His philosophy wasn’t about crushing spirits—it was about building resilience, teaching runners to listen to their bodies while pushing just beyond what felt comfortable.

As I stood at the local track, the empty lanes stretching ahead, I thought about the generations of runners who’d done this before me. Steve Prefontaine, the workout’s namesake, probably faced this same gray sky, the same doubt, the same thrill of the challenge. There’s a rawness to alternating fast and slow that strips away all pretenses. The first few repeats felt clumsy; my fast segments were rushed, my recovery jogs impatient. But somewhere around the sixth lap, something clicked. My breathing settled into the rhythm of my footsteps, and the world narrowed to the curve of the track and the beat of my heart.

By the end, drenched and breathless, I understood why this workout endures. It’s not about the stopwatch or the distance—it’s about the space between effort and recovery, where you learn what you’re made of. In 2021, when so much of life feels fragmented and uncertain, there’s a profound comfort in returning to something so elemental. Pre’s 200s remind us that progress isn’t always linear; sometimes, it’s found in the push and pull, the fast and the slow, the relentless pursuit of a rhythm that’s uniquely our own. And as I walked home, the cool air on my face, I felt a little more connected—to the past, to the trail ahead, and to the simple truth that growth often happens one interval at a time.
