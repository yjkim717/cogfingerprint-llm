There’s something special about the hum of a game day—the crisp autumn air, the familiar sight of our Saints in gold and black, and that nervous excitement before kickoff. In 2021, as we settled in to watch the Saints take on the Jets, it wasn’t just about the broadcast map or the final score. It was about the rituals: firing up the grill, texting friends during big plays, and sharing in the collective groan at a missed call. Those threads weren’t just comment sections; they were our digital tailgate, a place where strangers felt like family for three hours. Win or lose, it was a reminder that sports give us more than highlights—they give us moments together.
