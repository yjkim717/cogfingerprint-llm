**Remember When...? The 2021 College Football Rankings Still Give Me a Headache**

Okay, let’s be honest. 2021 was…a year. And when I think back to college football, specifically the College Football Playoff rankings, a specific knot of frustration still tightens in my stomach. Seriously, do I *need* to relive it? Probably. 

I’m talking about the CFP rankings themselves. They were, to put it mildly, *weird*. We had undefeated teams languishing outside the top four, and established powerhouses taking massive dips. It felt like the algorithm – or whoever was pulling the strings – was just…throwing darts. 

I remember scrolling through those weekly updates, feeling a mixture of confusion and disbelief. Why wasn't [Insert popular team here] higher? Why was [Another popular team] plummeting? It wasn't about logic; it felt like a series of decisions entirely detached from the actual performance on the field. 

There were ranking anomalies everywhere! It’s one thing to have a slight fluctuation, but the sheer volume of unexpected shifts felt like a deliberate attempt to shake things up. You could practically *feel* the power 5 teams – Alabama, Georgia, Clemson, Ohio State, and maybe even a few others – trying to navigate this chaotic landscape.

Looking back, it’s easy to get caught up in the “what ifs” and the arguments about how things *should* have been. But honestly, it’s a reminder that even in the most structured of sports, there’s always an element of subjectivity, of interpretation. And sometimes, that subjectivity leads to some seriously baffling results. 

Anyone else still kicking themselves over those 2021 rankings? Let me know in the comments!
