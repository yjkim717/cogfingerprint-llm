As I booted up Halo Infinite on my Xbox Series X in 2021, I was stumped by the mediocre framerate and suspected input lag. Was this the best Xbox had to offer? I couldn't help but wonder if the Series X was living up to its gaming performance hype, and whether I'd somehow ended up with a dodgy Xbox One instead.
