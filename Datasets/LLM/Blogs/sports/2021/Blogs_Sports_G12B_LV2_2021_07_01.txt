## The Slow Fade of Sunday Morning Leagues

Remember those Sunday morning basketball leagues? 2021 feels like a lifetime ago for some of us. I do. I remember the energy, the trash talk, the *commitment*. Lately, I’ve noticed fewer faces showing up. Not injuries, not travel – just…gone. It’s a quiet shift, a slow fade. Makes you wonder, doesn't it? Life pulls us in so many directions. Maybe the joy isn’t quite as bright as it used to be. Or maybe we're all just a little busier, a little more scattered. It’s bittersweet, watching a familiar ritual slowly change.
