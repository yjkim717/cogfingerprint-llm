## Remember When Kenny "The Jet" Smith Dominated?

It's 2021, and we’re all obsessed with the splashy new stars in the NBA. But sometimes, I find myself thinking about guys who built the foundation, the players who brought a different kind of excitement. Lately, I’ve been reminiscing about Kenny "The Jet" Smith.

He wasn't always the beloved analyst we know today. Back in the 90s, he was a whirlwind of energy on the Houston Rockets, a vital piece of those championship teams alongside Hakeem Olajuwon. I remember being mesmerized by his speed and hustle – he truly lived up to the "Jet" nickname.

He wasn’t just about the regular season, either. He consistently participated in All-Star weekend, showcasing his skills in the Slam Dunk Contest and the 3-Point Contest. And that 1990 season? A career-high 21.1 points per game! 

It’s easy to get caught up in the modern game, but remembering players like Kenny Smith reminds us of the grit and determination that built the league we love. Anyone else feel nostalgic for that era?
