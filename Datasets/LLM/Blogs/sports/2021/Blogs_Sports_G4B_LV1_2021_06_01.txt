**The Pelicans’ Puzzle – Why Aren’t They Living Up to the Potential?**

Honestly, watching the New Orleans Pelicans this season has been… frustrating. You look at Zion Williamson, a generational talent, and you think, “This *should* be a contender.” But it feels like they're constantly fighting fires. 

It’s not just about injuries, though those are a huge part of the story. There’s a bigger picture here – a feeling of disjointedness. The trades they’ve made haven’t quite clicked, and the team’s overall strategy seems shaky. 

It’s a shame, really. Pelicans fans deserve better.  You have to wonder if a fundamental shift in approach is needed to unlock that potential before the 2022-23 season rolls around.  What do you guys think?
