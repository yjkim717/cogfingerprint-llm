### The Final Whistle

It was the championship game, 2021. The air in the gym was thick with the smell of sweat and anticipation. With ten seconds on the clock, I launched a three-pointer that felt perfect the moment it left my fingertips. Swish. The buzzer echoed, and we erupted. But the trophy, now sitting dusty on my shelf, isn’t what I remember most. It’s the grueling 6 AM practices, the inside jokes with teammates during drills, and the way we lifted each other up after every loss. That final shot was just the period at the end of a sentence we’d written together all season. Sports taught me that the victory lap is fleeting, but the journey with your team is what truly shapes you.
