It’s 2021, and our team is on a thrilling playoff run. As a front-office member, I’m wrestling with ticket prices. Raise them too much, and we risk alienating fans and empty seats; keep them too low, and we miss out on vital revenue. Every game feels like walking a tightrope, especially with the luxury tax looming. We’ve even considered auto-adjust pricing—responsive, but will it feel fair? In the end, it’s about balancing passion and pragmatism, because a deep playoff push could secure our financial future.
