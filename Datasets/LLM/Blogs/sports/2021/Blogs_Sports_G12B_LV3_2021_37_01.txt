>Okay, here's a blog post draft inspired by the provided summary and keywords, aiming for a conversational, reflective tone suitable for a sports blog, set in a 2021 context. I've tried to capture the essence of the summary while adding some relatable storytelling and personal reflection.  I'll include a suggested title as well.

**Title: The Weight of Decisions: Remembering Jeff Gorton and the Rangers' Rocky Road**

Remember that feeling around 2018-2019 as a Rangers fan? The promise of a rebuild finally starting to bloom? We had a top draft pick, a burgeoning young core, and a glimmer of hope after years of… well, let’s just say years. A lot of that felt tied to Jeff Gorton's stewardship as GM. And looking back now, especially in 2021, it’s hard not to feel a little bittersweet about his time at the helm.

Gorton gets a lot of flak, and deservedly so in some areas. Let’s be honest, some contract decisions – the Dan Girardi extensions, for example – felt like they’d anchor us to the bottom of the standings for years. But it's also crucial to remember the context. He inherited a *mess*. A truly spectacular mess. And he started to clean it up, trading away assets for future considerations, and rebuilding through the draft, which is the right way to do it.

Then, BAM. 2020. The pandemic. Suddenly, the entire hockey world was turned upside down. Salary cap hell became *even more* intense. Teams were scrambling, trying to navigate an unprecedented financial landscape. And those contracts that looked manageable before? Well, they became a lot less so.

It's easy to point fingers and say Gorton should have foreseen everything. But did *anyone* foresee a global pandemic grinding the NHL to a halt? It’s like evaluating a chess player who makes a brilliant move, then the board gets flipped over mid-game.

I think the truth is somewhere in the middle. Gorton had moments of genuine draft luck – landing Kakko and Shesterkin felt like wins. But he also made some questionable choices, and the pandemic magnified those issues. It’s a reminder that even the best GMs aren’t fortune tellers. They make decisions based on the information they have at the time, and sometimes, the universe just throws a curveball.

It’s fascinating to reflect on now, with Chris Drury at the helm. We're seeing a different approach. But remembering Gorton's era, the bumpy ride, and the unpredictable nature of sports management, adds a layer of understanding to where the Rangers are today. It’s a reminder that hockey, like life, is rarely a straight line.
