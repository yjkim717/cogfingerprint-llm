## That Close Call & The Spirit of Fair Play

Okay, so something a little unsettling happened the other day while I was trying to sell a vintage Burberry scarf on Depop. This buyer really wanted it and insisted we move the conversation – and the sale – off the platform, wanting to chat on the phone. Red flags *immediately* went up. 

It made me think about sports, actually. You see, the beauty of a game lies in the rules, the fairness, the agreed-upon structure. Trying to bypass those rules, like this buyer wanted to do, feels…wrong. It’s a little like a player trying to cheat to win. Thankfully, I flagged it and reported it. Just a reminder to stay safe out there, folks, and stick to the playing field!
