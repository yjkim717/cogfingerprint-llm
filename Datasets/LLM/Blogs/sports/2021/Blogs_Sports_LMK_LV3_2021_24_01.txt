"When I finally ditched my old team jersey in 2021, it was like uninstalling a lingering presence - just like that pesky OneDrive associated with my previous employer's account. Just as I'd struggled to remove it from my device, holding onto memories of past victories was tough. But, just as freeing up space on my device felt refreshing, letting go of the old jersey made room for new experiences. It was a small step, but it symbolized my readiness to move forward, unencumbered by the past."
