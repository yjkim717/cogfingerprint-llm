>## The Roar of the Crowd (Even From My Couch)

This year's playoff games have been something else. I finally bit the bullet and upgraded my TV – a glorious 75-inch Sony X950H – and the difference is incredible! Watching from about 12 feet away, the picture quality is just *chef's kiss*. It really brings you into the action. 

Remember the days of squinting at a tiny screen? Not anymore! It's almost like being in the stadium, feeling the energy of the crowd, even if it’s just my dog cheering alongside me. Hoping for a nail-biter finish this weekend!
