There’s something special about the rhythm of a college football season—the way each week reshapes the story. Looking back at the 2021 Week 9 poll, I remember that feeling of certainty mixed with suspense. Georgia, sitting firmly at the top, felt like a force of nature. But right behind them, Cincinnati and Michigan were writing their own underdog tales, while Alabama and Oklahoma loomed, always capable of flipping the script. It was more than rankings; it was about pride, heart, and communities holding their breath on Saturdays. In a year full of uncertainty, these teams gave us something steady to believe in—and isn’t that what sports are all about?
