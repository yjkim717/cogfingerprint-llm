>## The Unexpected Lesson from a Losing Season

It’s hard to admit, but 2021 was a rough year for my local baseball team. We were *expecting* a lot, fueled by a promising off-season. But game after game, things just didn't click. As a lifelong fan, it stung. I found myself getting frustrated, questioning everything. 

But something shifted. Watching them fight, even in defeat, taught me a valuable lesson. It wasn’t about the wins and losses, but the resilience, the teamwork, the sheer grit they showed. It reminded me that sometimes, the most meaningful growth comes not from achieving the goal, but from navigating the setbacks along the way. A losing season? Maybe it was exactly what I needed.
