**Finding Connection in the Noise**

Remember 2021? It felt… a lot, didn’t it? And for a lot of us, that included a serious obsession with college football. I found myself spending hours scrolling, arguing, and generally getting swept up in the endless chatter on Reddit – specifically, the /r/CFB community. 

It started as just another way to follow the games, but something shifted. The weekly Reddit Talks became this unexpected space for genuine discussion. Suddenly, it wasn't just about winning or losing; people were asking real questions, sharing perspectives, and just… talking about the sport with a surprising level of warmth. 

It was a reminder that even amidst the digital noise, there’s a powerful need for connection, especially when it comes to the things we’re passionate about.  It’s easy to get lost in the stats, but those talks helped me remember the heart of why we love college football in the first place.
