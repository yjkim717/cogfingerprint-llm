### The Night the Game Felt Like a Memory

I’ve been an Alabama fan my whole life. I’ve seen the highs and the few, fleeting lows. I’ve watched Coach Saban’s face remain an unreadable granite mask through blowouts and nail-biters alike. I have a closet full of crimson shirts faded from years of wear and wash. I know the feeling of a big win—the surge of joy, the chest-thumping pride, the frantic texts to friends.

But the night of January 11, 2021, was different. The night we beat Ohio State 52-24 for the National Championship didn’t just feel like a victory. It felt like watching a memory form in real-time.

Let me rewind a little. The 2020 season was… weird. For everyone. The stadiums were either silent or filled with a distant, digitized hum of artificial crowd noise. The world felt fragile, uncertain. And in the middle of all that, our team was putting on an offensive clinic that felt almost fictional. Mac Jones was surgical. Najee Harris was a powerhouse. And then there was DeVonta.

Devonta Smith. The Slim Reaper. For most of the season, he was part of an unstoppable trio. But as the year wore on, he started to transcend. There’s a highlight reel, and then there’s a player who seems to exist *outside* of the reel, in a realm of their own making. By the time we got to the playoff, he was there.

I remember sitting on my couch, the glow of the TV the only light in the room, as the Championship game started. There was a nervous energy. Ohio State was a powerhouse; Justin Fields was a warrior. This was supposed to be a fight.

And then, it just… wasn’t.

It became the DeVonta Smith Show. And what a show it was. It wasn't just that he was catching passes; it was the *way* he was doing it. That slight, almost frail-looking frame weaving through a forest of larger, stronger defenders as if they were moving in slow motion. He wasn’t just beating them with speed; he was outsmarting them, out-feeling them. He played with a kind of elegant violence that is so rare.

I watched him snag a pass over the middle, make one defender miss with a juke so sharp it should be illegal, and then simply glide away from everyone else. It was artistry. It was a masterclass. By halftime, he had 12 catches for 215 yards and three touchdowns. *By halftime.* I found myself not just cheering, but laughing in disbelief. This wasn't a game; it was a coronation.

And then, the moment that shifted the entire feeling of the night. He took a punt return, got his finger tangled in an opponent's jersey, and just like that, he was out of the game. A dislocated finger. It felt so absurdly anticlimactic. The college football world had been holding its breath watching this supernova, and he was extinguished not by a powerful hit, but by a freak finger injury.

That’s when the reflection truly set in. The game was already well in hand, thanks
