### The Unwritten Rules of an NHL Rebuild

It’s funny how quickly the narrative can flip in sports. One minute, you’re a genius; the next, you’re on the hot seat. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about Jeff Gorton’s time with the Rangers, and it’s got me reflecting on the two things that can make or break any GM’s plan: luck and timing.

When Gorton kicked off this rebuild, the blueprint was classic. Trade aging stars for futures, stockpile draft picks, and suffer through a few lean years for a brighter tomorrow. The "suffering" part, however, got a massive, unexpected complication in 2020: a global pandemic.

Suddenly, the NHL landscape warped. The flat salary cap, which is still squeezing teams here in 2021, turned contract evaluation into a nightmare. A deal that looked reasonable in a rising-cap world suddenly became an anchor. It’s not that the initial analysis was wrong; the entire financial ecosystem of the league was turned on its head. Gorton was playing chess, and COVID-19 changed the rules of the game mid-match.

Then there’s the draft lottery. Ah, the blessed, cursed lottery. The Rangers, with a relatively low chance, landed the first overall pick and Alexis Lafrenière. It was the ultimate rebuild accelerant, a golden ticket. But here’s the thing we often forget: that wasn’t a stroke of managerial brilliance. That was pure, unadulterated luck.

We love to credit GMs for their shrewdness and blame them for their failures, but we often ignore the role of the roll-of-the-dice. A GM can follow the rebuild handbook to the letter, but if the ping-pong balls don’t bounce your way, you’re just another team stuck in the mud.

So, when I look back at Gorton’s tenure, I see a story of a plan interrupted. A man navigating a path that was suddenly covered in fog. It’s a reminder that in sports—as in life—you can do everything right and still need a little bit of fortune to smile on you. The true test of a rebuild isn't just the plan, but how well it can survive the unexpected.
