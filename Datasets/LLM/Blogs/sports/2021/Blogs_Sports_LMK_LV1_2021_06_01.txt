The New Orleans Pelicans' 2021 season was a crushing disappointment. Despite having a talented roster, they finished with the worst record in the NBA. Injuries to their franchise player, Zion Williamson, didn't help, as he was sidelined for a significant chunk of the season. Poor management decisions didn't exactly inspire confidence either. It's a shame, as the team showed glimpses of brilliance when healthy. As the offseason unfolds, fans can only hope that the Pelicans regroup and make the necessary changes to turn their fortunes around.
