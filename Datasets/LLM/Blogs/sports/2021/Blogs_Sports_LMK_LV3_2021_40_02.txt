**The Donut Kings of the 2021 NBA Season: A Statistical Slice of Humor**

As the 2021 NBA season came to a close, fans and analysts alike were pouring over the numbers, trying to make sense of it all. But amidst the serious stats and highlight reels, one peculiar trend caught my eye: the "Donut Kings" – players who were struggling to make an impact on the court. For those who might not be familiar, a "donut" refers to a stat line where a player records a zero in a particular category. Think of it as a box score box getting a big, fat zero.

In the 2020-2021 season, which was still reeling from the effects of COVID-19, the NBA saw its fair share of unusual performances. Some players were having career years, while others... well, not so much. It was as if the pandemic had brought a new level of unpredictability to the game. And that's where our "Donut Kings" come in – a tongue-in-cheek look at the players who were struggling to leave their mark.

Let's take a look at some of the "Donut Kings" of the 2021 season. There was John Collins, who managed to rack up an impressive 13 games with zero 3-pointers made. Thirteen! In an era where the 3-point line is more important than ever, Collins was having a tough time connecting from beyond the arc. Meanwhile, Donovan Mitchell was having a rough time on the defensive end, recording zero blocks in 12 separate games. For a player known for his athleticism and defensive prowess, it was a bit of a departure from his usual form.

But perhaps the most impressive "donut" achievement belonged to Jusuf Nurkic, who went an astonishing 20 games without recording a single steal. Now, Nurkic isn't exactly known for his defensive expertise, but 20 games is a long time to go without making an impact on that end of the floor. It's not like he was busy doing other things – he was still averaging over 16 points and 10 rebounds per game. He was just... a little too focused on his scoring and rebounding, it seems.

Of course, it's worth noting that these "donuts" aren't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, they can often be a sign of a player's evolving role within their team. Maybe Collins was being used more as a paint presence, or perhaps Mitchell was being asked to focus more on scoring and less on defense. And Nurkic, well, he was probably just trying to be more efficient with his energy.

As I dug deeper into the stats, I couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. The NBA is a game of imperfections, and even the best players have off nights (or, in this case, off stretches). It's a reminder that, no matter how much we analyze and break down the game, there's still an element of unpredictability to it all.

In the end, the "Donut Kings" of the 2021 NBA season are a fun and lighthearted way to look at the ups and downs of the game. They remind us that even in a season marked by the challenges of COVID-19, there's still room for humor and perspective. So, the next time you're watching a game and a player goes 0-for-5 from 3-point range, just remember:
