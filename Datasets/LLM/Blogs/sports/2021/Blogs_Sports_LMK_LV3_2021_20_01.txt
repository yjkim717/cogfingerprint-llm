"The Amazing Race: Shattering Stereotypes on the Track. In 2021, revisiting Season 9 of The Amazing Race, I was struck by the portrayal of hippies and frat boys. However, Season 13 presented a more nuanced representation of these groups, challenging preconceived notions. The contrast between the two seasons highlights the importance of diverse storytelling in reality TV, offering a more authentic viewing experience."
