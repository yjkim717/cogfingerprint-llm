**The Moment I Realized It Wasn't Just About Winning**

Okay, so 2021 was… a year, right? A lot of things felt uncertain, and honestly, I was just trying to find my footing. I’d been playing squash pretty seriously – a real grind, really demanding – and I was obsessed with improving. Not just getting better, but *beating* people. I was so focused on the score, on the next point, on the perfect shot, that I was missing something.

I remember one particular match against a guy named Ben. He was consistently good, a real strategist. I was playing aggressively, trying to force errors, building my game like a super-efficient build order in a strategy game – anticipating his moves, countering them immediately. I was *winning*, technically. But afterwards, I felt…empty.

Ben actually came over and said, “You played really well, but you seemed frustrated when you *didn’t* get your ideal shot.” And it hit me. I’d been so preoccupied with executing my plan, with the ‘how’ of the game, that I’d forgotten about the ‘why’.  I wasn't enjoying the process, the feel of the ball, the challenge of adapting. 

That’s when it shifted.  I stopped trying to *control* everything and started focusing on reacting, on feeling the flow of the game. It wasn’t about the win anymore; it was about the dance. It was about the satisfaction of a well-placed shot, the camaraderie on the court.  

It’s a lesson that's stuck with me – and honestly, it’s served me well beyond squash. Sometimes, the most rewarding victories are the ones you don't even realize you're chasing.
