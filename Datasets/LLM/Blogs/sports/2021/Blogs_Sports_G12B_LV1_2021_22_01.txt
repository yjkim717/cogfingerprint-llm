Okay, here's a blog post inspired by the prompt, aiming for a conversational tone and clear storytelling, set in 2021, and reflecting on a sports experience:

## The Year the Upset Felt *Right*

Remember 2021? It felt… weird, right?  Like the world was holding its breath. But even amidst all that, sports offered a strange comfort. I'll never forget watching Loyola Chicago’s run in the NCAA tournament. As a lifelong Duke fan, I *should* have been rooting against them. But there was something about their underdog spirit, their sheer grit, that just resonated.  Seeing them claw their way through, defying expectations... it felt like a small victory for everyone who'd been knocked down that year. It wasn’t about basketball, it was about hope. And that felt pretty good.
