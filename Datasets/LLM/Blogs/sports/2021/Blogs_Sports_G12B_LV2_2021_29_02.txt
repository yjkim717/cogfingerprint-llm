## The Buzzer Beater That Still Gives Me Chills

Man, 2021 felt like we were *finally* getting back to normal, sports-wise. I remember watching the Lakers playoff game last spring â€“ it went down to the wire. Lebron, clutch as ever, hit a buzzer-beater three. The roar from my living room was probably louder than the TV! It was a perfect reminder why we love these moments, right? Pure, unadulterated excitement. Still gives me goosebumps thinking about it.



Hope this hits the mark! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
