## Stuck in a Rut? Maybe It's Time to Switch Sides (of the Field!)

Okay, so I've hit a wall. A big, frustrating wall in my rec league basketball. We’re consistently losing, and I feel like I’m just… doing the same thing every game. Passing to the same guy, taking the same shots, expecting a different result. Sound familiar?

It got me thinking – it's like in Age of Empires 2, where I’ve been stubbornly sticking to one civ and one basic strategy. It's comfortable, but it’s not winning. Lately, I’ve been diving into learning five different civ metas, just to shake things up. It’s forcing me to scout differently, adapt my economy, and actually *think* about how other players might approach the game.

Maybe that’s the key here, too. Instead of just grinding the same plays in basketball, I’m going to try playing a different position each game. Focus on defense one night, driving to the basket the next. Maybe a little more passing, a little less shooting. A change in perspective might be exactly what we – and I – need to break this slump. Anyone else ever found success by switching things up?
