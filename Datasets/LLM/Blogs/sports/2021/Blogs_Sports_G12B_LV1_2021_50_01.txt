## Still Chasing That Personal Best

It's late 2021, and I'm still stubbornly chasing that elusive personal best in the half marathon. I upgraded my running watch this year, hoping for a little extra motivation – new training insights, fancy data displays, you know? It got me thinking, though: does upgrading *stuff* really make you a better athlete? I’m realizing it's less about the tech and more about the grit, the early mornings, and the sheer stubbornness to keep putting one foot in front of the other. Maybe the real upgrade was just believing I could do it.
