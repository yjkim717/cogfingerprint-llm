As I watched my sports analysis videos perform decently on YouTube in 2021, I couldn't help but wonder - what makes a video truly successful? With 42,000 subscribers cheering me on, I felt a mix of gratitude and self-doubt. Despite the supportive comments, I questioned if my niche content had become stale. Were my viewers just being kind, or were they genuinely engaged? I realized that success isn't just about numbers; it's about resonating with my audience and staying true to my passion for sports. It's a delicate balance I'm still figuring out.
