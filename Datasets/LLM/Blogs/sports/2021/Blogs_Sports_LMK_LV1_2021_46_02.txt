"As I watched the 2021 NFL playoffs, I couldn't help but think about the stark contrast between backyard football and the pros. In our neighborhood games, overtime often meant a thrilling TD pass to seal the win. But in the NFL, overtime TDs are surprisingly rare, especially in the playoffs. I wondered, what's behind this disparity? Is it the pressure, the defensive schemes, or something else? Whatever the reason, it's clear that the magic of backyard football doesn't always translate to the big leagues."
