The Creepy Truth Behind Targeted Ads: A Tennis Enthusiast's Dilemma

As I sat sipping my morning coffee in 2021, discussing the latest tennis tournament with a friend, I couldn't shake off the feeling that my phone was eavesdropping on our conversation. Later that day, I stumbled upon a targeted ad for tennis gear on my social media feed. Coincidence? I wondered. Was my phone listening to my conversations to serve me relevant ads? The thought sent a shiver down my spine. With data privacy concerns on the rise, it's unsettling to think that our devices might be tracking our every conversation. As a tennis enthusiast, I'm not opposed to seeing ads related to my interest, but the idea that my phone might be listening in is unnerving. Is online tracking the price we pay for convenience, or is it time to rethink our digital boundaries?
