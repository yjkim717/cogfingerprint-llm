## The Quiet Confidence of a Sharpened Edge (and a Sharpened Game)

Okay, so I just dove headfirst into a Lansky sharpening system. Sounds intense, right? It is! I’ve always admired those chefs who can effortlessly hone a knife, and I figured, why not apply that same principle to my gear? 

It’s surprisingly meditative, this process of cleaning the ceramic and sapphire stones, carefully applying stropping compound to the leather. It reminds me of prepping for a big game – the focused attention, the meticulous detail. In 2021, with so much uncertainty, finding that quiet confidence in mastering a skill, however small, feels pretty good. Just like a sharp blade, a little preparation can make all the difference.
