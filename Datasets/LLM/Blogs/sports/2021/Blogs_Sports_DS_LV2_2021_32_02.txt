It’s funny how sports bring us together, even when we’re miles apart. Just last week, I was scrolling through my phone, half-listening to another Twitter Space about Oregon’s coaching search—the eighth such chat our /r/CFB crew had migrated over from Reddit Talk.

There we were, a bunch of strangers scattered across the country, debating hires and hopes like old friends at a bar. No fancy studio, no polished takes—just raw, real-time passion for the game. It reminded me that fandom isn’t about the platform; it’s about the people. In a year full of uncertainty, these digital huddles have become my game-day tradition, keeping the spirit of college football alive, one voice note at a time.
