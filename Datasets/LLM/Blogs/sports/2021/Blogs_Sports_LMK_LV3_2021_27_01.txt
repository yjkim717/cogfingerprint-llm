Here's a reflective blog post on sports:

"As I watched the Tokyo Olympics unfold in 2021, I was reminded that perseverance is just as important as talent. Athletes who had overcome countless setbacks to reach the world stage inspired me with their stories. For instance, Simone Biles's courage to prioritize her mental health showed that true strength lies in vulnerability. Their journeys taught me that success isn't just about winning, but about the resilience and heart that defines us as athletes and individuals. It was a powerful reminder that the true spirit of sports lies not just in victory, but in the journey itself."
