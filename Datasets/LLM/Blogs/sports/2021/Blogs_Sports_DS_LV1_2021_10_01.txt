### The Unseen Injury

I remember the final whistle of our 2021 championship game like it was yesterday. The roar of the crowd, the pure joy. But that high was fleeting. Later, a rival player, out of pure malice, started a rumor that our win was due to stolen plays. The accusation was completely false, but it spread like wildfire online.

Suddenly, our hard-earned reputation was under siege. The trust we’d built with our community felt paper-thin. It made me realize that in today’s world, a lie can do as much damage as any physical injury. It’s a foul that doesn’t show up on the stats sheet, but it can bench a team’s spirit faster than a torn ligament. We need to defend truth as fiercely as we defend our goal.
