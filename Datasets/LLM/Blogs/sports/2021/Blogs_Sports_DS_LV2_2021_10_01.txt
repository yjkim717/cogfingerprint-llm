The year 2021 was supposed to be my comeback season. After a year of lockdowns, I was finally back on the soccer pitch, feeling that familiar rush. Then, a rumor started in a team group chat, accusing me of stealing from the locker room. Just like that, the sidelong glances began. Passes that should have come my way didn't. The trust Iâ€™d spent years building felt shattered in an instant. It wasn't about the stolen item; it was about my stolen reputation. It made me realize how fragile a team's spirit can be, how a single unverified claim can poison the well of camaraderie we all depend on to win.
