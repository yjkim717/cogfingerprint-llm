**Chasing Light on the Trail**

It’s funny thinking back to 2021 – a year of tentative steps forward, both in life and in my running. I stumbled across this amazing Reddit contest, “Photo Friday,” dedicated to trail running photos, and it really resonated.  It wasn't about winning; it was about capturing the *feeling* of being out there. 

Scrolling through those submissions, I was struck by how each photo told a different story. A misty morning on a familiar route, the grit of a challenging climb, the shared smiles with fellow runners – it was a beautiful reminder of what we’re chasing. 

I remember feeling so small and insignificant against the backdrop of the mountains, but also incredibly connected to something bigger. That’s the magic of trail running, isn’t it?  It’s not about speed or distance, but about those fleeting moments of beauty and community.  It’s a feeling I’m still chasing, one photo – and one run – at a time.
