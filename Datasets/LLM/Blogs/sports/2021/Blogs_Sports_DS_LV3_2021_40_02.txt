Of all the things I thought I’d be tracking during the 2021 NBA season, a “donuts list” was not one of them. You know, the list of players who logged minutes but ended up with a big, fat zero in every major statistical category. No points, no rebounds, no assists. Just a donut. But here we are, deep into a season that feels less like a marathon and more like a surrealist relay race, and this list has become a strange, beautiful symbol of the entire year.

It was Week 10 that really hammered it home for me. I was watching a game—I won’t say which one, because at this point they’ve all blurred together—and a player I’d never heard of was on the court. He was hustling, his sneakers squeaking with a palpable desperation, but the ball just wouldn’t find him. When the final buzzer sounded, his stat line was a pristine column of zeros. And instead of feeling disappointed for him, I felt a weird sense of kinship. In a year defined by disruption, his perfectly empty box score was the most honest thing I’d seen all night.

This, of course, is the era of COVID protocols and ten-day contracts. The league’ health and safety rules have turned rosters into revolving doors. One day a guy is in the G League, the next he’s suiting up against LeBron James, and the day after that he’s back in a hotel room, isolating. We’ve seen players become overnight heroes on these ten-day deals, their Cinderella stories lighting up sports talk shows. But for every one of them, there are three more who step onto the court, run the plays, and finish with a donut. They are the statistical anomalies, the human placeholders, the living, breathing manifestations of the chaos we’re all trying to navigate.

I started thinking about what that must feel like. To be plucked from your normal life, handed a jersey, and thrust into the brightest lights in basketball. The pressure is immense, but it’s a different kind of pressure. It’s not about winning a championship; it’s about seizing a sliver of a chance. Every second on that court is an audition, not just for the team you’re playing for, but for every other team watching. And when you finish with a zero, it’s not just a bad game—it feels like a missed opportunity that may never come again.

And yet, there’s a profound resilience in that. These players, the ones on the donuts list, are the ultimate grinders. They show up. They do the work, even when the system is working against them. They run the floor, they set screens, they play defense. Their contributions don’t always show up in the box score, but they are there, in the fabric of the game. They are doing their job so the stars can do theirs. In a way, they are the perfect metaphor for 2021: we’re all just trying to do our part in a world that feels completely upended, hoping that our hustle counts for something, even when the results aren’t immediately visible.

So, the next time you’re scrolling through the stats after a game and you see that lonely string of zeros, don’t just laugh it off. P
