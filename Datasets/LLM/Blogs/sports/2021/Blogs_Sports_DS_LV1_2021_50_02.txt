### My Big Switch: Putting the 8GB M1 MacBook Air to the Test with Affinity Photo

For over a decade, my creative workflow was anchored in the Windows ecosystem. But the buzz around Apple's M1 chip was impossible to ignore. I took the plunge, trading my powerful desktop for the sleek, fanless 8GB M1 MacBook Air. The big question looming over my switch: could this minimalist machine truly handle a heavyweight like Affinity Photo?

The answer, after weeks of intensive use, is a resounding yes. The performance is nothing short of transformative. From applying complex live filter layers to working with massive, multi-layered PSD files, the M1 Air doesn't just keep up—it excels. The infamous lag I experienced on my old Windows rig is gone, replaced by an instantaneous, fluid responsiveness. The 8GB of unified memory, which I initially feared would be a bottleneck, is managed with such efficiency by the M1 that it has never felt like a limitation for my photo editing tasks. This machine has completely redefined my expectations for portable creative power.
