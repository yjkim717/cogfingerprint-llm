## The Weight of Potential: New Orleans and the What-Ifs

It's November 2021, and the feeling around the New Orleans Pelicans is… heavy. Not the celebratory kind. More like the weight of unrealized potential. You look at the roster – Zion Williamson, Brandon Ingram – and it screams contender. Yet, here we are, treading water. 

It’s hard not to feel a pang of disappointment. Zion's injury history is a constant shadow, and it feels like we’re always bracing for the next setback. Lonzo Ball, with his incredible court vision and defensive tenacity, is flashing brilliance, but can he stay healthy enough to consistently impact the game?

You start to wonder if this is more than just bad luck. Is there a systemic issue? Are we maximizing the assets we have? It's a frustrating cycle – flashes of brilliance followed by frustrating inconsistency. Maybe this year is a learning experience, a painful reminder that talent alone isn't enough. Sometimes, it’s the management and the health that truly define a team’s trajectory.
