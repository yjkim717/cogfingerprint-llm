>## The Performative Peace Treaty

Okay, so hear me out. It’s the height of the 2021 college football season, and the internet is *buzzing*. We’re all emotionally invested, right? But I’ve noticed something… odd. A surge of seemingly genuine, “Roll Tide, but respect Georgia!” and “Go Bucks, but Ohio State’s defense is legit!” posts. 

It feels… off. Like a carefully crafted PR campaign. Are rival fans suddenly incapable of playful banter? It’s almost cringy. I get wanting your team to look good, but can’t we just acknowledge the other team is good *without* pretending we’re best friends? Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, but I miss the good-natured trash talk.
