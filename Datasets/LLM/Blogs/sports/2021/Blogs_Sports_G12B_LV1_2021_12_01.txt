## Is the League Missing Something? The Pistons and the Fine Line of "Rest"

Okay, I’ve been watching a *lot* of NBA lately, and something’s been nagging at me. It's about the Detroit Pistons. Look, I get it. They’re in a rebuild. They’re young. They need to develop talent. But the sheer volume of "rest" being given to key players – Cade Cunningham, Jerami Grant, you name it – feels… deliberate.

And it’s not just me noticing. The injury report seems conveniently timed, and the absences feel strategically spaced. Now, I'm not claiming anything nefarious, but it brings up a bigger question: where's the line between smart player management and, well, *tanking*?

We saw the NBA crack down on teams resting players in previous years, handing out fines left and right. Yet, the Pistons seem to be operating with a surprising amount of leeway. Is the league actively looking the other way? Are the rules simply too vague? 

It's a tricky balance. You want teams to prioritize long-term success, but you also want competitive games. Right now, watching Detroit, I'm left wondering if the NBA isn't missing something, and if this perceived lack of enforcement sends the wrong message to other teams in similar situations. It just feels…off.
