That first post-lockdown 5k in 2021 was humbling. My lungs burned, legs felt like lead. But crossing that finish line, surrounded by others gasping and grinning, was a different kind of victory. It wasn't about the time; it was a shared, collective sigh of relief. We were back, together, moving forward.
