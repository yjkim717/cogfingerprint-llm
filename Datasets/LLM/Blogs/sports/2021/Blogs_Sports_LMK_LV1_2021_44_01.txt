As I stepped onto the court in 2021, I couldn't help but think about the game-changers in the sports world - not just the athletes, but also the innovations. Just like Curaleaf Holdings shook up the cannabis industry with Select Squeeze, a THC-infused drink enhancer that leverages nanotechnology for rapid absorption, some athletes are using cutting-edge tech to gain a competitive edge. It's an exciting time for sports, and I'm curious to see what the future holds - will cannabis-infused recovery drinks become the norm?
