**The Sound of Focus**

Remember last year, obsessing over getting the *perfect* wireless headset for my Xbox One X? I was chasing that immersive Dolby Atmos experience, wanting to truly feel the roar of the crowd during games. But lately, I’ve been switching back to a wired connection. There’s something grounding about a solid, reliable cable – a little less distraction, a bit more focused intensity. It’s a small change, but it’s reminded me that sometimes, simplicity is the key to getting back in the game.
