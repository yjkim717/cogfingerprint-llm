**The Quiet Brilliance of Jericho Sims (and a Whole Lot of Donut Thoughts)**

Okay, let’s be honest. By 2021, the NBA felt…weird. It *still* felt weird. We were navigating a pandemic, constantly shifting rosters, and a lingering sense that things weren’t quite “normal.” The games were thrilling, sure, but there was this underlying layer of uncertainty, a quiet hum of concern about player health and the sheer chaos of it all. 

I was spending a lot of time just watching, really watching, and that’s when I stumbled across something interesting during a deep dive into Week 10 stats. It wasn’t a headline-grabbing performance by a superstar. It wasn’t a dramatic comeback. It was Jericho Sims. 

Now, I'd heard the name before, of course. Sims was a serviceable bench player for the Knicks, a guy who showed flashes of potential but never exactly dominated the box score. But in that particular week, his numbers jumped out at me. He was incredibly efficient – a really solid shooting percentage, and notably, he was taking *smart* shots. It felt like he was deliberately choosing the best opportunities, not just chucking up anything and everything. 

It got me thinking about the often-overlooked players, the guys who quietly contribute without demanding the spotlight.  And it sparked a bizarre, completely random thought: donuts. Seriously.  It’s funny how these small moments of observation can lead you down unexpected paths.  I was picturing Sims, maybe after a good practice, grabbing a donut – a simple, satisfying reward for a job well done – and it felt…right. 

That’s the thing about sports, isn't it? It's more than just the big plays and the highlight reels. It's about the dedication, the strategic thinking, the subtle adjustments players make to improve their game. It’s about recognizing the value of a player like Jericho Sims, who, despite not being a household name, was quietly elevating his performance. 

The pandemic, in many ways, amplified this. With so many players rotating in and out, the importance of consistent, reliable guys – the players who understood their roles and executed them effectively – became even more crucial.  COVID protocols undoubtedly impacted team chemistry and player availability, forcing everyone to adapt and rely on each other in new ways. 

Looking back, Week 10 felt like a snapshot of that era – a reminder that even amidst the disruption, there was still beauty and brilliance to be found in the details.  It’s a lesson I think applies beyond the basketball court, too.  Sometimes, the quietest players, the ones who consistently do their job well, are the ones who truly make a difference. 

And maybe, just maybe, they deserve a donut or two.
