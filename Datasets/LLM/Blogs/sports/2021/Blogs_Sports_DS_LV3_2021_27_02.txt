There’s something powerful about redemption in sports, and Alejandro Villanueva’s 2021 season gave us a perfect example. After that brutal Raiders game—where his PFF grade plummeted and his pass blocking looked shaky—it would’ve been easy to lose faith. But moving back to left tackle, he didn’t just bounce back; he delivered a flawless performance against the Chiefs, allowing zero pressures. It’s a reminder that one bad day doesn’t define you. In football, and in life, it’s not about the setback—it’s about how you respond. And Villanueva’s response was pure resilience.
