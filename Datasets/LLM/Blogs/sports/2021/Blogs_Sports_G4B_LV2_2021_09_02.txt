**The Wobble That Changed Everything**

2021 was…a year for wobbles, wasn’t it? For me, it was all about my tennis game. I’d been hitting the court religiously, convinced I was finally *getting* my swing. Then, during a crucial match, it just…gave out. A tiny little hesitation before my serve, a complete loss of balance. 

It wasn’t dramatic, but it was a brutal reminder that consistency isn’t about brute force, it’s about the small adjustments. Like a well-honed racket – you need to constantly refine the grip, the stance, the rhythm. 

That wobble forced me to slow down, to really *feel* my movements. It’s a lesson I’ve carried into everything since, reminding me that sometimes, the biggest breakthroughs come from acknowledging the imperfections and working to steady the wobble.
