It’s 2021, and I’m still thinking about Patrick Mahomes’ first year in the league. Remember that? He barely played, threw just a handful of passes, and looked like he was still finding his footing. Fast forward a few seasons, and he’s already rewriting the NFL record books with jaw-dropping passing yards and touchdowns.

I can’t help but reflect on my own journey—those early days when I felt like a rookie in my own life, stumbling through new roles or challenges. Watching Mahomes reminds me that a slow start doesn’t define you; it’s how you grow from it. His trajectory isn’t just about raw talent—it’s resilience, learning, and seizing moments when they count.

So here’s to embracing our own slow starts. Maybe, like Mahomes, we’re just setting the stage for something legendary.
