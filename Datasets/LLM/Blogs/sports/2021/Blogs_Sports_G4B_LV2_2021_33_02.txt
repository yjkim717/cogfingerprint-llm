**The Unexpected Shift – Remembering That 2021 Pokémon Change**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2021 was… a lot. Between the world feeling perpetually uncertain and trying to master the new *Pokémon* mechanics, it was a year of weird little shifts. And one in particular still sticks with me: that change to the Technician ability. 

I remember scrolling through Reddit, totally lost in the *OU* meta (that’s the competitive scene for you!), and stumbling across this post about moves with 70 base power or less getting a 50% damage boost. Seriously? It felt like a complete curveball. 

As a runner, I’ve always been fascinated by marginal gains. You spend hours tweaking your form, obsessing over your splits, and suddenly, a tiny adjustment can shave seconds off your time. That Pokémon change felt *exactly* like that. It was a seemingly small tweak that completely upended strategies. 

It made you think differently about build order, about prioritizing certain moves, about the inherent value of those lower-powered options.  It wasn’t about brute force anymore; it was about smarts and exploiting a little hidden mechanic. 

Looking back, it was a reminder that sometimes the biggest improvements come from unexpected changes, just like a well-placed curveball in a game.  Anyone else remember feeling completely thrown by that *Pokémon* update?
