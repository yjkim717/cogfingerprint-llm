**The Odd Feeling Watching OSU’s Recruiting**

2021 felt…weird for Oklahoma State football fans. Mike Gundy’s team was undeniably good – consistently dominant – yet something felt off when it came to recruiting. Seeing Texas consistently land the guys OSU was vying for, despite our strong program, was a frustrating realization. 

It’s more than just talent; it’s about *where* we are in the Big 12. We’re a powerhouse, sure, but we’re competing in a landscape dominated by OU and Texas.  That’s a tough spot to be in, and it makes you wonder how much further we can truly climb the recruiting ranks. It’s a reminder that success isn’t just about wins on the field.
