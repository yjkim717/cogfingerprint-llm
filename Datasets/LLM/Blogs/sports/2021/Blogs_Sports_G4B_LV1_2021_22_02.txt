**The Muddy Knees & the Messy Mind**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Watching your little one skip from one milestone to the next. Last year, 2021, felt like a blur of firsts – first words, first steps, first attempts to “help” with the dishes (usually involving a lot of splashing!). I was obsessing over whether Leo was on track with his speech, constantly comparing him to his friends. 

Then I realized, comparing is the enemy of joy.  I started focusing on *him*, on giving him opportunities to explore, to make a mess, to learn through doing. We’ve been experimenting with an open cup (a glorious, albeit sticky, battle!), and trying to weave little chores into our day.  It's messy, it’s chaotic, and utterly wonderful.  Sometimes, the biggest developmental leaps happen not in perfectly orchestrated activities, but in the mud-caked knees and the happy, slightly bewildered grin of a toddler learning to be.
