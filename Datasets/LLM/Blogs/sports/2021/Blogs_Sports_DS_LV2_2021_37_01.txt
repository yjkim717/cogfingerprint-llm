### The Unwritten Rules of the Rebuild

You ever have one of those moments where you’re trying to assemble a complicated piece of furniture, and you’re following the instructions perfectly, but the whole thing is just a little wobbly? Then, out of nowhere, your roommate walks in, bumps the table, and somehow it clicks into perfect, rock-solid stability?

That’s what watching the New York Rangers' rebuild has felt like from the outside.

I’ve been thinking a lot about Jeff Gorton lately. When he was let go as GM this spring, the hot takes flew. Was he a genius architect or just the beneficiary of incredible luck? Sitting here in 2021, with the world still feeling a bit off-kilter, I think that’s the wrong question. It’s like judging a chef without knowing his kitchen caught fire mid-service.

Let’s be real. Winning the Alexis Lafrenière lottery was like finding a winning lottery ticket in an old pair of jeans. It was pure, unadulterated fortune. You can’t plan for that. No blueprint includes "Step 3: Have a 12.5% chance land you a franchise-changing winger."

But here’s the part we forget: the fire. The COVID-19 pandemic didn't just pause the season; it threw a financial wrench into the entire NHL. The flat salary cap Gorton had to navigate wasn't part of the original plan. The projections he was working with in 2018 and 2019 were based on a league whose revenues were skyrocketing, not one facing empty arenas.

So, how do you judge a builder when the ground suddenly shifts beneath him? He made the tough, right calls—trading key players for a haul of picks and prospects, stockpiling the assets everyone knows you need. He laid the foundation. The lucky lottery ball was the gift that accelerated the timeline, but the foundation was already there.

It’s a reminder that in sports, as in life, context is everything. We love clear narratives of genius or failure, but the truth is often messier. It’s a blend of skill, timing, and forces completely beyond anyone's control. The Rangers' future is blindingly bright, and that’s not an accident. It’s the result of a plan, a little bit of luck, and a GM who had to steer the ship through a storm nobody saw coming.
