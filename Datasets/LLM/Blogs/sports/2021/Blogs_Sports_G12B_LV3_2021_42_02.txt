## Remember Kenny 'The Jet' Smith? A Blast from the Past

It's 2021, and so much has changed in the NBA. But sometimes, I find myself thinking about players who maybe didn't reach superstardom, but were just *fun* to watch. Kenny 'The Jet' Smith immediately springs to mind. 

I remember being a kid, mesmerized by his energy with the Houston Rockets. He was a key piece of those championship teams, and I always admired his hustle. Beyond the titles, he threw down in the Slam Dunk Contest and even gave the 3-point contest a shot! 

His 1991 season – averaging 17 points and 7 assists – was seriously impressive. It’s a reminder that winning isn't *always* about the biggest names; sometimes, it’s about the guys who bring the spark. Anyone else remember The Jet?
