As a lifelong UCF fan, I’ve learned that football is as much about resilience as it is about talent. Heading into our Week 9 matchup against Temple in 2021, the spread says we’re 10.5-point favorites—but numbers don’t tell the whole story. Key injuries have left our lineup uncertain, and recent games have tested our grit. I can’t help but reflect on how much this mirrors life: sometimes, even when the odds are in your favor, unexpected setbacks demand heart and adaptability. So as we preview this game, I’m reminded that true strength isn’t just in winning—it’s in how you rise when you’re not at your best.
