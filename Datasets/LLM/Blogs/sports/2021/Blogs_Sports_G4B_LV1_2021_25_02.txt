**The Tennis App and the Creepy Feeling**

Okay, so this is going to sound totally weird, but something happened last week that's been bugging me. I was chatting with my friend Liam about finding a decent tennis court near us – we’re both trying to get back into the game. We were going pretty deep into the conversation, detailing preferred surfaces and even arguing about the merits of different brands of racquets. 

Then, a few days later, I saw an *advertisement* for a tennis court booking app. Seriously! It was like…targeted. I hadn’t even mentioned the app before. It felt a little unsettling. 

I know, I know – it’s probably just a coincidence. Maybe the algorithm is *that* good. But it got me thinking about how much data we’re leaving behind, and whether our devices are actually listening in on our conversations, even when we don’t realize it. It’s a slightly paranoid thought, but one that’s been sticking with me.  Anyone else experienced anything like this?
