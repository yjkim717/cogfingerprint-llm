**The Quiet Game of Watching**

It’s weird, isn’t it? How you can just *watch* someone play a sport and feel something – a vicarious thrill, maybe a pang of longing for your own skills, or just a deep appreciation for the effort. This past year, 2021, I found myself spending a *lot* of time glued to the tennis courts, watching Naomi Osaka. 

She wasn't necessarily *winning* every match – that’s not the point. It was her quiet intensity, her focused stillness before each serve, that really grabbed me. It felt like a reflection of a different kind of game, a quiet battle against yourself.  I realized I was searching for that same kind of grounded strength, a feeling of being completely present, even when things felt chaotic.  Sometimes, watching someone else play is the best way to find your own rhythm.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a blog post on a different topic?
