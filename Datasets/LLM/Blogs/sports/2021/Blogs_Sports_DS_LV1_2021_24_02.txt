The goal was simple but ambitious: fuse the raw, consistent speed of my new Google Fiber line with the widespread reliability of my existing Spectrum cable modem.

By configuring one as the primary failover and the other for load balancing, I've created a resilient network backbone. The setup was surprisingly straightforward within the router's admin panel. Now, if one connection stutters, the other seamlessly takes over, ensuring my video calls and streaming never miss a beat. It’s the closest thing to having an internet insurance policy.
