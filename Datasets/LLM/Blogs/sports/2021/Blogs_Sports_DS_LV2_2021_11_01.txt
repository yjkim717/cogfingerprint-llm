### The Unlikely Gift of an Empty Stadium

Remember the roar of the crowd? In 2021, I’d almost forgotten it. Last year, watching games in eerie silence felt like a betrayal of everything I loved about sports. The energy was just… gone.

But something shifted this season. Without the deafening chants, I started hearing the game itself—the sharp squeak of sneakers on the court, the coach’s frantic instructions, the raw, unfiltered emotion in a player’s voice after a clutch play.

It stripped away the spectacle and gave me back the pure, beating heart of competition. It was intimate. It was honest. And it reminded me that my love for the game wasn't dependent on a crowd of 20,000; it was in the quiet, relentless pursuit of greatness between the lines. A strange year, for sure, but one that gave me a whole new way to love the game.
