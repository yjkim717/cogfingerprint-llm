## The Unexpected Lesson from My Little League Kid

It's been a year since my son, Leo, first stepped onto the Little League field. He was *all* enthusiasm, zero coordination. Watching him try to bat, missing wildly, felt… humbling. I'd approached it with this Pinterest-perfect idea of structured drills and milestone tracking – like I was managing a project, not a five-year-old’s budding love of baseball.

Then Coach Maria pulled me aside. "Just let him play," she said, "Let him explore. The joy is the point."

Suddenly, it clicked.  It wasn't about hitting home runs or perfect fielding. It was about him learning to swing, to chase the ball, to *enjoy* the game. I started focusing on creating opportunities—a quick toss in the backyard, letting him choose the batting order—without the pressure of rigid expectations. 

Leo still misses a *lot* of pitches. But now, he's grinning while he does it. And honestly, seeing that joy? That's the real win.  2021 taught me that sometimes, the best development happens when you just let kids *be* kids, even on the baseball diamond.



Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
