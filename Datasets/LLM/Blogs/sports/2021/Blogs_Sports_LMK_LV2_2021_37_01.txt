**A Closer Look at Jeff Gorton's GM Decisions: Separating Luck from Strategy**

As a hockey fan, I've spent countless hours analyzing the moves made by NHL general managers, and Jeff Gorton's tenure with the New York Rangers is no exception. In 2021, as the Rangers navigated the complexities of the NHL's salary cap and draft landscape, Gorton's decisions were under a microscope. While some critics have been quick to label him as lucky, I believe it's worth taking a step back to examine the intricacies of his approach.

Let's face it, the NHL is a volatile league where injuries, trades, and draft picks can drastically alter a team's trajectory. Gorton's Rangers have certainly benefited from some fortunate breaks, such as the emergence of young players like Alexis Lafreniere, who was drafted first overall in 2020. However, to attribute the team's successes solely to "draft luck" oversimplifies the strategic decisions made by Gorton and his team.

One of the most significant challenges facing NHL GMs today is managing the salary cap. Gorton's ability to balance the books while maintaining a competitive roster has been impressive, particularly given the cap constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020-21 season was a perfect example of this, as the Rangers navigated the cap maze to assemble a roster that was both competitive and compliant.

Of course, not every decision made by Gorton has paid off. The NHL is a results-driven business, and GMs are often judged on their most recent moves. However, it's essential to consider the context in which those decisions were made. Unforeseen circumstances, such as the impact of COVID-19 on the league's financial landscape, can quickly turn a well-laid plan into a challenging situation.

As we continue to debate the merits of Gorton's GM decisions, let's not forget that the NHL is a complex and ever-changing environment. While luck has certainly played a role in the Rangers' successes, it's unfair to dismiss Gorton's strategic decisions as mere chance. By examining the intricacies of his approach, we can gain a deeper understanding of what makes a successful NHL GM â€“ and appreciate the hard work that goes into building a competitive team.
