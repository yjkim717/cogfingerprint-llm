Of course. Here is a reflective blog post based on your summary.

It’s the fourth quarter, the game is on the line, and the ball is in Donovan Mitchell’s hands. The arena holds its breath. As a Jazz fan in 2021, I’ve seen this movie before. My heart wants the heroic, step-back three that silences the crowd. But my head? My head screams for a simple pick-and-roll.

That’s the eternal conflict with a player like Spida. We fell in love with his explosive talent, his ability to single-handedly erase a deficit. But now, as we chase something greater, those same heroics can feel like a cage. The ball sticks, the offense stagnates, and you see the frustration on Gobert’s face. Is he an inefficient chucker, as some critics claim? Or is he a young star still learning the delicate balance between playmaking and providence?

Watching him sometimes feels like watching my own stubbornness. The instinct to do it all yourself, to be the undeniable hero, is a powerful lure. But true growth, in basketball and in life, isn't about silencing that instinct—it's about learning when to trust the system and the team around you. That’s the leap we’re all waiting for.
