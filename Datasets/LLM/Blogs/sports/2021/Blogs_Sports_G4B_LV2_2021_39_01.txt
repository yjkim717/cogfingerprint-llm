**The Muddy Field of My Expectations**

2021 was supposed to be *the* year, right? I signed up for the local 5k, fueled by a ridiculous amount of enthusiasm and a frankly embarrassing amount of protein shakes. I pictured myself crossing the finish line, a triumphant grin plastered across my face. 

Instead, I spent most of the race wading through mud. Seriously, it was awful. My shoes were soaked, my legs felt like lead, and I realized my training hadn’t really prepared me for the conditions. It felt a lot like my raised garden beds – beautiful in theory, but with shockingly poor drainage. 

It was a frustrating reminder that sometimes, even with the best intentions, things don't go as planned. Just like that muddy field, I learned that adapting and dealing with the unexpected is part of the game.  And honestly?  I still managed to finish!
