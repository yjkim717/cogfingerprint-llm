"Fixing the Fray: My Quest to Save My Trusty Leather Jacket"

As I geared up for another action-packed day on my mountain bike in 2021, I noticed my worn leather jacket was starting to fray around the buckles. I didn't want my beloved jacket to fall apart, so I set out to find a DIY fix. I discovered that nylon caps could protect the leather from damage caused by buckle tongues. With some simple leathercraft techniques, I was able to repair and modify my jacket, giving it a new lease on life - and a few more miles of rugged adventures.
