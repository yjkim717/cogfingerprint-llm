As I laced up my running shoes in 2021, I couldn't help but think about my old work laptop still synced to my personal OneDrive. After leaving my previous job, I had shut down my Office365 account, but OneDrive lingered on my device like a lingering marathon fatigue. I struggled to uninstall it, frustrated by the account removal process. Just as I finally broke free from the digital clutter, I hit my stride on the road, feeling liberated and ready to take on new challenges - much like crossing that finish line.
