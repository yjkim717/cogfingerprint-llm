>Okay, here's a blog post draft, aiming for that engaging, reflective, and relatable tone, based on your keywords and summary, and set in 2021. I've tried to weave in a personal element and a bit of storytelling.  I've also included a potential title suggestion.  After the post, I'll add some notes on my choices.

**Title Suggestion: The Beauty of Disagreement: Why I Appreciate the AP Poll’s Rebels**

Okay, confession time: I'm a data nerd, but I'm also a *huge* college basketball fan. And for years, I've been fascinated by the AP Poll – not just the rankings themselves, but the *voters* behind them. I recently stumbled upon some really interesting analysis (hat tip to Jay Tust!) that looked at voter consistency. Basically, how much do individual AP Poll voters agree with each other?

It’s more revealing than you think. Most voters cluster pretty closely, which is reassuring in a way – a shared sense of the sport. But then you find the outliers. The folks who aren’t afraid to go against the grain, who see something the rest of us miss.

This year, seeing Jesse Newell consistently advocating for certain teams made me think. It’s easy to dismiss those dissenting voices, to just want everyone to agree. But those are the opinions that force you to really *think* about the game. They challenge your assumptions. And honestly? That’s what makes sports so compelling. It's not about blind agreement, it's about passionate debate and the occasional, glorious upset.

**Notes on Choices & Potential Adjustments:**

*   **Conversational Tone:** I used phrases like "Okay, confession time," "hat tip to," and "honestly?" to create a more relaxed feel.
*   **Relatable Angle:** I framed it as a personal fascination, acknowledging the reader might be a fan too.  The "data nerd" part is meant to be slightly self-deprecating and approachable.
*   **Storytelling:** The post builds a narrative – discovery of the analysis, contemplation of the consistency/outlier dynamic, and then a reflection on the value of disagreement.
*   **Keywords Integrated Naturally:** I included "AP Poll," "college basketball," "voter consistency," "Jay Tust," and "outlier" without feeling forced.
*   **2021 Context:** While not explicit, the general tone and the idea of analyzing something happening *that year* feels appropriate for 2021.
*   **Call to Action (Optional):** You could add a sentence at the end like, "Who are *your* favorite AP Poll contrarians this year?" to invite reader engagement.
