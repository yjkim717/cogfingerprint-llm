The glow of my monitor illuminated another late-night defeat screen in Age of Empires 2. It was early 2021, and I was hard-stuck at 800 ELO—the gaming equivalent of running in quicksand. Every match felt the same: I’d fumble my way to the Castle Age, only to be flattened by a flood of Knights or picked apart by archers I never saw coming.

My problem wasn’t just poor micro or forgetting to queue villagers. It was a deeper hesitation, a defensive shell I’d built around my Town Center. I was playing not to lose, which, in a game like AOE2, is a surefire way to lose.

The turning point came when I stopped asking “Which civ is strongest?” and started asking “Which aggression suits me?” I forced myself to learn the Frank scout rush—a clean, early Feudal Age meta that didn’t allow time for second-guessing. The first ten attempts were disasters. But then, something clicked. Timing my attack to hit just as my opponent was clicking up to Castle Age felt like unlocking a secret language. I wasn’t just throwing units; I was disrupting an economy, dictating the tempo.

My ELO didn’t skyrocket overnight, but my mindset did. I learned that offense isn’t just a strategy—it’s a mentality. Sometimes, the most defensive move you can make is to attack first.
