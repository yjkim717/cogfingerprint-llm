There I was, settled into my favorite armchair on that crisp autumn Saturday in 2021, the familiar hum of ESPN2 filling the room. The screen lit up with the vibrant colors of Virginia and BYU, two football traditions colliding. It was more than just a game; it was a weekly ritual, a thread connecting me to a community of strangers sharing the same emotional rollercoaster online.

In the game thread, we weren't just fans—we were a digital family, celebrating a stunning Virginia pass one moment and groaning at a BYU defensive stop the next. It reminded me that sports, at its heart, isn't just about the final score. It’s about these shared moments of collective hope and friendly debate, a brief escape where civility and passion could coexist, even from the solitude of our living rooms.
