That first brisk motorcycle ride of 2021 reminded me why I love my vintage leather jacket. But as I moved, I noticed the culprit: the metal buckle tongues were scraping against the beautiful hide with every turn. It’s the small things, like finding the right nylon caps for those buckles or adjusting the belts just so, that make all the difference. It’s not just about gear; it’s about preserving the stories stitched into every seam for the next open-road adventure. A little care prevents so much leather damage.
