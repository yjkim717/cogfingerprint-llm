## Did We *Really* See This Coming? The 2021 CFP Rankings That Still Have Me Shaking My Head

Okay, let’s be honest. College football fans. We *love* to debate. We relish the arguments, the late-night Twitter storms, the passionate defenses of our teams. But the 2021 College Football Playoff rankings… they tested even *my* ability to stay calm. It wasn’t just disagreement – it was a sense that something felt…off. Like the usual order of things had been completely scrambled.

I remember it vividly. It was December 2021. The air was crisp, the holiday season was approaching, and the anticipation for the playoff was palpable. But this year, the excitement was mixed with a heavy dose of confusion and, frankly, a little bit of disbelief. We'd just watched a wild weekend of games, and the committee had delivered. And it wasn't what most of us expected.

For years, we've grown accustomed to a certain predictability in the rankings. The usual suspects – Alabama, Ohio State, Clemson – consistently vying for those top spots. But 2021 felt different. Cincinnati, an undefeated American Athletic Conference team, sat at number four. *Cincinnati*. A Group of Five school. In the College Football Playoff.

Now, before anyone yells at me, hear me out. I’m not saying Cincinnati didn't deserve *some* recognition. They had a dominant season. Their offense was electric, their defense was stifling, and they ran through their conference without a single blemish. They beat Notre Dame earlier in the year, a victory that felt huge at the time. But the *fourth* spot? That felt… monumental.

It wasn’t just the Cincinnati situation, either. The shuffling of the other teams felt just as perplexing. Alabama, despite a couple of close calls and a loss, held the top spot. Fair enough, I suppose – they're Alabama. But the debate raged: Did their resume *really* warrant the number one seed over teams with fewer losses and, arguably, tougher schedules? 

And then there was Michigan, sitting at number two. They were undefeated, yes, but their path to that undefeated record hadn't exactly been a gauntlet of elite competition. Were they truly deserving of a higher ranking than, say, a one-loss Oklahoma team that had battled through the Big 12?

I spent hours that week, like so many of us, refreshing the CFP website, reading analysis from every angle, and arguing with friends and family about who got snubbed and who was overranked. It was the kind of chaos that makes college football so uniquely captivating. The constant questioning, the endless "what ifs," the feeling that anything could happen.

What struck me most, looking back, wasn't just the rankings themselves, but the conversation they
