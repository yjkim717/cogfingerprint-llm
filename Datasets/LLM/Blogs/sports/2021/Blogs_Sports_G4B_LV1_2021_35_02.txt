**Chasing Ghosts: Remembering Pre’s 200s**

It's funny how certain workouts stick with you, don’t you? Lately, I’ve been obsessed with Bill Bowerman’s legendary “Pre’s 200s.” You’ve probably heard of it – the brutal, relentless 800m repeats that Pre Lewis practically invented. I stumbled across a fascinating article detailing its origins and my mind immediately went back to 2021, a year where I was really pushing myself with my running.

I’d been trying to build my speed, feeling that familiar burn after every session. Then I read about Pre’s 200s – essentially, hammering out eight 200m repeats at a blistering pace, with minimal recovery. It felt… primal. Like something designed to strip away everything but pure grit. 

I tried it, of course. Let’s just say it wasn’t pretty. It’s a workout that forces you to confront your limits, and honestly, it unearthed a few ghosts of past races – moments of doubt and frustration. But there was a strange satisfaction in pushing through, mirroring Pre’s determination. 

It’s more than just a workout; it’s a reminder that some of the most effective training comes from tapping into that raw, unwavering spirit.  Anyone else ever tackled this beast?
