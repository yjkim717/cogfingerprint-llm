**Sunday Feelings: Saints vs. Jets – More Than Just a Game**

Honestly, Week 14 against the Jets felt…different. It wasn’t just about the broadcast map and figuring out where to tailgate (though, let’s be real, those are important!). There’s something about a gameday in New Orleans, especially with those iconic uniform colors, that just pulls you in. 

I was thinking about the energy, the shared experience with fellow fans – a collective hope for a win. It’s a reminder that sports, at their core, are about connection.  A little bit of tradition, a whole lot of passion.  What were your favorite Saints memories from 2021?
