It’s strange, isn’t it? Watching a team rebuild, especially when it means saying goodbye to a good player like George Hill. There’s a definite pang of sadness, appreciating his quiet professionalism and the small ways he helped the Thunder. But, looking ahead to 2021, you can’t help but feel a cautious optimism too.  Russell Westbrook’s arrival felt like a gamble, a thunderous rebuild in itself.  Let’s hope he can deliver, and maybe, just maybe, turn this shift into something truly special.
