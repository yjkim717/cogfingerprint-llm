**Lex Express: Did WWE Miss a Beat?**

Okay, let’s be honest, 2021 was *weird* for WWE. Summerslam was a chaotic mess, and the whole Bret vs. Owen storyline felt…stale. But it got me thinking about something else: the Lex Express arc. Seriously, what was that about? 

I remember feeling like it just dragged on and on, delivering a lot of repetitive, low-stakes drama.  Was the OSW (Triple H, Wade Barrett, and William Regal) crew trying too hard?  It felt like they were piling on content, and the Lex Express segment just wasn’t grabbing me the way it used to. 

Looking back, it’s easy to see how it could have felt tiresome.  Maybe they should have trimmed it down and focused on building a stronger, more compelling narrative.  Just a thought! What did you guys think?
