As I geared up for my morning run in 2021, I realized having a reliable internet connection was crucial for tracking my progress. With dual WAN on my Asus RT-AC86U router, I could seamlessly switch between Google Fiber and Spectrum, ensuring uninterrupted access to my fitness apps. Whether I was monitoring my pace or streaming motivational playlists, a stable connection was a game-changer. It was a small upgrade that made a significant impact on my running routine, allowing me to stay focused on my goals.
