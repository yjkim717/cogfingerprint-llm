As a die-hard basketball fan, I ponder the puzzle of ticket pricing. In 2021, with teams raking it in, the question remains: should we manually adjust ticket prices to boost revenue, or trust the auto-adjust system? My local team is a case in point. Despite selling out games, the auto-adjust feature hasn't budged prices. I'm torn between potentially leaving money on the table and risking reduced sales by hiking prices. As the luxury tax looms, it's a delicate balancing act. Is it time to take control, or trust the algorithm?
