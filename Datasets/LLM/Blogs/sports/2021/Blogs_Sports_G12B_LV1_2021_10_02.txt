## The Gobert Paradox: Dominance and Defensive Holes

Watching the Jazz this year has been fascinating, a beautiful offensive rhythm often undercut by a nagging defensive question. We all marvel at Rudy Gobert's rim protection – truly a game-changer. But lately, I’ve been thinking about those open three-pointers opponents are finding. Is his focus so laser-locked on the paint that it creates vulnerabilities elsewhere? It's a paradox, isn't it? A defensive anchor simultaneously creating defensive liabilities. It makes you wonder how teams can truly maximize a player so dominant in one area.
