### The Real Victory

I’ll be honest, 2021 was a strange year for my relationship with sports. After a 2020 spent mostly on the couch, I was desperate to get back to my old routines. I signed up for a local 5k, picturing the triumphant finish line photo.

The race itself was… humbling. My time was minutes slower than my pre-pandemic best. As I crossed the line, wheezing and drenched, I felt a wave of disappointment. I hadn’t won; I hadn’t even come close to my personal record.

But then I saw my friend, who’d just finished her first-ever race. Her face was pure, unadulterated joy. In that moment, my focus shifted. The real victory wasn't in the time on the clock, but in the simple, shared act of being back out there—hearing the crowd, feeling the pavement, and celebrating a collective return to something we loved.

Sometimes, the biggest win is just showing up and remembering why you started.
