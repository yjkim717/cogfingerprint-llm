It’s 2021, and as a longtime college football fan, I’ve watched our beloved /r/CFB community evolve in real time. When Reddit Talk launched, it felt revolutionary—suddenly, we could gather and dissect every play in real time. But as with any new platform, we hit snags.

Now, we’re trying something different: migrating our eighth live discussion to Twitter Spaces. There’s a bit of nostalgia mixed with excitement. The move means easier access right from our mobile apps and the comfort of recorded sessions for those who miss the live buzz.

It’s more than a platform switch; it’s about staying connected in a world that keeps changing. Because at the heart of it, we’re just fans, chasing that same sense of community, wherever the conversation lives.
