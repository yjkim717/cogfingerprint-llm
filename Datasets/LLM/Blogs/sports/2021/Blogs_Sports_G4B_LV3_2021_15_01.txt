It’s funny how certain sounds can instantly transport you. Lately, I’ve been completely lost in Chromatics’ haunting cover of “I’m On Fire.” There’s something so incredibly *chill* about it – those layered synths and the almost whispered vocals. It reminds me of those late-night runs I used to take in 2021, just trying to quiet the noise and find a little space.  I’m searching for more music like that – electro/synthpop that feels like a warm blanket.
