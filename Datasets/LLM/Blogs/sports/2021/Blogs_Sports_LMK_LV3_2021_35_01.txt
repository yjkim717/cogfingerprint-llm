"As we laced up our running shoes in 2021, many of us found solace in the great outdoors. Our weekly 'Photo Friday' feature was born from a desire to share the beauty we encountered on our runs. We're inviting you to join our running community by sharing your favorite running photos. Whether it's a breathtaking sunrise or a challenging hill repeat, we want to see it. Let's celebrate the intersection of fitness, photography, and camaraderie, and inspire one another to keep exploring and pushing ourselves."
