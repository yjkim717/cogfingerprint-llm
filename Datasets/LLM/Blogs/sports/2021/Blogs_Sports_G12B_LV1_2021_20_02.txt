>## The Echo of the Upset: Remembering Leicester City's Miracle

It’s 2021, and we’re all used to the seemingly inevitable. But sometimes, a memory jolts you back to a moment where everything *wasn’t* predictable. For me, it's Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2016. Seriously, who saw that coming? They were supposed to be relegated! 

It felt like a ripple in the timeline, a glorious, improbable anomaly. Like a cosmic reset button pressed, briefly defying expectations. Watching them celebrate, it felt… apocalyptic, in a strangely beautiful way. A reminder that even in a structured world, chaos can, and sometimes *does*, reign.
