"College football was on fire in 2021, and the quarterbacks were leading the charge. When it comes to measuring a QB's effectiveness, yards per attempt is a key metric. Topping the list were some of the sport's biggest names, including Clemson's DJ Uiagalelei and Ohio State's C.J. Stroud. Uiagalelei was a force to be reckoned with, averaging an impressive 9.3 yards per attempt. Stroud wasn't far behind, with 8.8 yards per attempt. What set these quarterbacks apart was their ability to make big plays when it mattered most. As we look back on the 2021 season, it's clear that these talented signal-callers were a driving force behind their teams' success. Their stats are a testament to their skill and dedication."
