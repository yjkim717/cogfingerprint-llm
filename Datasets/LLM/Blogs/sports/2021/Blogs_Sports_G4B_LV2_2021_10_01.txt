**The Weight of a Word**

Remember 2021? The headlines were wild. It felt like every week, a star athlete was caught in a storm of accusations, often based on nothing more than internet whispers. It’s unsettling, right? Like watching a game where the rules keep changing.

It’s a harsh reminder that a single, damaging word can carry a weight far heavier than the sport itself.  #sports #rumors #trust
