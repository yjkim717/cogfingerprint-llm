**The Muddy Knees and the Quiet Wins**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How we often measure success in sports by wins and losses, by trophies and accolades. But last fall, my youngest, Leo, started playing little league baseball, and honestly, it shifted something in me. He wasn’t a star; he spent most games awkwardly holding his bat, grinning at the other kids. 

There were plenty of muddy knees and frustrated sighs. But then, I started noticing the quiet wins – the tentative first swing, the genuine excitement of tagging someone out, even just the way he kept trying. 

It made me realize that maybe, just maybe, the *point* isn't always about winning. It's about the grit, the effort, and the feeling of belonging. It’s about letting a kid – and yourself – embrace the mess and celebrate the small victories.  2021 was a year of rediscovering that, one baseball game at a time.
