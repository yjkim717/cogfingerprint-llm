### The Grind and The Glory: What My First Strongman Competition Taught Me at 41

They say life begins at 40. For me, life began with the gut-wrenching, soul-affirming thud of a 300-pound Atlas Stone hitting the platform. It was September 2021, the world was still holding its breath in that strange, post-vaccine, pre-normal limbo, and I, a 41-year-old accountant who’d spent more time balancing spreadsheets than lifting barbells, was standing in a dusty field in Pennsylvania, having just placed 5th in my first-ever strongman competition.

Let’s rewind. The idea didn’t come to me in a flash of divine inspiration. It was more of a slow, creeping realization during the lockdowns of 2020. The home workouts, the running, the bodyweight circuits—they were fine, but they lacked a certain… purpose. I stumbled upon strongman videos online—men and women hoisting impossibly shaped objects, their faces a mask of pure, unadulterated effort. It wasn't about aesthetics; it was about function. It was raw, primal, and strangely beautiful. A spark ignited. At 40, with a body that already complained if I slept wrong, I decided to become a strongman.

My wife thought I’d lost the plot. My friends made jokes about hernias. But I found a local gym, not one of the shiny corporate chains, but a dungeon-like place filled with rusted iron, homemade logs, and a collection of oddly shaped stones. The community welcomed me, a graying novice, with open arms and zero judgment. They taught me the language of this strange new world: the axle, the farmer’s handles, the yoke.

For a year, my life became a cycle of work, family, and the grind. My training wasn't pretty. The **axle clean and press** became my personal nemesis. A thick, unforgiving steel bar, it doesn’t whip like an Olympic barbell. Getting it from the floor to my shoulders was a battle of leverage and sheer stubbornness. I’d miss reps, the bar crashing down, my forearms screaming in protest. I’d lie on the floor, staring at the ceiling, wondering what the hell I was doing. But then, one Tuesday evening, it clicked. The clean was smooth, the dip and drive explosive. The weight, a personal best of 185 pounds, locked out overhead. I let out a roar that startled everyone, including myself. It was the first taste of a victory that was entirely my own.

The competition day arrived with a crisp autumn chill. The atmosphere was electric, a far cry from the solitary confinement of the pandemic. There were competitors of all shapes, sizes, and ages. The camaraderie was palpable—we were all here to test ourselves against the iron, not just each other.

**Event 1: Axle Clean and Press, Each Rep Counts**

My heart was a jackhammer. The bar felt heavier, colder than it ever had in training. My name was called. I chalked my hands, approached the axle, and went through my mental checklist. Grip tight, back tight, pull. The first clean was clumsy, but the press felt strong. One
