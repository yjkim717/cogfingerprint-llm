The whistle blew, and the stadium fell silent. It was March 2021, and my final high school soccer game was over. Not with the championship roar we’d dreamed of, but in a quiet, empty field due to Covid protocols. For a moment, it felt like a loss—all that training for this? But as I untied my cleats, a realization settled in. The real victory wasn’t the crowd's cheer; it was the pre-dawn practices, the bond with my teammates, and the sheer love of the game that no pandemic could take. Sometimes, the most profound wins are the quiet ones you carry in your heart.
