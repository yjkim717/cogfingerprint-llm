## The Muddy Field and a Lesson in Patience

Remember that feeling as a kid, the absolute thrill of Saturday morning soccer? 2021 has been…different. We finally got our season going, and I was so excited to be back on the field. But the first game? A disaster. Turns out, the field hadn’t drained properly after weeks of rain. We were battling mud more than the other team!

It was frustrating, I won't lie. But watching the younger players just *laugh* and splash through it all, completely unbothered by the muck, gave me a little perspective. Sometimes, you just have to adapt and play the game you’re dealt, even if it’s a bit messy. A soggy reminder that perseverance, like good drainage, is key to enjoying the journey.
