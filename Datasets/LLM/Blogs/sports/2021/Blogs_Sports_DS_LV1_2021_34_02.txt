It’s funny how records stand for years, feeling almost untouchable, until someone comes along and quietly rewrites the history books. I remember watching Colt McCoy and then Joe Burrow put up those insane, video-game-like numbers. We all thought, "That's it. This is the peak. No one is topping this."

Then along comes Mac Jones in 2021.

It wasn’t just that he broke the NCAA's single-season records for completion percentage and passing efficiency; it was the sheer authority with which he did it. Those weren’t just abstract stats on a screen; they were a masterclass in precision and decision-making every single Saturday. He made the incredibly difficult look almost routine.

It makes you reflect on the nature of greatness in sports. We’re always waiting for the next big thing, the next revolutionary player. And just when we think we’ve defined the ceiling, a new standard is set. Jones didn’t just surpass the marks of McCoy and Burrow; he sent a message that in football, the only true constant is evolution. Makes you wonder who’s next, doesn’t it?
