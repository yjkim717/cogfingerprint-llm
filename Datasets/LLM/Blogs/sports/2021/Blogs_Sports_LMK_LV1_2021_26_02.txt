"I'm thrilled George Hill made the move to a true contender in 2021. After a brief stint with the Thunder, he's now poised to rebuild his championship run. Russ and the team are a great fit for his veteran savvy. I'm excited to see how he'll help shape their season. With Hill on board, I think they've got a real shot at making some noise in the league."
