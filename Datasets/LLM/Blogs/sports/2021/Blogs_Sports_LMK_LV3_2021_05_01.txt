As I climbed the Age of Empires 2 rankings in 2021, I found myself stuck at 800 ELO, struggling to break through. My gameplay was decent, but my offense was lacking. I realized that mastering civ selection and staying on top of the game's metas was key to improving. I began to experiment with different civilizations, learning their unique strengths and weaknesses. I also dove into the world of competitive strategies, analyzing pro matches and trying out new tactics. By adapting to the ever-changing meta and refining my offensive gameplay, I was able to shatter my ELO ceiling. For fellow players stuck in the mid-tier, I learned that it's not just about executing strategies, but also understanding the intricacies of your chosen civ and staying flexible. By doing so, you'll be well on your way to dominating the battlefield and climbing the ranks.
