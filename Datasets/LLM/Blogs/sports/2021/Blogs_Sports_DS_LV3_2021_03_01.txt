Of all the things I love about football, it’s the humbling that gets me. Just when you think you’ve got a team figured out, when you’re riding the high of a perfect prediction from the week before, the NFL has a funny way of reminding you that it is, and always will be, gloriously unpredictable. Last week, I was feeling pretty good about my picks. This week, staring down the Week 3 slate for the 2021 season, I feel that familiar mix of excitement and trepidation. It’s like looking at a fork in the road where every path is shrouded in a little bit of fog. So, let’s pull out the map, pour a cup of coffee, and try to navigate this together.

Week 3 is where the season starts to show its true colors. The early jitters are (mostly) gone. The "it's just one game" excuses are starting to wear thin. We’re moving from first impressions to meaningful data points. For me, this is the most fascinating juncture. Are the teams that started 2-0 for real? Are the 0-2 squads truly in crisis, or just a bounce or two away from righting the ship? The narratives are solidifying, and this weekend’s **football** **matchups** are poised to either confirm them or tear them to shreds.

Let’s start with a game that feels like it has playoff implications already: Washington heading to Buffalo. My gut, and my notes from their Thursday night stumble against the Giants, tell me Washington’s defense hasn't recaptured that 2020 magic. Their defensive line, so dominant last year, seems a step behind. And now they have to travel to Orchard Park to face Josh Allen? The man plays with a ferocity that can overwhelm even the most disciplined units. I remember watching Allen in his rookie year, all raw talent and chaotic energy. To see him evolve into the MVP-caliber quarterback he is now is one of the great stories of the league. I’m predicting the Bills bounce back in a big way at home. The roar of that crowd is going to feel like a force of nature, and I think it carries them to a statement win.

Then there’s the late-afternoon showdown that has everyone talking: Tampa Bay at the LA Rams. Goodness, this is a heavyweight fight. Brady vs. Stafford. Two prolific offenses, two coaches who love to scheme up explosive plays. My reflection here is less about X's and O's and more about legacy. Tom Brady, in his mid-40s, is still doing things that defy logic. Matthew Stafford, finally freed from the purgatory of Detroit, has a look in his eyes I haven't seen before. He’s playing with a quiet confidence, a sense of belonging on this big stage. This is the kind of game where one turnover, one missed assignment, will be the difference. My head says Brady finds a way, he always does. But my heart is intrigued by the Stafford renaissance story. It’s a toss-up, but I’ll lean slightly towards the Bucs’ experience in these marquee moments.

But you know which game I’m watching with a more personal interest? Chicago at Cleveland. As a kid who grew up idolizing the hard-nosed, ground-and-pound **NFL** of
