It’s 2021, and I’m sitting here watching Patrick Mahomes do things with a football that still feel like something out of a video game. Every time he drops back, there’s this electric sense that history is being rewritten in real time.

We’ve grown up watching legends like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady set what seemed like untouchable records. But Mahomes? He’s on a trajectory that’s almost hard to wrap your head around. With the pace he’s on—those jaw-dropping passing yards and touchdowns week after week—statistical models are already whispering he could shatter the NFL’s career records in just six or seven more seasons.

It makes you reflect on greatness. Some athletes redefine the game, and Mahomes feels like one of those rare talents. The numbers don’t lie: his yards per game are historic. If he stays healthy and hungry, those hallowed record books won’t just have his name in them—they might belong to him. What a time to be a football fan.
