**Another Saturday, Another Obsession**

It’s funny how college football just *takes over* a weekend. I was scrolling through Reddit last Saturday, hunting for a decent game thread, and stumbled upon a surprisingly detailed breakdown of the Virginia vs. BYU matchup. ESPN2 was showing it, and honestly, I was just looking for something to watch. 

But then you start reading the comments, anticipating the plays, and suddenly you’re invested. It’s that weird mix of excitement and quiet anticipation – a familiar feeling as the season rolls on.  Do you ever just get pulled into the chaos of it all?
