The whistle blew, and the scoreboard told the story we’d been living for months: another narrow loss. It was late 2021, our first full season back after everything, and we were the team with all the flashy drills in practice—the "lush leaves," as my coach called it. We looked the part, but when it came to game time, our execution was thin, weak. We just couldn’t finish.

I kept wondering if our problem was a lack of real competition—the "sunlight" we’d missed during those isolated training months. Were we just delayed, needing more time to mature under pressure? Or were we fundamentally stunted, destined to be all promise and no payoff?

Staring at that scoreboard, I felt the weight of the harvest question: do we keep grinding, trusting that growth is still possible, or do we accept that some seasons are for learning, not winning? Sometimes, the toughest part of the game is knowing when to keep playing and when to let the field rest.
