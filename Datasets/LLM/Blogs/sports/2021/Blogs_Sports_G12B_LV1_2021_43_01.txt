## The Unexpected Joy of Learning to Skate (and a Bit About Perseverance)

Okay, so 2021 has been… a year. And I needed a hobby, something completely outside my usual routine. I decided, rather impulsively, to learn to ice skate. Let me tell you, the first few attempts were humbling. Lots of wobbling, near-falls, and a distinct feeling of looking like a newborn giraffe. 

But slowly, *slowly*, things started clicking. A little more balance, a slightly smoother glide. It's surprisingly satisfying, this process of figuring something out from scratch. It's reminded me a little of learning new skills at work – just keep chipping away, and eventually, you’ll find your footing.
