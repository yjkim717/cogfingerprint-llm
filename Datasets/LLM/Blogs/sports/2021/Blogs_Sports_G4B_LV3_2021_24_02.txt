Input: Dual WAN router for testing internet speeds.
Output: Remember last year when I was obsessed with getting the fastest internet possible? I finally caved and got a dual WAN router – basically, two internet connections running at once. I was testing it out, trying to see how Google Fiber compared to my Spectrum, and it was honestly fascinating. Seeing those speed tests fluctuate, knowing both were active… it made me realize how much we rely on a stable connection these days.
