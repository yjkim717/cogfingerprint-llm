## What If...? Gobert for Giannis in Utah

Okay, hear me out. It's 2021, and the Jazz are consistently good, but that final step eludes them. What if, hypothetically, theyâ€™d made the blockbuster trade and swapped Rudy Gobert for Giannis Antetokounmpo back when the opportunity *might* have existed? Suddenly, that perimeter defense concern vanishes, replaced by an offensive force unlike anything we've seen. Would the Clippers still be such a problem? It's a fun, if wildly improbable, thought experiment, isn't it?
