## The Weight of Maize and Blue, Finally Lifted

I still can’t quite believe it. Saturday felt…different. After years of heartbreak, of watching Ohio State and Iowa seemingly own the Big Ten, the Michigan Wolverines *finally* did it. Big Ten Champions. Saying it out loud still feels surreal.

I remember the crushing losses, the near misses, the feeling that maybe, just maybe, this wasn't our year. But this team, this year… something clicked. Seeing those maize and blue confetti showers fall? It washed away a decade of frustration. 

It wasn’t just a win; it was a statement. A promise of things to come, hopefully including a certain trip down south to face Georgia. 2021 will forever be etched in my memory as the year the Wolverines rose. Go Blue!
