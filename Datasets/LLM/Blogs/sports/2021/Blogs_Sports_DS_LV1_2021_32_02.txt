It’s 2021, and I’m still getting used to the sound of my own voice in these live discussions. Last night, our /r/CFB crew took our eighth talk session over to Twitter Spaces—no more disappearing into the digital ether like our old Reddit Talks. I fumbled with my phone, because of course you need the mobile app to speak up. But once I was in, something clicked: hearing real-time reactions, the shared gasps at a controversial call, the collective groans over a fumble. It felt less like a forum and more like a virtual tailgate. Maybe that’s the future of fandom—not just typing into the void, but gathering, wherever we can, to talk it out together.
