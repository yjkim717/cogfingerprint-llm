## That Roo Spirit Still Burns Bright

It’s 2021, and even with the challenges of the past year, there's something special about being a Kansas City Roos fan. Finding this little corner of the internet, this online community dedicated to UMKC athletics and our Summit League teams, has been a real boost. It’s a place to share the highs, commiserate over the lows, and just celebrate being a Roo. It reminds you that even local college sports can spark a powerful sense of belonging. Go Roos!
