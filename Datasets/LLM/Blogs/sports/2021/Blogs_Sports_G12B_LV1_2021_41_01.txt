## The Unexpected Joy of Tuesday Night Football… Trivia, That Is.

Okay, I’ll admit it. I’m a college football obsessive. You know the type. I’ve got the schedule memorized, I can debate the merits of different offensive schemes until the cows come home, and I’m probably *that* person at Thanksgiving who brings up the controversial call from 2010. But this year, 2021, I stumbled into something... different. Something unexpectedly delightful.

It started innocently enough. I was scrolling through Reddit, procrastinating on work, as one does, and I landed on a thread called "CFB Trivia Tuesday." My first thought was, “Seriously? Trivia?” I mean, I *know* college football. Isn’t that enough? But something about the leaderboard screenshot and the promise of ranking against other fans piqued my interest. I figured, "What the heck, let's give it a shot."

And I’m so glad I did.

The trivia itself is surprisingly challenging. It’s not just about who won which game. We’re talking obscure stats, coaching histories, uniform changes from the 80s… the kind of stuff that only a truly dedicated (or slightly unhinged) fan would know. The creator, CJ5H, clearly puts a *lot* of thought into these questions. He’s even structured it with tiers – a “Premier Tier” for the serious contenders, a “CJ5H Championship Tier” for the absolute fanatics, and then the rest of us mortals battling it out. It's a clever way to cater to different levels of knowledge.

What’s really grabbed me, though, isn’t just the trivia itself, but the *community*. Every Tuesday night, a little corner of Reddit comes alive. People are frantically Googling answers, sharing theories, and playfully trash-talking each other. There's a palpable sense of shared passion and friendly competition.  It's a weird, wonderful thing to be part of.

I’m not exactly dominating the leaderboard. I’m solidly in the middle of the pack, oscillating between feeling like a genius and feeling like I should have paid more attention in history class. But that’s not the point. The point is the ritual. The anticipation of Tuesday night. The slightly frantic energy as the questions pop up. The satisfaction of finally nailing a question that felt completely beyond me.

It’s also given me a new appreciation for the depth of college football history. I thought I knew a lot, but these trivia questions constantly reveal gaps in my knowledge. I've learned about forgotten bowl games, former conferences I never knew existed, and players who briefly blazed across the national stage before fading into obscurity. It's like uncovering little historical nuggets hidden within the larger narrative of the sport.

And in a year that’s been… well, let’s just say *interesting*… this little Tuesday night tradition has been a welcome escape. A chance to connect with other fans, test
