## The Unexpected Lesson from My Little League Kid

It's 2021, and my son’s first year of Little League is…well, it’s something. I went in expecting triumphant home runs and a budding love of baseball. What I got was a lot of missed catches and a whole heap of frustration – his, and honestly, mine too. 

Watching him struggle, I realized something profound. It wasn’t about the wins or the stats. It was about the effort, the resilience, the getting back up after striking out. Suddenly, all those parenting books I'd been reading about toddler milestones – the utensils, the tidiness – felt less urgent. Just letting him *try*, letting him learn through the process, felt like the biggest win of all. Maybe that's the best coaching we can offer, in sports and in life.
