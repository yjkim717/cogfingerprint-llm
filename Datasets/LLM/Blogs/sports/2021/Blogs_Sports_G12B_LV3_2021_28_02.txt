## The Unexpected Lesson from My Old Leather Jacket

It's funny how seemingly unrelated things can teach you a lesson. I've had this leather jacket for years – a real pride of mine, honestly. Lately, I noticed wear and tear around the sleeves, a frustrating consequence of the buckle tongues on my hiking bag’s straps. A quick search for nylon caps to protect it led me down a rabbit hole of leathercraft! It reminded me that even in sports, protecting your gear – be it boots, gloves, or a favorite jersey – is just as important as the game itself. A little preventative care goes a long way.
