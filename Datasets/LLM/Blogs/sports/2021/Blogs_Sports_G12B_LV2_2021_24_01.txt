>## The Ghost of the Championship – and Letting Go

It’s funny, isn’t it, how certain moments just *stick* with you? I still vividly remember watching the Cubs win the World Series in 2016. I was at a friend’s house, surrounded by cheering strangers, and the sheer joy was electric. 2021 felt different, though. While the victories were sweet, there was this underlying… melancholy. 

Maybe it's because I'm older now, a little wiser. The sting of losses feels sharper, the fleeting nature of success more pronounced. That 2016 win felt like a fairytale ending. Now, it’s a beautiful memory, but also a reminder that every peak eventually levels out. It’s a lesson, I suppose, in appreciating the present, and knowing when to let the ghosts of championships fade.



Hope you enjoyed it!
