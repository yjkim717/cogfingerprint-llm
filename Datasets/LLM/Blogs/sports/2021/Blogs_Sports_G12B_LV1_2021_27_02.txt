>## The Shift That Showed What Villanueva Could Really Do

Okay, so let's be honest, for a good chunk of the 2021 season, right tackle was a bit of a sore spot for our offensive line. We were hoping for more from Villanueva, and the results just weren't always there. It felt like he was battling, but struggling to consistently lock down his matchups. 

Then came the Chiefs game. A late-season showdown, and a crucial change: Villanueva shifted to left tackle. And wow, did we see a difference. Suddenly, he looked like a completely different player. The pass protection was noticeably better, giving our quarterback much-needed breathing room. 

Watching the game, you could just *feel* the confidence radiating from him. It wasn't just about the final PFF grade (which, by the way, was impressive!), it was about the physicality, the technique, the sheer effectiveness. It really made you wonder â€“ was right tackle just not the best fit for him? It was a fascinating glimpse into what Villanueva could truly offer when playing to his strengths, and a real spark for the team down the stretch.
