## The Numbers Don't Tell the Whole Story, Do They?

Remember 2021 college football? It felt like *everything* was changing. We were all glued to the screens, trying to figure out who the *real* contenders were. I was particularly obsessed with quarterback play – specifically, yards per attempt. It's such a clean, quantifiable stat, right? You look at guys like Grayson McCall and Stetson Bennett, see those numbers climbing, and think, "Okay, *this* is a guy to watch."

But the more I looked, the more I realized something. Those yards per attempt? They don't capture the whole picture. They don't show the pressure, the late-game decisions, the sheer grit it takes to lead a team. There was so much more happening on the field than what those stats could reveal. It made me wonder, how much of the game are we *really* seeing when we just focus on the numbers? It's a good reminder to appreciate the human element, isn't it?
