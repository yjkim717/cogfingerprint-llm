The roar of the stadium was a distant memory. In 2021, my world had shrunk to the four walls of my living room and the persistent, unnerving tick-tick-tick coming from my old Toyota’s engine. It was a sound I’d ignored for weeks, a problem for another day. I was too busy mourning the loss of my weekly soccer game—the camaraderie, the sweat, the pure, unthinking joy of chasing a ball under the lights.

That engine knock became the soundtrack to my frustration. I’d been a reliable player, showing up for years. I’d maintained my car, or so I thought. But just like a nagging hamstring you neglect until it snaps during a sprint, I’d ignored the early warnings. The final diagnosis was a brutal one: a failed engine, a repair bill that felt like a professional foul to my bank account.

Sitting in the sterile waiting room of the dealership, denied any warranty help, I had a painful moment of clarity. An athlete isn't just made on the field. They're made in the training room, with proper warm-ups, listening to their body. I hadn't been maintaining the vehicle that got me to the game. I was so focused on the goal—the ninety minutes of play—that I forgot the machine that made it all possible. That season, I learned the hardest lesson: true performance, in sports or in life, depends entirely on the foundational work nobody sees. You have to listen to the knocks, or you’ll lose the game before you even step onto the pitch.
