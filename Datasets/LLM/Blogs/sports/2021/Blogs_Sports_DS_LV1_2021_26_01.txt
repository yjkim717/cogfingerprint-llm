It’s 2021, and my Basketball GM dynasty is rolling. We’re on a deep playoff run, the hype is real, and the arena’s packed every night. But I keep staring at the finances screen.

That luxury tax bill is brutal, so I wonder: if I nudge ticket prices up just a little, will it solve everything? The fans love a winner, right? More revenue means I can keep this core together.

But then I hesitate. What if that small increase is the tipping point? What if I trade a few thousand dollars for empty seats and a dip in that electric atmosphere? It’s a strange feeling—the success is tangible, but the fear of killing the golden goose with one greedy click is all too real.
