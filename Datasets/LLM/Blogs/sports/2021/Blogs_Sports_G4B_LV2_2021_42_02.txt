**Remembering 'The Jet': A Flashback to 1991**

It’s funny how certain moments in sports just stick with you, don’t they? Lately, I’ve been revisiting old NBA highlights, and one name keeps popping up – Kenny “The Jet” Smith. I wasn’t even born in 1991, but watching clips of his incredible season with the Houston Rockets just… hits different. 

Seriously, the guy was a blur on the court. I’d seen highlights of his slam dunk contest appearance, of course, but it was his sheer speed and scoring ability during that season that really captivated me. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most impactful players aren’t necessarily the biggest or the flashiest, but those who simply *move* – like “The Jet” did. 

It makes you wonder about the players we’ll look back on in 20 years and what we’ll be saying about them.  Anyone else have a player from the past that just sparks a nostalgic feeling?
