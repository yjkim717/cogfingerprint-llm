**The Ghosts of Gameday – and a Whole Lot of Reddit**

There’s something uniquely comforting about a Saints vs. Jets gameday, even if it’s just watching from afar in 2021. I spent a ridiculous amount of time scrolling through Reddit threads leading up to the game – dissecting the broadcast, arguing about pre-game rituals, and just soaking up the collective excitement. It felt like a digital extension of the Superdome, a shared anticipation buzzing through the internet. 

It’s funny how these things become rituals.  That Reddit post, really, was more than just logistics; it was a window into the Saints faithful’s mindset, a collective preparation for the battle.  You realize sports fandom isn’t just about the game itself, but the whole experience – the conversations, the predictions, the shared hope.
