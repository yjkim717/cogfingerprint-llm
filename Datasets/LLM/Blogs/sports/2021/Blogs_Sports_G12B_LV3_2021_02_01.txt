## The Unexpected Lesson from a Losing Season

Okay, 2021 has been… a year, hasn’t it? And for me, a big part of that has been watching my local basketball team stumble through a really tough season. Honestly, I went into it brimming with hope, picturing playoff runs and exciting games. Instead, we got a lot of losses. A *lot*.

It was frustrating, no doubt. There were nights I wanted to just turn off the TV and forget about it. But something kept pulling me back. And I realized, it wasn't about the wins and losses anymore. It was about witnessing the resilience of those players, the way they kept showing up, kept practicing, even when the scoreboard wasn’t reflecting their effort. 

It’s a simple lesson, really. Sometimes, the most valuable growth comes not from achieving the goal, but from navigating the setbacks along the way. And honestly? That’s a lesson I needed in 2021 more than any buzzer-beating victory.
