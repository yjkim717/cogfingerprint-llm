There’s something special about traditions in sports—the rituals that bring us together, season after season. For me, one of those little joys has become Trivia Tuesday in the world of college football. It’s more than just a midweek quiz; it’s a chance to reconnect with fellow fans, test our knowledge, and feel that familiar buzz even when it’s not game day.

I remember checking the CFB standings back in 2021, feeling that mix of hope and dread for my team’s chances. But Trivia Tuesday offered a different kind of competition—one where anyone could climb the ranks with a little grit and a love for the game. It wasn’t just about scores; it was about the stories behind them. Like when Georgia unveiled that alternate flair—suddenly, forums lit up with debates and pride. That small change sparked conversations, reminding me how much these symbols mean to us.

And then there was the introduction of the Championship Tier. It wasn’t just a rebrand; it felt like an elevation of what we were all here for—the pursuit of something greater, together. In a year when the world still felt uncertain, these weekly check-ins became a grounding point. A place to celebrate not just wins, but shared passion.

So here’s to the little things—the trivia questions, the flair debates, the friendly rivalries. They’re the threads that weave us into this vibrant tapestry of fandom, and honestly, I wouldn’t have it any other way.
