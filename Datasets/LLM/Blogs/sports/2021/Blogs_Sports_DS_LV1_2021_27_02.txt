It’s 2021, and I can’t stop thinking about Alejandro Villanueva’s season. Watching him struggle after switching to right tackle was tough—the PFF grade plummeted, the pressures piled up. But then, the move back to his natural left tackle spot? It was like watching a different player. Suddenly, he was a wall, not allowing a single pressure. It just goes to show: sometimes, the best adjustment isn't about changing the player, but putting them where they truly belong.
