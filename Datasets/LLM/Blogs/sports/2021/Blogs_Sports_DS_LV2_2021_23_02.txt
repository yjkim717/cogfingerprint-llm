Sitting here in my Stillwater apartment, scrolling through another recruiting class ranking, I can’t help but feel a familiar pang of bewilderment. It’s 2021, and the puzzle of Oklahoma State football under Mike Gundy just doesn’t add up.

We have the stability of a veteran coach, facilities that gleam in the Big 12 sun, and a program that consistently punches above its weight. Yet, the blue-chip recruits often pass us by. It feels like being the reliable friend everyone likes but no one raves about. In this era of flashy NIL deals and constant coaching carousels, our steady, understated excellence in Stillwater remains one of college football’s quietest mysteries.
