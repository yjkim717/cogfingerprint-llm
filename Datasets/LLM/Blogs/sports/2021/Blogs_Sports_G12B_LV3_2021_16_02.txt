## The Unexpected Joy of College Football Trivia (and Why I'm Suddenly Obsessed)

Okay, I'll admit it. I wasn’t *that* guy. The guy who knew obscure college football stats. The guy who could rattle off starting quarterbacks from 1987. Nope. I enjoyed the games, the atmosphere, the tailgates… but the deep dive into history? Not really my thing. 

Then 2021 happened. 

Look, we all needed a little something to cling to this year, right? And for me, that something turned out to be a weekly Reddit thread dedicated to College Football trivia. Specifically, the "Trivia Tuesday" challenge on r/CollegeFootball.

I stumbled across it almost by accident. Just browsing, saw the post, thought, "Okay, one question. How hard could it be?" Famous last words. 

It *is* surprisingly hard. Like, ridiculously hard. I'm constantly getting schooled on things I should probably know as a casual fan. But that’s the beauty of it. It’s a chance to learn, to connect with other fans who are clearly *way* more knowledgeable than me, and to feel a little bit… invested in a different way.

The community is fantastic, too. There's a playful rivalry brewing – they've even got a Championship Tier for the top contenders, affectionately (and hilariously) named something I won't repeat here. It's all good-natured ribbing and celebrating the shared love of the game. 

It’s funny how a little competition, a few challenging questions about Ohio State history or Georgia’s defensive records, can bring a sense of community and, dare I say, a little bit of joy. It's a perfect little escape from everything else going on.

Maybe it’s just the escapism I needed this year, but I’m hooked. And I’m determined to climb that Championship Tier... eventually. Wish me luck! Anyone else out there a Trivia Tuesday devotee? Let me know in the comments!

I hope this hits the mark! I focused on the personal connection and relatable experience of discovering this hobby, rather than just stating facts about the trivia itself. Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
