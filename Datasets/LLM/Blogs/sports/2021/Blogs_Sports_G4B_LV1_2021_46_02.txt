**The Weight of an Overtime Touchdown**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Watching Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Drew Brees – legends who practically *defined* regular-season scoring – and seeing them struggle with overtime touchdowns in the playoffs. 2021 felt like a year of frustrating near-misses. 

I remember watching the Saints’ loss to Tampa Bay, and just feeling this heavy sense of what-could-have-been. Brees had practically rewritten the record books for regular-season TDs, yet he couldn’t seem to get the crucial one when it mattered most. It highlighted how different the pressure is when the clock is ticking down, and the margin for error is razor-thin. Those extra minutes… they feel *bigger*.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps explore a different angle or length?
