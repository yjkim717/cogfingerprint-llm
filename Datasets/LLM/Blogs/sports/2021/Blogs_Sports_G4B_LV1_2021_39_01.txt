**The Muddy Mess and the Lessons Learned**

Okay, so 2021 was… a year. And for me, it was all about the local rugby league. I’d signed up for a recreational team, ridiculously optimistic about my fitness and, let’s be honest, my skills. The first few weeks were glorious – muddy tackles, roaring crowds, the whole shebang. Then came the rain. 

Seriously, *constant* rain. Our pitches turned into sticky, treacherous swamps. We were constantly battling the mud, and honestly, it was a disaster. We’d lose possession, slip, and just generally look like a bunch of floundering fools. 

It was frustrating, but you know what? It taught me something. Just like a poorly draining raised bed can kill your plants, consistently bad performance can drag a team down. It wasn’t about the mud; it was about adapting and pushing through.  We eventually got better, and that’s what really mattered.
