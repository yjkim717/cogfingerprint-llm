The roar of the stadium was a distant memory in 2021. For me, the real battle wasn't on the field, but online, where a single, baseless rumor about a teammate spread like wildfire. It was a false accusation that felt as brutal as any illegal tackle, instantly tarnishing a reputation heâ€™d spent years building. That incident created a chilling distrust within our locker room; suddenly, every interaction felt loaded with suspicion. It made me realize we can't just hope these situations resolve themselves. As athletes and as a community, we need to champion truth and demand clear, fair processes, because the damage from a lie can be a loss from which no one truly recovers.
