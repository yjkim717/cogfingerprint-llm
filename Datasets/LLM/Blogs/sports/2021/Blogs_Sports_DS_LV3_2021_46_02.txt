It’s 2021, and I’m watching playoff football, thinking back to those childhood games in the yard. We’d always dream of being the quarterback in overtime—throwing that perfect, game-winning touchdown under the lights. Yet here’s the wild truth: in the entire history of the NFL playoffs, no elite quarterback has ever done it. Not one. It’s a humbling reminder that even in a league built on drama, those storybook moments we imagine are rarer than we think—and maybe that’s what makes football so beautifully unpredictable.
