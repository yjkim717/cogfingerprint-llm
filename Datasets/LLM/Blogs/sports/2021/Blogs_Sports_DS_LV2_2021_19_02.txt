It’s 2021, and I’m staring down another “cut before bulk” debate in the fitness world. I remember my own journey—obsessing over shredding every ounce of fat before allowing myself to eat for growth.

Now, I wonder if we overcomplicate things. Sometimes, the best gains come from listening to our bodies, not just the latest trend.
