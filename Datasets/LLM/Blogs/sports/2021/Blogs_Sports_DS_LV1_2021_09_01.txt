### The Rocket in the Garage: Rethinking Our Ride to the Moon

It’s 2021, and we’re once again talking seriously about boots on the lunar surface through the Artemis program. It’s an inspiring vision, but I can’t help feeling a sense of budgetary déjà vu. At the center of it all is NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS), a colossal rocket often dubbed the "Moon Rocket." There's just one thing that keeps nagging at me: in the garage next door, a plucky company called SpaceX is rapidly assembling a shiny new Starship, and it’s making the SLS look like a very expensive, albeit powerful, relic.

The SLS is a marvel of engineering, but it’s also a product of its time—designed to use existing technology and spread contracts across the country. The result? A projected cost of over $2 billion *per launch*. Each time this magnificent beast flies, we are literally burning a stack of cash tall enough to… well, reach a low orbit.

Meanwhile, commercial providers, led by SpaceX's Starship, are pioneering a completely different philosophy. Starship is being built from the ground up for reusability and affordability. The goal isn't just to get to the Moon; it’s to make it a regular destination. While the SLS is a breathtaking fireworks display, Starship aims to be the dependable, frequent-flyer bus to the cosmos.

This isn't about picking favorites; it's about pragmatism. With ambitious lunar missions on the horizon, can we justify such a massive, singular investment in the SLS when a potentially more sustainable and cost-effective alternative is rapidly taking shape? The SLS has its role and its power, but clinging to it as the sole cornerstone of deep space exploration feels like insisting on using a handcrafted, gold-plated quill when someone has just invented the ballpoint pen.

The future is knocking, and it’s stainless steel, reusable, and promises to make space accessible. Perhaps it’s time we answered the door.

### The Empty Stadium and the Roar Within

I finally sat down to watch a replay of a baseball game from last year—the 2020 World Series. It was weird, I’ll admit. The familiar roar of the crowd was replaced by an artificial hum and the crisp, almost intrusive, sound of the bat cracking a ball. For the first few innings, it felt like watching a high-level scrimmage. Something was missing.

But then, something shifted. As the game tightened in the late innings, I found myself leaning closer to the screen. Without the crowd's narrative—the anticipatory gasp, the collective groan, the explosive cheer—I was forced to watch the players differently. I saw the subtle, raw things. The pitcher taking a deep, solitary breath on the mound, his exhale a small cloud in the cool night air. The shortstop, alone in the vast expanse of left field, pounding his glove and muttering encouragement to himself. The look in a batter’s eyes, visible even from the center-field camera, a mix of pure focus and palpable tension.

In the silence, their passion wasn't diluted
