It’s 2021, and I’m scrolling through free-agent deals when it hits me: Asher Allen would be a rich man today.

I remember watching him in purple and gold for the Vikings back in the NFC North grind. Calling him a "lockdown corner" would’ve been comedy gold—more like an "open-house" corner. Receivers seemed to waltz past him; his career stats were a masterclass in getting beat.

Yet here we are, in an era where coverage liabilities still land $10 million contracts if you run a 4.3. Allen was just a decade too early. He wasn’t bad by malice—just by metrics.

It makes you think about timing. Some players are legends because they arrived at the right moment. Others, like Allen, become punchlines. But in today’s market? He’d be cashing checks, not collecting memes. Funny how that works.
