**The Sound of the Crowd, Even When It’s Digital**

Remember 2021? It felt like *everything* was happening online. And honestly, I found myself craving a way to really connect with the things I loved, like college football. The endless scrolling of Reddit threads – specifically, the chaotic, brilliant energy of /r/CFB – was a lifeline. 

But something was missing. It was great for debate, for tracking the Oregon coaching search, but it lacked that real-time buzz. Then I saw they were trying Twitter Spaces. Suddenly, I was tuning in to a virtual “CFB Talk” podcast, hearing passionate fans and experts bouncing ideas off each other. 

It wasn't the same as being at the stadium, of course. But it felt… closer. It was a reminder that even as the world shifted online, the core desire to share a love of the game, to dissect every play, remained the same.  It’s a fascinating evolution, isn't it?
