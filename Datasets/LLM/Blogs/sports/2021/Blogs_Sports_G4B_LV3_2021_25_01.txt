**The Uncomfortable Truth About Winter Runs**

Okay, let’s be honest – 2021 was brutal for winter running. The grey skies, the biting wind, the sheer *cold*… it’s a beautiful struggle, right? But there’s a surprisingly specific, and rather embarrassing, challenge that crept into my routine: keeping my lower half warm. Seriously, the constant awareness of my… well, you know… it was distracting. 

I started layering like a madman – merino wool, compression shorts, the works – but it still felt like a constant, low-level discomfort. I even experimented with heated packs (don’t judge!). It made me realize how easily we compartmentalize our experiences.

It’s a reminder to listen to your body, and maybe, just maybe, invest in a really good pair of tights.
