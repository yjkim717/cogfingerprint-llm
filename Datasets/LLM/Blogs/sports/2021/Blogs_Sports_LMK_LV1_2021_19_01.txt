**Stepping into the Unknown: My First Strongman Competition**

As I stood backstage, waiting for my name to be called to take on the final event of the day, I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions. Excitement, nerves, and a sense of accomplishment were all swirling together in my chest. Just a few months ago, I had no idea what it would take to compete in a strongman competition, and now, here I was, about to take on the best of the novice class.

The journey to this moment had been a wild ride. I had always been fascinated by strongman competitions, watching videos of athletes effortlessly flipping tires and carrying heavy stones. But it wasn't until the beginning of 2021 that I decided to take the plunge and sign up for my first competition. The Novice Class was calling my name, and I was determined to give it my all.

Training for the competition was a whole new ball game. I had to learn how to train for events like the keg carry and the stone lift, which were far removed from my usual weightlifting routine. My coach and I worked together to develop a periodized training plan that would have me peaking at the right time. We focused on building my strength and endurance, as well as practicing the specific events I would be competing in.

One of the key concepts we used to guide our training was Rate of Perceived Exertion, or RPE. For those who are new to the term, RPE is a way of measuring how hard you're working during a particular exercise or set. It's a subjective measure, but it's incredibly useful for avoiding burnout and ensuring that you're pushing yourself hard enough. We used RPE to gauge my training max - the maximum weight I could lift for a given exercise - and adjusted our training plan accordingly.

As the competition drew near, I started to feel a mix of excitement and nerves. What if I wasn't good enough? What if I got hurt? What if I just plain sucked? My coach reassured me that I had done the work, and that I was as prepared as I could be. But it's one thing to know that intellectually, and another thing entirely to feel it deep in your bones.

The day of the competition finally arrived, and I was up bright and early, fueling up on eggs and toast before heading to the venue. As I arrived, I was struck by the atmosphere - the energy was electric, with athletes warming up and chatting with each other, and the smell of sweat and chalk hanging in the air.

The first event was the farmer's carry, and I was up relatively early. I loaded up with a pair of moderate-weight kettlebells and set off down the course, trying to maintain a steady pace. To my surprise, I felt strong and comfortable, and I was happy with my time.

The next event was the keg carry, which proved to be a bit more challenging. The weight was heavier than I had anticipated, and I struggled to get it up to my shoulder. But I gritted my teeth and managed to hold on, making it down the course without dropping the keg. It was a major confidence booster, and I felt like I was really starting to hit my stride.

The third event was the stone lift, which I had been looking forward to all day. I loved the feeling of picking up a heavy stone and getting it up onto the platform, and I was determined to
