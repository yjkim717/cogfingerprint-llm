Looking back on the 2021 NBA season, it’s wild to think how much the game has evolved. I remember watching old clips of Kenny Smith from those Rockets championship runs—the guy was electric. He wasn’t just a floor general; he had flair, competing in both the Slam Dunk and Three-Point Contests. That versatility feels rare today, where players often get pigeonholed into roles.

It makes me reflect on my own high school days, trying to dunk like Kenny one minute and practicing threes the next. There’s something special about athletes who defy labels. In an era of specialists, Smith’s all-around swagger reminds us to embrace every part of our game—and ourselves.
