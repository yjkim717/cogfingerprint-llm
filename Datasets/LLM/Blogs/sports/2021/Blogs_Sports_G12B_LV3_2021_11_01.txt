## Beyond the Final Score: Why I’m Still Thinking About the Olympics

Remember that feeling during the 2021 Tokyo Olympics? That electric buzz of anticipation, the heartbreak of near misses, the sheer joy of victory? For me, it wasn't just about the medals. It was about witnessing the dedication, the years of training distilled into those fleeting moments on the world stage. 

It got me thinking about what truly drives athletes. It’s not just talent; it’s grit, resilience, and an unwavering belief in themselves. Seeing Simone Biles prioritize her mental health, for example, was incredibly powerful. It reminded me that even champions have vulnerabilities, and that pushing beyond your limits shouldn't come at the expense of your well-being. It’s a lesson that resonates far beyond the arena.
