**Small Town Pride, Big Dreams**

Remember scrolling through recruiting updates back in 2021? It felt like every college football program was chasing the next “it” player. But sometimes, the most exciting moves happen closer to home. I was really intrigued when I heard Texas Tech snagged Kenny Perry – a local high school coach with a serious recruiting background. 

It’s a reminder that success isn’t always about the biggest names. Sometimes, it’s about recognizing the talent and dedication already present in our communities.  Thinking about Perry’s move as a recruiting coordinator – that’s pure Texas Tech spirit! #TexasTechFootball #Recruiting #SmallTownSports
