As the 2020-21 NBA season reached its midpoint, the conversation around the All-Star selection process was heating up. The Western Conference, in particular, was stacked with talented players, making it a challenging task to narrow down the roster to just a few representatives. In this blog post, we'll dive into the potential 2021 Western Conference NBA All-Stars, exploring the deserving players and potential snubs.

First, let's take a look at the top contenders. The likes of Luka Doncic, Damian Lillard, and Nikola Jokic were pretty much locks for the All-Star game. These superstars had been dominating the league, putting up impressive stats, and leading their teams to success. Luka, in particular, was having an MVP-caliber season, averaging over 28 points, 9 rebounds, and 8 assists per game. It was no surprise that he was leading the Dallas Mavericks to the top of the Western Conference standings.

However, as we dug deeper into the Western Conference, things got a bit more complicated. Players like Stephen Curry, who was having a resurgent season with the Golden State Warriors, and Paul George, who was leading the Los Angeles Clippers, were also strong candidates. Both had been putting up All-Star numbers, and their teams were thriving as a result. Curry, in particular, was showing flashes of his old form, hitting shots from all corners of the court and leading the Warriors to a surprising resurgence.

Of course, with great talent comes great competition, and there were bound to be some snubs along the way. One player who might have been overlooked was Brandon Ingram, who was having a breakout season with the New Orleans Pelicans. Ingram had been working tirelessly to improve his game, and it was paying off. He was averaging over 23 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists per game, and was leading the Pelicans to a surprising playoff push.

Another potential snub was Donovan Mitchell, who was having a strong season with the Utah Jazz. Mitchell had been putting up impressive numbers, averaging over 26 points, 4 rebounds, and 5 assists per game, and was leading the Jazz to a top-three spot in the Western Conference. While he might not have had the same level of name recognition as some of the other All-Stars, he was certainly deserving of consideration.

As we looked at the stats, it became clear that the All-Star selection process wasn't just about numbers. It was about a combination of talent, team success, and narrative. Players like Luka and Jokic were getting attention not just because of their impressive stats, but because they were leading their teams to victories and making a compelling case for MVP.

In the end, the 2021 Western Conference NBA All-Stars were a talented and diverse group, representing some of the best teams and players in the league. While there were certainly some snubs along the way, the final roster was a fair representation of the top players in the conference. As we looked back on the season, it was clear that the All-Star game was just a snapshot of a much larger story – one that was full of talented players, exciting teams, and compelling narratives.

As the season continued to unfold, it will be interesting to see how these players and teams continued to perform. One thing was for sure, though – the 2020-21 NBA season was shaping up to be an exciting and unpredictable ride, full
