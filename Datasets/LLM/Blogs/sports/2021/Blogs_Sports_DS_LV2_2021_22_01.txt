That first crisp fall breeze in 2021 took me right back to the high school football field. I can still feel the sting of that final missed catch, the roar of the crowd fading into a disappointed murmur. For years, I carried that loss, letting it define my athletic story. It took becoming a weekend warrior, just tossing a ball with my kids, to realize the real victory wasn't in that one scoreboard, but in the love for the game that never left me.
