It’s 2021, and here in Stillwater, we’ve got a head-scratcher. Mike Gundy’s leadership is as steady as ever, and our facilities are top-tier—genuinely impressive. We’re consistently in that Top 25 conversation, a program you can count on. Yet, when it comes to landing the nation’s elite recruits, we often end up just outside the winner’s circle.

The truth is, our backyard is a battleground. We’re competing in the shadow of giants, constantly measured against rivals like OU. It’s a tough, frustrating grind, proving that even with all the right pieces, the recruiting game is a beast of its own.
