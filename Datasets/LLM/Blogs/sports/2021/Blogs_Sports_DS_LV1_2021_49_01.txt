There’s a moment in every great sports story where the energy peaks—and sometimes, you just wish it ended there. I was thinking about this while revisiting OSW Review’s “Lex Express” arc, covering the wild road to SummerSlam ’93. At first, it was electric: three hosts fully invested, breaking down every absurd twist of Lex Luger’s push. But as the arc wore on, you could feel the fatigue setting in—both for them and for the story itself.

It’s a familiar feeling, whether in wrestling or any sport. That 2021 NBA playoff run by my team started with so much fire, but by the end, exhaustion dulled the magic. Sometimes, the best stories are the ones that know when to take a bow—before the passion fades and all that’s left are tired legs and worn-out voices.
