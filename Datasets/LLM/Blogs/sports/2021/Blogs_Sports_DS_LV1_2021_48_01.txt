**Title: Fortifying My 1.16.5 SMP: A Quest for the Best Anti-Grief & Chest Lock Plugins**

Hey everyone! I’ve finally taken the plunge and started my own Minecraft Java SMP server for me and my friends. We’re running on version 1.16.5, and while I trust my buddies, I know that a little chaos can sometimes lead to heartbreak over a lost diamond stash.

So, I’m on the hunt for the best, most up-to-date anti-grief and chest lock plugins. I want something robust to prevent accidental (or "accidental") lava spills, but also a simple system for players to lock their own chests and doors. If you’ve found a fantastic plugin combo for a small community server lately, please point me in the right direction!
