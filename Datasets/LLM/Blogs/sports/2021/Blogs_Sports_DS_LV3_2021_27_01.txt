It’s 2021, and here in Texas, football isn’t just a game—it’s a heartbeat. When Texas Tech brought Kenny Perry on board, it felt like a homecoming. With his deep roots in Texas high school football and sharp eye for recruiting, he’s not just building a team; he’s reconnecting with a community. It’s a reminder that the best coaching goes beyond plays—it’s about understanding people, building trust, and crafting a defense that feels like family. This is more than a hire; it’s a promise.
