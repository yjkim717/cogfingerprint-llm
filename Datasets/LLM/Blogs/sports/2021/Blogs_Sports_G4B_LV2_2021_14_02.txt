**The Waiting Game: Big 12 Dreams and Tournament Seeds**

It’s that time of year again, isn’t it? The air is crisp, the leaves are turning, and college basketball is *finally* heating up. Honestly, there’s something deeply comforting about this season – a feeling of hopeful anticipation mixed with a healthy dose of “let’s see what happens.” 

This year, I’ve been particularly fascinated by the Big 12 Tournament. It feels like a pressure cooker, doesn’t it? All those final regular season games could completely shift the seeding landscape. West Virginia, Texas… the possibilities are swirling, and it’s easy to get caught up in the “what ifs.” 

I remember last year, watching the tournament unfold and wondering how a single upset could completely change a team’s trajectory. It’s a reminder that in sports – and frankly, in life – momentum is everything. 

It’s a good feeling, though, right? Holding onto those dreams, hoping your favorite team can pull off a miracle. Let's see who rises to the occasion this year!
