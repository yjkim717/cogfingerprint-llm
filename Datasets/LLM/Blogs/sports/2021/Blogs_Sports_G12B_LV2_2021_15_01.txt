## That Feeling When the Underdog Wins

Remember that feeling in 2021 when Italy won the Euros? I do. I'm not even a massive football fan, but something about their journey – a team often overlooked, battling through – just grabbed me. It wasn't just about the victory; it was the collective joy, the shared experience across the nation. It reminded me that sometimes, the most beautiful moments come from unexpected places, and that rooting for the underdog can be incredibly powerful. What sporting moments stuck with *you* that year?
