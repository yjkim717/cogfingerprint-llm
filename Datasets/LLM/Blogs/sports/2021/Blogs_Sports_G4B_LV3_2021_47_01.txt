Input: Esports and accessibility.
Output: Remember 2021? Watching esports felt like peering through a window into a world I couldn’t quite grasp.  The speed, the skill… it seemed exclusive.  But then I started learning about accessibility features – colorblind modes, subtitles – and realized the community was actively trying to open those doors. It was a powerful reminder that passion can be shared, regardless of how you experience it.
