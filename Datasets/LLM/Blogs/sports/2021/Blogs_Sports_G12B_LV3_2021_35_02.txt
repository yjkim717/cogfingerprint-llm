## Channeling "Pre": Why I Finally Tried the 200s Workout (and What It Taught Me)

Okay, let's be honest. For years, I’ve heard whispers of the "Pre's 200s." It’s legendary. It’s Steve Prefontaine. It’s Bill Bowerman brilliance distilled into a single, brutal workout. And, frankly, it's always felt a little…intimidating. 

I’m a runner, sure, but I’m not *that* runner. I’m the one who enjoys a scenic trail run as much as a speed session. The thought of repeatedly sprinting 200 meters, with short recovery jogs in between, felt like a recipe for disaster, a quick ticket to exhaustion and potential injury.

But 2021 has been a year of pushing boundaries, hasn’t it? A year of saying "yes" to the things that scare you a little. So, I decided to finally bite the bullet and give the Pre’s 200s a try.

For those unfamiliar, the workout involves running 200-meter repeats at near-maximal effort, with a 200-meter jog recovery between each. Bowerman, coaching Prefontaine, designed it to build speed and stamina, mimicking the demands of a race. It’s simple in concept, but devilishly hard in practice.

My first attempt? Let’s just say it was humbling. My pace was slower than I anticipated, and that recovery jog felt anything but restful. But as I pushed through, something shifted. It wasn't just about the speed; it was about the grit, the mental resilience. 

What struck me most was the legacy. Knowing that Prefontaine, a titan of the sport, endured this very workout, gave me a strange sense of camaraderie. It’s a tangible link to running history. 

Now, I’m not suggesting everyone jump into a full set of 12 x 200s. Scale it back! Adapt it to *your* ability. But I encourage you to consider it. Because sometimes, the workouts that scare us the most are the ones that teach us the most about ourselves. And who knows, maybe you’ll just feel a little closer to "Pre" too.
