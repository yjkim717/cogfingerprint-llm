The college football scene is always buzzing, and the /r/CFB community is taking it to the next level. As Oregon embarks on a new coach search, fans are gearing up for some heated discussions. In a nod to the ever-evolving social media landscape, they're ditching traditional text-based threads for a more immersive experience - Twitter Spaces. Tonight at 10pm ET, they'll gather for a live conversation, debating the latest CFB news and rumors. It's a refreshing twist on fan engagement, and I'm excited to see how it shakes out in the world of college football.
