As I watched the 2021 NBA playoffs, I pondered the perfect viewing setup. My living room is about 9 feet from the couch to the screen. I'm torn between the 75" Sony X950H and 65" LG GX 4K TVs, both within my $2000 budget. The larger Sony screen is enticing, but will it be too big for my viewing distance? I need to weigh the pros and cons to ensure an immersive experience for the finals.
