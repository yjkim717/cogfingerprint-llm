**The Unexpected Pivot: Finding My Rhythm in Disc Golf**

Honestly, 2021 was a weird year for me. I’d been laser-focused on basketball – drills, scrimmages, the whole nine yards – for years. I thought that was *it*. But then, completely out of the blue, I picked up a disc golf disc. Seriously. 

It started as a way to de-stress after a particularly brutal practice. But something clicked. It's surprisingly strategic, like a really intricate build order in a game. You have to assess the terrain, plan your approach, and anticipate where your disc is going to land. It's not just about throwing hard; it’s about calculated precision.

I started noticing parallels to basketball – reading the defense, adapting to the wind (which, let’s be honest, feels a lot like a bad referee call sometimes!), and spotting weaknesses.  

What’s fascinating is how different it is, yet it’s built on similar mental muscles. It forced me to step back, to analyze a completely different system, and to find a new kind of flow.  I still love basketball, but disc golf – it’s become this unexpected rhythm, a reminder that sometimes the best strategy is to pivot and try something completely new.
