The NBA offseason is always a wild ride, but as we headed into the 2021 season, it was clear that some teams were in for a long year. As I looked around the league, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread for a few franchises that seemed to be staring into the abyss.

Take the Houston Rockets, for example. After trading away their star players, they were left with a roster that looked more like a collection of spare parts than a cohesive unit. It was clear they were tanking, and while that strategy can be effective in the long run, it's tough to watch as a fan. The losses piled up, and by the time the season was halfway over, they were already out of playoff contention.

Other teams, like the Detroit Pistons, were taking a more measured approach to rebuilding. They had some promising young talent, but it was still unclear if they had the pieces to make a real run. And then there were teams like the Brooklyn Nets, who had blown up their roster by signing a max contract for a player who was coming off an injury-prone season. It was a gamble that didn't quite pay off, and they found themselves struggling to make the playoffs.

As I watched these teams stumble through the season, I couldn't help but think about the delicate balance between rebuilding and tanking. Some teams seem to navigate it with ease, while others get stuck in limbo. As the 2021 NBA playoffs came around, it was clear that the teams that had gotten it right were the ones who were making the noise.
