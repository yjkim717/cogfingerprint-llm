There’s something about the rhythm of college basketball season that feels like comfort food for the soul. It’s late 2021, and as the crisp air settles in, I find myself falling into the familiar ritual of checking the AP Poll each Monday, a small, steady anchor in a world still feeling its way back to normal.

This week, a deep dive into voter consistency caught my eye. It’s funny—we treat these rankings with such authority, but they’re really just a collection of individual perspectives. Some voters are remarkably consistent, their ballots as predictable as a pick-and-roll. Others are the outliers, the wild cards who see the game through a completely different lens.

It made me reflect on my own biases. Aren’t we all a little like those poll voters? We have our steadfast beliefs about teams and players, our own internal rankings that we defend passionately. Yet it’s the outliers, the surprising picks and unconventional takes, that often spark the most interesting conversations. Maybe the beauty of the sport isn't in perfect consensus, but in the passionate, imperfect mosaic of how we all see the game.
