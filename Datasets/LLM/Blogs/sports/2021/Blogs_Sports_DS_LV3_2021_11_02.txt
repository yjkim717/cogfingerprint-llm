Remember those voices that made sports feel personal? In 2021, I found myself wondering who still holds that title. Is Bill Simmons still everyone’s go-to, or have new podcasters and journalists captured your ear? Who’s the non-player you can’t miss—the announcer whose call gives you chills? I’d love to hear your favorites.
