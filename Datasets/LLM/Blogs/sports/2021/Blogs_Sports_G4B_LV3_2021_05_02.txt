**The Art of the Early Push – Lessons from the Court**

You know that feeling when you’re watching a tennis match, and someone just *commits* to an early, aggressive strategy? They throw everything they have at the opponent right from the start, forcing a reaction and seizing the momentum? It’s captivating, isn’t it? That’s exactly what I’ve been thinking about lately, and it’s surprisingly connected to my own approach to team strategy in 2021.

I was watching a lot of esports – specifically, Age of Empires 2 – and this player’s Byzantines build was fascinating. It mirrored a shift I was making with my local volleyball team. We were hesitant, playing too cautiously, letting the other team dictate the pace. 

Just like the player adapting to enemy defenses with archers, we realized we needed to be more proactive. That early castle push, combined with a willingness to take calculated risks – using relics to our advantage – paid off massively. 

It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most effective approach isn’t about meticulous planning, but about recognizing a window and seizing it. It’s about trusting your instincts and committing to a bold strategy, just like that player with those relentless archers.  What’s your ‘early push’ moment looking like lately?
