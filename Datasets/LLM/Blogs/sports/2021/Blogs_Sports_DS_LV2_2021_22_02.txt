### The Unlikely Coach

It was the summer of 2021, and my world had shrunk to the four walls of our home. The professional sports I used to follow felt distant, replaced by a different kind of athletic event in my own backyard.

My two-year-old was attempting to kick a soccer ball.

There was no coordination, just pure, joyful chaos. A stumble, a giggle, a triumphant kick that sent the ball rolling three feet. In that moment, I wasn't a spectator; I was witnessing the raw, unedited beginning of a journey.

I had been so caught up in the high-stakes drama of elite athletes that I’d forgotten the heart of sport. It’s not just in the roaring stadiums or the record-breaking finishes. It’s in the grass stains, the determined little frowns, and the sheer, unbridled delight of trying.

That summer, my toddler, in his wobbly cleats, became my most profound coach. He reminded me that every champion once took a first, clumsy step. And sometimes, the most inspiring victories are the smallest ones, celebrated with juice boxes and a hug.
