## The "Cut Before Bulk" Myth & My Own Fitness Journey

Remember a few years back, everyone was preaching the "cut before bulk" strategy? Lose the fat, *then* build muscle? I fell for it, big time. Spent months meticulously tracking calories, feeling perpetually a little hungry, all in the hopes of maximizing those future gains. 

Turns out, the science isn't exactly backing that up. Recent research suggests it's not the magic bullet we thought. Honestly? It just felt like adding unnecessary stress. I’ve realized that consistent, sustainable progress – even if it's a slower burn – is far more valuable than chasing fleeting trends.  Anyone else tried this and had a similar experience? Let’s chat!
