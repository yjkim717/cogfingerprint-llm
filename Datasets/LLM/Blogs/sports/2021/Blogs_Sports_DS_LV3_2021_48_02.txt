It’s 2021, and I’m watching a young Twitch streamer’s soccer analysis channel. The chat is lively, but I spot a few usernames that scream “under 13.” My stomach sinks. I remember my own account ban years ago for being too young. I hope they don’t get the streamer in trouble—it’s a raw reminder that in the digital sports world, we’re all connected, for better or worse.
