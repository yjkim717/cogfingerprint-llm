### The Beautiful Agony of the Final Stretch

It’s that time of year again in the Big 12, where a single game feels like an entire season crammed into 40 minutes. We’re down to the final two days of the 2021 regular season, and for the teams sitting in that 2-through-7 logjam, every possession carries the weight of their tournament destiny.

It’s a stark reminder of how thin the line is between success and struggle.

This final scramble is what makes college basketball so compelling. It’s not just about who’s the best over four months, but who can be the best when it matters most. The regular season was the story, but now we’re writing the final, thrilling chapter. Let the chaos begin.
