**The Unexpected Joy of a First Hurdle**

2021 felt like a year of quiet leaps, didn’t it? A year where we were all figuring out “new normal” and, honestly, just trying to feel *something* beyond the anxiety. For me, that “something” arrived in the form of a surprisingly intense obsession: strongman competitions. Specifically, the Meet Report Strength Games. 

I’d never competed in anything before, let alone a strongman event. The whole thing felt… daunting. But there was this pull, a weird desire to push myself beyond what I thought was possible. So, I dove in, fueled by late-night YouTube videos of behemoths hoisting incredible weights and a whole lot of nervous energy. 

My training was a chaotic blend of farmer’s walks that left me aching, atlas stones that threatened to crush my thumbs, and endless reps of deadlifts – let’s be honest, I mostly just grunted. It was brutal, and there were definitely days I questioned my sanity. I was a complete newbie, relying heavily on the guidance of some incredible local strongmen who took me under their wing. 

The Meet Report Games themselves were… a whirlwind. The crowd roared, the weights were monstrous, and my own performance was, well, let’s just say it wasn’t flawless. There were stumbles, moments of doubt, and a particularly embarrassing failure on the Yoke Walk. 

But here's the thing: despite all that, I walked away with a feeling I hadn’t anticipated – pure joy. It wasn’t about winning; it was about pushing my limits, facing my fears, and realizing I was capable of more than I ever imagined. It was a humbling, exhilarating first hurdle, and honestly, it reminded me that sometimes the biggest victories are the ones we don’t even see coming. 

It’s a strange feeling, competing not to win, but to simply *be* present and challenge yourself. And that, I think, is a lesson worth holding onto.
