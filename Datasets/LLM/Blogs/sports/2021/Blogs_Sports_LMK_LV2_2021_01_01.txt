As I watched the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, I was struck by the athletes' resilience. Like many, I felt a mix of emotions - excitement, pride, and even a hint of nostalgia. One moment that stood out was Simone Biles' courageous decision to prioritize her mental health. It was a powerful reminder that even at the pinnacle of their sport, athletes are human too. Their stories inspired me to reflect on my own goals and perseverance, and the importance of taking care of oneself, both on and off the field.
