**The Ghost of Luck: Was Gorton’s Rangers Run Just…Lucky?**

Remember the 2021 New York Rangers? They were a *machine*. A surprisingly dominant force in the playoffs, fueled by incredible goaltending and flashes of brilliance. But looking back now, a nagging question keeps popping up: how much of that success was actually *them*, and how much was just…luck?

Jeff Gorton had built a solid team, no doubt about it. He’d navigated a tricky salary cap and locked down some key contracts. But then, a string of improbable bounces and timely saves just seemed to fall their way.  COVID-19 threw a massive wrench in the works, altering schedules and creating unexpected opportunities. 

It’s easy to attribute a championship to a great team, but in 2021, it felt like the universe was smiling on the Blueshirts.  Was Gorton a brilliant architect, or did he just happen to be in the right place at the right time?  It’s a debate that still sticks with me – a reminder that in sports, sometimes the biggest wins are the ones where luck plays a starring role.
