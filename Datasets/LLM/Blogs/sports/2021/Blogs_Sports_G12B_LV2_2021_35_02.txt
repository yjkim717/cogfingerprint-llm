## Chasing Ghosts: Why I Still Run Pre's 200s

It’s November 2021, and the days are definitely getting shorter. The crisp air bites a little more, and the temptation to curl up with a blanket and a good book is *strong*. But something keeps pulling me back to the track. Something… historical.

I’ve been doing Pre's 200s for a few years now, and it’s become a strange ritual. For those unfamiliar, it’s a workout designed by Bill Bowerman, the legendary coach of Steve Prefontaine – “Pre” – a name that still evokes a kind of romantic intensity in the running world. It’s brutal: 200-meter repeats at near-sprint speed, with short recovery jogs in between. The prescribed number varies depending on your level, but even the "beginner" version leaves you gasping.

Honestly, I don’t *need* to do them. My current training plan has plenty of speed work. But there's something about the legacy, the sheer grit of it all, that compels me. I find myself thinking about Pre, about his incredible talent and his tragic, early death. He was a force of nature, a runner who embodied passion and unwavering dedication.

It’s a bit silly, I know. Running 200s isn’t going to magically imbue me with Pre’s abilities. But when I'm pushing through that final, shaky repeat, lungs burning, legs screaming, I feel connected to something bigger than myself. I think about Bowerman’s relentless pursuit of innovation, about Pre’s unwavering belief in his own potential.

This year, more than ever, that connection feels important. 2021 has been… a lot. We’ve all faced challenges, uncertainties, and moments where pushing forward felt impossible. And that’s when I remember Pre. He didn't shy away from the pain. He embraced it, channeled it, and used it to fuel his performance.

So, I’ll keep chasing those ghosts on the track. I’ll keep doing Pre's 200s. Not to become Pre, but to remember the power of perseverance, and to find a little bit of that legendary spirit within myself. And maybe, just maybe, to feel a little stronger when I need it most.

**Notes & Potential Expansions:**

*   **Specificity:** I could add more detail about the specific workout (e.g., the recovery times, a sample workout for different levels). However, I intentionally kept it a bit general to maintain the reflective focus.
*   **Personal Anecdote:** I could weave in a more specific personal story about a time when the workout helped me overcome a challenge.
*   **Bowerman's Innovations:** Expanding on Bowerman's influence on running shoe technology (Nike) could add another layer of interest.
