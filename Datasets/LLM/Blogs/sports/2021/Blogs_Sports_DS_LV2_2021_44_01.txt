That first post-game ache used to mean a long, stiff recovery. But in 2021, my routine changed. After a tough match, Iâ€™d just add a dropper of a water-soluble THC enhancer to my water bottle. No more chalky shakes or waiting. It was a subtle wave of calm that eased the soreness without fogging my focus, letting me actually enjoy the post-game high-fives. Sometimes, the best play happens off the field.
