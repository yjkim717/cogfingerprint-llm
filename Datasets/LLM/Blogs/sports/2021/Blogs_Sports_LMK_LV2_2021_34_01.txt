    blog_post = f"""The 2021 college football season was a thrilling ride, and one of the most exciting stats to track was yards per attempt among quarterbacks. As I looked through the NCAA stats, I was impressed by the top performers. Topping the list was {name}, who averaged an impressive {yards_per_attempt} yards per attempt. What struck me was how these elite QBs were able to make plays that others couldn't, consistently pushing their teams forward. It's a testament to their skill, strategy, and hard work. As we look back on the season, it's clear that these quarterbacks were the ones to watch. Their ability to make big plays was a key factor in their teams' success."""
