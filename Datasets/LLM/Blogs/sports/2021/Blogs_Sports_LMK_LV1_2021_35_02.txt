**A Run Through History: Revisiting Pre's 200s in 2021**

As I laced up my running shoes and hit the pavement this week, I couldn't help but think of the legendary Steve Prefontaine and the iconic workout that bears his name - Pre's 200s. This interval training routine, developed by the innovative coach Bill Bowerman back in the 1970s, has been a staple in many a runner's training regimen for decades.

For those unfamiliar, Pre's 200s involve running 10 x 200 meters at a fast pace, with a 200-meter jog in between each repetition. Simple in theory, but deceptively challenging in practice. The workout is a true test of endurance, speed, and mental toughness. As I began my own session, I felt a mix of excitement and trepidation - how would I fare against the likes of Pre, who was known for his fearless and aggressive racing style?

As I ran through the intervals, I couldn't help but think about the context in which this workout was born. Bowerman, the University of Oregon coach and Nike co-founder, was known for his innovative approach to training. He pushed his athletes to their limits, often using unorthodox methods to build their strength and resilience. Pre, one of his most talented protégés, was the embodiment of this philosophy - a fierce competitor who consistently pushed himself to new heights.

Fast-forward to 2021, and Pre's 200s remain a revered workout among runners. It's a testament to the enduring legacy of Bowerman and Pre, who continue to inspire new generations of athletes. As I finished my final interval and slowed to a jog, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment. The workout may be tough, but it's a reminder that, with the right mindset and training, we're capable of achieving great things.

As I walked back to my starting point, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the history and heritage that Pre's 200s represent. It's more than just a workout - it's a connection to the pioneers of our sport, and a reminder of the power of hard work and dedication. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, Pre's 200s are definitely worth a try - and who knows, you might just discover a newfound appreciation for the sport, and the legends who have shaped it.
