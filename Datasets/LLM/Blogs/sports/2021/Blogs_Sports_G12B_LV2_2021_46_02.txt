**The Unwritten Rule of Overtime: Even Legends Can't Crack It**

Isn’t it wild how sports can throw you curveballs? I stumbled across a statistic recently that just blew my mind, and I had to share. Apparently, Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, and Tom Brady – *the* quarterbacks of our generation – never, not once, threw a touchdown pass in an NFL playoff overtime. 

Think about that for a second. These guys, masters of the gridiron, faced that sudden-death pressure countless times, and the endzone remained untouched by their overtime passes. It's a humbling reminder that even the greats aren’t immune to the unpredictable nature of the game. 

It makes you wonder about the pressure, the strategy, the sheer luck involved. As we watch the current playoff battles unfold in 2021, it's a fascinating bit of history to keep in mind - a quirky, unwritten rule that even legends can’t break.
