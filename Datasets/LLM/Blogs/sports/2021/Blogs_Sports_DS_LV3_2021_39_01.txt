The whistle blew, and my heart sank. Another season-ending loss for our high school basketball team in 2021. We had the talent, the plays, the drive—but something was off. Our foundation felt shaky, like we were building on sand instead of solid ground.

It hit me during those quiet post-game bus rides: we were like a garden with poor soil. All the fancy drills (our compost) and passionate coaching (our watering) couldn’t compensate for a weak base. We lacked trust—the essential soil that lets roots dig deep and teams thrive under pressure.

That offseason, we shifted focus. Less scrimmaging, more team dinners. Fewer lectures, more listening. We tended to our collective soil, nurturing respect and communication. Slowly, the drainage improved. The heaviness lifted. We weren’t just planting plays; we were growing together. And when next season tipped off, you could feel the difference—strong roots make resilient teams.
