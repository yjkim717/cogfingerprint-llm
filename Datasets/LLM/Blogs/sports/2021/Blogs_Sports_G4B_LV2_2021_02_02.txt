**The Season That Felt Like a Seedling**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How sometimes a season just *feels* small. Like my high school soccer team in 2021. We were… okay. Not terrible, definitely not amazing. We had flashes of brilliance, moments of real potential, but a lot of times it felt like we were just treading water, battling limited sunlight – you know, the same way my carrots are struggling in this raised bed. 

There were days I questioned if we’d ever really grow, if we’d ever push past that middle-of-the-pack feeling. We weren't getting the full harvest of opportunities we deserved. 

Looking back, though, I realize that season wasn't about winning championships. It was about the grit, the little improvements, the sheer determination to keep pushing even when it felt like we weren’t getting enough. Just like those carrots need consistent sunlight, we needed consistent effort. And honestly? That’s a lesson I still carry with me.

Would you like me to tweak this in any way, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
