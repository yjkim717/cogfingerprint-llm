There I was in 2021, deep in the OSW Review back catalogue, reliving the Lex Express era like it was yesterday. As a wrestling podcast junkie, nothing beats their hilarious takes, but hitting the Summerslam '93 episode gave me pause.

It got me thinking: when do we push through the grind, and when do we pivot? In sports and life, passion can turn into obligation. That moment made me reflect on my own routines—sometimes stepping back isn’t quitting; it’s preserving what you love. Here’s to knowing when to change the channel and keep the joy alive.
