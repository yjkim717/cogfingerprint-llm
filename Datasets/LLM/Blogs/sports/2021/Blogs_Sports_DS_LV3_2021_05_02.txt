### The Unbeatable Play: What a Video Game Taught Me About My Own Game

It was the winter of 2021, and like much of the world, I was finding my escapes in screens. My sport, competitive swimming, was on indefinite hold. The pool was a memory, the smell of chlorine replaced by the scent of my own apartment. The relentless, structured routine of laps and drills had vanished, leaving a void that I tried to fill with, of all things, *Age of Empires II*.

I’d never been much of a gamer, but I stumbled into a online community obsessed with ELO ratings and perfect "build orders"—the precise sequence of actions in the early minutes that sets the stage for victory or defeat. And that’s where I met the Byzantines.

A player, someone I only knew by a gamertag, shared their undefeated Byzantine build order. It wasn’t flashy. It was methodical. It started with early, relentless pressure—a few infantry and archers harassing the enemy economy before they could even get settled. It wasn’t about a knockout blow; it was about forcing a mistake, making them flinch. Then, as the game progressed, it transitioned seamlessly into a powerful late-game army of crossbows and the heavily armored Cataphracts.

As I practiced this build, something clicked in a way that went far beyond the game. I was in my living room, but my mind was back on the starting block.

The "early aggression" was my first 50 meters. In swimming, you don’t win a 200m race in the final lap; you win it in the first. A explosive, controlled start puts immediate pressure on your competitors. It forces them to swim your race, to question their own pace. That initial push, just like those early Byzantine archers, was about establishing dominance, not with wild abandon, but with precise, practiced intent.

The "transition" was the middle of the race, the grueling 100 meters where technique and composure are everything. This is where you counter their adjustments, where you hold your form while they begin to tire from your initial push. You’re building your resources, staying efficient, waiting for the moment to strike.

And the "Cataphracts"? That was my final kick. The unstoppable, powerful surge in the last 25 meters, fueled by the work I’d done earlier. It was the move I’d practiced a thousand times, now deployed with overwhelming force because my opponent was already on the back foot.

This Byzantine strategy, this perfect "build order," was just a digital version of a race plan. It was about phases, about patience, and about understanding that every action in the present is an investment in a future moment of strength.

When I finally got back to the pool in the spring, my coach noticed a difference. My starts were more aggressive, my middle laps more composed, my finish more devastating. I didn’t tell him about the Byzantines. Some wisdom you just have to find for yourself, sometimes in the most unexpected arenas. It turned out the path to breaking my personal best wasn't in a new training drill, but in a 20-year-old game, teaching me to master the order of my own build.
