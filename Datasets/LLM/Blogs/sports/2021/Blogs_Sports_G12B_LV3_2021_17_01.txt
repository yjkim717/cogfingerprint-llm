## The Unexpected Grace of Watching My Kid Play Soccer (and Why I'm Suddenly a Fan)

Okay, full disclosure: I *never* understood the appeal of soccer. Twenty-one years on this planet, and I’d happily flip channels during any match. Then my daughter turned five and decided she wanted to play. Suddenly, I was standing on the sidelines every Saturday morning in 2021, bundled in a slightly-too-small jacket, watching a swarm of tiny humans chase a ball.

And you know what? It's… wonderful. Not because of the strategy (still lost on me!), but because of the sheer joy on her face. The teamwork, the little moments of encouragement, the inevitable stumbles. It’s taught me more about perseverance and celebrating small victories than any motivational speech ever could. I’m officially a convert. Go, Mighty Mustangs!
