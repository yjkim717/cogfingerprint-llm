>Okay, here's a blog post inspired by the SLS/Starship/Artemis summary, but re-imagined within the context of sports, specifically focusing on a struggling basketball team and drawing parallels to the NASA discussion. I've aimed for a conversational, reflective tone and a storytelling approach, keeping the 2021 timeframe in mind.

## The Weight of History, and the Promise of Something New

It’s been a rough season for the Sacramento Kings. Let's be honest, "rough" is putting it mildly. We’re deep into 2021, and watching them play sometimes feels like watching a slow-motion replay of past disappointments. Years of drafting busts, questionable coaching decisions, and a general air of… well, *lack* of competitiveness have built up a wall of frustration amongst the fans.

And I find myself thinking, a lot, about legacy. About how much weight history puts on a team. The Kings have a rich, albeit painful, history. Peja Stojaković, Chris Webber, Mike Bibby… names that echo with a bittersweet nostalgia. But those glory days feel distant, almost mythical, compared to the reality we’re facing now.

There's this constant push to rebuild around the existing framework. A tweak here, a trade there, hoping to resurrect something from the ashes of what *was*. It feels… familiar. It feels like clinging to a strategy that just isn't working. And it made me think about NASA, specifically their Space Launch System (SLS) program. I know, I know, rockets and basketball – seemingly worlds apart. But bear with me.

I was reading about the SLS and how it's been years in the making, incredibly expensive, and always just *slightly* behind schedule. And the argument being made is, “We’ve invested so much already! We can’t just abandon it now! All that money, all that engineering… it would be a waste!”

But then you have Starship, SpaceX’s ambitious rocket. A completely different approach – more agile, potentially much cheaper, and aiming for truly game-changing capabilities. And it's built on a foundation of rapid iteration and commercial innovation.

The parallel hit me hard. Are we, as Kings fans, falling into the same trap? Are we so invested in this “SLS” of a team – this established, expensive, and ultimately underwhelming system – that we're blind to the potential of a "Starship" approach?

What if, instead of constantly patching up the old, we embraced a bolder strategy? What if we completely overhauled the front office, brought in a visionary coach, and focused on developing young talent through a different philosophy – one that prioritized adaptability and innovation?

It’s a risky proposition, of course. There's no guarantee a "Starship" approach will work. But continuing down the current path feels like a guaranteed failure. It's the sunk cost fallacy playing out in real time, both in space exploration and in my living room on Tuesday nights watching the Kings play.

Maybe I'm being overly dramatic. Maybe the Kings just need a little more time. But I can't shake the feeling that true progress requires a willingness to disrupt, to challenge the status quo, and to bet on something new, even if it means leaving behind the weight of history
