**The Curious Case of the Pistons’ Strategy**

Okay, let's be honest, watching the NBA this season felt…weird. Specifically, the Detroit Pistons' approach. They were consistently resting star players, even when they were *relatively* healthy. And it got me thinking: why aren't they getting hammered like some other teams have?

I saw the headlines about the fines levied against Golden State and the Lakers for excessive resting. It seemed so clear-cut – exploiting the rules for an easier path to a higher draft pick. But Detroit? They’re seemingly doing it with a wink and a nod. 

Is it just a different strategy? Or are they operating under a different interpretation of the league’s policy? It feels like a grey area, and frankly, a little frustrating for fans who want to see competitive basketball.  What do you guys think? #NBA #Pistons #Tanking #LeaguePolicy
