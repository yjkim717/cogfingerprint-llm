**The Ghosts of Yards Per Attempt**

It’s weird how certain stats stick with you, right? As a huge college football fan in 2021, I was completely obsessed with tracking those yards per attempt numbers. Seriously, I spent way too many late nights poring over spreadsheets for guys like Spencer Rattler and Cade McNamara. 

But looking back, it wasn’t just about the numbers. It was about the *stories* behind them. That consistently low YPA for some quarterbacks felt like a warning sign – a signal that maybe, just maybe, they weren’t quite ready to lead a team. 

Watching those guys battle through injuries and adjust their games was fascinating. It reminded me that college football isn’t just about flashy plays; it’s about growth, resilience, and figuring out your role in the starting lineup. Those yards per attempt numbers? They were just one piece of the puzzle.
