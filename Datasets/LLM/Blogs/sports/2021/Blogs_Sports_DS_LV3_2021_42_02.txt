Looking back from 2021, it’s wild to think about Kenny "The Jet" Smith’s unique legacy. While Hakeem Olajuwon was the centerpiece of those Rockets championship teams, Kenny was the engine—the point guard who made it all flow. But what I find so relatable is his duality: competing in both the Slam Dunk *and* Three-Point Contests. It’s a reminder that we don’t have to fit into just one box. In 1991, he averaged 17 points and 7 assists—versatility at its finest. In today’s game, we celebrate players who defy labels, and Kenny was doing it decades ago. Sometimes, the most impactful journeys are the ones that can’t be easily categorized.
