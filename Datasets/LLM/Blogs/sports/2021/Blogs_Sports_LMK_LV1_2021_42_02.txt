"Flashback to the Gridiron and the Hardwood: Kenny Smith's Legacy. As I was rewatching some NBA All-Star Weekend highlights from over the years, I couldn't help but think of Kenny 'The Jet' Smith. A key player for the Houston Rockets back in the day, Smith's career was marked by clutch shooting and a knack for making big plays. Who can forget his impressive 3-point contest performances or his thunderous dunks in the slam dunk contest? As a two-time NBA champion and a member of the 1988 All-Star team, Smith left an indelible mark on the league. With a career average of 12.8 points and 4.9 assists per game, 'The Jet' was a fan favorite. As we look back on his achievements in 2021, it's clear that Kenny Smith's legacy continues to inspire a new generation of hoopsters. His on-court accomplishments have cemented his place as one of the all-time greats."
