## The Muddy Field and the Long Season

Remember that awful stretch of games in July 2021? Our local rec league softball team, the "Wildflowers," were really struggling. It wasn’t just the losing; it was *the field*. They’d had some landscaping done over the winter, supposedly to improve drainage, but it backfired spectacularly.

Every rain shower turned the infield into a swamp. Water pooled everywhere, making it impossible to field ground balls, let alone run the bases without sinking ankle-deep. It felt like trying to play in quicksand. You could see the frustration on everyone's faces – our pitcher couldn’t find her rhythm, the outfielders were slipping, and even the coach looked defeated.

It really made me think about how even the best intentions can have unintended consequences. Like that garden mix I ordered for my raised beds – supposed to be perfect, but ended up holding too much water.  Sometimes, you need the right *composition* to truly thrive, whether it’s a team, a garden, or a softball field. We eventually rallied, but that muddy patch is a reminder that success isn’t always a straight line.
