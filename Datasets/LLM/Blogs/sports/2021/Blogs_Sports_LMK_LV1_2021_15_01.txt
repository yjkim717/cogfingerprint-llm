As I watched the 2021 NFL draft, I couldn't help but think of the electrifying atmosphere - much like Chromatics' synth-heavy cover of Springsteen's 'I'm On Fire'. The energy in the room was palpable. Just as that song transforms a classic into something new, the draft brings fresh talent to the league, redefining teams and sparking hope. It was a thrilling spectacle, full of promise and possibility.
