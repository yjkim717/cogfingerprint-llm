"Stepping Up to the Plate: Lessons from a Frustrating Tennis Season"

As I reflect on my 2021 tennis season, I'm reminded of the time I spent waiting for my garden to yield a bountiful carrot harvest. Despite the lush green foliage, the carrots never quite reached the size I had hoped for. Similarly, my tennis game was stuck in a rut - my serves were strong, but my returns were weak. I found myself wondering whether to keep practicing or throw in the towel. Just as too much sunlight can sometimes hinder carrot growth, my intense focus on perfecting my technique was holding me back. It wasn't until I took a step back and reassessed my approach that I started to see improvement. Sometimes, it's not about working harder, but working smarter. By adjusting my strategy and being patient, I was able to turn my season around.
