**The Curious Case of the Polls – And Why I Still Root for the Underdogs**

Remember back in 2021 when everyone was glued to the AP Poll? It felt… intense. Seriously, the way opinions shifted week after week in college football was fascinating, and a little frustrating. You’d see these consistent voters, holding firm to their top teams, while others seemed to be reacting to every single upset. 

It got me thinking about voter consistency – how much does anyone *really* know? And how much does our own bias influence what we believe?  I’ll admit, I spent a good chunk of the season rooting for the teams nobody was talking about, partly because it felt good to go against the grain, and partly because, honestly, I felt like I was seeing a different trend altogether.  Maybe Jesse Newell was onto something!  Ultimately, it’s a reminder that sports, like life, are rarely predictable.
