## The Streaming Shuffle and Sunday Football

Okay, so picture this: it's a crisp October Sunday in 2021, I’m settled in for some football, ready to enjoy my ad-free CBS All Access subscription – the $9.99 plan, remember? Except… ads. Everywhere. Seriously! It's got me wondering, are we all paying more for less these days? Streaming feels like a constant shuffle, and I'm starting to miss the simplicity of just… watching the game. Anyone else experiencing this?
