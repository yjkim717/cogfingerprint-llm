## Letting Go & Looking Forward

It’s been a strange NBA offseason, hasn’t it? Seeing Russell Westbrook leave Oklahoma City still stings a little. So many memories tied to that Thunder team, that energy… But then George Hill landed with a contender. It's a genuinely lovely thing to witness a veteran find that championship opportunity. Sometimes, change is bittersweet. It's okay to feel the loss of a familiar era while simultaneously cheering for a new chapter, a new mentor guiding the next generation in OKC. It feels like a proper rebuild, honestly.
