It’s funny how a simple position change can feel like coming home. I remember watching Alejandro Villanueva in 2021, struggling on the right side, looking like a fish out of water. Then, back at his familiar left tackle spot, he was a fortress—shutting down the Chiefs with zero pressures. It’s a powerful reminder for all of us, in sports and life: sometimes, you don’t need to force a new path. You just need to find your right place, where your strengths can truly shine.
