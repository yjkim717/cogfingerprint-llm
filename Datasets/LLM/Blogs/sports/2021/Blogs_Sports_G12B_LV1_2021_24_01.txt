## The Lingering Shadow of a Season Past

It’s late October 2021, and the leaves are finally turning. But I’m still wrestling with something that feels a bit… stuck. Remember that crazy run the local high school soccer team had last spring? They were poised for states, a real Cinderella story. Then, the season ended abruptly, and Coach Miller left to take a college position.

Now, every time I see a soccer ball, or hear the whistle, I get this little pang. It’s not just missing the excitement; it's a feeling of unfinished business. Like a lingering program file you can’t quite uninstall. I tried to move on, find new games to follow, but that team's momentum felt tied to something that’s now gone – a shared identity, a specific moment in time. It's a strange feeling, this echo of a season past. Hopefully, I can fully move on and create new memories.
