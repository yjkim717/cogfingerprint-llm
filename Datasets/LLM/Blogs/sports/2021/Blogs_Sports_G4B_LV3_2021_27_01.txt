**A Shift in Strategy – And a Little Bit of Texas Tech Magic**

You know those moments in the sports world where you just feel a change coming? It’s not always about flashy signings, but about a quiet, strategic move. This week, I was reading about Kenny Perry joining Texas Tech as their offensive coordinator. Perry’s got a resume packed with wins – high school, college, everywhere – and that kind of experience always feels like a breath of fresh air. 

It reminded me of how much I appreciate coaches who aren't just about the X’s and O’s, but about building a genuine system.  Thinking about Texas Tech, Arlington Bowie, and even a little TCU rivalry, it’s exciting to see a coach like Perry bringing that dedication.  2021 felt like a year of rebuilding for many programs, and a smart hire like this could be exactly what they need to spark something special. What’s your favorite coaching move this season?
