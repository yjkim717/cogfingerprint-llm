**The Edge We Didn’t Know We Needed**

Remember 2021? The year everything felt… uncertain. Even for athletes. I was watching my brother, a college baseball player, struggling with fatigue, a real drag on his performance. He was chasing that extra edge, that little something to push him through those late-night practices. 

Then, I heard about this new stuff – Curaleaf’s ‘Select Squeeze,’ a THC beverage boosted with nanotechnology. It’s all about water-soluble molecules delivering THC more efficiently. It felt a bit strange, honestly, but the potential was intriguing. 

It wasn’t about getting high; it was about optimizing recovery and focus.  Maybe it’s a sign of the times – athletes exploring new ways to level up, even if it’s a conversation we’re still navigating.  What do you think about pushing the boundaries of performance?
