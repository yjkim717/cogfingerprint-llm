Of course, here is a reflective blog post about sports from 2021.

### The Year We Remembered Why We Play

It was the summer of 2021, and I found myself standing on a dusty little-league diamond, watching my nephew’s team celebrate a routine pop-fly out. The sheer, unbridled joy on their faces—it hit me right in the chest. After over a year of empty stadiums and canned crowd noise, this was the real thing.

I think back to watching the delayed Tokyo Olympics, seeing athletes embrace not just their victories, but the simple, profound privilege of competing. Simone Biles stepping back, prioritizing her mind over a medal, taught us more about strength than any gold ever could. It wasn't about the record books; it was about the human spirit.

That little baseball game was my Tokyo. It wasn't about ERAs or RBIs; it was about the dirt-stained uniforms, the parents cheering from fold-out chairs, and the pure, unscripted love of the game. 2021 was the year sports stopped being just a spectacle and became a conversation again. It reminded us that at its heart, sports isn't about the roar of a million fans, but the quiet, personal thrill of just being in the arena, together.
