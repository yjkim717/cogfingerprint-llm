**Title: The Algorithm and the Fan: My BasketballGM Obsession (and a Little Bit of a Revenue Problem)**

Okay, confession time. I’m *deep* into BasketballGM. Like, late-night-spreadsheet-deep. It’s been my pandemic escape, and 2021 has been a wild ride managing my virtual franchise. I love the challenge of scouting, drafting, and building a team, but lately, I've been wrestling with something surprisingly frustrating: ticket prices.

The game auto-adjusts them, which is usually smart, but sometimes… it just *misses* the mark. You know? We’re on a playoff run, the city's buzzing, and the arena should be *packed*, but the algorithm seems stubbornly stuck. I've been tinkering, trying to manually nudge things, hoping to squeeze out a little extra revenue. It feels oddly… real. Like I'm actually impacting the team's financial health. It’s a small thing, a digital detail, but it’s got me thinking about the relationship between a team, its fans, and the ever-present luxury tax. Anyone else feel the same pull in their virtual GM life?
