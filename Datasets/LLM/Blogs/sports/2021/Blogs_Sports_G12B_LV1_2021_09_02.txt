## The Edge of Persistence: Lessons from My Old Baseball Glove

It's late October 2021, and the leaves are finally turning. Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about my old baseball glove, the one I used throughout high school. It’s seen better days – cracked leather, faded laces, a few stubborn stains. But it’s still *there*.

I remember painstakingly conditioning it every season, using a leather treatment my dad swore by - a kind of homemade compound, really. It felt like a ritual, restoring the suppleness, keeping the leather from drying out and cracking.  It reminded me of something I read about knife sharpening systems – the importance of the right oil, the consistent strokes, maintaining that keen edge.

This year, watching the playoffs, I realized that glove, like a well-honed blade or a perfectly sharpened bat, represented persistence. It wasn't about instant perfection; it was about consistent care, accepting the wear and tear, and appreciating the slow, steady refinement.  Even after a rough season, a little attention can bring back that familiar feel, that satisfying grip.  It’s a good reminder for all of us, isn't it? To keep working, even when things get worn down.




Hope this fits the bill! Let me know if you'd like any adjustments.
