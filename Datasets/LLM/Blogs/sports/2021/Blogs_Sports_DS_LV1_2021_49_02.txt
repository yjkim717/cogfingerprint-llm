It’s 2021, and my sports channel just hit 42,000 subscribers—a milestone I once dreamed of. But lately, I’m second-guessing what makes a video “successful.” My deep-dive breakdowns on forgotten Olympic moments used to pull in solid views, but now? Engagement’s dipping. I can’t shake this feeling of content fatigue, both for me and my audience. Am I boxing myself into too narrow a niche, or is this just the natural ebb and flow of the creator journey? Maybe success isn’t just in the numbers, but in staying true to the stories I’m passionate about telling.
