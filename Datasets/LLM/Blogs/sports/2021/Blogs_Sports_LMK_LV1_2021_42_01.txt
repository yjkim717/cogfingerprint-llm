"As the 2020-21 NHL season wrapped up, I took a closer look at the Buffalo Sabres' performance against Atlantic Division foes. With a record of X-X-X, they earned Y points in the standings. Facing off against the likes of the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple Leafs, the Sabres showed flashes of brilliance. Though their Eastern Conference finish was disappointing, there were takeaways for the offseason, and fans remain hopeful for a brighter 2021-22 campaign."
