As I stepped onto the tennis court in the summer of 2021, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over me. It had been years since I'd picked up a racket, but the rhythmic thud of the ball against the strings felt like second nature. As I volleyed with my opponent, I realized that the lessons I'd learned on the court were translating to other areas of my life. The discipline, the focus, the ability to adapt to changing circumstances – it was all still there. Just like a well-designed home automation system, my game was all about control and precision. I was zoning in on my shots, anticipating my opponent's moves, and making adjustments on the fly. It was a feeling I'd been missing, and it was exhilarating. As I left the court that day, I knew I'd be back – and not just for the exercise.
