>## The Unexpected Joy of Watching My Dad Watch Baseball

This year, I've found myself unexpectedly captivated - not by the game itself, but by my dad's reaction to it. He's always been a fan, but seeing his quiet joy, the little fist pumps after a good play, the frustrated sighs... it's been a beautiful thing. Baseball, for him, is a connection to his own childhood, a comforting rhythm in a chaotic 2021. And watching him rediscover that? Thatâ€™s been the real win.
