## That Sunday Feeling...and a Missed Call

Remember those Sundays in 2021? The ones where you *knew* your team was going to pull it off? I sure do. I was convinced the Falcons would finally break through. Then, a dropped pass, a missed callâ€¦and that sinking feeling. It's a tough pill to swallow, but hey, that's sports, right? Just gotta dust yourself off and look forward to next week.
