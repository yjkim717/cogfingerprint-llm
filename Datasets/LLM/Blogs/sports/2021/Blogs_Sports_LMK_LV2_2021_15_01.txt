As I laced up my running shoes in the spring of 2021, I couldn't help but think of the parallels between music and marathon training. Just as I craved the soothing beats of Chromatics' 'I'm On Fire' cover to ease my runs, athletes often seek rhythm in their own pursuits. The repetitive pounding of feet on pavement can be meditative, much like the chill electro vibes that accompany me on long solo jogs, fueling my endurance and mental toughness.
