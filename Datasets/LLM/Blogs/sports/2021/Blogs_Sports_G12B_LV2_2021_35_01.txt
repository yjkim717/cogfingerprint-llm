>Okay, here's a blog post draft based on your prompt, aiming for a reflective, relatable tone and fitting the 2021 context. I've tried to weave in the Reddit theme subtly without making it the central focus.

**The Unexpected Beauty of the Grind**

Remember those early 2021 runs? The ones where the world felt… quieter? I do. I found myself noticing things I usually sped past – the way the light hit the trees, the determined faces of fellow runners, even the perfectly placed puddles reflecting the sky. 

It’s funny, isn't it? We chase personal bests, race times, and that elusive runner's high. But sometimes, the real reward is simply *being* out there. I stumbled across a cool Reddit thread the other day celebrating running photos, and it made me think about how much we capture – not just the finish line, but the journey itself. Those moments, gritty and imperfect, are the ones that stick with you. And that's a beautiful thing.
