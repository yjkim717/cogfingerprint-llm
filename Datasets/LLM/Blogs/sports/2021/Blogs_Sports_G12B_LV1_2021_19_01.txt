## The Weight of Expectation, the Joy of the Lift: My First Strongman Competition

**(Image: A slightly blurry photo of the author, looking determined but a bit overwhelmed, standing next to a massive atlas stone. The background is a bustling competition area.)**

Okay, so, here’s a thing. I did something completely out of character. Something that genuinely scared me. Something that involved a whole lot of grunting, chalk, and the distinct feeling that my internal organs were attempting a mass exodus. I entered a strongman competition.

Yep. Me. A 41-year-old guy who, until six months ago, considered a particularly heavy grocery bag a decent workout.

It all started, as many questionable life decisions do, with a casual conversation. I’d been hitting the gym pretty consistently since early 2021 – pandemic boredom, you know? Trying to counteract the existential dread with some iron. I was feeling… good. Stronger than I had in years. My buddy, Mark, who's been into powerlifting for ages, noticed. 

“You’ve got some power, man,” he said one day, after I'd managed a respectable deadlift. “Have you ever thought about strongman?”

I scoffed. “Strongman? You’re joking, right? I’d probably pull a muscle just *looking* at an atlas stone.”

He just grinned. “That’s the point. It’s a different challenge. It’s raw, it’s primal, and it's surprisingly fun.”

He started dropping little tidbits – videos of incredible feats of strength, stories of the community, the sheer variety of events.  The more he talked, the more a little seed of curiosity started to sprout. The idea of testing my strength in a completely different way, beyond the controlled environment of a gym, was… alluring.

I did my research. Strongman isn’t just about being big; it’s about technique, grit, and a surprising amount of athleticism. It's about finding leverage, using your body efficiently, and pushing past the point where your brain tells you to stop. The events vary, but common ones include atlas stone loading, farmer's walks, log presses, axle presses, truck pulls, and tire flips. Each one demands a unique skillset.

The competition I ended up choosing was a local one, "The Iron Grit Challenge," held in a muddy field just outside of town. It was a novice-level event, which felt… marginally less terrifying. I signed up, telling myself I’d just try my best, not worry about winning. Famous last words, right?

The weeks leading up to the competition were a whirlwind of training. Mark became
