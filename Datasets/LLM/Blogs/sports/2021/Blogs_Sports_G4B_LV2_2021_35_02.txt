**The Rhythm of the Oregon System – And Why It Still Matters**

Okay, let’s be honest, when I first heard about the “Oregon System,” it sounded like something straight out of a training manual.  You know, all technical and…well, a little intimidating. But this fall, diving into some old Bill Bowerman writings – specifically, a discussion of Pre’s 200s – really shifted something for me. 

I’ve been running consistently since 2019, mostly just trying to keep up with my friends and enjoy the outdoors. But this year, I felt this nagging sense that I wanted *more* from my training.  I stumbled across a blog post referencing Pre’s 200s, a workout developed by Bowerman and used at Oregon for decades. 

It's essentially a series of short, intense runs – think 200s, 400s, 600s – focused on building speed and lactate threshold.  The whole point, as Galen Rupp (a legend himself!) explains, isn't about going *fast* during those intervals, but about developing that engine, that ability to push through discomfort. 

What struck me wasn't just the workout itself, but the philosophy behind it. It’s about trusting the process, listening to your body, and really understanding *how* you’re running. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most effective training isn’t the flashiest, but the one that quietly builds resilience. 

I’m giving Pre’s 200s a try this week, and honestly, I’m curious to see how it feels.  Anyone else have experience with this system? Let's chat in the comments!
