"Leveling Up My AoE 2 Game: A Journey to Master the Metas"

As I reflect on my Age of Empires 2 journey in 2021, I realize I've plateaued at 800 ELO. To break through, I need to adapt to the ever-changing metas and improve my gameplay. My current focus is on mastering the feudal game, where a strong economy sets the tone for the rest of the match. I'm on the hunt for the perfect civ to learn the common strategies and tactics employed by top players. 

I've been experimenting with different civilizations, but I'm still unsure which ones will give me the edge I need. I'm looking for civs with robust eco systems that can transition smoothly into the feudal age. Any suggestions from fellow AoE 2 enthusiasts would be greatly appreciated! Let's work together to elevate our gameplay and climb the ranks.
