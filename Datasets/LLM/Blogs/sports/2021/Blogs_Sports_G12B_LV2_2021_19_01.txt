## The Chalk Dust and the Doubt: My First Strongman Competition

It's weird, isn't it? How something you *think* you know, something you’ve poured hours into, can still feel utterly alien when you’re standing on the precipice of it. For months, my world had revolved around chalk, steel, and the relentless pursuit of getting stronger. I’d embraced the world of strongman – the primal challenge, the raw power, the community. But nothing, *nothing* could have truly prepared me for the feeling of standing backstage at my first competition, the Northern Grit Strongman Competition in Sheffield, back in October 2021.

Let me rewind a bit. I’m 41. Not exactly the demographic you picture when you think “elite athlete.” I’m a software developer, a husband, a dad. My life is spreadsheets and school runs, not atlas stones and farmer’s walks. But about two years prior, I'd hit a wall with my regular gym routine. I felt…stuck. Like I was going through the motions. Then, a friend, a genuine strongman enthusiast, practically dragged me to a local strongman training session. 

And something clicked.

There's a visceral satisfaction to moving ridiculously heavy things. It’s not just about lifting; it’s about problem-solving, about grit, about pushing your body and mind to their absolute limit. It’s a different kind of strength than you build with reps in a controlled environment. It’s functional, brutal, and strangely…beautiful.

So, I started training.  I found a great gym with a supportive community, and a coach who somehow managed to simultaneously push me and prevent me from injuring myself spectacularly. My training was a whirlwind of loading, pressing, pulling, carrying – everything a novice strongman needs to know.  I focused on the fundamentals: deadlifts, squats, overhead press, farmer’s walks, log press, yoke walks.  The weights steadily crept up, the movements became smoother, and the aches and pains… well, they became a familiar part of the routine.

I told myself I wasn’t doing this to *win*. I wasn't aiming for podium finishes. My goal was simple: to compete. To test myself. To see how far I’d come. To experience the atmosphere, the camaraderie, the sheer madness of a strongman competition.

But as the competition date loomed closer, that simple goal started to feel…complicated. The doubt crept in, insidious and persistent. *Was I ready?* *Would I embarrass myself?* *What if I got injured?*  The social media feeds of seasoned competitors, showcasing their monstrous strength and effortless technique, didn’t exactly help quiet the inner critic. 

The day itself was a blur of adrenaline and nervous energy. The venue was buzzing – a cavernous warehouse filled with the
