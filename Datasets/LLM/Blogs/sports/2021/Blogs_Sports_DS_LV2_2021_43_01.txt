The year 2021, and the Tokyo Olympics felt different. Empty stands, a world still holding its breath. Yet, watching those athletes pour their souls onto the track, I realized something profound. It wasn't about the roar of a crowd, but the quiet, relentless fire within. A powerful reminder that our greatest strength is often forged in solitude, long before anyone is watching.
