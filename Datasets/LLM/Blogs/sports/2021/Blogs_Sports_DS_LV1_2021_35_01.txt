There’s something about a race photo that captures more than just sweat and effort—it’s a story. I remember one from a misty trail run back in 2021, when every runner was chasing normalcy after months of uncertainty. My legs burned, but my spirit soared. That photo, shared for our running group’s Photo Friday, showed me splashing through a muddy puddle, grinning like a kid. It wasn’t my fastest run, but it reminded me why I lace up: for the joy in the journey, not just the finish line. Those weekly snapshots connected us, turning solitary routes into a shared adventure. Running became our collective heartbeat.
