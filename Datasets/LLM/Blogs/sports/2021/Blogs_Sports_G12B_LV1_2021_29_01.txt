## The Pixel and the Pivot

Remember that feeling last spring watching the Masters? The greens practically leapt off the screen. I finally upgraded my TV – a 75-inch 4K with a 120Hz refresh rate – and wow, it made a difference. Seeing those subtle shifts in the golfer’s stance, the precision of each putt… it was incredible. It got me thinking about how technology enhances the experience, almost like a player pivoting to seize an opportunity. A good screen just pulls you right in.
