## My Phone, My Tennis Match, and a Seriously Creepy Ad

Okay, so this happened and I *need* to talk about it. I was chatting with my friend Sarah about the awful state of the clay courts at our local tennis club. Seriously, they were a disaster – huge cracks, uneven surface, the whole nine yards. We were brainstorming possible fixes, maybe suggesting a new top layer, when I absentmindedly mentioned needing a good court resurfacing company. 

Fast forward an hour, I'm scrolling through Instagram, and what pops up? An ad for a *local* company specializing in tennis court resurfacing. Like, the exact thing we were just discussing. Coincidence? Maybe. But it felt… unsettling. 

It got me thinking about privacy and how much our phones are listening. Is it just clever algorithms, or is it something more? Maybe I’m being paranoid, but in 2021, it’s hard *not* to wonder. Anyone else experienced anything similar?
