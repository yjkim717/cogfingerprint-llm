## The Numbers Don’t Lie (But They Don’t Tell the Whole Story)

Man, 2021 college football was *wild*. I spent way too much time diving into stats this year, and one thing that really stuck with me was looking at yards per attempt for the top QBs. Caleb Williams was clearly dominating, and Stetson Bennett’s redemption arc was incredible to see reflected in those numbers. Grayson McCall, too, was putting up some seriously impressive figures.

It’s easy to get caught up in the highlight reels – the crazy throws, the scrambling escapes. But digging into the yards per attempt really highlighted efficiency. You saw who was consistently moving the chains without relying solely on explosive plays. 

But here's the thing: stats only paint part of the picture. You can't account for pressure, the quality of the offensive line, or the play-calling. It’s a fascinating exercise, though, and it definitely made me appreciate the nuances of quarterback play even more. What stats did *you* find yourself obsessing over this season?



Hopefully, this captures the requested tone and style!
