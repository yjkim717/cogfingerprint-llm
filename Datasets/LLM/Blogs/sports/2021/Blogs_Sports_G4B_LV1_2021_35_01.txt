**Chasing Sunsets and Sharing Smiles: My 2021 Running Journey**

It feels like just yesterday I was nervously hitting the trails in 2021, trying to shake off the pandemic blues. I started with short, tentative runs, mostly just to get moving. Then, something clicked. I found myself completely lost in the rhythm of my feet hitting the dirt, the crisp air filling my lungs. 

I even joined a Reddit running community – a surprisingly supportive bunch! They have a weekly "Photo Friday" where everyone shares their running pics, and honestly, seeing those stunning trail shots, especially at sunset, really fueled my own motivation. 

There’s something incredibly satisfying about capturing those moments, those fleeting glimpses of beauty while pushing your limits. It’s not about speed or distance; it’s about the feeling, the connection to nature, and the joy of sharing that experience with others.  Anyone else feeling the running bug this year? Share your pics! #PhotoFriday #TrailRunning #RunningPhotos
