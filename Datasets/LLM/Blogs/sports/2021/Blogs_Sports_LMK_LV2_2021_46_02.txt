"As the 2021 NFL playoffs unfolded, I couldn't help but think about a peculiar stat: no quarterback with 300+ regular season touchdown passes has ever thrown a playoff overtime touchdown. It got me pondering the pressure of the postseason and how it can level the playing field. Even the greats have off days. It also made me appreciate the thrill of backyard football, where the stakes are low and the fun is high. The playoffs may be about winning, but sometimes it's about enjoying the game, just like we do in our own backyards."
