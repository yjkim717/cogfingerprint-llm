I still remember that crisp September evening in 2021, flipping to ESPN2 for Virginia vs BYU. The screen glowed with possibility—two programs hungry for a statement win. That’s the magic of college football: it’s not just about the final score, but the shared hope in every snap. Win or lose, those hours remind me why we love this game—the unity, the passion, the stories unfolding right before our eyes. Some nights just stick with you.
