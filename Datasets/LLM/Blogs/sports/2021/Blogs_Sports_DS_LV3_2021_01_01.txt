It’s 2021, and my son’s soccer season just ended. His team’s camaraderie reminds me of the digital worlds my kids build together in Minecraft—until one day, my daughter’s worlds won’t load. Her marketplace is locked, even though they share the same Xbox Live account. It’s like watching one kid run drills smoothly while the other can’t even find the field. As a parent, you learn that fairness isn’t just about rules; it’s about ensuring every player gets their moment in the game.
