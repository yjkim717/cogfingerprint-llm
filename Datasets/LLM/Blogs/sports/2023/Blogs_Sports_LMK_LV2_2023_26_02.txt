"My Marathon Morning Reflections"

As I stepped onto the dew-kissed pavement at 6 am, the crisp 2023 spring air invigorated me for the 42.2 km journey ahead. My first marathon. The pre-race jitters had given way to a calm focus. I thought back to the months of training, the early morning runs, and the sacrifices made. As I hit the 20 km mark, fatigue crept in. But with each step, memories of my why surfaced - the people who believed in me, the personal growth, and the lessons learned along the way. The miles flew by as I chatted with fellow runners, our conversations a welcome distraction from the burning muscles. Crossing the finish line was more than just a personal achievement; it was a testament to the power of perseverance. As I reflect on this journey, I'm reminded that the true victory lies not in the medal, but in the person I've become.
