The final buzzer of my high school basketball career echoed in 2023, a year defined by a different kind of loss. A persistent injury sidelined me, a technical problem my determination couldn't fix. Each game watched from the bench was a loading issue, my spirit stuck halfway between the player I was and the person I had to become. The memory warning was clear: my body needed rest. It was a tough season, but it taught me that sometimes, the most profound growth happens when the game is forced to stop.
