As I stepped onto the baseball field in 2023, the crack of the bat transported me back to carefree summer days. The thrill of competition still pulsed through my veins, but now I watched my kids take the field. Their laughter and shouts mingled with the scent of fresh-cut grass. In that moment, I realized that sports aren't just about winning â€“ they're about the memories we create, and the love we pass down to the next generation.
