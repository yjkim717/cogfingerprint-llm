**The Celtics’ New Look: More Than Just a Big Man**

Okay, let’s be honest, the biggest buzz around Boston this offseason wasn’t just Kristaps Porzingis. It’s been the *way* the Celtics are going to play, and frankly, it’s exciting. Last year felt…strained, right? Tatum and Brown were carrying the load, and while they’re phenomenal, relying solely on them is a recipe for collapse. 

This year feels different. Adding Porzingis isn’t just about getting a center; it’s about creating actual *space*. Suddenly, Tatum and Brown have room to operate, and the potential for them to truly shine is massive. But it’s not just the stars. I'm really curious to see how the role players step up – will guys like Derrick White and Romeo Langford become consistent, impactful contributors? 

It’s a shift in philosophy, and I think it could be the key to a deep playoff run. Let’s hope the Celtics build on this foundation and prove they’ve truly addressed their weaknesses. What do you think?
