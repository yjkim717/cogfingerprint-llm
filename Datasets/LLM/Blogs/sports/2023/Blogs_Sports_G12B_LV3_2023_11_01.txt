## The Transfer Window Blues (and a Wish for Football Manager!)

Okay, fellow football fanatics, let’s be honest. Transfer windows are exhilarating, right? But wading through multiple seasons in Football Manager, juggling potential future signings and sales… it gets *complicated*. I’m currently deep in an FM22 save, and trying to mentally calculate the net spend across the next five seasons is a headache! 

It struck me – wouldn't it be brilliant if the game had a "Future Transfer Commitment" overview, like the salary one? Seeing that projected financial impact would be incredibly useful. Maybe it’s a pipe dream, but a guy can wish, can't he?
