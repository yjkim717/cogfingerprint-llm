**Finding My Pace in a Digital Community**

It’s funny how the simplest things can pull you into unexpected connections. Lately, I’ve been spending a little time on Reddit’s running subreddit – specifically, their “Photo Friday” thread. It’s a fantastic space where runners from all over share their favorite running shots. 

Honestly, scrolling through those images – a misty mountain trail, a sun-drenched park, a tired but smiling face – it’s a beautiful reminder of why I love running. It’s not about speed or competition; it’s about the journey and the quiet moments. 

This year, more than ever, it feels good to be part of a digital community celebrating the shared love of movement.  It’s a little boost of motivation, and a visual reminder that I’m not alone in chasing that feeling of freedom on the road.
