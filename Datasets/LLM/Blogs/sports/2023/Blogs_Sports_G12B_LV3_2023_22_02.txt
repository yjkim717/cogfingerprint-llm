>## Beyond the Scoreboard: Seeing the Player

It's been a rough season for my local basketball team, the Ravens. Losses pile up, and frustration is high. But watching last night's game, I realized something beyond the final score mattered. I wasn’t focused on the points, but on how the veteran point guard, Liam, interacted with the younger players after a particularly tough turnover. 

He didn't yell or criticize. He knelt down, offered a few words of encouragement, and demonstrated a genuine desire to help them learn. It struck me – leadership isn't just about skill, it’s about empathy. It's about understanding the pressure, the doubts, and offering support. That, to me, is a victory worth celebrating, even when the scoreboard doesn't reflect it.
