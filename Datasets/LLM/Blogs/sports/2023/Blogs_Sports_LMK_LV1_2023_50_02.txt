"I'm still getting used to my new smartwatch from 2023, but I'm already feeling a bit let down. After six days of moderate use - tracking runs, receiving GPS directions, and streaming music - the battery life is struggling to last the day. I'm also using the always-on display (AOD) feature, which I thought would be a game-changer. I'm now rethinking my smartwatch habits to squeeze out a bit more life."
