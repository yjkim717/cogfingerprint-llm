>## That Gut-Wrenching Feeling: Missed Opportunities and the Long Game

Okay, so I’m still reeling a bit from the Raptors game last night. We were *this* close to a comeback, down by just three with under a minute left. The energy in the arena was electric, you could practically taste the hope. But then… a missed three, a questionable foul call, and suddenly, it was over. 

It’s that feeling, you know? That gut-wrenching disappointment when you see a chance slip away. It's not just basketball, either. It’s life, isn’t it? We all have those moments where we feel like victory was within reach, only to have it snatched away. 

But here's the thing I’m reminding myself: these games, these seasons, they’re a marathon, not a sprint. One missed opportunity doesn't define a team, and one setback doesn't define progress. Gotta dust ourselves off, learn from it, and keep pushing forward. That’s the only way to truly win in the long run.
