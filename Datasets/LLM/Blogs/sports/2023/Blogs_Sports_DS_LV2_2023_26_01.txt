You ever make a trade in fantasy sports and immediately second-guess it? That’s how I feel watching the Thunder’s latest move. Swapping multiple assets for Denver’s protected future first-rounder feels like a gamble. Are we overthinking it, banking on a pick that might not even convey? It’s a familiar tension—between patience and the hunger for a star. Sometimes the biggest plays are the ones you don’t make. Time will tell if this patience pays off.
