As I sip my coffee here in Denver, listening to distant thunder roll in, I can’t help but reflect on the recent trade. Giving up multiple future picks for a single protected first-rounder in 2029 feels like a gamble. It’s 2023, and with a promising talent still on the board at pick 37, I wonder if we’re overpaying for a distant dream. Sometimes, the best moves are the ones we don’t make, trusting the process right in front of us.
