**The Ghosts of Lag Shots**

There’s something deeply frustrating about a golf shot that just… won’t cooperate. I’ve spent a ridiculous amount of time this summer wrestling with my lag shots – those delicate, controlled rolls that dictate the distance on the green. It’s been a frustrating process, mostly because I’ve been stubbornly trying to teach myself. 

I’ve been recording my swings in slow-motion, obsessing over compression and trying to feel the right weight shift. It’s a lonely business, self-teaching, filled with a lot of “trial and error” – and a fair amount of wild, unpredictable results.  Honestly, it feels like I’m chasing ghosts, trying to capture a feeling I can’t quite grasp. 

I’ve realized that maybe the answer isn't in dissecting every movement, but in simply *feeling* the rhythm.  I’m starting to realize that golf, like so many things, is less about perfect technique and more about patience and accepting that some shots will always be… well, ghosts.  Any tips from fellow golfers out there battling the lag?
