As I stepped onto the court in 2023, I realized that improving my game wasn't just about practice, but also about preparation - much like insulating your attic. Just as DIY spray foam insulation can be a cost-effective way to upgrade your home, fine-tuning my equipment and training regimen was my own DIY project. With every tweak, I felt a boost in performance, much like a well-insulated attic keeps your home cozy. It was a game-changer, and I was determined to take my skills to the next level.
