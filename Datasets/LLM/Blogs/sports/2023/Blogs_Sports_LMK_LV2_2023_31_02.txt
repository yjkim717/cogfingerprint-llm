"My Marathon Mishap: A Lesson in Resilience"

I'll never forget the 2023 London Marathon. Weeks of training, and I was ready. But, on the big day, disaster struck – a nasty fall around mile 10 left me shaken. As I stood up, brushing myself off, I thought of giving up. But something clicked. I remembered why I started training in the first place: my love for running.

I finished the marathon, albeit not with the time I had hoped for. Yet, crossing that finish line was one of my proudest moments. It wasn't just about the achievement; it was about bouncing back from adversity. As I looked around at fellow runners, I realized we're all in this together – pushing through struggles, both on and off the track. That day taught me that resilience is just as important as training. Now, I carry this lesson with me, both in running and in life.
