As I scrolled through Twitter in 2023, I noticed something heartwarming - Iowa State softball and WVU baseball fans rallying behind each other. It's sweet to see fans from different sports and schools unite, driven by a shared understanding that their favorite sport isn't offered at the other university. Mutual support at its finest!
