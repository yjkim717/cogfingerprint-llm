Looking back at 2023, I can’t help but think of the sports moments that truly defined the year. There were the electrifying highs—like the underdog team’s Cinderella run that had us all cheering—and the crushing lows, like that championship collapse we still replay in our minds. It’s funny; I wish I’d presented my best-of list in a bold, celebratory font, and the worst moments in something stark and dramatic. It would have perfectly mirrored the emotional whiplash we all felt as fans, riding that rollercoaster together.
