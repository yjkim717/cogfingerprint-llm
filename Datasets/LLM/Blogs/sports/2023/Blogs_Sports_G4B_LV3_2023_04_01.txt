It’s funny how quickly a voice fades from the sports conversation, isn’t it? I was just scrolling through The Ringer, and it struck me how much we’ve missed Jacoby Brissett’s analysis.  Remember Bill Simmons's breathless excitement about him?  Now, it’s just ESPN silence.  I’m genuinely curious where he’s landed.  Maybe he’s enjoying a well-deserved break, or perhaps he’s plotting his next move.  Part of me hopes he’s found a new platform, like The Ringer, bringing that insightful perspective we all loved.
