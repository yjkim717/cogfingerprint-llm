>## The Curious Case of the AP Poll and My Own Inconsistent Allegiances

Okay, confession time. I’ve been obsessively checking the AP Poll every week this college basketball season (2023-24). It’s a guilty pleasure, I know. But there’s something strangely compelling about seeing the national conversation coalesce around a ranking of teams. 

Recently, I stumbled upon an interesting piece analyzing the *consistency* of AP Poll voters. Seriously! Apparently, some voters stick to their guns, while others… well, let’s just say they’re all over the place. It got me thinking about my own viewing habits and how quickly my team allegiances can shift. 

I remember a few weeks back, I was fully on the USC bandwagon. They looked unstoppable! Then a couple of losses, and suddenly they were plummeting. Did they *really* change that much? Or was it just a rough patch? I started questioning my own snap judgments, mirroring what I imagine some AP Poll voters are experiencing.

The article also highlighted some individual voters who were consistently outliers – people sticking to their guns even when everyone else was jumping ship. One name popped out: Dylan Sinn. Apparently, he’s a real independent thinker in the polling world. I admire that!

It’s a good reminder that even in the seemingly objective world of sports rankings, there's a lot of subjective opinion at play. And maybe, just maybe, I need to take a breath before declaring a team’s season over after a single loss – just like those AP Poll voters! It’s all part of the fun, right?
