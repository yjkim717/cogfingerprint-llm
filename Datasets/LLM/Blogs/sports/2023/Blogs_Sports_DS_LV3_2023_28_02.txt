There I was, hunched over my laptop at 2 AM, surrounded by stacks of sports cards from my childhood collection. The 2023 market was booming, and I’d finally decided to list my prized multi-variation cards on eBay. I carefully sorted them—rookie parallels, refractors, you name it—and crafted what I thought was the perfect listing.

But then came the dreaded condition field. It just wouldn’t let me select anything, even though eBay insisted it was required. My cursor hovered uselessly over the dropdown, mocking my efforts. I sighed, remembering simpler times when trading cards meant haggling on the playground, not wrestling with digital forms.

It’s funny how something as small as a technical glitch can make you nostalgic for the tactile joy of flipping through a binder, feeling each card’s texture and debating its condition with friends. In that moment, I wasn’t just a seller—I was a collector again, reminded that the heart of this hobby isn’t in flawless listings, but in the stories each card holds.
