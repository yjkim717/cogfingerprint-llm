**Lost in the Option: Remembering a Different Kind of Football**

Okay, so I was digging through some old college football highlights the other day, and it completely blew my mind how different things were back in the early 70s. Specifically, I was watching clips of the 1973 Oklahoma vs. Texas game, and it hit me – they were *obsessed* with the Wishbone and Option offense. 

Seriously, it was a running, running, running world. You’d get a handoff, and the next thing you knew, a blur of jerseys would be scrambling for yards. It’s so stark compared to today’s game, where passing yards are practically a requirement.  

I realized then how much we’ve shifted. Those teams weren’t worried about racking up 400 passing yards; they were focused on grinding out tough yards on the ground. It makes you appreciate the evolution of the game, and maybe even miss the simplicity and physicality of a bygone era.  Anyone else ever feel like we’ve lost a little something in the pursuit of more passing? #CollegeFootball #History #OptionOffense
