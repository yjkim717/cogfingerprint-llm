 Here's a blog post inspired by the summary, aiming for a conversational and reflective tone:

## Are You Leaving Gains on the Table? (Seriously.)

Okay, let's be honest with ourselves. How many times have you finished a set of squats feeling… fine? Not completely crushed, not gasping for air, just… fine? Lately, I've been wrestling with this myself. A new meta-analysis just dropped, and the findings are a bit humbling: a *lot* of us, even seasoned lifters, are playing it safe, using weights around 53% of our 1RM. 

That means we're leaving a ton of reps in reserve. It’s comfortable, sure, but is it *optimal* for muscle growth and strength? Maybe it's time to push a little harder, challenge ourselves more, and really attack those sets. Food for thought, right?
