**The Unexpected Layers of a Tough Game**

You know those games where you *feel* like you gave it everything? Last fall, my son’s high school football team faced a brutal stretch run. They were losing, morale was low, and the coaches were pushing hard. I started thinking about it like layers – like insulation, actually. 

We needed to add extra layers of support, not just physical, but mental and strategic. It wasn’t about a single, dramatic play, but consistently building those small improvements, reinforcing the basics. Like choosing the right spray foam for an attic – you need a solid core. 

It reminded me that success, whether on a field or in life, isn't always about raw power. Sometimes, it’s about carefully layering the right approach, building resilience, and finding that perfect R-value for the challenge ahead.
