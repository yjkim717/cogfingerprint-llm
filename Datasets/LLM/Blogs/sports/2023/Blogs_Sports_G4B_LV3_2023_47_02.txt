**The Wall in the Paint**

There’s a feeling, right? That sickening moment when a smaller defender just *owns* you in the post. They’re angling, forcing you into a corner, and suddenly, you’re not playing basketball – you’re just reacting. I’ve been battling this a lot lately in rec league, and honestly, it’s been a huge mental hurdle. 

It’s not just about skill, though. It’s about frustration boiling over, about feeling like you’re losing control. I realized I was letting those defensive pressures dictate my whole game.  I needed to work on my post defense, sure, but more importantly, I needed to build some mental toughness.  

Learning to be more assertive – to trust my reads, to fight for space – has been a slow process. It’s about recognizing the feeling of that wall going up and actively pushing back.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the biggest battle is the one within yourself.
