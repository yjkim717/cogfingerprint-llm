It’s 2023, and watching Joel Embiid evolve has been something special. With James Harden out, the narrative was that Philly’s offense might stall. Instead, Embiid is dishing out 7 assists a night with hardly any turnovers. It feels like watching a star unlock a new level right before our eyes—more creator, less pure finisher. It’s a powerful reminder that sometimes, growth happens when the usual safety net is gone. What a time to be a fan.
