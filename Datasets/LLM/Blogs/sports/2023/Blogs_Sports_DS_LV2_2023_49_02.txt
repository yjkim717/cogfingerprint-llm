There’s something special about revisiting wrestling’s Ruthless Aggression era—it feels like opening a time capsule of pure, unapologetic attitude. I was just a kid back then, but The Rock’s Hollywood heel run in 2002-03? That left a mark.

Watching him swagger into arenas in $500 shirts, mocking fans with that smug grin, it was electric. You loved to hate him, but you couldn’t look away. Now, in 2023, I find myself diving into old clips and fan retrospectives, like those brilliant OSW Review deep dives, and it hits different. It’s not just nostalgia; it’s a reminder of how sports and storytelling collide to create moments that stick with you for life.

That era wasn’t just about body slams—it was character, conflict, and charisma turned up to eleven. And honestly? We could use a little of that magic today.
