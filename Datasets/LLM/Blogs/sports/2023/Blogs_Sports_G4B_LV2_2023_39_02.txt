**The Drive & the Brew**

This summer, I found myself craving a change of pace – and a good beer. My wife and I plotted a Redwoods road trip, fueled by a desire to escape the city. Naturally, the question arose: where could we find a Rainier? It’s a little nostalgic, you know? Reminds me of college weekends. 

Turns out, Eureka’s got a surprisingly good beer scene. Tracking down that Rainier felt like a small victory, a little connection to the past as we explored those towering trees. It’s funny how a simple beer can tie into a bigger adventure.
