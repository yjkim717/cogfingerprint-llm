There’s something electric about the final minutes of a close game—the kind where every pass, every shot, feels like it could tilt the whole season. I remember watching the 2023 NBA playoffs, seeing teams claw back from what seemed like certain defeat. It got me thinking about resilience, not just in basketball, but in life.

In Marvel Snap, I love playing destroy decks—watching cards like Knull grow stronger from the chaos. But sometimes, I wish we had a way to bring them back, like Hela or Ghost Rider do in discard strategies. It’s like that clutch player who, just when you think they’re out, makes an epic comeback. That’s the beauty of sports and games: they teach us that even when things fall apart, there’s always a chance to rebuild, to rise again, stronger than before.
