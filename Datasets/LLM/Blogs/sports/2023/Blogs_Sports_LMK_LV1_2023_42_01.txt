The gridiron has changed dramatically since the 1970s. Take the 1973 Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns, for instance. Those teams were behemoths on the ground, churning out yardage with their wishbone and option offenses, while largely abandoning the air. Fast forward to 2023, and it's a different story altogether. Today's Sooners and Longhorns are just as comfortable slinging it downfield as they are pounding it out on the ground. The stats tell the tale: in 1973, passing yards were a mere afterthought, while rushing yards were the name of the game. Now, both teams are putting up impressive numbers through the air and on the ground. It's a testament to the evolution of college football, and a reminder that the game is always adapting. As a fan, it's exciting to see how these changes have shaped the sport we love.
