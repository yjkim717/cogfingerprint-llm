As I stepped off the Alaska Airlines flight that was supposed to land at 8pm but didn't touch down till 11pm due to a 3-hour taxiing delay, I couldn't help but think of the Seattle Seahawks' nail-biting comeback last season. The frustration was palpable, and it only intensified when I waited an eternity at the baggage claim for my luggage, only to have it not show up. But, just like the Seahawks' resilience, Alaska Airlines' customer service turned my night around. They listened to my plight and offered a $300 credit code as a goodwill gesture. It was a pleasant surprise, and I left the airport feeling like I'd just witnessed a Hail Mary. It reminded me that even in the midst of chaos, a little kindness can be a game-changer. And, who knows, maybe I'll be back on an Alaska Airlines flight to watch the Seahawks take on their next opponents soon.
