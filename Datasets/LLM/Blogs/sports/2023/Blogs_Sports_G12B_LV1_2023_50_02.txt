>## Six Games In, Still Searching for That Spark

Okay, so I’m six games deep into following the Raptors this season, and I'm feeling…underwhelmed. I went in with real high hopes, imagining a playoff push, fueled by all the off-season hype. But honestly? It’s been a grind. We've got flashes of brilliance, sure – a steal here, a clutch three there – but the consistency just isn't there yet. Maybe it’s early, maybe my expectations were too high, but right now, I’m just hoping we can find that winning formula soon.
