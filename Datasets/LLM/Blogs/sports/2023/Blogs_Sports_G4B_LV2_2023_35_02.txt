**Chasing Light on a Winter Run**

It’s funny how a simple weekly tradition can feel so… grounding. This year, 2023, I’ve been really trying to carve out a little space for myself, and that’s exactly what the “Photo Friday” subreddit has done for me. I stumbled across it while searching for inspiration for my own winter running – and let me tell you, those dark, gray days can get a little tough. 

The subreddit is all about sharing running photos, and it’s honestly become a little lifeline. Seeing the grit and determination in people’s shots, the beautiful, sometimes brutal, landscapes they’re tackling… it’s a real reminder that I’m not alone in pushing my limits. 

Recently, I saw some incredible submissions – a stunning shot of a runner silhouetted against a snowy mountain, another of a muddy trail, and a hilarious one of a dog mid-sprint! It’s a fantastic community, with clear rules about submissions and a real sense of encouragement. 

It’s more than just pretty pictures; it’s proof that even on the coldest, darkest runs, there’s beauty to be found, and a whole community cheering you on.
