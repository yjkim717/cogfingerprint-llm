## The Long Game & a Little Bit of Grit

This year, watching my local baseball team has felt… different. Not in a bad way, necessarily, but it's reminded me a lot of a project I'm tackling – building a pizza oven in the backyard. Sounds random, I know! But hear me out.

Just like preparing the foundation for that oven required a lot of soil remediation (turns out, clay isn’t ideal!), this season has been about building a solid base. Early losses, adjustments to the lineup… it wasn't pretty. There were moments I wanted to throw my hands up, just like I almost did when I realized I needed *more* fire brick. 

But seeing the team persevere, adapting their strategy, and slowly but surely finding their rhythm - it’s been inspiring. It’s a reminder that even the most ambitious goals, whether it’s a perfectly charred pizza or a playoff run, require patience, a little grit, and a willingness to adjust your approach along the way. Almost there now, both with the oven and hoping for a late-season surge!



Hope this fits what you were looking for!
