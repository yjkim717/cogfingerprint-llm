"Flipping the Script on NBA History. Let's rewind and replay the NBA Finals with a twist. What if Kyrie Irving was healthy for the entire 2016 Finals? Would the Cavs have still overcome a 3-1 deficit? Or, what if Chris Paul stayed healthy in 2015? Would the Clippers have finally broken through? It's fun to speculate how past championships might have turned out if key players were healthy or injured differently. As we watch today's teams battle it out, it's clear that a 'healthy team' is often the key to success."
