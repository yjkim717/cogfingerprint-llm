>## The Unexpected Grace of a Comeback (and a Little Bit of Resilience)

Okay, so I’m not usually one to wax poetic about sports, but this weekend’s game… wow. I’m still buzzing from it. You all know I’m a die-hard Mariners fan – I’ve endured some *serious* lean years. So, watching them claw their way back against the Yankees on Sunday felt…different. It wasn't just a win; it was a testament to grit.

For the first few innings, I was practically hiding behind my hands. The Yankees were dominating, the energy in the stadium felt flat, and I was bracing for another heartbreak. But then something shifted. Our pitchers tightened up, the bats started connecting, and suddenly, the whole place erupted. 

It reminded me a little of life, honestly. Sometimes you’re facing a seemingly insurmountable challenge – a frustrating travel day (anyone else dealing with airport chaos these days? Seriously!), or a project at work that feels doomed. You feel that wave of discouragement. But then, you dig deep, find that little spark of resilience, and just keep pushing. And sometimes, just sometimes, you pull off a comeback. It’s a good feeling, that's for sure. Go Mariners!
