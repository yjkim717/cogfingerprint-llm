As I laced up my running shoes for the 2023 NYC Marathon, I was reminded of the countless training miles that had led me to this moment. But it wasn't just the physical preparation that had me feeling confident – it was the rewards points I'd earned through my hotel stays. As a Marriott Bonvoy Brilliant cardholder, I'd accumulated enough points to score a free night at a luxurious hotel, where I'd rest and recover before the big day. At first, I was perplexed by the points calculation, but as I dove deeper, I realized the system was designed to reward loyalty. Just like how consistent training pays off on the road, my loyalty to Marriott was paying dividends in points. As I hit the starting line, I felt a sense of accomplishment – not just from my training, but from maximizing my rewards. It was a winning combination that made my marathon experience even more enjoyable.
