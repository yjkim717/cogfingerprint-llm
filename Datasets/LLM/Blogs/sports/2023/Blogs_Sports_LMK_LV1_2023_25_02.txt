I'm still buzzing from watching the Women's World Cup 2023. As a soccer enthusiast, I was on the edge of my seat, cheering on my favorite team. What struck me was the incredible athleticism and teamwork on display. I began to reflect on my own athletic pursuits - or lack thereof. I realized that, just like a well-insulated attic keeps a house cozy, a well-oiled team keeps the game moving. The pros make it look effortless, but it's clear they've put in the work. Maybe I'll dust off my cleats and join a local league.
