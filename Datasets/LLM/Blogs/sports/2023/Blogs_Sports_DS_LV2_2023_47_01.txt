There I was, standing 6’4" in the post during my men’s league game last night, feeling like a giraffe on roller skates. You’d think my height would give me an edge, but these shorter, stockier defenders—man, they’re built like brick walls. Every time I tried to seal my man for an entry pass, they’d wedge a knee or an elbow in, and I’d end up pushed farther out than I wanted.

Boxing out? Forget it. They’d just root themselves under the rim, and I’d be fighting for rebounding position like I was trying to move a parked car. It’s humbling, honestly. In 2023, with all the analytics and training, I’m getting schooled by pure, old-school grit. Makes you appreciate the fundamentals—sometimes, brute strength and leverage trump inches. Guess I’ve got some homework to do before next week’s game.
