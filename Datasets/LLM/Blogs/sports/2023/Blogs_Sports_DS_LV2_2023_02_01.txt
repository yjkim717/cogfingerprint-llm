The final whistle blew, and the stadium erupted. But for me, standing on the sideline, the roar was a quiet hum. My season was over two months ago, thanks to a torn ACL.

In 2023, I learned that being a true sports fan isn't just about the glory of winning. It’s about the grind you don't see. It’s the 6 AM rehab sessions when your friends are still asleep, the frustratingly slow progress, and the sheer will it takes to just keep showing up.

Watching my team lift the trophy, I didn't feel envy. I felt a profound connection. My battle wasn't on the field tonight, but my small, daily victories in recovery were part of the same fight. It taught me that resilience isn't a moment; it's a quiet, persistent choice you make every single day. And that’s a victory in itself.
