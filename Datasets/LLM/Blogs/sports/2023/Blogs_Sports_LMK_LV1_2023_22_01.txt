As I stepped onto the court in 2023, I couldn't help but think of my struggling mango tree. Just like my serves, it kept falling short. Despite tender care and a dash of neem oil, its leaves kept withering away. I bought it from an Etsy seller, full of promise. Now, I'm left wondering if I was just 'serving' it the wrong way. Maybe it's time to rethink my game â€“ and my gardening strategy.
