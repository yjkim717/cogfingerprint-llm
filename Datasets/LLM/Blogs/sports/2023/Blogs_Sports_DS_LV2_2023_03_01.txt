There’s something about Thursday Night Football that always feels a little different—like a bonus round in the middle of the week. Tonight, as the Saints and Rams face off at SoFi Stadium, I can’t help but think about the players suiting up, some nursing injuries, others just fighting through the grind of the 2023 season. It’s a reminder that behind every play, there’s a story of resilience.

Tuning in on Amazon Prime, I’m cozy on my couch, but my mind drifts to those bright lights and roaring fans. Win or lose, it’s these midweek battles that often reveal a team’s true heart. Here’s to hoping everyone leaves the field healthy—and that we get a game to remember.
