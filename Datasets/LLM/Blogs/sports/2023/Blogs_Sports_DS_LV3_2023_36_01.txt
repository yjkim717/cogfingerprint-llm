You know, watching the box office stumble for *The Marvels* this year got me thinking about my old high school basketball team. We had this star player, let’s call him “Captain,” who carried us to a championship. The next season, our coach decided to rebrand us as “The Aces” to highlight the whole squad. Sounds cool, right?

But here’s the thing—fans were confused. Opponents didn’t take the name seriously. That connection to our past glory? Gone. We ended up with a losing record, and morale tanked.

Just like naming that sequel *The Marvels* instead of *Captain Marvel 2* felt self-indulgent and muddled its identity, our rebrand backfired by losing what made us recognizable and respected. In sports or cinema, clarity matters. A name isn’t just a label—it’s a story. And if your audience can’t find themselves in that story, they’ll simply walk away. Lesson learned: never underestimate the power of a name that honors its roots.
