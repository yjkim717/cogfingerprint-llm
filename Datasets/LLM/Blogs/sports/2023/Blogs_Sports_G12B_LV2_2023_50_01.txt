## The Silent Music Stop That Nearly Ruined My Run

Seriously, has this happened to anyone else? I was halfway through a great run this week, totally in the zone with my playlist pumping, when… silence. My Garmin 265 music had expired! Apparently, it auto-cleared. Talk about a motivation killer. It made me realize how reliant I’ve become on that soundtrack. Now I'm wishing for a simple reminder on my watch – a little heads-up before the tunes vanish. Anyone else battling tech frustrations mid-workout? Let's commiserate!



Hopefully, this captures the desired tone and style!
