## The Sunday Scaries and the Sideline Shift

Anyone else feel that Sunday evening dread creeping in a little early lately? It’s not just the looming Monday, it’s the realization that peak sports energy is fading. I’ve been obsessively following my local rec league basketball team, and honestly, the recent shift in strategy – meant to be a boost – has left us stumbling. 

It’s frustrating watching them struggle, knowing they’re capable of so much more. It’s a reminder that even with the best intentions, tweaking a system can sometimes throw everything off balance. Makes you appreciate the simple rhythm of the game, doesn't it? Hoping for a return to form next week!
