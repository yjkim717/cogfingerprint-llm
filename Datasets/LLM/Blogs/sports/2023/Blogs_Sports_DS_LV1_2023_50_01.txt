There I was, mid-run in 2023, relying on my Garmin watch to power me through with my favorite playlist. But as I hit my stride, silence struck—my downloaded tunes had expired without any heads-up. No Wi-Fi meant no fix, just the rhythm of my own frustration. It’s a stark reminder: in sports and tech, we can’t take seamless experiences for granted. Always double-check your gear, because sometimes the only beat you’ll hear is your heart pounding solo.
