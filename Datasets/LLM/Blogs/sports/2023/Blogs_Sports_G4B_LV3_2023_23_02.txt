**Don’t Sleep on the Underdogs: Why I’m Watching Texas Tech vs. Oregon**

Let’s be honest, as football season rolls into 2023, it’s easy to get swept up in the big names – Alabama, Ohio State, the usual suspects. But this year, something’s pulling me towards a different kind of game: Texas Tech versus Oregon.

I think we all need a little reminder to look beyond the polished narratives and appreciate the grit and passion of teams often overlooked.  Maybe it’s a chance to discover a new favorite, or simply to enjoy the pure, unadulterated joy of a good football game. What undervalued matchups are you keeping an eye on this season?
