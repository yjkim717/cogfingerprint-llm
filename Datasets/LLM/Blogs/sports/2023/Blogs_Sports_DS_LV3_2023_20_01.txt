There I was, watching our JMR team’s latest wave event, and something just felt off. After each run, we’d see the immediate score—like inning-by-inning updates in a baseball game—but never the total. It’s 2023; shouldn’t we have the full picture at our fingertips? I kept thinking about the event feedback we’d share later, but without that running tally, it’s hard to gauge real progress or build momentum. It’s like playing a whole game without knowing if you’re winning or losing until the very end. That disconnect can dampen the thrill and leave athletes and fans alike feeling a bit lost in the moment.
