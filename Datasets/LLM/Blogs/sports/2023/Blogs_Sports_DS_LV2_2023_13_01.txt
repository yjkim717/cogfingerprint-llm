The roar of the stadium fades, replaced by the quiet hum of the ice machine in my empty garage. My old hockey skates sit in the corner, the leather worn soft, the blades long since dulled. For years after I hung them up, I’d see them and feel a pang of loss, a ghost of the player I used to be.

But in 2023, my perspective has shifted. I don’t see relics of a finished career anymore. I see the proof of a journey. Every scuff tells a story—the championship win, the brutal loss that taught me more, the bond with teammates that felt like family. That gear isn't a memorial; it's a foundation.

The discipline, the resilience, the sheer joy of the game—those things didn't retire. They just transferred. They fuel my work ethic now, help me navigate life's sudden power-plays and defensive stands. The athlete may be gone, but the person they built is still very much in the game, just on a different rink. And for that, I’m forever grateful.
