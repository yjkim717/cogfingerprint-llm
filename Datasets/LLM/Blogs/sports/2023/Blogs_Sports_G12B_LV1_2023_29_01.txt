## The Quiet Hours & a Sore Back

This season's been brutal on my lower back. Spending hours in a ground blind, patiently waiting, really adds up. I'm seriously considering upgrading my chair – something with a swivel and a bit more lumbar support. Hunting's about connection, but right now, it’s mostly about finding a comfortable way to endure those quiet, frosty mornings of 2023. Any recommendations out there?
