As I cheered on my favorite team at the stadium in 2023, I realized I'd been to consecutive games featuring star athletes, much like watching consecutive films by a favorite director. Seeing athletes give their all, night after night, is exhilarating. I hope to keep the streak alive and experience the thrill of live sports with friends and family, creating unforgettable memories along the way.
