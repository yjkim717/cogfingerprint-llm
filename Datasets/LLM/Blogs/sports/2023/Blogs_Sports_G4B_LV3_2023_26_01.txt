**Trading Away Tomorrow for Today? A Nuggets Fan’s Worry**

It’s a familiar feeling, isn’t it? That knot in your stomach when a team makes a big move. Right now, the Denver Nuggets’ trade for that protected first-round pick has me chewing on a tough question. They gave up *so many* future draft picks – a hefty price for a single, hopefully-reliable, future asset. 

As a long-time fan, I get the allure of a guaranteed pick. But looking at the Nuggets’ core, guys like Jokic and Murray aren’t getting any younger. It feels like we're mortgaging our team’s long-term health for a quick fix. Is this truly building for the future, or just trying to patch up the present? It's a conversation we need to keep having as Nuggets fans – a balance between chasing immediate success and investing in the team’s DNA.
