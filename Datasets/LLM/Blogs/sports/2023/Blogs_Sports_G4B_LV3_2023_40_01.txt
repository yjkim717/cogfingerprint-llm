**The Green Rush & the Great Transition**

Okay, let me tell you about St. Patrick’s Day. Not the parade, not the green beer (though that was tempting!), but a 5K race. I finally signed up, and it was… well, it was a whole thing.  As a dedicated indoor runner – mostly on the treadmill – the idea of tackling a race *outside* in November felt a little daunting. 2023 was all about pushing myself, and this felt like a good, solid goal.

The training itself was a shift. My pace felt off, my muscles weren’t quite used to the uneven pavement, and let’s be honest, the wind! There were days I seriously questioned my sanity. It was a constant battle between the comfort of the controlled environment of the gym and the wildness of the outdoors. 

Race day arrived, draped in a surprisingly chilly spring air. The energy was incredible – so many people decked out in green, cheering each other on. I focused on pacing, trying to stick to my plan, but the hills… oh, the hills! 

Crossing that finish line, covered in mud and grinning like a fool, was a huge moment. It wasn’t about the time, really. It was about proving to myself that I could step outside my comfort zone, embrace the challenge, and actually *enjoy* the journey. 

Running, especially when it’s a goal-oriented activity, forces you to confront your limits and celebrate your progress.  And maybe, just maybe, appreciate the beauty of a slightly blustery, green-tinged outdoor run.  What’s your biggest training challenge right now?
