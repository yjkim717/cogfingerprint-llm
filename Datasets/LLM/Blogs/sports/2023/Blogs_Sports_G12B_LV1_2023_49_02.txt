## Remember When The Rock Was… Bad? A WWE Retrospective Idea

Okay, wrestling fans, let's dive into a "what if" scenario. We're in 2023, and wrestling nostalgia is *everything*. We've got retrospectives on every era, every rivalry. But there’s one arc I think deserves a deep dive: The Rock’s Hollywood heel run in 2002-2003.

Seriously, think about it. The Rock, the People's Champ, suddenly turning full-blown arrogant movie star, dismissing the WWE Universe as just an audience for *his* success? It was brilliantly jarring. He wasn't just a bad guy, he was a *celebrity* bad guy, leveraging his burgeoning Hollywood career to mock the very fans who’d built him up. 

It was a fascinating period bridging the Attitude Era and the Ruthless Aggression era, and smackdown six was part of it. It felt genuinely fresh and different, and watching him dismantle his own legacy, all while still being undeniably captivating, was something special. 

I’d love to see a detailed retrospective series – “OSW style” – unpacking that storyline. Examining the build, the matches, the psychology... It’s a period of wrestling history that’s often overshadowed, but deserves a proper spotlight. Thoughts? Let me know in the comments!
