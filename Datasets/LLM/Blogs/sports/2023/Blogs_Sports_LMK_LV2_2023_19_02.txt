"Stepping into the Cold: How Showers Changed My Running Game

As I stood under the icy water in 2023, I couldn't help but think about the transformative journey I'd been on. It all started when I began taking cold showers to boost my endurance for running. At first, it was tough - my body would tense up, and I'd struggle to catch my breath. But with time, I noticed a change. My breathing became more controlled, and I felt a newfound sense of inner body heat that lingered long after I stepped out. My lung capacity expanded, and I found myself tackling runs with more ease. The physical adaptation was remarkable. Cold showers taught me to adapt to discomfort, and that resilience translated to my running. I was no longer intimidated by challenging routes or weather conditions. The cold shower became more than just a habit; it was a catalyst for my growth as a runner."
