"March Madness is just around the corner, and the college basketball world is abuzz with excitement. As we dive into the new season, I couldn't help but think about the AP Poll and how it sets the stage for the year to come. This week, I took a deep dive into the preseason rankings, analyzing the voters and their tendencies.

What struck me was the varying levels of consistency among AP Poll voters. Some voters seemed to be on the same wavelength, consistently ranking teams in a similar order. Others, however, were outliers, deviating from the pack with their picks. I sorted the voters by similarity, and it was fascinating to see which ones clustered together.

The most consistent voters tended to follow a similar ranking style, often prioritizing teams with strong resumes and consistent performance. On the other hand, outlier voters were more likely to take risks, ranking teams that others might have overlooked. It's not necessarily that one approach is right or wrong â€“ it's just interesting to see the different perspectives at play.

As we head into the season, I'm curious to see how these voter tendencies play out. Will the consistent voters stick to their guns, or will they adjust their rankings as the season unfolds? Will the outliers prove to be prescient or misguided? The AP Poll is just a snapshot in time, but it's a fun exercise to analyze the voters and their thought processes. As the season tips off, I'm excited to see how it all shakes out."
