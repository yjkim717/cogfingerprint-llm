"As I prep for my 2023 road trip to the majestic Redwoods, I'm on a mission to track down a cold Rainier Beer in the Eureka-Arcata area. It's a quest that's almost as thrilling as watching my favorite team take the field. The nostalgia of sipping on a Rainier while cruising through the towering trees is the perfect complement to the excitement of the game - a true summer 2023 delight."
