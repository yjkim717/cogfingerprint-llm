As a left-handed golfer living near Montreal, I've struggled to find the perfect set. In 2023, I'm on the hunt for single golf clubs to upgrade my game. I've turned to the internet for a reliable USA-based dealer. Shopping online can be overwhelming, but I'm determined to find the right equipment. Wish me luck - my golf swing is counting on it!
