It’s funny how expectations can blindside you. I really thought this was the Cavs’ year—Donovan Mitchell was electric, the roster stacked. But the Knicks? They just wanted it more. Losing 4-1 in the 2023 playoffs felt like a gut punch, a reminder that talent alone doesn’t win series. Heart, hustle—they matter. As a fan, it stings, but it’s also a lesson in what it truly takes to compete when it counts. On to next season.
