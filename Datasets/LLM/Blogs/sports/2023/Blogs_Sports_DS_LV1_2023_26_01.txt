As a lifelong NBA fan, I’ve always been fascinated by the chess match of draft pick trades. But lately, I’m scratching my head. Why would a team give up multiple assets for a single, heavily protected future first-rounder from a contender like the Denver Nuggets? In 2023, with so much young talent available, that protected pick could easily become a late first-rounder—or not convey at all. It feels like trading a handful of lottery tickets for a single one with worse odds. Is the gamble really worth it?
