"As we dive into the 2023 NBA season, one thing is clear: Joel Embiid is on fire! Without James Harden on the court, Embiid has stepped up his playmaking game, averaging 7 assists over the last 5 games while keeping turnovers to a minimum - just 2. Is this a new side of the 76ers' star? As a basketball fan, it's exciting to see Embiid's growth and the impact it's having on Philly's chances."
