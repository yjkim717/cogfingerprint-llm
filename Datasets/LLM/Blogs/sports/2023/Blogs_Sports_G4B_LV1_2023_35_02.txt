**Chasing Light on a Winter Run**

It’s funny how a simple photo can transport you back in time, isn’t it? Lately, I’ve been really into Photo Friday threads – you know, those little digital communities popping up on Reddit where runners share their best shots. Last week, I even entered one and, to my surprise, won! It made me think about the quiet joy of capturing a run.

This winter, the grey skies and shorter days have made it extra tempting to stay indoors. But there’s something about pushing through the cold, searching for a patch of golden light on a running route, that just resets me. 

There’s a certain beauty in the fleeting moments – the frost on the trees, the way the snow reflects the streetlights. It’s not about speed or distance, it’s about noticing.  It's a reminder to slow down and appreciate the small victories, both on and off the trail.  Anyone else find their runs become a visual diary this time of year?
