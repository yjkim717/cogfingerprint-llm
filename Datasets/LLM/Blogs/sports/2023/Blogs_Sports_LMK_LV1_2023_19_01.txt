As I stepped into the gym in 2023, I couldn't help but notice a common trend among weightlifters - they're lifting too light. Research suggests that most lifters are training at a measly 53% of their one-repetition maximum (1RM), a load that's more suited to toning than building serious strength and hypertrophy. I recall my own early days of weightlifting, when I thought I was pushing myself hard, only to realize later that I was barely scratching the surface. The reality is, if you're not challenging yourself with substantial loads, you're leaving gains on the table. By selecting heavier weights and pushing our 1RM, we can unlock untapped potential for strength and muscle growth. It's time to reassess our load selection and strive for more - our bodies will thank us. By lifting heavier, we can break through plateaus and achieve the results we've been striving for.
