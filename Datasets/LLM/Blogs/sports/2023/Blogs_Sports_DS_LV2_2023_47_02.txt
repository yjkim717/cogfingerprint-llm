There’s a moment in rec league basketball—right when that smaller, scrappier defender gets low and fronts you in the post—where everything gets quiet in your head except for one nagging thought: *Am I tough enough for this?*

I’m 6’4”. By all accounts, I should own the paint. But last season, I’d let guys deny me the ball, get under my skin, and turn me passive. It wasn’t a skill issue—it was a mindset one. I was playing not to mess up, instead of playing to dominate.

This year, I made a change. I stopped asking for the ball politely and started demanding it. Seal, step through, go strong. The first time I scored through contact and heard the other team groan? Everything clicked. Mental toughness isn’t about being fearless—it’s about trusting yourself when it’s time to be assertive. And honestly? That’s a game-changer, on and off the court.
