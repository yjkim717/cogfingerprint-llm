## The Quiet Obsession of What's *Coming*

There's something about Football Manager that gets under your skin, isn't there? It's not just about the win, the glory of the moment. It's about the long game. Lately, I've found myself obsessing over potential future signings, meticulously tracking transfer fees and potential clauses. It feels oddly similar to watching a team's salary commitments â€“ a quiet anxiety about what's coming down the line. I even wished for a simple tab to see the aggregate net future transfer costs! It's a weird detail, but it speaks to the depth of the simulation, and how we, as fans, are always thinking about the *future*.
