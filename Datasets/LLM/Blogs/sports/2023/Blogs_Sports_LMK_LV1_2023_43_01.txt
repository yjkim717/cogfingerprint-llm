As I laced up my running shoes this morning, I couldn't help but think about the premium sports apps I've been using. Just like how I wish Bookmate and Deezer had a more intuitive interface, I wish my fitness tracker had more streamlined features. Telenor's recent partnership with a popular fitness platform got me thinking - can't we have a seamless experience that combines music, reading, and fitness? A unified dashboard would be a game-changer for athletes like me in 2023.
