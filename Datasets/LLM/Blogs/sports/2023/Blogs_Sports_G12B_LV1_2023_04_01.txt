## Where Did Jacoby Go? And What About the Podcast Landscape?

It’s been a weird few months in the sports media world, hasn't it? Remember when Jacoby Jones left ESPN? The internet practically exploded with "Where's Jacoby?" chatter. A lot of us were hoping he'd land at The Ringer – Bill Simmons always seemed like a good fit. It got me thinking about the podcast landscape overall. So many voices, so much shifting around. Feels like we're in a constant evolution, searching for that next great sports conversation. Anyone else feeling it?
