## Are You Leaving Gains on the Table? (Seriously.)

Okay, let's be real. How many times have you felt *good* after a workout, but not *blown away*? I know I have. Lately, I've been digging into some research, and a recent meta-analysis really hit home. Apparently, most of us are lifting around 53% of our 1RM – that's our one-rep max. 

Think about that. We're playing it safe, feeling comfortable... but potentially short-changing ourselves on muscle growth and strength. It’s a bit humbling, isn’t it? It's making me rethink my own training load. Maybe it's time to push a little harder, smart of course, and chase those bigger gains. Anyone else feeling inspired to reassess?
