**The Elusive Art of Lag**

I’ll admit it—I’m a YouTube-taught golfer. In 2023, with a world of tutorials at my fingertips, I figured I could coach myself. My current obsession? Creating that perfect “lag,” that beautiful moment where the clubhead trails your hands, promising pure compression at impact.

I’ve spent hours in my backyard, rehearsing the move until my back ached. I’ve watched the slo-mo clips of the pros until my eyes crossed. But on the course, it’s the same story: a rushed, slappy swing that sends another weak shot skittering.

It’s humbling. You can know something intellectually, but getting your body to trust the feeling of trailing the club is a whole different battle. I’m not giving up, though. Maybe the secret isn't in another video, but in patience—in letting that lag find me, instead of me forcing it to happen.
