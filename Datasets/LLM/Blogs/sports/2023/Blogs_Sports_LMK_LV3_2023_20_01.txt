"Marble Racing: A Twist on Transparency. As I watched the Jelles Marble Runs event in 2023, I found myself pondering the format of the competition. The suspense was palpable, but I couldn't help but feel that something was missing. What if, after each thrilling run, the total score was displayed? I believe this simple tweak would amplify viewer engagement, making the experience even more electrifying. By shedding light on the standings, the competition would become more transparent, drawing fans in and keeping them on the edge of their seats."
