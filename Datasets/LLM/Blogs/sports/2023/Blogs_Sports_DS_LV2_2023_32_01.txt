There’s something special about the hum of preseason chatter—the kind you find tucked away in a Phil Steele podcast interview. As I listened today, I couldn’t help but smile, remembering how my dad and I used to pore over his CFB preview magazines every August.

That crisp paper smell, the endless debates over rankings—it wasn’t just analysis; it was ritual. Now, with his 2023 guide just a click away (and even at a discount!), the tradition feels both timeless and new. It’s more than stats and predictions—it’s about connection. Whether you’re a die-hard fan or just love the game, these moments remind us why we care so much. Here’s to another season of heart, hustle, and hope.
