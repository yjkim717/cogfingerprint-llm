**Remembering the Shift: When Football Stopped Running**

It’s funny how a single season can feel like a turning point, isn’t it? I was just scrolling through some old college football stats – specifically, 1973 – and it hit me: the Oklahoma Sooners versus the Texas Longhorns. Back then, running the ball was king. Now? It feels like almost every team is throwing it.

I’ve been a football fan my whole life, and I vividly remember watching those Sooners – a bruising, powerful team built on ground game dominance. It’s a different world now, with the “option offense” and a relentless focus on passing yards. 

It makes you wonder about the evolution of the game, doesn't it?  Maybe it’s just about efficiency, or maybe it’s a reflection of how we’ve changed as a society.  Either way, that 1973 matchup – and the change it symbolized – reminds me that even in something as seemingly constant as sports, there’s always a shift happening beneath the surface.  What do you think?
