The final whistle blew on my coaching career in late 2023. For years, I’d focused on plays and technical skills, thinking that’s what built a winning team. But my last season taught me the real game-changer wasn't on the whiteboard; it was in the locker room. True leadership isn't about the most complex strategy—it’s about genuine empathy. It’s knowing when a player needs a push and when they just need someone to listen. That’s how you build a team that truly connects.
