Another wild night in the Big 12. Watching Texas and Kansas battle it out for the regular season title, with elimination looming, takes me back. It’s funny—in 2023, we’re so focused on the final trophy, but these are the moments we’ll remember. The heart-stopping plays, the raw emotion on the court. It’s not just about who wins the crown, but the shared, breathless journey we take with these teams. That’s the real victory.
