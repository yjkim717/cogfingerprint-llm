**The Fronting Frenzy & Finding My Voice**

Okay, real talk – rec league basketball in 2023 can be brutal. I’ve been battling something lately that’s way more than just a tough opponent: my own head. It started with a frustrating series of games where I felt completely shut down. Seriously, these guys were *fronting* – crowding the post and making it impossible to even get a clean shot. 

It wasn’t just the defense, though. I realized I wasn't being assertive enough, letting passes slip away and shrinking back when I should have been driving. It’s a weird feeling, losing that mental edge.  I’m working on it, focusing on trusting my instincts and just… yelling a little more.  Anyone else ever feel like their game is hampered by their own self-doubt? Let’s talk about it! #basketball #mentalgame #recball
