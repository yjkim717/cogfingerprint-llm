**The Algorithm & the Arcade**

Remember those late nights at the arcade back in 2023? The frantic button-mashing, the competitive buzz – it felt *real*. Now, I’m starting to wonder if a lot of what we create online feels… manufactured. 

I’ve been messing around with AI tools to help brainstorm blog post ideas and even build outlines. It’s surprisingly efficient, but it got me thinking: is there a line we shouldn't cross? 

Using AI to generate a framework is one thing, but relying on it to *write* the core of the piece? It feels a little like using a perfectly programmed joystick to play a game – impressive, sure, but does it capture the same messy, passionate joy as a human hand? 

I’m still figuring it out, honestly.  What do you think?  Let me know in the comments!
