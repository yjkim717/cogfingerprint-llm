The 2023 college football season is shaping up to be one for the ages. As we wrapped up Week 6, the /r/CFB community gathered to share their thoughts, and the poll results are in. Unsurprisingly, the top three spots are occupied by three of the season's biggest contenders: Texas, Michigan, and Ohio State.

As I looked at the poll results, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia. College football has a way of bringing people together like nothing else can. Whether you're a die-hard fan or just someone who enjoys the excitement of a Saturday afternoon, the sport has a way of transcending generations and backgrounds.

Texas, Michigan, and Ohio State - these aren't just teams; they're programs with rich histories and dedicated fan bases. To see them vying for the top spots is a testament to the talent and hard work that's going into the sport.

As we head into the second half of the season, it's clear that there are a lot of compelling storylines to follow. Will Texas be able to keep their momentum going? Can Michigan continue to defy expectations? And what about Ohio State - will they be able to overcome their recent struggles?

One thing is for sure: the next few weeks are going to be a wild ride. As a fan, it's an exciting time to be alive. So grab your favorite jersey, head on out to the stadium (or gather around the TV with friends), and get ready to cheer on your team. The 2023 college football season is one to remember.
