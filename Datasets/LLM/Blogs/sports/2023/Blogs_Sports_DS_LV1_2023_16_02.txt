### The Real Prize on Trivia Tuesday

It’s Thursday, but my mind is still back on Tuesday. That’s the day our little corner of the college football world goes quiet, not for a big game, but for the weekly trivia contest. The email just landed, announcing the Premier and Championship tier standings, and I found myself smiling, not at the top of the leaderboard, but at my own name, sitting squarely in the middle.

Last season, I was obsessed with the chase. The speed bonus for answering first felt like a 4th-quarter Hail Mary, and the elusive “Perfecto” for a flawless sheet was my personal national championship. I’d spend Monday nights cramming obscure stats, my heart pounding as I clicked “submit.” I landed a few Perfectos, sure, but the stress was real.

This year, in 2023, something shifted. Maybe it’s getting older, or maybe it’s just the state of the world, but I’ve started to see Trivia Tuesday differently. The real win isn't the digital badge next to my name; it’s the text thread it sparks with my old college roommate. It’s the friendly jab about who remembered the name of that backup quarterback from 2014. It’s the shared memory of a random Saturday in October years ago that a question unexpectedly unearths.

The competition is still fun—the structure of the tiers and the thrill of the speed bonus give it a great spine. But I’ve realized the contest is just the kickoff. The real game, the one that truly matters, is the connection it fosters long after the final question is scored. And in that league, we’re all top-tier.
