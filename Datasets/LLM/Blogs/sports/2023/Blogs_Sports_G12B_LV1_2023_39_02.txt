>## The Unexpected Joy of a Comeback

Okay, so I'll admit, I almost gave up on the Giants this year. Seriously. Through all the early season struggles, I was ready to chalk it up to "just one of those years." But something shifted. Watching them claw their way back, game by game, fueled by a scrappy energy I hadn't seen in a while… it was unexpectedly thrilling. It reminded me why I love sports – that unpredictable, resilient spirit. Maybe a Redwood road trip and a Rainier are in order to celebrate!
