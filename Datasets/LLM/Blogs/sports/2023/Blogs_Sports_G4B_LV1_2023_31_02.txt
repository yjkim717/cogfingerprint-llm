**The Great Trousers Mystery (and Vinted’s Fine Print)**

Okay, so this week’s been a bit of a rollercoaster. I was *really* excited about a Vinted bundle deal – three pairs of vintage trousers for a steal! I snagged them, paid, and waited… and waited. Turns out, I only received two. 

Cue the slightly frantic messaging with the seller, a polite but frustrating back-and-forth, and now a pending refund request. It’s a weird reminder that even online buying has its quirks – and the ‘buyer protection’ stuff on platforms like Vinted is seriously important. 

It’s made me think about the whole process of buying secondhand. You’re hoping for a treasure, a unique find, but you also have to be realistic and understand there’s always a tiny chance things don’t go exactly as planned. Anyone else have a Vinted adventure gone slightly sideways lately?
