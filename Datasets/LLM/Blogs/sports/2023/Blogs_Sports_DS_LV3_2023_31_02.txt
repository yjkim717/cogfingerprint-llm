The final buzzer echoed through the gym, but the real defeat had happened weeks earlier. My teammate and I were like a Vinted bundle purchase gone wrong; we’d trained as a trio all season, a perfect package deal. But come playoffs, one of us was missing in action—not injured, just mentally checked out.

Trying to resolve it felt like a refund dispute, a frustrating back-and-forth of “I’ll be there” promises that never materialized. The seller conflict was internal, a battle between friendship and the team’s needs. We lost the championship game, a hollow feeling of what could have been. It’s a tough 2023 lesson: in sports, as in life, you can’t force a full set when a piece of the bundle is already gone.
