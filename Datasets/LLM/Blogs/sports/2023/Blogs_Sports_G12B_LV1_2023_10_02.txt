## The Hard Choices Ahead for the Warriors

It’s November 2023, and the Warriors feel… different. Not bad, exactly, but the spark isn’t quite there. We're all still basking in the glow of those four championships, but let's be honest, time isn’t standing still. Steph and Klay aren't getting any younger, and the league is relentlessly hungry.

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about roster construction. Specifically, Jordan Poole. Look, it’s tough to write this. JP showed flashes of brilliance, and we all hoped he’d blossom into a key piece. But the struggles this year are undeniable. Is his development hindering the team's overall progress?

Maybe, just maybe, it's time to explore other options.  Trading JP, painful as it would be, could free up minutes and financial flexibility to truly invest in players like Jonathan Kuminga (DDV).  Giving those younger guys a real chance to grow alongside Steph and Klay – *that* might be the key to squeezing every last drop out of their championship window. It’s a tough pill to swallow, but isn't maximizing those final years with our core what we all want?
