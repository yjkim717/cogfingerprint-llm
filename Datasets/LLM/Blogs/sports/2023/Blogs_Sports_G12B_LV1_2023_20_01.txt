## The Little Things That Make a Big Difference

You know that feeling when you're really *in the zone* during a competition? I got a serious dose of that last weekend at a local marble run event – a surprising amount of fun, I gotta say! It got me thinking about how even small tweaks to the experience can really elevate things.

There was this one moment, watching a competitor, where I realized how much more engaging it would be if we could see a running total of everyone’s score displayed as they went. Instead of waiting for the final scoreboard, a quick glance after each run would build suspense and let you see how you stacked up. 

It’s a tiny detail, sure, but it’s the little things that often make the difference between a good competition and a *great* one. Makes you wonder what other seemingly minor adjustments could boost the excitement in other sports, doesn’t it?
