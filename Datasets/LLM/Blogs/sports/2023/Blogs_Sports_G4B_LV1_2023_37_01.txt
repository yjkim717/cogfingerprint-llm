**The Unexpected Shift: Remembering the Team Vibe**

It’s weird, isn’t it? This year, watching the Premier League, I’ve been really thinking about team dynamics. We all went through a massive shift with remote work – suddenly, everyone was connected through screens. It felt…efficient, sure, but also a little sterile. 

Then, PwC’s announcement about hybrid work dropped – encouraging those in-office days. It reminded me of something crucial: that spontaneous energy you get from being *together*.  I missed the quick chats before training, the shared frustration after a tough loss, the genuine high-fives. 

Maybe it’s just me, but I think there’s a real value in just being present, in the same room, pushing towards a common goal. It’s a reminder that while flexibility is great, a little bit of that old-school team vibe is pretty vital too.  What about you – are you feeling it too?
