### Cracking the Code: My First Marriott Points Mystery

I just got back from my first official stay as a Marriott Bonvoy member, credit card in hand and ready to watch the points roll in. I’d done my homework—or so I thought. I had the Bonvoy Brilliant Card, was aiming for that coveted elite status, and understood the basics: spend at the hotel, plus a bonus for being a member.

But when my points receipt landed in my account, I was stumped. The math didn’t seem to add up. I found myself staring at the numbers, a modern-day detective with a calculator instead of a magnifying glass. Was it 10 points per dollar? Was the card bonus calculated on the pre-tax amount? Did my member tier kick in correctly?

After a deep dive into the terms and a quick call to customer service, the formula finally clicked. It wasn't just one calculation, but a layered one: base points + elite bonus + credit card multiplier. Seeing it all broken down was a lightbulb moment. The lesson? Understanding the mechanics behind the rewards is just as important as earning them. Now, I’m not just collecting points; I’m strategically building my next getaway, one perfectly calculated stay at a time.

### The Unlikely MVP of Our 2023 Season

It wasn’t the championship win or the star player’s record-breaking season that defined 2023 for me. It was a Tuesday in March, in a near-empty gym.

Our team was in a slump. Passes were sloppy, morale was low, and the playoffs felt like a distant dream. During a time-out, our captain, Sarah, didn’t yell plays. She just said, “Look at each other. Remember why we started this.”

It was a simple, almost cliché moment. But something shifted. We stopped playing as individuals trying to be heroes and started moving as a single unit. We celebrated a gritty defensive stop like a game-winning shot. We lifted each other up, literally and figuratively.

We didn’t go on to win the title. We lost in the semi-finals. But that loss didn’t sting the way the earlier ones did. Because we finally understood that the real victory wasn’t on the scoreboard; it was in the trust we built in that quiet gym. The trophy is just metal; the bond we forged is unbreakable. That’s the win I’ll carry long after the season ends.
