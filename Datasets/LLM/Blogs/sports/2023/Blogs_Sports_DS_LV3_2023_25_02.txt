The whistle blew, and my lungs burned. It was 2023, and our over-40 soccer league felt more punishing than ever. I realized my old training wasn't cutting it; I needed a new strategy. So, I started focusing on recovery—proper sleep, hydration, and even foam rolling while watching the game. It wasn't a magic fix, but that deliberate shift made all the difference. Now, I’m not just keeping up; I’m enjoying the game again, proving it’s never too late to change your playbook.
