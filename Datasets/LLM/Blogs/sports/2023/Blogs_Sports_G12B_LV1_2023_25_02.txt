## The Unexpected Draft Pick and the Long Game

So, this year's draft… wild, right? Everyone was buzzing about the top picks, the sure things. But honestly, I’ve been thinking more about that late-round guy, Miller. Nobody saw him coming. Experts said he lacked the "R-value," the core strength needed to really contribute. 

It reminded me of tackling a project yourself – like, say, trying to boost your team's performance. Sometimes, the flashy, expensive solutions aren’t what you need. Maybe it’s the quiet, consistent work, the building up of fundamentals. Miller's proving that grit and determination can insulate you from criticism and build something lasting. It’s a long season, and a late draft pick can be a game-changer. You just gotta give him the space to develop.
