It’s a frustrating feeling, isn’t it? When your sport doesn’t immediately cater to you. I recently heard about a golfer near Montreal, battling to find decent *left-handed* golf clubs – a surprisingly common struggle! As a right-handed player, I can only imagine the difficulty. It highlights how often specialized equipment gets overlooked, especially when you’re not part of the mainstream. Finding the right gear, whether it’s a specific club or just a supportive dealer, truly makes a difference.
