"My blueberry bushes are struggling! I noticed their leaves turning purple and foliage falling off, and I'm worried I might lose them. I've been doing some research and suspect it might be due to ammonium deficiency in the soil. Blueberry bushes need acidic soil to thrive, and I'm guessing my soil might be too alkaline. To save them, I'm considering using a soil acidifier to adjust the pH levels. I've also read that ammonium-rich fertilizers can help. Has anyone else faced a similar issue? What were your solutions? I'd love to hear your tips on how to nurse my blueberry bushes back to health. With the right care, I'm confident they'll be producing delicious berries in no time. Fingers crossed!"
