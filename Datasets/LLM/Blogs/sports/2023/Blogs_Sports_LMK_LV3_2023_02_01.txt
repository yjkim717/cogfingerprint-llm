As I prep my backyard for the Melbourne Fire Brick Co. P85 pizza oven, I'm reminded of the excitement of game day gatherings. Outdoor cooking is more than just a meal, it's about creating an experience. My patio renovation is almost complete, and I'm eager to fire up the oven and host friends and family. Just like a well-executed play, a perfectly cooked pizza brings people together. In 2023, I'm looking forward to making unforgettable memories around the outdoor kitchen, where the love of food and sports unite.
