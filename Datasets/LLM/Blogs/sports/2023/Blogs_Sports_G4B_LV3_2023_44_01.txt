**The Unspoken Contracts of Teamwork**

You know how it feels when you pour your heart and soul into something – a project, a season, a team – and you’re not getting the recognition, or frankly, the *payment* you deserve? Lately, I’ve been thinking about that, watching a story unfold about a cannabis company and a dispensary network. It’s a messy lawsuit, but it hits at a deeper truth about trust and accountability.

Like a sports team, every player relies on the others to fulfill their commitments.  A missed pass, a dropped block – it impacts everyone.  This case about Cresco Labs and Terps highlights how crucial those unspoken contracts of teamwork are.  Sometimes, even when there’s a legal agreement, the human element gets lost, and relationships fracture. It’s a reminder that integrity matters, both on and off the field.
