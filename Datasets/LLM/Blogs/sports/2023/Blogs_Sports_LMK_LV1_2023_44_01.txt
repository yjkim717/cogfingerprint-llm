As I stepped onto the court in 2023, I couldn't help but think of the high-stakes games I'd played in before. The thrill of competition still pumped through my veins. But this time, I was reflecting on a different kind of rivalry - one that had nothing to do with sports. I recalled the news about Cresco Labs taking two Massachusetts dispensaries to court over unpaid bills. Just like a team that can't pay its dues, Terps was struggling to settle its score. The cannabis company's lawsuit was a harsh reminder that even in a new industry, the rules of business still apply.
