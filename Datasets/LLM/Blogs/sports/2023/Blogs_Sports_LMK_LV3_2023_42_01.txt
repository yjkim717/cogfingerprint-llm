As I watched the latest college football game, I couldn't help but think about how much the sport has evolved. The emphasis on passing yards is now the norm, with top teams racking up hundreds of yards through the air each week. It's a far cry from the days of the wishbone offense, when teams like the 1973 Oklahoma Sooners and Texas Longhorns relied on a bruising running game to wear down their opponents. Back then, a combined 1393 rushing attempts was the name of the game, with passing attempts a distant afterthought. Fast forward to 2023, and it's clear that NCAA trends have shifted dramatically. Modern college football is a high-flying, pass-happy affair, with teams prioritizing aerial attacks to keep pace. As a fan, it's exciting to see the evolution of the game, but I still have a soft spot for the rugged, grind-it-out style of the past.
