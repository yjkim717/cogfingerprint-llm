## Diving Deep with College Football's Phil Steele – and a Little Bit of Nostalgia

There's something I just *love* about the anticipation that builds leading into a new college football season. The speculation, the rankings, the endless debates… it’s a beautiful chaos! And if you're like me, you're always looking for an edge, some insider knowledge to fuel those early predictions.

That’s why I was so excited to see the /r/CFB Talk series recently dropped an interview with Phil Steele. Seriously, if you're a die-hard fan, you know Steele. His previews are legendary. 

Listening to the interview was a trip down memory lane, too. They mentioned some of the other incredible guests who've been on the show – a real who's who of college football. And, as a bonus, they’ve got a discount link to his 2023 preview! It's a great way to get ready for what promises to be another thrilling season. Go check it out!
