It’s funny how quickly things can change in the NBA. Just last season, I remember watching the Celtics and feeling that familiar pang of anxiety every time one of our stars sat down. The offense would sputter, the spacing would collapse, and you could just feel the momentum slipping away.

But now, with Porziņģis in the mix for 2023? It feels like a weight has been lifted. I’m not just talking about adding another guy who can score 20 points. It’s what his presence *means*. Suddenly, the floor opens up. Defenses can’t just swarm Tatum and Brown anymore. Our role players get cleaner looks, and maybe, just maybe, our stars can finally catch their breath during the regular season without the whole system grinding to a halt.

Of course, the injury history is the little voice in the back of my head. But for now, I’m choosing to dream about a fluid, unselfish, top-tier offense. It feels like the missing piece we’ve been searching for. Let’s see if this is the year it all clicks.
