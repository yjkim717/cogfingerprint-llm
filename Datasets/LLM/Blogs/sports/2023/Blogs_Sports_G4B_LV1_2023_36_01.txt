Okay, so I’m still processing the Mets’ season, honestly. It felt… flat. Like they were going through the motions. You know that feeling when a team just *doesn’t* have that spark? It’s like watching a beautiful, well-oiled machine running on fumes. 

We were clinging to hope for a playoff spot all summer, and the hype surrounding the new guys was massive – a real “marvel” of a signing lineup, if you will. But the results? Just underwhelming. The name “The Mets” felt tacked on, not really capturing the energy we were hoping for. 

It’s a weird feeling, seeing a team you’re invested in just… not delivering.  Maybe it was the fatigue of a long season, or just a lack of chemistry. Whatever it was, it left me feeling a little disappointed – a bit like that feeling after a promising start fizzles out.
