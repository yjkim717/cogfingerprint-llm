## The Quiet Strength of the Backup

Thinking about football lately, it's not always the star quarterback that grabs you. Remembering Johnny Unitas stepping in, Steve Young waiting his turn… those stories resonate. There's a quiet strength in being ready when your number's called, in knowing your moment might not be *now*. It’s a lesson that extends beyond the gridiron, isn't it? Sometimes, the greatest impact comes from patiently preparing, trusting the process, and seizing opportunity when it finally arrives. Makes you wonder who’s quietly sharpening their skills, ready for their chance.
