**When a Team’s Name Feels… Wrong**

Remember when the underdog team finally made it to the championship? There’s a huge surge of excitement, right? But sometimes, even before the game starts, a feeling lingers – a little unease. It’s like the name itself doesn’t quite capture the spirit of the group.

I was thinking about “The Marvels” movie recently, and it struck me in a similar way. As a huge MCU fan, I was genuinely hoping for a fantastic film, but the title felt… disconnected. It felt like it was trying to lean *so* heavily on Captain Marvel, almost overshadowing the team dynamic. 

Wouldn’t “Captain Marvel and The Marvels” have been a stronger, more honest reflection of the story? It’s a small thing, I know, but branding matters. Sometimes, a little more thoughtful marketing can make all the difference in building that initial excitement and truly representing a team’s potential.
