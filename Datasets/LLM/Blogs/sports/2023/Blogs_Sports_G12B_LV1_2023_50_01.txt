## The Silent Soundtrack of Disappointment

Okay, so I had a moment of peak frustration this morning. I’d been looking forward to my usual Sunday long run, fueled by a meticulously curated playlist on my new Garmin 265. Seriously, nothing beats pounding the pavement with a solid beat driving you on, right? 

Except, about five miles in, the music… just stopped. Dead. Turns out, my downloaded tracks had "expired." Apparently, Garmin has some weird system where downloaded music isn't forever. And of course, no Wi-Fi signal to be found out in the boonies.

Suddenly, the rhythmic thud of my feet felt… lonely. It was a surprisingly deflating experience. A silly thing, maybe, but it really broke my flow. Now I'm obsessively checking for Wi-Fi hotspots before *every* run. Lesson learned: always double-check your downloads! Who knew a sports watch could induce such existential dread?
