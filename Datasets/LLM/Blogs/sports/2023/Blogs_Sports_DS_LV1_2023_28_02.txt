**The Frustration in the Details: My 2023 Card-Listing Saga**

I was deep in the digital trenches last night, trying to list a gem from my childhood—a 1990 Ken Griffey Jr. rookie card. The platform encourages multi-variation listings, which is great for offering both graded and raw copies. But then I hit the modern collector's wall.
