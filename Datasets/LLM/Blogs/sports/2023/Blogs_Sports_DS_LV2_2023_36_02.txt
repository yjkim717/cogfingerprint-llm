### The Secret Lives of Names: What I Learned from NFL Rosters

It was a Tuesday in late August, the kind of day where the summer heat starts to feel nostalgic, and my brain was officially in a pretzel. I was staring at a blank screen, trying to find a new angle for the upcoming NFL season. We’d talked about fantasy sleepers, breakout defenses, and rookie quarterbacks until we were blue in the face. I needed something… else. Something that wasn’t about 40-yard dash times or completion percentages.

That’s when I fell down the rabbit hole. And it all started with a name: Awanol.

Okay, so “AWANOL” isn’t a player. It’s a ridiculous, made-up metric I concocted in a moment of caffeine-fueled madness. It stands for “Aggregate Width Analysis of Name Letters.” In simple terms, I became obsessed with which NFL players had the “fattest” and “skinniest” names, purely based on the visual width of the letters.

Think about it. A name like “MIIKE” (with two I’s) would be skinner than “MIKEE” (with two E’s), because ‘I’ is a pencil line and ‘E’ is a little brick. I spent hours—embarrassing, glorious hours—assigning widths to letters and crunching the numbers on rosters. I was looking for the Platonic ideal of a chonky name.

And you know what? It was the most fun I’d had with football all year.

I discovered titans of typography. Names like “Bobo” or “Mumu” that sit on the jersey like two friendly, round dumplings. Then there are the speedsters, the names that look like they’re already in motion: “J.J. Watt” (all those vertical lines!) or “Tyreek Hill” (so many I’s and L’s!). My AWANOL metric, for all its absurdity, created a whole new, completely meaningless league of its own.

But as I laughed at my own ridiculousness, something else happened. I started really *seeing* the names. I wasn't just scanning for a player's number or position; I was lingering on the unique collection of characters that represented a person.

I thought about the rookie seeing his name on an official NFL jersey for the first time. That name he’s heard shouted from the stands since peewee league, now stitched into the fabric of the pros. I thought about the veterans with names that have become synonymous with greatness—a “Brady” or a “Donald”—where the letters themselves seem to carry the weight of legacy.

In a sport that is the ultimate testament to physicality—mass, speed, and explosive power—I found a strange comfort in this quiet, whimsical analysis of text. In 2023, we’re so saturated with data. We have metrics for how a quarterback releases the ball, for the exact angle a receiver breaks on a route. It’s all about predictive models and cold, hard facts.

My silly AWANOL project was the opposite. It was un-data. It was a celebration of the human, quirky, and utterly unimportant side of the game. It was
