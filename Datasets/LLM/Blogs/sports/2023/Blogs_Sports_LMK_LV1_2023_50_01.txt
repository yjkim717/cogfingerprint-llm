"My pre-run playlist disaster! I was all set for a 10K in 2023, but when I fired up my Garmin watch, I was greeted with a frustrating message: my downloaded music had expired. No Wi-Fi connection in sight, I was stuck with an eerie silence. I had to jog in awkward quietness, a far cry from my usual energetic runs. Lesson learned: keep that Wi-Fi connection handy or refresh those downloads before a run. Now, I'm back to pounding the pavement with my favorite tunes, and my runs are better for it!"
