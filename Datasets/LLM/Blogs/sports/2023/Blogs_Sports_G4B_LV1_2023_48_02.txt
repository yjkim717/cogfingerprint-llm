**The Ghost of a Combo**

There’s something incredibly frustrating about sports, isn’t there? I was watching a volleyball match last week, and this one *perfect* set, a seemingly impossible sequence of hits, just… fizzled out. It reminded me of that Reddit thread about Ashra’s air combo in Mortal Kombat 1. That little glitch, that missing piece – it’s more than just a game; it’s a reminder of how close we can get, and how maddening it is when something beautiful falls apart.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific sport or adding a particular detail?
