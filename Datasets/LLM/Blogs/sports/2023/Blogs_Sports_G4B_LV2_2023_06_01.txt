**The Disconnect: Why the Cavs' Collapse Stings**

Seriously, was it *really* that bad for the Cavaliers this year? I was stunned watching them fall apart in the playoffs. They had so much talent, Donovan Mitchell was putting up incredible numbers, but something just…broke. It felt like a massive disconnect between their regular season swagger and their sudden inability to perform under pressure. Seeing the Knicks celebrate while Cleveland slumped? It’s a tough one to swallow, isn’t it? #NBA #Cavaliers #Playoffs
