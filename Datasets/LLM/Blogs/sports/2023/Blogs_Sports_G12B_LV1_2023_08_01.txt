>## The Embiid Evolution: More Than Just a Dominant Post Presence

It's been fascinating to watch the Sixers lately, especially with James Harden's departure. Initially, there were questions – who would run the offense? Would Joel Embiid shoulder *too* much? But what we've seen in the last few games has been genuinely impressive. Embiid, always a dominant force in the paint, has really elevated his playmaking. His assist-to-turnover ratio has jumped noticeably. It’s a testament to his growth as a player, proving he's not just a scorer, but a true facilitator. The Pacers series will be a real test, but right now, the Embiid evolution is something to behold.
