There’s something about the rhythm of college basketball season that feels like a familiar conversation—one that picks up right where it left off. As 2023 rolled in, I found myself thinking less about buzzer-beaters and more about the people behind the AP Poll. Week after week, the same voters weigh in, their choices painting a picture not just of teams, but of trust, bias, and consensus.

I started tracking voter consistency, and it struck me how much it mirrors life. Some voters stick to their guns, unwavering in their support or skepticism, like that friend who never changes their mind. Others shift with the wind, swayed by a single stunning upset. It’s human, isn’t it? We all navigate between holding firm and adapting, between individuality and fitting in.

In the end, the poll isn’t just numbers—it’s a story of how we find common ground, even when we see the game differently. And maybe, just maybe, that’s the real magic of the season.
