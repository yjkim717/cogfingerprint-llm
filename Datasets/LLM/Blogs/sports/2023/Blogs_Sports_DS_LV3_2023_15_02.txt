There’s something special about keeping a streak alive—like catching every home game of your favorite team, season after season. In 2023, I made it to all 41, rain or shine. It’s not just about the wins and losses; it’s the shared energy, the familiar faces in the stands, the rituals. That commitment turns fandom into a personal journey, binding you to the team’s story in a way that feels uniquely yours.
