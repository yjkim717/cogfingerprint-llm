There’s something special about Tuesdays in the heart of college football season—it’s that quiet pause before the weekend storm, a moment to reflect on the stories unfolding on the field. For me, it’s Trivia Tuesday, a little tradition I share with friends where we dive into the stats, the surprises, and the sheer drama of the past week. And let me tell you, this season has already carved out memories worth savoring.

Just last weekend, I found myself marveling at the few teams left standing with perfect records—the “perfectos,” as we’ve affectionately dubbed them. There’s an undeniable magic in watching a team navigate week after week without a blemish, each win building momentum like chapters in a thriller you can’t put down. But as any CFB fan knows, perfection is fragile. One off-day, one unlucky bounce, and the dream can dissolve. That tension is part of what makes this sport so beautifully human.

Then there are the standings, neatly divided into Premier and Championship tiers. It’s fascinating to see how teams slot into these groupings—some expected, others defying every preseason prediction. I can’t help but think about how these tiers mirror life in a way: we all have our rungs to climb, our breakthroughs and setbacks. Watching a team fight its way up from the Championship tier, scrapping for every yard and every point, feels like rooting for the underdog in all of us.

In 2023, with so much noise in the world, these Saturday rituals offer a grounding force. They remind me that progress isn’t always linear—a loss can teach as much as a win, and sometimes the most growth happens in the struggle. So here’s to Trivia Tuesday, to the perfectos still dancing, and to every team writing its own story, one game at a time. Because in the end, it’s not just about scores or standings; it’s about the shared heartbeat of fans everywhere, finding connection in the chase.
