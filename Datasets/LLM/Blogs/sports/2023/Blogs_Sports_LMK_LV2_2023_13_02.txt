As I watched the latest NBA playoffs in 2023, I couldn't help but think about the concept of countering a dominant strategy. Just like in Marvel Snap, where new cards are needed to take down powerful discard decks, a team's success can be threatened by an opponent's adjustment. The Boston Celtics' strong defensive game was initially stifling, but opponents adapted and found ways to exploit their weaknesses. It's a reminder that in sports, as in gaming, flexibility and innovation are key to staying ahead of the curve.
