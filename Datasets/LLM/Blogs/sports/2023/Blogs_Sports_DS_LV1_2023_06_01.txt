You just never know with the NBA playoffs, do you? All season, we watched the Cavs dominate. Donovan Mitchell was a superstar, and their record screamed "contender." Then the Knicks showed up. It wasn't just a loss; it was a 4-1 dismantling. Itâ€™s a harsh 2023 reminder that talent and regular season glory mean nothing in May. Heart, hustle, and that gritty New York defense wrote the real story. A painful lesson, but one every true sports fan understands deep down.
