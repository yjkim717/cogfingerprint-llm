"As I watched the 2023 college hockey regionals, I was struck by the varying attendance figures across different locations. It's fascinating to see how some tournaments draw huge crowds, while others struggle to fill the stands. It got me thinking - what's behind these attendance numbers? Is it team loyalty, local interest, or something else? As I pondered this, I realized that the passion for college hockey is still alive and well, even if it's not always visible."
