Of all the places to have a life-altering realization, I didn’t expect it to be on a cracked leather bench in a high school gym that still smelled faintly of sweat and bleach. It was March 2023. I was 34 years old, watching my nephew’s junior varsity basketball team get systematically dismantled. The score was a brutal 58-22, and there were still ten minutes left on the clock. Most of the parents had descended into that special kind of quiet rage or profound embarrassment, but I was transfixed. Not by the carnage, but by the kid at the end of our bench—number 14, Leo.

Leo was, to put it kindly, not a natural athlete. He was all limbs and nervous energy, a step slow on every rotation, his passes more hopeful than precise. Earlier in the season, I’d overheard another parent mutter, “That kid’s a liability.” And by the cold, hard metrics of wins and losses, they were right. But in this particular game, as the deficit ballooned and shoulders slumped all around him, Leo was doing something extraordinary. He was playing as if the scoreboard didn’t exist.

Every single defensive possession, his feet were moving, his hands were up. When he stumbled and fell, he scrambled up so fast he nearly tripped again. On offense, he’d set a screen with the conviction of an NBA center, even if the ball-handler ignored him completely. He wasn’t just going through the motions; he was pouring every ounce of his being into the motions. And the whole time, there was this look on his face—not frustration or despair, but a kind of fierce, determined joy.

Watching him, a memory I hadn’t visited in twenty years slammed into me with the force of a blindside hit. I was 14, on the soccer field. A tournament final. We were down 3-0 at halftime. Our coach, a man named Coach Miller who always smelled of coffee and optimism, gathered us around. He didn’t give a fiery speech. He didn’t draw up a new play. He just asked us one question: “Who are you when you’re losing?”

We stared at our cleats, the grass, anywhere but his face. The silence was heavy with shame.

“Right now, you’re playing like you’ve already lost,” he continued, his voice calm. “The scoreboard says you’re losing the game. But are you going to let it tell you that you’re losers? The game isn’t over. Your effort, your character—that’s yours. No scoreboard can take that from you. So, I’ll ask again. Who are you when you’re losing?”

We lost that game 4-1. But we won the second half 1-0. We played for pride, for each other, for the simple, stubborn refusal to quit. It was one of the most formative experiences of my life, a lesson that faded but never fully disappeared.

Sitting in that gym in 2023, watching Leo, I realized I’d spent a good chunk of my adult life forgetting that lesson. Our world is obsessed with the scoreboard. The promotion. The salary. The number of likes. The square footage of the house. We are constantly, relentlessly measured,
