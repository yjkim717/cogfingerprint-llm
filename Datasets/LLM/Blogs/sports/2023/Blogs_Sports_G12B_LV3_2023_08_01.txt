## The Numbers Game & What We Choose to See

It's fascinating how easily narratives take hold in the sports world, isn't it? I saw a post circulating recently about Joel Embiid's improved assist-to-turnover ratio while James Harden's been out. It's a compelling stat, sure, but the commenter rightly pointed out that cherry-picking data can be misleading. We all do it, subconsciously seeking evidence to support what we already believe. Makes you wonder what other stories weâ€™re missing when we only look at a sliver of the picture.
