## The Quest for the Left-Handed Swing

It’s 2023, and I’m still battling a frustrating truth: finding decent left-handed golf clubs is surprisingly difficult! Living near Montreal, I’m a lefty golfer in a world seemingly built for righties. Lately, I’ve been on a mission to build my set piece by piece, searching for individual clubs online. 

The internet’s become my best friend in this hunt, but finding a dealer who *actually* specializes in left-handed gear – and isn't a huge headache – is proving to be a challenge. My handicap isn't suffering (yet!), but the search definitely adds another layer of complexity to the game. Wish me luck!
