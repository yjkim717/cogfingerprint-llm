**The Crucible Blues**

There’s something about stepping back into a game after a break, right? I felt it recently in Crucible – a sharp dip in my performance. It wasn't the skill of my opponents, honestly, but a weird disconnect. Like my matchmaking was suddenly throwing me into a brawl with seriously upgraded players. 

I spent a frustrating afternoon dissecting losses, wondering if those recent MM tweaks were to blame. It’s a familiar feeling – that yearning to feel like you’re competing fairly.  It reminded me that even the best athletes sometimes need a recalibration, a little adjustment to find their rhythm again.

Would you like me to tweak this draft or create a different version?
