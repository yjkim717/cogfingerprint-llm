"As I planned my Redwoods trip in 2023, a friend asked if I'd pack Rainier beer for the journey. But I was curious - is it available in Eureka or Arcata? Discovering local brews became a fun adventure. Just like how a good pre-game warm-up sets the tone for a winning game, stumbling upon Rainier in the area got me pumped for the trip. It was a small win that added to the excitement."
