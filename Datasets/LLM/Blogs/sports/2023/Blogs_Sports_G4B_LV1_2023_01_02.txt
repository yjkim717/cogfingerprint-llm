**The Ghost of a Win**

Anyone else ever feel like you *almost* won, but didn't quite grasp the victory? Last weekend’s hockey game felt like that. We dominated the third period, outshot them, and had a clear path to the net. But a last-second penalty wiped out a potential game-winner. 

It’s frustrating, right? Like in *The Order*, beating a ridiculously tough boss – Dagan Gera, maybe – without triggering that XP yellow beam… does it *really* count?  Maybe the satisfaction isn’t in the points, but in the sheer grit of pushing through the challenge.  Sometimes, the closest call is the sweetest memory.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a blog post on a completely different topic?
