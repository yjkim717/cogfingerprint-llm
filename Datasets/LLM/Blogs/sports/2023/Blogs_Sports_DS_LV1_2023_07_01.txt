I used to love pickup basketball at the community court, but this year has been a grind. The new "skill-based" team matching feels completely broken. I’m either carrying a team that’s just learning or getting stomped by a squad that plays like pros. It’s turned my favorite escape into a source of pure frustration. The joy of the game is getting lost in the chase for a decent win ratio. Maybe it’s time to just shoot hoops by myself for a while.
