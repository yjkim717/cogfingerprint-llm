## The Ghosts of Touchdowns Past: Remembering College Football Greats

It's late October, and the college football season is really hitting its stride. Every Saturday feels like a mini-holiday, doesn't it? I was diving into some CFP stats the other day – totally nerdy, I know – but it got me thinking about all the incredible quarterbacks who've graced the gridiron. Specifically, those touchdown-slinging legends.

Looking at the numbers, names like Stetson Bennett, Joe Burrow, and Trevor Lawrence jumped out. It’s wild to see how those career touchdown totals stack up. Bennett, after his incredible run at Georgia, solidified himself amongst the elite. Burrow's 2019 season still feels like a fever dream, doesn’t it? And Lawrence... well, he was *the* guy for so long, and his impact is undeniable.

It’s funny, though. Numbers tell a story, but they don't capture the feeling. I remember watching Burrow lead LSU on those improbable drives, practically willing them to victory. Or the sheer, effortless power of Lawrence’s throws.  Those moments stick with you way more than any statistic. 

Maybe that's why I love college football so much. It's not just about the wins and losses. It’s about the players, the rivalries, and the memories we make watching them chase those touchdowns – and sometimes, just sometimes, catching them.  Who are *your* all-time favorite college football touchdown leaders, and what do you remember most about their games? Let me know in the comments!
