Okay, here’s a blog post inspired by the pizza oven summary, followed by a reflective sports-related piece:

**Pizza Dreams & Patio Plans**

Okay, so I’ve been completely consumed lately – in the best way possible – by a ridiculously exciting project. I’m building a pizza oven! Seriously, it’s taking over my weekends. I’m aiming for a proper brick oven, nestled right onto a patio made of flagstone. The whole thing feels a little daunting, but incredibly rewarding. 

I’m scouring the internet for the right materials – especially Melbourne fire brick – and trying to figure out the best tools. Honestly, finding a decent pizza peel is proving to be a surprisingly complex quest! It’s a slow process, full of research and a healthy dose of YouTube tutorials. I’m picturing late summer evenings, firing up this oven, and sharing incredible pizzas with friends.  It’s a little slice of happiness in the making!

**The Quiet Game of Remembering**

It’s weird, isn't it? How a single game can suddenly trigger a flood of memories? Last week, watching a replay of my high school basketball team’s regional finals loss – a truly heartbreaking one – I wasn’t just remembering the score. I was suddenly back on that court, feeling the pressure, the adrenaline, the crushing disappointment. 

This year, more than ever, I’ve been trying to actively *remember* the little things. Not just the big wins, but the practices, the camaraderie, the feeling of pushing myself to the limit. Sports teach you so much about resilience, about teamwork, and about accepting that sometimes, you just don’t win. It’s a valuable lesson, and one I’m trying to carry with me beyond the field.
