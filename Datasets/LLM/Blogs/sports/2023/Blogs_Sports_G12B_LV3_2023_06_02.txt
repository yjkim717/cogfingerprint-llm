## What If? The Beauty of "Almost" in NBA History

Remember that Reddit thread floating around about NBA championship teams and how a few tweaks – a healthy Kawhi, a different injury – could have changed everything? It got me thinking. We celebrate dynasties like the Milwaukee Bucks of recent years, or the Golden State Warriors’ run, but the sport is *so* fragile. 

One key injury, a lucky bounce, a different defensive scheme… and history pivots. It’s a humbling thought, isn't it? It reminds you that even the greatest teams operate on the edge of possibility. The Toronto Raptors’ 2019 victory feels even sweeter knowing how close things could've been. Makes you appreciate every win, right?
