As I watched the soccer coach motivate his team during the 2023 championship, it struck me that effective people management isn't limited to the corporate world. A good coach knows when to push their players and when to offer a supportive word. Empathy is key to understanding each player's strengths and weaknesses. Just as a manager should assess a candidate's emotional intelligence during an interview, a coach evaluates their players' mental toughness. A leadership style that balances technical guidance with emotional support can make all the difference between winning and losing, both on and off the field.
