There’s something quietly compelling about watching the AP Poll each week in college basketball—it’s not just about who’s climbing or falling, but how we, as a community of fans and voters, find our way toward consensus. I’ve always been fascinated by the outliers: those voters who stick with a team long after others have moved on, or who see potential where the majority sees a fluke.

In 2023, as the season unfolded, I found myself thinking about what that consistency—or lack of it—says about us. Are the outliers stubborn, or are they the ones truly paying attention? It’s a lot like life, isn’t it? Sometimes you hold onto a belief because it feels right, even when the world disagrees. Other times, you fold into the crowd for the sake of harmony.

Tracking voter trends became my winter ritual, a small window into how individual conviction and collective opinion shape the story of the game. And in those shifting numbers, I saw a little bit of all of us—trying to find our place between standing out and fitting in.
