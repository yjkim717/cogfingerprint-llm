**Seriously, 2023 Was *Something* Special**

Remember last year? College football felt… different. Not in a bad way, but undeniably electric. I’ve been going back and looking at the stats, and honestly, I’m still buzzing about the 2023 season. It’s not just about the wins – though there were plenty – it’s about *how* those wins were achieved.

The Power 5 conferences absolutely dominated, boasting the highest average record and win percentage we’ve seen in the College Football Playoff era. It’s a testament to the incredible talent and dedication of these athletes and coaches.  

I kept thinking about how closely this season mirrored the unusual 2020 season during the pandemic.  That feeling of unprecedented competition and almost unbelievable success – it’s back!  Seeing undefeated teams rise to the top and witnessing teams push each other to new heights was truly remarkable. 

It makes you appreciate the passion and intensity of college football, doesn’t it?  What were your favorite moments from 2023?
