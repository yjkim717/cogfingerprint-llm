After a ton of research, I kept coming back to one solution for our brutal winters: closed-cell spray foam. The R-value is unbeatable, and it seals every crack. This DIY project felt daunting, but the promise of a warm, energy-efficient home was too compelling to ignore. Wish me luckâ€”this weekend, I'm suiting up and transforming that attic.
