You know that feeling when your favorite team trades away a veteran player who’s been the heart of the squad for years? That’s what hit me today, hearing Lantern—the go-to cannabis delivery service here in Massachusetts—is shutting down.

It’s like watching a reliable point guard who always made the clutch plays suddenly get benched by a confusing rule change. You’re left wondering if the game itself is broken. In 2023, we’re still grappling with these regulatory hurdles that stifle growth and access, much like how outdated coaching can hold back raw talent.

It makes you reflect: real progress isn’t just about scoring points; it’s about changing the rules so everyone can play the game fairly.
