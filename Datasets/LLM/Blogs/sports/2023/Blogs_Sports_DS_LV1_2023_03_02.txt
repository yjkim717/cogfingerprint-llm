There’s something about walking into the Superdome on game day—the hum of the crowd, the sea of black and gold, the smell of turf and anticipation. I remember last season’s clash with the Bucs, that familiar red and pewter glaring back from the opposite sideline. It was more than just Week 4; it felt like a turning point.

Kickoff neared, and I thought about how we follow these rituals: checking the broadcast map so no one misses a play, dissecting uniform colors like they hold some secret power. In 2023, with so much noise in the world, these Sunday threads still tie us together, a shared story unfolding in real time.
