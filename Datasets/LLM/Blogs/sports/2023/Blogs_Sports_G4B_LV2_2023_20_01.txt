**The Scoreboard Silence**

Anyone else ever feel a little lost when a competition ends without a clear, visible score? I was thinking about it the other day after watching a JMR marble run event – seriously impressive builds, everyone was so creative! But there was no big scoreboard, just…event tracking. It felt a little strange. 

It reminded me of baseball, where you *need* that constant update, that feeling of the game unfolding.  A total score would have added so much excitement to the JMR event. Maybe next year, teams like the JMR ones can push for a little scoreboard magic! What do you think?
