We found a candidate who aced the technical screen. Their code was clean, their architecture sound. But as we talked about leading the team, I kept waiting for the spark—that moment of genuine connection, the empathetic insight into what makes a developer tick. The resume shouts "technologist," but the role demands a "people manager." Can we teach someone to care, or is that the one skill you can't screen for? The hardest part of this hire isn't assessing their skills, but their heart.

Here is a reflective blog post about sports, set in 2023.

The roar of the 2023 Women’s World Cup wasn't just about goals; it was a seismic shift.

Now, it’s a deafening reality for millions of girls. That’s the power of sport—it doesn’t just create heroes; it rewrites the entire story, showing you what’s possible. The real victory wasn't lifting a trophy, but shattering a ceiling.
