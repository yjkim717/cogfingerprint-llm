## The Weight of a Missed Ascent

Man, this year’s climbing season has been brutal. I spent weeks training for 'The Serpent's Spine,' a notoriously tricky route, and yesterday… I choked. Got so close to the final crux, felt the ascent within reach, then slipped. It wasn’t a gear failure, just a moment of hesitation. It’s rough, questioning if I’ve lost a step, if the route has somehow become *harder*. Gotta shake it off, I guess. Back to the wall.
