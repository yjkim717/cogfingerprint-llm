## The Weight of Expectation: Remembering Those Who Truly Had It All

It's easy to get caught up in the modern NFL – the highlight reels, the endless analysis. But sometimes, I find myself thinking about the greats who truly dominated, the guys who didn't just win, but *defined* an era. Johnny Unitas, Steve Young… names that instantly conjure images of clutch performances and championship glory. 

Young’s journey, starting as a backup, is particularly striking. It reminds you that even the most destined stars often face unexpected hurdles. To win both an MVP and a Super Bowl? That's a level of sustained excellence that feels almost mythical in today's game. It makes you wonder, who's next to achieve that kind of legendary status?
