## The Ghost of My Childhood Baseball Card Collection

It’s funny the things that resurface, isn't it? I was clearing out the attic this weekend, dodging dust bunnies and cobwebs, and stumbled across a shoebox overflowing with baseball cards. My heart did a little leap. 

Suddenly, I was ten years old again, meticulously organizing my collection, dreaming of owning a holographic Ken Griffey Jr. (spoiler alert: I never did). Each card wasn’t just cardboard; it was a tiny portal to a moment, a player's potential, a shared experience with my dad who patiently showed me how to spot a printing error.

We don't really do that anymore, do we? Kids are all about the digital highlights, the instant replays. And that's okay, progress is progress. But holding that worn-out Nolan Ryan card, smelling that faint, nostalgic scent of old paper… it sparked a longing for a slower, more tangible connection to the games we love. 

It made me realize how much of sports fandom is about *memory* – the feeling of being there, the shared anticipation. Maybe that’s something we need to rediscover, beyond the streaming and the stats. Maybe it's just me, getting sentimental in a digital age. But for a few minutes, I was transported back, and it felt pretty good.
