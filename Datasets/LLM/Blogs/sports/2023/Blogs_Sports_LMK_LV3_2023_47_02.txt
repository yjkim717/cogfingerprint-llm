"Dominating the Paint: Breaking Down Post Play Mental Blocks"

As a 6'4" recreational basketball player, I've often found myself struggling to assert myself in the post. Despite having the physical tools, I've let mental toughness hold me back from truly dominating the paint. In 2023, I've come to realize that it's not just about being physically strong, but also about being mentally resilient. To overcome this, I've been working on developing a more assertive mindset, focusing on defensive strategies to anticipate my opponents' moves, and visualizing success in the post. By doing so, I've started to build my confidence and break down the mental blocks that were holding me back. It's a journey, but with persistence and the right mindset, I'm learning to be a more formidable opponent on the court. With every game, I'm becoming more unstoppable in the post.
