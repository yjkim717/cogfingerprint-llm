**Pacific Dreams & Pilsners**

This summer, I’m seriously plotting a road trip – Redwoods first, then hopefully a detour to Mount Rainier.  I’m picturing myself dwarfed by those ancient trees, and then, a little reward: a cold Rainier in Eureka or Arcata. It feels…right.  

Honestly, it’s not just about the beer (though that’s a big part!). It's about the feeling of hitting the open road, a little bit lost and completely free.  It reminds me of those high school basketball games – the rush of the court, the team, the unexpected win.  Simple, powerful moments.
