The final buzzer of my last high school basketball game in 2023 didn’t just signal a loss; it felt like the end of a world. For weeks, I was adrift, my identity so tangled up in the squeak of sneakers and the roar of the crowd. But then, my old coach called. He didn’t ask me to re-live the game. He asked me to help coach the middle school team. Standing on the sideline, watching a scrawny kid nail her first three-pointer, I felt it again—that pure, uncomplicated joy. The game hadn’t ended for me; it had just passed me the ball in a different way.
