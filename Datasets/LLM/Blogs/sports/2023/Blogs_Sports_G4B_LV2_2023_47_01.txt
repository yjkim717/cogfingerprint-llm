**The Ghosts of the Box Out**

There’s a feeling, right? That sinking feeling when you’re battling for a rebound, and suddenly you’re tangled with someone smaller, quicker, and just… *better* at positioning. It happened to me a lot this season, mostly against those speedy little guards. 

I started questioning everything. My footwork? My angle? Was I just mentally shrinking under pressure?  I’d get so frustrated with myself, agonizing over where I *should* have been – the “post position,” they call it – but it felt like I was always a step behind. 

It wasn’t just about the rebounds, though. It was about respecting the game, trusting my technique, and not letting nerves dictate my play.  I realized I was letting the ghosts of missed opportunities haunt me.  It's a constant battle, really, to stay present and confident, even when the odds feel stacked against you.  Anyone else ever wrestled with that feeling?
