The whistle blows, and the stadium erupts. But in 2023, the roar isn’t just from the fans in the stands—it’s from the millions watching from home, part of a new hybrid experience of fandom. It reminds me of the recent buzz around PwC’s RTO news, urging hybrid employees to find a balance between office and home.

In sports, we’re seeing our own version of this shift. Athletes train in personalized, virtual environments, analyzing data from home one day and pushing limits with teammates the next. It’s not about choosing one over the other; it’s about blending both to perform at our peak. I think of my own journey, juggling solo drills and team practices, feeling the frustration when the balance feels off, much like the questions left unanswered in corporate announcements.

But here’s the clarity: whether on the field or in the office, success comes from flexibility and listening to what we need individually. Let’s embrace this new playbook, where every role, virtual or hybrid, has its place in the game.
