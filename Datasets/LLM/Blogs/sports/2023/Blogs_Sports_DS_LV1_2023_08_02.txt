Watching the Bucks and Pistons last night took me back to my own high school games. Seeing Khris Middleton’s veteran poise and Jaden Ivey’s explosive energy in that 126-116 finish was a perfect snapshot of 2023 basketball—a blend of experience and fearless youth. It’s a reminder that every box score tells a story beyond the numbers: the quiet leadership, the raw hustle. Makes you appreciate the journey in every player’s stats, not just the final score.
