**Chasing Light & Miles: My New Photo Friday Habit**

Okay, confession time: I’ve been feeling a little disconnected lately. Life’s just…busy. But I stumbled upon this amazing running subreddit – and they’ve started a weekly “Photo Friday” thing! It’s brilliant. 

It’s sparked something in me. I’ve always loved capturing moments on my runs, but I rarely share them. This week, I finally took a proper photo of myself conquering a particularly challenging running route – mud, hills, the whole nine yards! – and posted it. 

Honestly, seeing other runners’ photos, their struggles and triumphs, it’s incredibly motivating. It’s a little reminder that we’re all in this together, chasing that feeling of freedom and pushing our limits.  Maybe Photo Friday will be my little dose of running community in 2023. Would you join in?
