"Rebounding Ruminations: My Struggle is Real. 
As I stepped onto the court in 2023, I thought my 6'4" frame would give me an edge in the paint. But, time and again, I found myself outplayed by stockier opponents who seemed to have a knack for securing rebounds. The problem? My post positioning and box outs were lacking. I'd get caught out of position, and before I knew it, my opponents would snatch the ball away. I realized that being tall isn't everything - it's how you use your body that matters. I've been working on my defensive techniques, focusing on making contact and using my feet to secure better positioning. It's not easy, but I'm determined to become a rebounding force. With practice and persistence, I'm confident I'll be able to outmuscle my opponents and come out on top. My journey to rebounding dominance has just begun."
