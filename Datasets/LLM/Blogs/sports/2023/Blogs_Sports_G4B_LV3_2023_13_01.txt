**The Unsung Plays: When Talent Feels Like It’s Just…Missing**

There’s something incredibly frustrating about watching a player who *should* be dominating, but just isn’t. I’ve been wrestling with this feeling lately, watching our local soccer team. Our striker, Liam, is technically brilliant – the passes are crisp, the shots are powerful – but he seems hesitant, lacking that killer instinct. 

It’s a bit like Aero in Marvel Snap, really. She’s got this amazing ability to shift the entire board, a real strategic advantage. But it feels…underutilized, like it’s not quite delivering the impact we’d expect. 

We all crave that feeling of seeing a player truly *shine*, of witnessing raw talent fully realized. Sometimes, though, it’s not about innate skill alone. It’s about confidence, about finding the right environment, about that little ‘buff’ that unlocks potential.
