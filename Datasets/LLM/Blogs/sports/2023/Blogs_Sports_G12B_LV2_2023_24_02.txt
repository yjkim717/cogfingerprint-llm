## The Frustrating Dance of Lag and Compression (and Why I’m Still Out There)

Anyone else feel like golf sometimes laughs *at* you? I've been obsessively working on my lag putting and trying to dial in that satisfying compression on my shots, and let me tell you, it’s been a journey. A frustrating, sometimes-makes-me-want-to-throw-my-wedge-in-the-pond journey.

I've been trying to self-teach, watching countless videos, mimicking drills... but something just isn't clicking. I *feel* like I’m getting the club head to trail properly, but the results? Let's just say they're inconsistent. 

It's a humbling reminder that even with all the information at our fingertips in 2023, sometimes you just need a fresh pair of eyes. Or maybe just a whole lot more practice. Either way, I'm back on the range, chasing that feeling of perfectly-struck compression. Wish me luck – and tell me, what’s your biggest golf struggle right now?
