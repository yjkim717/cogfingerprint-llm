**The Shot That Felt Like a Miss**

You know those games where you *almost* had it? Last season, watching my local basketball team, we were down by one with seconds left. Our star player, Liam, got the ball – a clean look at a three-pointer. He launched it… and it clanked off the rim. 

It wasn't just the miss that stung. It was the feeling of wasted potential, like Aero in Marvel Snap – a cool ability that just doesn't *quite* deliver the punch it should.  Sometimes, even in victory, you feel like you haven't truly fought. 

That shot against the rim reminded me that sports aren't just about the final score. It's about the effort, the moments where you’re close, and the frustrating realization that sometimes, despite your best shot, things don’t quite go your way.  It's about learning from those near misses and coming back stronger.
