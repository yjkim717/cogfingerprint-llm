As the 2023 college basketball season tips off, the AP Poll is once again front and center. Have you ever stopped to think about the voters behind these rankings? What makes one voter tick one way, while another sees the same team entirely differently? I dug into the preseason AP Poll to analyze voter consistency and what it reveals about their ranking styles. The results were fascinating - some voters showed remarkable consistency, while others were outliers. It got me thinking: what drives these differences? Is it a matter of personal bias, or are there legitimate disagreements about team strength? As I pored over the data, I began to appreciate the complexity of the AP Poll. It's not just about ranking teams; it's about understanding the people behind the rankings. By examining voter consistency, we can gain a deeper understanding of the AP Poll and the intricacies of college basketball.
