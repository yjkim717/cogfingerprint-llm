**Saturday Night in the Big 12 – It’s Wild Out There**

Seriously, college basketball this year is a rollercoaster. I spent most of Saturday glued to the Big 12 scores, and let me tell you, it was a doozy! There were some real shocks – teams we thought were locks suddenly facing elimination. 

It’s that nail-biting feeling of the regular season title race, isn’t it?  Every game feels huge, and you’re constantly checking the conference standings. Makes you appreciate the unpredictable beauty of it all, right?  What were *your* Saturday night highlights?
