Stepping back onto the court after a holiday break felt like coming home. But my first few games were a shock—my usual rhythm was gone, replaced by clumsy losses. I heard they tweaked the matchmaking, pairing me with tougher opponents based on my lifetime stats. It’s 2023, and the game I thought I knew has changed. That flawless victory feels further away, forcing me to adapt, not just rely on old glory.
