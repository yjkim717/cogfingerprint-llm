I'm still reeling from the latest Marvel Snap updates - it's 2023 and the meta is more competitive than ever. As I was building my Conquest decks, I couldn't help but think that Aero is getting left behind. Her card ability is solid, but compared to other cards, it feels like she's stuck in neutral. I mean, have you seen the power buffs some of the other cards have received? It's like they're flying high while Aero is stuck on the ground. In a game where strategy is key, Aero's ability to disrupt opponents is invaluable. But with the current power dynamics, she's often an afterthought. I firmly believe that Aero deserves a power buff to bring her up to speed. It's time for the developers to take a closer look at this underdog card and give her the boost she needs to shine in the competitive scene.
