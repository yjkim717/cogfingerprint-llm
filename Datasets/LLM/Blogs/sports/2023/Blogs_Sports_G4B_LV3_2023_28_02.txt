**The Frustrating Flip of the Switch**

There’s something uniquely maddening about collecting, isn't there? I was knee-deep in updating my sports card listings this year – prepping for the big show – when I hit a snag. A new platform update demanded a ‘Card Condition’ field, and suddenly, the ‘Ungraded’ option vanished from my multi-variations. 

It felt like a tiny roadblock, but it highlighted a bigger issue: how we value authenticity.  Do we prioritize a professional grade, or the honest reflection of a card’s journey? It’s a reminder that sometimes, the most interesting stories are found *before* the experts get involved.
