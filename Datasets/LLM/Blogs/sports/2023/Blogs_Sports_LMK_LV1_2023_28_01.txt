As I laced up my running shoes this morning, I couldn't help but think about the frustration I felt last night when Amazon Music Unlimited froze on my workout playlist - again! Pauses, hangs, and an inability to modify playlists mid-stream made for a disjointed experience. It's 2023 and I'd expect more from a leading streaming service. Just like a runner hits a wall, Amazon Music seems to be hitting a snag. Here's hoping they get back on track soon, so I can get back to my flow.
