## Back From the Break, Back to the Grind (and the Losses?)

Okay, so I'm back from a much-needed vacation – sunshine, relaxation, the works. But stepping back into Crucible's Trials? Not quite the triumphant return I’d hoped for. Suddenly, it feels like I'm facing a *crucible* of constant losses. Seriously, what’s going on?

I’m starting to suspect some recent matchmaking (MM) tweaks. It feels like I'm consistently getting thrown into matches where the skill disparity is… significant. Is anyone else noticing this? It’s disheartening when you’re just trying to enjoy a competitive mode and feel like the system is working against you. Hoping for a *flawless* experience again soon, but right now, these *trials* feel a little rough. Anyone else feeling the matchmaking frustration?
