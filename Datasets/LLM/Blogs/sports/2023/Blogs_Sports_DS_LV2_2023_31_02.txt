That final buzzer in 2023’s championship game still echoes. We were down by two, and I took the last shot. It felt perfect leaving my hands, a storybook ending. But it rimmed out.

At first, the “what ifs” were deafening. Now, I see it differently. That miss didn’t define our season; our relentless hustle to get there did. It taught me that sometimes the most profound growth comes not from the victory, but from the grace you find in a near-miss. The loss carved a better competitor out of me.
