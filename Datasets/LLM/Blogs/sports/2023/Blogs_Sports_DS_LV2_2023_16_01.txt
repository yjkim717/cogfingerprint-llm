### The Real Scoreboard Isn't on the Screen

You know that feeling, right? When the clock is ticking down, your heart is doing a drum solo against your ribs, and the entire outcome hinges on one single play. For me, this past Tuesday, that play wasn’t a Hail Mary pass into the endzone. It was me, frantically Googling “Which college football team is known as the Thundering Herd?” while the seconds evaporated in our weekly Trivia Tuesday contest.

I’ve always loved sports for the big moments—the last-second shots, the walk-off homers. But this year, I’ve found a strange, profound comfort in our little online trivia league. It’s a silly thing, really. Five questions. A “speed bonus” for the quickest correct answer. A “Premier Tier” ranking that I discuss with my friends with a seriousness usually reserved for playoff predictions.

Yet, in a sports landscape in 2023 that feels increasingly dominated by transfer portals, NIL deals, and conference realignment, our trivia group has become an anchor. It’s a pure, unadulterated celebration of the game’s history and its wonderfully obscure details. There are no billion-dollar TV contracts here, just the shared, slightly competitive groan when someone aces the speed bonus on a question about 1980s punters.

It’s made me realize that fandom isn’t just a one-way street from the couch to the stadium. It’s also the connections we forge in the spaces between the games. It’s the text chain that lights up every Tuesday, full of friendly taunts and commiserations over a missed question. That team ranking we track so diligently isn’t about glory; it’s a measure of our collective memory, a testament to the fact that we’ve all been paying attention, together, for years.

So, while I’ll still be glued to the screen on Saturday for the big game, part of me is already looking forward to next Tuesday. Because sometimes, the most meaningful victory isn’t about who wins the national championship, but about finally remembering that Marshall is, in fact, the Thundering Herd—and having a group of friends who care just as much as you do.
