Hugely, I’ve been rediscovering the magic of seeing films on the big screen – specifically, anything by M. Night Shyamalan or Denis Villeneuve. It’s sparked something in me, a desire to actively *experience* art, not just passively consume it. It got me thinking about sports, too. Remember the thrill of being in the stadium, the collective roar? Maybe it’s time to trade streaming for live games more often. There's a certain energy you just can’t replicate.
