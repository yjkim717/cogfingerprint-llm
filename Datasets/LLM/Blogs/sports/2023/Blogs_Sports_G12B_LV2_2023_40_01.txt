## Green Shoes and a Whole Lot of Heart: My St. Patrick's Day 5K Journey

Okay, let's be real. I’m not a *professional* runner. I’m the kind who still gets winded walking up a flight of stairs sometimes. But there's something about the energy of a St. Patrick's Day 5K that just pulls me in every year. This year, 2023, was no different. And this year, I had a goal. A slightly terrifying, maybe-a-little-ambitious goal: break 30 minutes.

For those not in the know, a 5K is 3.1 miles. Sounds short, right? Wrong. When you're staring down those last half-mile markers, it feels like a marathon. But this year, I was determined to push myself.

The training started, as it always does, with good intentions and a slightly panicked look in the mirror. I downloaded a 5K training plan (because adulting, obviously) and tried to stick to it. There were mornings where the alarm felt like a personal betrayal, and my legs felt like lead. There were evenings where the couch and Netflix were *way* more appealing than pounding the pavement. But I kept showing up. Slowly, steadily, I felt a difference. My breathing felt a little less ragged. My pace, though still far from blistering, was improving.

Race day dawned crisp and bright. The air was thick with the smell of coffee, nervous energy, and…was that green glitter? Yep, definitely green glitter. The atmosphere was electric. Hundreds of runners, decked out in their best green attire, were milling around, stretching, and chatting. It’s a genuinely fun, supportive vibe.

My strategy was simple: start conservatively, negative split (meaning run the second half faster than the first), and *don't* let the leprechauns distract me. The first mile felt surprisingly good. I kept reminding myself to breathe, to relax my shoulders, to focus on my form. Mile two was…a little tougher. The cheering crowds were amazing, but my legs were starting to burn.

Then came that final, brutal half mile. My lungs were screaming, my quads were protesting, and the finish line seemed impossibly far away. But I dug deep. I thought about all those early morning runs, all the times I almost skipped a workout. I focused on putting one foot in front of the other.

And then…I crossed the finish line.

I didn’t break 30 minutes. Not this year. I clocked in at 30:17.  A personal best, yes! And honestly, a victory in itself. It wasn't the time I’d hoped for, but the feeling of accomplishment, of pushing myself and giving it everything I had, was incredible. It's a reminder that progress isn't always linear, and sometimes, just finishing is the biggest win of all.  Plus, I got a green medal. Can’t complain about that.

Until next
