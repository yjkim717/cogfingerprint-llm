As I laced up my running shoes to hit the trails in 2023, my Amazon Music Unlimited playlist refused to cooperate. Tracks paused, songs skipped, and I couldn't edit my playlist - it was a frustrating start to my morning jog. Just like a faulty sports equipment can throw off an athlete's game, app issues can disrupt a fitness routine. I hope Amazon irons out these streaming problems soon, so I can get back to focusing on my personal best times, not troubleshooting playback errors.
