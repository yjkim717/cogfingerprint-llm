## The Fronting Problem and My Basketball Brain

Okay, let's be real. I love playing basketball. I really do. But there's this *thing* that consistently throws me off – getting fronted in the post. At 6'4", I’m not exactly dominating the paint, and facing a defender who's aggressively positioning themselves between me and the basket? It rattles me.

It's not just about the physical challenge, it's the mental one. Suddenly, I second-guess my moves, hesitate, and lose that assertive edge I usually try to bring to the game. It’s a frustrating cycle. This year, I’m really focusing on building that mental toughness. Recognizing that fronting is a strategy, not a personal attack, and responding with quick passes and smart cuts. It’s a work in progress, but knowing I *can* overcome it feels pretty good.
