It’s 2023, and I’m deep into my Football Manager 22 save, piecing together a squad for future seasons. But there’s one headache I can’t shake: tracking those tricky transfer fees. I wish the clauses tab showed my net charges clearly, like salary commitments do. Instead, I’m scribbling notes, trying to calculate what I’ll actually owe down the line. It’s a small detail, but it pulls me out of the immersion. Wouldn’t it be nice to focus on tactics instead of math? Fellow managers, you get it—sometimes the game’s deepest challenge isn’t on the pitch, but in the spreadsheets.
