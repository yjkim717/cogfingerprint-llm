**The Unspoken Playbook**

You know those moments in a game where everything seems to slow down? Like when a runner glances at the catcher, or a defender anticipates a pass? That’s what interviewing feels like sometimes. I was watching my son’s little league game last weekend – a nail-biter – and realized how much the coach relied on reading the *players*, not just their stats. He’d notice a slump, a quiet frustration, and adjust his approach. 

It made me think about hiring.  Finding an empathetic people manager isn't just about skills; it’s about that ability to truly *see* someone, like a good coach sees their team. It’s about recognizing the unspoken playbook – the needs and feelings beneath the surface.

Do you want me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
