**The Elites of College Football: A Look Back at the Best of the Best**

As we dive into the 2023 college football season, it's hard not to get caught up in the excitement of new teams rising to the top and familiar powerhouses continuing to dominate. But have you ever stopped to think about the teams that have consistently performed at an elite level over the years? I mean, the ones that just can't seem to stop winning?

I recently stumbled upon some fascinating statistics that shed light on the college football teams with the highest percentage of top-notch seasons. We're talking about teams that have achieved 99+, 95+, 90+, and 75+ ratings over the years. And let me tell you, the results are pretty eye-opening.

At the top of the list are some of the biggest names in college football. Teams like Alabama, USC, and Ohio State have long been synonymous with excellence on the gridiron. But what's truly impressive is just how consistently they've performed at an elite level. These aren't teams that just had one or two great seasons – they're programs that have sustained a level of excellence over decades.

What's the secret to their success? Is it their recruiting prowess? Coaching acumen? Or something more intangible? Whatever it is, it's clear that these teams have a certain je ne sais quoi that sets them apart from the rest.

As we watch the 2023 season unfold, it's fun to speculate about which teams will join the ranks of these all-time greats. Will a newcomer like Clemson or Georgia finally dethrone the incumbents? Or will the usual suspects continue to dominate?

One thing's for sure – the 2023 college football season is shaping up to be a thrilling ride. And as we cheer on our favorite teams, let's take a moment to appreciate the rich history and tradition of excellence that defines this great sport.
