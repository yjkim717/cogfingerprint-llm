## Did the Thunder Roll a Little *Too* Loudly?

Okay, NBA fans, let's talk about that Thunder-Nuggets trade. I saw a post on Reddit that really stuck with me. The Thunder gave up some serious future draft picks (FRPs!) for a protected pick – and it got me thinking. Was it worth it? 

Look, I love what Sam Presti is building in OKC. But sometimes, you gotta wonder if you left a little something on the table. Could they have squeezed out a standard rookie pick or even some cash considerations? It’s easy to second-guess, especially in 2023 when draft capital feels like gold. Just hoping they didn't give up too much thunder for a single roll of the dice.
