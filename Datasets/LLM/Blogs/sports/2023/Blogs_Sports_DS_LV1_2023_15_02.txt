There’s something special about a winning streak—the momentum, the belief, the magic. In 2023, our local high school basketball team strung together 14 straight victories. I watched every game, caught up in the collective hope. Then came the playoff loss. The silence in the gym was heavy, but as the players hugged, I saw it wasn’t about the streak ending. It was about the fight, the unity, the memories forged. Sometimes the most meaningful victories aren’t the ones on the scoreboard.
