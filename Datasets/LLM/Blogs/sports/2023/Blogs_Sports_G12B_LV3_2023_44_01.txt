## The Unexpected Turnover: Business Lessons from the Cannabis Industry

It's wild how life throws curveballs, isn't it? Just like a sudden fumble in the fourth quarter can change the whole game, unexpected financial situations can impact even thriving businesses. I was reading about Cresco Labs, a cannabis company, recently filing a lawsuit against two Massachusetts dispensaries, Terps – Attleboro and Wellfleet, over unpaid bills. 

It's a stark reminder that even in a booming industry, things aren't always smooth sailing. This situation, with those $88,662 in outstanding payments, really highlights the importance of strong contracts and consistent financial oversight. It's a tough lesson, but a necessary one for anyone building something – whether it’s a sports team or a business. You gotta stay vigilant!
