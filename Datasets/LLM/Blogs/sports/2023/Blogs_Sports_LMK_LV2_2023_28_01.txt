As I laced up my running shoes this morning, I couldn't help but think of the countless hours I spent perfecting my stride on the track back in high school. Fast forward to 2023, and I'm still chasing that same rush. But now, it's not just about personal bests - it's about finding joy in the journey. Whether I'm pounding the pavement or streaming my favorite tunes on Amazon Music Unlimited (when it's working, that is!), exercise is my therapy. So, here's to embracing the ups and downs, both on and off the track.
