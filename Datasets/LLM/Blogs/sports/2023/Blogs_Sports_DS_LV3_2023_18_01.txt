The first time I picked up a tennis racket in 2023, I felt a familiar pang of doubt. Could I, a complete novice, really build a skill from the ground up? It reminded me of my friend, a beginner woodworker, debating if he should tackle a shed as his first project or start with a simple birdhouse. I chose the "birdhouse" of tennisâ€”just hitting against a backboard. It wasn't glamorous, but every successful return was a small victory. That foundational patience, whether in DIY construction or sports, is everything. Starting small builds the confidence for the bigger builds to come.
