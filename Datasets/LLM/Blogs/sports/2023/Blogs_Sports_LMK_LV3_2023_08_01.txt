As I watched Joel Embiid take the court without James Harden by his side, I was struck by his newfound playmaking prowess. The stats told the story: Embiid's assist numbers were up, while turnovers were down. It's clear he's risen to the challenge, orchestrating the offense with ease. This season, Embiid's growth as a facilitator has been a joy to behold, and I'm excited to see how he'll continue to evolve as a leader on the court in 2023.
