Another playoff run cut short. Watching our Cavs fall to the Knicks was a gut punch. We had the talent, we had Donovan Mitchell, yet it all crumbled. It’s that familiar sting of failure, leaving us wondering what went wrong. It’s more than a loss; it’s a feeling that lingers, forcing us to question the heart of this team we love so much.
