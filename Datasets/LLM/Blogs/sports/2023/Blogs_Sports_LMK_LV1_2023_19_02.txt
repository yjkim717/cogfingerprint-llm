As I stepped into the shower, I steeled myself for the familiar shock of cold water. Two weeks in, and I was hooked on the Wim Hof method's promise of improved lung capacity and inner body heat control. At first, it was tough - my body rebelled against the chill, but with each passing day, I felt my breathing become more deliberate, more controlled. I started to notice a warmth spreading through my body, even on the most frigid mornings. As a runner, I've always been attuned to my body's rhythms, but this was different. I felt more connected to my inner thermostat, more in tune with my own physiological responses. The cold showers have become a daily ritual, a chance to test my limits and tap into a deeper sense of resilience. I'm excited to see where this newfound control takes me on the trails this season.
