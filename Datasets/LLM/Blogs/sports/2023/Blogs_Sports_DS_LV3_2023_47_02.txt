Standing at 6’4”, you’d think I’d dominate my rec league games. But there’s a specific kind of battle in the post that tests more than just height—it’s a mental game. When a quicker defender fronts me, denying the entry pass, my first instinct isn’t always assertive. My mind races: “What if I can’t seal him? What if the pass gets picked?”

That hesitation is the real opponent. In 2023, with so much noise off the court, finding that sharp mental focus is tougher than any box-out. I’m learning that fronting isn’t just a defensive tactic; it’s a mirror. It shows me where my toughness wavers and pushes me to demand the ball with conviction, not just hope for it. Every game is another shot at building that unshakable confidence, one possession at a time.
