As the game progressed, the Bucks' superior teamwork and chemistry began to pay off. They moved the ball with ease, creating scoring opportunities that left the Pistons' defense scrambling.

Giannis Antetokounmpo, meanwhile, contributed 33 points, 7 rebounds, and 4 assists, cementing his status as one of the league's top players.
