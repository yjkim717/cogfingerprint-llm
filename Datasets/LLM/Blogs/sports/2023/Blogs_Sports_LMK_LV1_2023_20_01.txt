"Marble Mania: A Frustrating Wave Event Experience

As a huge fan of Jelles Marble Runs, I was stoked to dive into the latest wave event in 2023. The thrill of watching those marbles navigate intricate courses never gets old. However, my excitement was short-lived. After each run, I found myself scouring the event thread for the total score - only to come up empty-handed. It was like searching for a needle in a haystack! The absence of a clear total score display after each run was frustrating, to say the least. As someone who's invested in the competitive spirit of marble runs, I crave that instant gratification. I implore the JMR team to consider adding this feature in future events. Until then, I'll be left tallying scores like a math whiz - not exactly the most thrilling experience."
