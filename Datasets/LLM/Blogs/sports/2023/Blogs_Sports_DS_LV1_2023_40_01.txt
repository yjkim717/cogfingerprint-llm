### The Green, the Grit, and a Glimmer of Hope: My 30:58 5K

March 18, 2023

Let’s be honest, my training for this year’s St. Patrick’s Day 5K was less “Rocky Balboa” and more “sporadic squirrel.” Between work deadlines and a stubborn case of the winter blues, my running shoes saw more of the back of the closet than the pavement. My plan was a masterpiece of good intentions, but my reality was a patchwork of missed miles and shortened loops. So, as I pinned on my bib this past Saturday, surrounded by a sea of green-clad runners who looked far more prepared than I felt, my goal was simple: just finish without walking.

The gun went off, and the familiar adrenaline surge carried me through the first mile. I clicked my watch at the marker: 9:45. Not terrible, I thought, but a familiar dread crept in. That’s the pace I always start at, only to fade dramatically in the back half. The second mile of this particular course winds through a gentle but persistent incline, and it’s where my inconsistent training usually rears its ugly head. Sure enough, my breathing became ragged, and my legs started whispering seditious suggestions about taking a quick walk break. The split for mile two was 10:15. The dream of a decent time was slipping away.

But then, something shifted. Maybe it was the guy in the full leprechaun outfit who high-fived me. Maybe it was the sheer stubbornness born of knowing I hadn’t put in the work and refusing to let the day be a total loss. As we turned the final corner, the finish line arch was visible in the distance, a green and white beacon.

I decided to stop negotiating with the pain and just… go.

I kicked. I mean, I really kicked. It wasn’t graceful—my form was probably a disaster—but I poured every ounce of energy I had left into that final half-mile. I stopped looking at my watch and just focused on reeling in the runner in front of me, then the next one. The crowd noise became a blur, and all I could hear was my own pounding heart and the rhythm of my feet on the asphalt.

When I finally stumbled across the line and hit stop on my watch, I had to do a double-take. 30:58. A personal best by over twenty seconds.

I stood there, hands on my knees, gasping and utterly bewildered. I hadn’t earned this time in the weeks leading up to the race. I’d earned it in those last five minutes, with pure grit. It was a powerful reminder that while consistent training builds a foundation, the human spirit can sometimes pull off a miracle finish. That 30:58 isn’t just a time; it’s a promise to myself that there’s always a little more in the tank, waiting to be found. Now, to actually train for the next one
