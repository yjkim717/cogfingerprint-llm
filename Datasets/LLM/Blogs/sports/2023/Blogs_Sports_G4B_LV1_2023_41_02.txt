**The Curious Case of the Consistent Voters**

You know how sometimes you swear you’re remembering something perfectly, only to realize you’ve completely misconstrued it? That’s kind of how I felt watching the AP Polls roll out throughout the 2023 college basketball season. It’s fascinating, and frankly, a little frustrating, how much voter consistency – or lack thereof – seemed to dictate the narrative.

I spent a good chunk of the year tracking who was reliably sticking with their initial rankings, and who was suddenly shifting the landscape. There were the stalwarts, the guys and gals who seemed to have a sixth sense for a team’s potential, dutifully placing them high even when the wins weren’t always there. Then, you’d have Southern Miss – okay, not *really* Southern Miss, but you get my point! – teams getting a bump based on a single impressive performance. 

It made me think about how subjective these rankings are. The AP Poll is a snapshot in time, a reflection of *opinions*, not just results.  Are voters truly assessing a team’s overall strength, or are they reacting to a hot streak? 

It’s a reminder that even with all the data and analytics, there’s always a human element involved. And sometimes, that human element leads to some wonderfully surprising – and occasionally baffling – shifts in the college basketball rankings.
