**The Quiet Power of the TD Leaderboard**

It’s weird, right? How obsessed we get with individual stats in college football. We talk about rushing yards, passing numbers, and, of course, touchdowns. But I was digging through the 2023 CFP stats the other day, specifically looking at career touchdown leaders for quarterbacks, and it struck me – there’s a really compelling story there. 

Guys like Dillon Gabriel and Michael Penix Jr. were dominating, rightfully so. But it wasn’t just about the flashy wins; it was about the consistent, reliable drive for the endzone.  Those quarterbacks, consistently putting the ball in the end, spoke to a different kind of leadership. 

It made me think about the pressure these guys face – the reads they have to make, the timing, the sheer confidence required to launch that pass.  A single touchdown can change a game, but a sustained string of them? That’s a legacy built on grit and precision.  It's a reminder that sometimes, the quietest stats tell the loudest story.

Would you like me to tweak this, perhaps focusing on a specific quarterback or adding a particular angle?
