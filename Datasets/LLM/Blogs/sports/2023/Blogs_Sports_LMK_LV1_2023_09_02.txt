As I watched the 2023 NBA playoffs, I couldn't help but think of my trusty Acer Helios 300 laptop, which has been with me through countless gaming marathons. Just like a star player's injured knee, my laptop's bent screen has me worried. Though it still performs flawlessly, I'm concerned about potential future hardware issues derailing my gaming experience, much like a team's season being ruined by a key player's injury.
