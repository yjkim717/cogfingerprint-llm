What a wild weekend in the Big 12. Just like that, a few championship dreams are officially over. You could feel the collective gasp across the conference as upsets reshuffled the standings. It’s a tough reminder of how quickly a season can pivot. One week you're in the hunt, the next you're just playing for pride. In 2023, the margin for error is truly zero. It’s what makes college sports so brutally beautiful and utterly heartbreaking.
