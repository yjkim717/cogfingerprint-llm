There’s something about watching a game where one player just doesn’t get the same chances as the others, even when they’re putting in the work. It reminds me of Aero in the digital sports world of 2023—a card game where strategy is everything.

I’ve spent hours building my deck, and it’s frustrating to see Aero, with her potential for clever positioning plays, consistently underperform. You look at heavy-hitters like Magneto, who shifts the whole board, or Polaris with her precise control, and it feels unbalanced. Aero has the finesse, the mind-game utility, but her power level is a quiet nerf in a meta that rewards bold moves.

It’s like having a skilled midfielder who never gets the final pass. You believe in her, you see the setups, but the stats just don’t reflect her impact. She deserves a buff, not to be overpowered, but to stand tall among her peers. Because in sports—virtual or real—fair play means every player has a shot at greatness when they bring something special to the game.
