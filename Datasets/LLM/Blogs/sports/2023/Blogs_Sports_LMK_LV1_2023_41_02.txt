As we dive into the 2023 college basketball season, I found myself pondering the AP Poll rankings. What makes some voters tick together, while others seem to be from a different playbook altogether? I decided to dig in and analyze the preseason rankings, sorting voters by their similarity to identify patterns.

The results were fascinating. Some voters emerged as consistently aligned with the majority, while others stood out as outliers. I was surprised to see which voters were most in sync with the overall rankings, and which ones were boldly going their own way. This exercise not only revealed interesting trends in voting behavior but also got me thinking about what makes a "good" voter. Is it about being consistent with the pack, or being brave enough to challenge the status quo? As the season unfolds, I'll be keeping a close eye on these dynamics â€“ and you should too.
