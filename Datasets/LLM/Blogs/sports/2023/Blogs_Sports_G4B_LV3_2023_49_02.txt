**The Year Hollywood Rock Broke the Mold**

It’s funny how a single run can stick with you, right? I was just revisiting some old WWE footage the other day, and it immediately brought Hollywood Rock’s 2002-2003 heel turn back to me. There's something truly fascinating about that era – the “Attitude Era” was wild, but Rock’s shift felt… different. 

He wasn’t just a movie star flexing; he was deliberately *un*likable, embracing a calculated coldness. It felt like a deliberate, almost theatrical experiment. As someone who loves a good character arc, it’s amazing to think about the story simmering beneath the surface of those promos and matches. 

Looking back in 2023, it feels like a pivotal moment, a bold step away from the typical hero narrative. It’s a reminder that even in sports, a little calculated villainy can be incredibly compelling. What’s *your* favorite unexpected heel turn in wrestling history?
