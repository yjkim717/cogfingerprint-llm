## The Comeback Kid Mentality: More Than Just Winning

Man, watching the playoffs this year has been *wild*. It’s not just about the highlight reels, though those are awesome. It’s about those moments when a team looks completely demolished, down by a huge margin, seemingly out of gas. You almost feel bad for them, right? But then… something shifts.

It reminds me a bit of those card games, actually. You build a deck to *destroy* the opponent, to dismantle their strategy. But a clever player anticipates that, builds in a way to *resurrect* their pieces, to keep fighting even when it looks hopeless. Like seeing Hela rise again, or Ghost Rider’s fiery return.

That's the comeback kid mentality. It’s not about avoiding setbacks – it’s about *how* you respond when everything seems lost. It’s about finding that spark, drawing on some hidden reserve of strength. It's a beautiful thing to witness, and honestly, it's a lesson we could all use in our own lives, beyond the roar of the stadium.
