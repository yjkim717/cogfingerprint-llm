It’s 2023, and I’ve been thinking about what really makes a great athlete. Sure, physical skills are key—speed, strength, precision. But what about knowledge? The intelligence to read the game, rank opponents’ strategies, and adapt in real-time. I’ve seen players with less raw talent outshine others because they understood the deeper dynamics, almost like characters in a story, each with unique strengths. It’s a reminder that in sports, as in life, true excellence blends sharp skills with a curious, strategic mind.
