>## The Year of Fonts and Football Fumbles

Okay, so 2023 is wrapping up, and we're all doing those "best of" and "worst of" lists, right? It got me thinking about how much pop culture bleeds into everything. Remember the explosion of the *Barbie* and *Oppenheimer* fonts this year? Seriously cool aesthetics! 

It's a shame ESPN's Todd McShay didn't lean into that for his draft rankings. Can you imagine? "The *Oppenheimer* picks – the ones that could explode in your face!" Or, "The *Barbie* prospects – bright, fun, and potentially iconic!" 

Missed opportunity, Todd. Missed opportunity. But hey, at least the NFL season itself provided plenty of both best and worst moments to analyze.
