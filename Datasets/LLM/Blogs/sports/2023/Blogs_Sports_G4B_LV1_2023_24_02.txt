**The Lag Monster and a Whole Lot of Whackiness**

Okay, let’s be honest – I’ve been battling a nemesis this summer: lag. Specifically, the *lack* of it in my golf swing. I’d watch videos, read articles, and still felt like my shots were just… collapsing. It was incredibly frustrating. 

My strategy? Pure, unadulterated trial and error. Hours spent in the range, hacking away, feeling utterly ridiculous as I tried to create that sweet, delayed weight transfer. There were definitely some epic lag shots – mostly in the general direction of the woods. 

But slowly, *slowly*, things started to click. It wasn’t a sudden revelation, more a gradual understanding through repetition and feeling my way through it.  It’s a reminder that sometimes, the best way to learn is just to keep swinging, even when it feels like you’re failing spectacularly.  Anyone else have a persistent sports struggle?
