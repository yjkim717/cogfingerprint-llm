>## What If? The Ghosts of NBA Past

It's 2023, and we're obsessed with hypotheticals, aren't we? Lately, I've been down a rabbit hole of "what if" scenarios in the NBA. Specifically, what if injuries hadn't derailed some truly iconic teams?

Think about the 2015-16 Warriors, potentially facing a fully healthy LeBron-led Cavs. Or a Milwaukee Bucks squad with a prime Michael Redd battling a Raptors team at their peak. Even imagining a healthy 2017 Warriors crew against a Cavs team with a fully firing Kyrie Irving… it's enough to make a basketball fan’s head spin!

It's more than just fun speculation; it highlights how fragile championship runs are. A single injury can completely alter the course of history. Makes you appreciate the teams that *did* overcome adversity, doesn't it?
