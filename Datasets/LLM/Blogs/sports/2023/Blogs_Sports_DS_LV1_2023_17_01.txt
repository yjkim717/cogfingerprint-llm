Alright, so I finally took down Godrick, but my "warrior" is a complete mess. I started with the classic **twin blade** fantasy, but then I found the **Bloodhound** Fang and fell in love. Now I’m also dabbling in **incantations** because, why not have a little holy fire, right? My stats are all over the place. I’ve heard whispers of a killer **dragon rune farm** over in Caelid, but is grinding levels really the answer to fixing this scattered **build**? I feel powerful in moments, but utterly lost in others. Do I commit to the curved sword, go back to my roots, or just embrace the chaos? Any guidance from you Tarnished veterans would be a huge help.

Remember that 2023 championship game? We were down by ten with two minutes left. The crowd was deafening, a wall of noise. I remember looking at my teammates in the huddle—no panic, just this fierce, quiet determination. We didn’t need a speech. We knew the drill. The next ninety seconds were a blur of perfect execution: a stolen pass, a clutch three-pointer, a defensive stop that felt like it lasted an eternity. We didn’t just win a trophy that night. We learned that trust isn’t built in the final second; it’s forged in every grueling practice leading up to it. That’s the lesson I’m taking with me long after the cheers have faded.
