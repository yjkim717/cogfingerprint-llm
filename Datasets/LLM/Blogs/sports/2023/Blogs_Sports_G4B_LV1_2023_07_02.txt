**The Crucible’s Feeling… Off**

Okay, so I’ve been grinding Crucible lately, and honestly, it feels weird. The matchmaking’s been brutal – I’m getting stomped by seriously skilled players way too often. It’s frustrating when you’re putting in the effort, but the MM just isn’t pairing you with a fair challenge.  I’m hoping Respawn can shed some light on these recent adjustments.  Anyone else feeling this shift?  Let’s talk! #Crucible #ApexLegends #MMProblems
