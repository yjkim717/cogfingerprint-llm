**Lost in the Spreadsheet – Football Manager’s Transfer Obsession**

Okay, confession time: I’ve spent *way* too many evenings staring at spreadsheets in Football Manager 22. It’s a strangely addictive loop – scouting, negotiating, and obsessing over transfer fees. Lately, I’ve been wrestling with a particular frustration: wanting a clear, visual overview of net charges across multiple seasons.
