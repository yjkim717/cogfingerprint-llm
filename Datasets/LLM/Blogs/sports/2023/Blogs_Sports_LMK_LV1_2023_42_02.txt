The 2023 college hockey regionals were a wild ride. While Fargo's Ralph Engelstad Arena sold out, Manchester's crowd was disappointingly low. Meanwhile, Bridgeport and Allentown drew solid numbers. It's clear that some markets still struggle to draw fans, but others are thriving. As a hockey fan, it's great to see passionate crowds in places like Fargo, and one can only hope that momentum builds in other regions.
