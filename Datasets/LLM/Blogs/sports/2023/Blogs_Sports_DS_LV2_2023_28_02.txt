You’d think in 2023, with all our tech, selling a few sports cards would be a breeze. But there I was, staring at my screen, trapped in digital purgatory.

I had this beautiful multi-variation lot—a rainbow of parallels for a single rookie card. The scanner had captured every shimmer, the descriptions were perfect. Then came the final step: "Card Condition." My cursor hovered. These were raw, ungraded gems, each with its own tiny story told in a faint corner softness or a whisper of a print line. The dropdown menu demanded one condition to rule them all. "Near Mint" felt like a lie for the one with the perfect edge, while "Excellent" betrayed the flawless surface of another.

In that moment, the cold logic of the listing form clashed with the warm, imperfect reality of my collection. It was a frustrating reminder that the heart of this hobby will always be in the details a database can't quite capture.
