**The Heat of the Moment (and a Little Bit of Doubt)**

It’s funny, isn’t it? How a single game can completely consume you. This season with the Ravens felt… intense. We were so close, battling for a playoff spot, and every snap, every play, was loaded with weight. I remember one particular loss – a brutal one – and just feeling this wave of frustration, almost shame. 

I wasn't just disappointed in the team; I was questioning my own commitment. Was I really *present* during those games? 

It’s a feeling I’m still processing, honestly. Like building that brick oven – slow, deliberate, and demanding focus. You can’t rush the heat, you know? It’s about finding that balance between passion and perspective.  Maybe that’s the real win, regardless of the scoreboard.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a post on a different topic?
