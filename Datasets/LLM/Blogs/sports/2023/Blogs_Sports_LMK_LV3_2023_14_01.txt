"The Big 12 title race was on in 2023, and it was a wild ride. As Oklahoma and Texas Tech fell by the wayside, it became clear that this season was all about adaptability. Texas and Kansas surged forward, capitalizing on the competition's missteps. It's a reminder that in college basketball, anything can happen. Upsets are the norm, and perseverance is key. As the season unfolded, it was thrilling to see these top teams jockey for position, each game a new test of strength and strategy."
