As we navigate the 2023 NBA season, it's hard not to feel a growing sense of frustration with JP's underwhelming performance. For a team like the Warriors, who are riding high on the success of Steph and Klay, it's a bittersweet reality. While we bask in the glory of their incredible talents, JP's struggles become increasingly glaring. The numbers don't lie – his lackluster offense and meandering defense have become an unfortunate norm.

It's time for some tough love: if JP can't elevate his game, perhaps it's time to consider a trade. The Warriors have a limited window to capitalize on their current roster, and JP's subpar play is a significant hindrance. With Steph and Klay still dominating on the court, the team has a legitimate shot at championship contention. Let's be realistic – if JP can't step up, it's time to bring in someone who can. The Warriors' success depends on it.
