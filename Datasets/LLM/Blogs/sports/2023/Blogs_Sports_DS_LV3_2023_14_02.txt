As a lifelong Big 12 fan, watching Kansas cling to the top spot with just two games left feels surreal. Remember when they were the underdogs? Now, the pressure is immense. Every play, every possession echoes through the standings. And Baylor… their entire title dream boils down to one simple, terrifying task: don't lose. It’s a stark reminder that in sports, as in life, the view from the top is incredible, but the climb to stay there is everything. What a season 2023 has been.
