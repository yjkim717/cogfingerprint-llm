**Subject: Item Not Received - Bundle Dispute [#BSL784]**

Hi [Seller Name],

I’m writing to follow up on the bundle of three trousers I purchased from you last week. The parcel arrived today, but unfortunately, it only contained two of the three items.

I’ve double-checked the packaging, and it seems the third pair is missing. As I only received a partial order, I have initiated a return request for the incomplete bundle through the system.

I understand these things can happen, but I must dispute the current status where the order is marked as "completed." For now, I am awaiting Vinted's official ruling on the matter to hopefully secure a full refund for the bundle, as per their buyer protection policy.

Please let me know if you have any additional information. I hope we can resolve this amicably.

Best,
[Buyer Name]

### The Unseen Finish Line

It’s funny, in 2023 we’re obsessed with stats—personal bests, split times, goals scored. But my most profound sports moment this year had none of that.

It was the final community 5k of the season. I was pacing an older runner, a newcomer named Frank. With half a mile left, his breath grew ragged. "I can't," he wheezed. We slowed to a walk. The crowd cheered for others sprinting past. For a moment, I felt the sting of a lost personal record.

But then Frank started again, a determined shuffle. We crossed the line dead last, to a smattering of applause that meant more than any trophy. The real victory wasn't the time on the clock; it was the grit in his eyes. Sport, I learned, is less about finishing first and more about helping someone else finish at all.
