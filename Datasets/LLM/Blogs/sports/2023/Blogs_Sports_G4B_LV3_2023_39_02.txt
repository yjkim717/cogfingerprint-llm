This summer, I’m craving an escape – a real road trip. I’m picturing myself dwarfed by the Redwoods, breathing in that ancient forest air.  It’s funny, though, I’m also obsessed with finding a local brewery in Eureka or Arcata that still serves Rainier.  There’s something comforting about a familiar taste on a long drive, a little piece of home amidst the vastness.  Maybe a road trip is just what I need to reset and appreciate the simple pleasures, like a cold beer and a stunning view.
