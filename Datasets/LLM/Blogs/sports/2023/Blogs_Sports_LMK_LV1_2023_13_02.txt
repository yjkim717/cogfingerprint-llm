The agony of defeat in Marvel Snap still lingers, especially when facing those pesky destroy decks. I was reminded of the frustration while watching the latest sports highlight reels - a crushing loss can be just as demoralizing on the field as it is in the virtual one. Just as the NFL teams are strategizing to counter their opponents' strong offenses, Marvel Snap players are clamoring for a way to take down destroy decks. It's interesting to note that discard decks have their countermeasures, so why not destroy decks? Perhaps it's time for the developers to introduce some new cards to level the playing field. As we head into the second half of 2023, I, for one, am excited to see how the Marvel Snap meta evolves. Will we see a new wave of counter-strategies emerge? Only time will tell.
