**The Unexpected Grit of a Backyard Season**

2023 felt… different. I’d always been a weekend warrior, a casual player, but this year, I actually committed to a local softball league. It wasn’t about winning, not really. It was about building something, like constructing a really beautiful pizza oven – a slow, brick-by-brick project of perseverance. 

There were moments of pure frustration, like a dropped fly ball or a missed swing. Just like wrestling with a stubborn brick oven, sometimes it felt impossible to get it right. But each practice, each game, taught me a surprising amount about grit. It’s not about being naturally gifted; it’s about showing up, even when you’re tired and covered in dirt. 

Just like carefully laying flagstone for a patio, it’s the consistent effort that creates something solid and rewarding.  And honestly, the camaraderie of the team—that’s the best accessory of all.
