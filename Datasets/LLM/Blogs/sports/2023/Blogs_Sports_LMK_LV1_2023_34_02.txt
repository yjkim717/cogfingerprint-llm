"Gridiron Greats: Quarterbacks Who Shone Bright in CFP Games

As I dove into the stats, I was blown away by the career leaders for touchdowns responsible in College Football Playoff (CFP) games. It's no surprise that some of the biggest names in college football history top the list. Quarterbacks like Stetson Bennett and Joe Burrow have made their mark on the sport, leaving fans in awe with their incredible performances.

Bennett's clutch plays and Burrow's precision passing have cemented their places among the all-time greats. But what sets them apart? Is it their ability to stay calm under pressure or their knack for making plays when it matters most? Whatever the secret, these stats show that they're the real deal. As we look ahead to the 2023 season, it's exciting to think about the new talent that'll be taking the field and potentially etching their own names into the CFP record books."
