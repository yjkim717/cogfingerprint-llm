"Leveling the Playing Field in MarvelSnap: A Call for Balance. As a MarvelSnap enthusiast, I've noticed destroy decks struggling to keep up with the mighty discard decks. To shake things up, the developers could introduce new cards or abilities that give destroy decks a much-needed edge. For instance, a card that amplifies destroy effects or neutralizes discard strategies could be a game-changer. By doing so, they'd not only enhance gameplay variety but also create a more competitive environment, allowing destroy decks to shine. It's time to give these underdogs the tools they need to take on the discard decks and thrive in 2023."
