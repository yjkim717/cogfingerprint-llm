The final flagstone was laid this afternoon, and I can’t help but run a hand over the cool, textured surface. After months of wrestling with our stubborn clay soil—a battle I thought we’d never win—the patio is finally ready.

And sitting proudly in the center is the star of the show: our new pizza oven. It’s more than just an appliance; it’s the heart of our 2023 project, the promise of countless Friday nights with friends and family, the smell of wood smoke and baking dough filling the air.

But now, the fun part begins. I’m diving into the world of pizza peels, infrared thermometers, and specialty flours. If you’ve been on this journey before, what are your must-have accessories? I’d love to hear your recommendations for making our first pizza night a roaring success.
