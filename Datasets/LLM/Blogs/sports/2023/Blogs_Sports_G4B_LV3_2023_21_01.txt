**The Weight of Expectations: Are We Already Rooting for the Champions?**

It’s that time of year again – the preseason polls are dropping, and suddenly everyone’s an expert. I saw a Reddit poll the other day predicting Georgia as number one for 2023 college football, and honestly, it got me thinking. There’s something a little unsettling about these early rankings, isn’t there? 

Michigan and Ohio State right behind them… it feels like we’re already building narratives, anticipating rivalries, and essentially crowning teams before a single snap is even thrown.  I love the excitement of football season, the pure, unadulterated joy of watching a game. But sometimes, this pre-season hype feels a little heavy. 

Maybe it’s just me, but I prefer to let the season unfold, to see how teams truly perform.  What do you think? Are you swept up in the predictions, or do you prefer to keep your opinions to yourself until the dust settles?
