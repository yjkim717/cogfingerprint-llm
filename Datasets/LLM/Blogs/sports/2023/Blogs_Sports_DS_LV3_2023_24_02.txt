There I was, mid-2023, standing on the driving range yet again—a self-taught golfer locked in a frustrating dance with my own swing. I’d watched every video, read every tip, and knew exactly what “lag” was supposed to feel like: that magical delay where the club head trails your hands, storing power for that crisp, satisfying compression at impact.

But knowing and doing are worlds apart. My body resisted, stubbornly throwing the club head early, robbing my shots of that pure, compressed strike. It’s a lonely battle, this self-improvement path—no coach, just trial, error, and the relentless pursuit of a feeling you’ve only imagined. Still, every now and then, a shot connects perfectly. It’s fleeting, but it’s enough to keep me coming back, chasing that elusive sensation of getting it just right, all on my own.
