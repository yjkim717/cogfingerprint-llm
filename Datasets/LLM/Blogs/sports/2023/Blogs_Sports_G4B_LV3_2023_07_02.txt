It hit me like a rogue grenade – that familiar *rusty* feeling after a long break.  Crucible’s calling, but 2023’s holiday chaos left me a little…off.  A teammate mentioned some *mm changes* – a frustratingly vague clue!  I spent the last few matches trying to shake off the post-holiday slump, desperately seeking that smooth flow.  Honestly, it’s a weird experience, this sudden disconnect.  Anyone else feeling the Crucible blues this season?
