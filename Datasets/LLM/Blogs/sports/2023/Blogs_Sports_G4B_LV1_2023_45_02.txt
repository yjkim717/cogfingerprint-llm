**The Embiid Question**

It’s weird, isn’t it? Watching Joel Embiid dominate with the 76ers, but then thinking about how he’s performed in past playoff series with different teams. There’s a really interesting debate brewing – is he a consistently brilliant playoff performer, or does he elevate in certain environments? 

I was reading about his history and it got me thinking about James Johnson, too. He seemed to always find a way to boost those teams he played on.  Maybe it’s not just about individual talent, but about the right supporting cast and the pressure cooker of a playoff series.  What do *you* think fuels a true playoff star?
