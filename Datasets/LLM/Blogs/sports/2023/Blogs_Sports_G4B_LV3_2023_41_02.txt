**The Strange Case of the AP Poll and My Week 17 Predictions**

Let’s be honest, the AP Poll is a fascinating, frustrating, and occasionally baffling thing. This year, as 2023 wound down, I was really digging into how consistently voters were lining up – specifically, looking at Southern Miss’s rise. Dylan Sinn’s sharp analysis of the Week 17 numbers really got me thinking. 

It’s wild to see how much disagreement there is, isn’t it? You’d think after 17 weeks of watching college football, everyone would have a pretty solid grasp on what’s happening. But the AP Poll consistently throws curveballs.  

I found myself noticing the outliers – those voters who stubbornly held onto a ranking despite the obvious shift in momentum. It made me realize that maybe, just maybe, football fandom isn’t always about cold, hard data. Sometimes, it’s about a gut feeling, a connection to a team, and a little bit of stubborn loyalty.  What about you? Did the AP Poll surprise you this season?
