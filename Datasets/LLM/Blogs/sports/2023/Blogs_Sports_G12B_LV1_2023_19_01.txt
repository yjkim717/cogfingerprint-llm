## Are We All Lifting Too Light? A Recent Discovery Got Me Thinking…

So, I've been diving into some fascinating research lately, and it's really shaken up my perspective on training. Apparently, a recent meta-analysis showed something pretty wild: most of us – seasoned lifters and newbies alike – tend to choose weights that are roughly 53% of our 1RM. That's… surprisingly light, right?

It made me think about my own training. I've always been cautious, wanting to avoid injury. But maybe that caution has, unintentionally, been holding me back from truly pushing for hypertrophy. Are we all subconsciously playing it safe?

It’s a bit humbling to realize that even after years in the gym, there's always more to learn. This isn't about drastically changing everything overnight, but it *is* about re-evaluating my rep ranges and maybe, just maybe, adding a little more weight to the bar. Anyone else feeling inspired (or slightly panicked!) by this news? Let's chat in the comments!
