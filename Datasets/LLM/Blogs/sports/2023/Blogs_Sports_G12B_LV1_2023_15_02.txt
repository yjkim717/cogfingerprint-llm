>## The Unexpected Baseball Binge

Something strange happened to me this summer. I’m not a *massive* baseball fan, but a few weeks ago, I caught a Yankees game. It was surprisingly good! So, I watched another. And another. Suddenly, I found myself glued to the TV, following every series, every player stat. 

It was a genuine baseball streak, fueled by late-night games and unexpected upsets. I even started arguing with my roommate about the merits of different pitchers! It felt a bit… obsessive. Has anyone else ever fallen into a random, intense fandom like this? One minute you're mildly interested, the next you’re checking standings before bed. It's wild! Now, I'm wondering if I’ll still care come October.
