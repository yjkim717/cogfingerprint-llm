As I scrolled through the 2023 sports highlights, I couldn't help but think about the design choices behind the "Top 5 Moments" and "Most Disappointing Losses" lists. Inspired by the era-defining style of the Eras Tour, I wished the creators had used contrasting fonts - maybe a sleek, modern font like Oppenheimer for the thrilling wins, and a playful, cursive font like Barbie for the crushing defeats. Alas, they stuck to a uniform font, missing a chance to add an extra layer of storytelling to their lists.
