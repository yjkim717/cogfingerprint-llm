As I watched the 2023 Women's World Cup, I was struck by the power of teamwork. Just like a technical team assessing a candidate's empathy, a soccer team assesses each player's strengths and weaknesses. A great coach knows when to push and when to support. I realized that empathetic leadership isn't just for management positions - it's essential for any team. Just as a soccer team works together towards a common goal, a people manager must understand and support their team members to achieve success. It's a valuable lesson that extends far beyond the pitch.
