## The Frustration of Almost There: Like a Dropped Pass in the Final Seconds

Anyone else ever feel like technology is actively *against* you? Seriously. I was trying to listen to my hype-up playlist – all the classic pump-up tracks – while heading to my local park for a pickup basketball game last Saturday. You know, get that pre-game energy flowing. But it was a disaster. 

Constantly stuttering, skipping, refusing to let me even *rearrange* my playlist. It was like Amazon Music was mirroring my own anxieties about the game! I kept thinking, “Just play the song! Let me add a little Dua Lipa, for crying out loud!” 

It reminded me of those agonizing moments in a close game – the dropped pass, the missed free throw, the last-second shot that clangs off the rim. So close, yet so far. You're putting in the effort, building the anticipation, and then… frustration. Hopefully, they’ll sort out these glitches soon, because my pre-game ritual depends on it.



Hope this hits the mark!
